if you talk to people on the street , though , it 's a very different story .
many still ca n't seem to imagine that things will improve any time soon .
and the main reason for this skepticism is germany 's ailing job market . more than 4.5 million germans are unemployed .
others only have temporary jobs or work for little or no money .
and the result is not only that increasing numbers of people feel like failures or have low self-esteem , but that those lucky enough to be employed are under greater pressure than ever before . " what counts today is how you assert yourself , how you 're able compete on the market , how loud you are , " said anke patt , a journalist who has recently started her own business .
" and sometimes it counts how good you are at fitting in and swimming with the current . " after world war ii , and especially during the 1960s and 1970s , having a job in germany usually meant that you would start working for a certain company in your late teens or 20s , that you climbed up the career ladder step by step , and that you stayed with that same company throughout your working life .
it was a time of growing social and job security .
but all this has changed dramatically and irreversibly . as a result , many germans feel insecure and fear they will be failures in life .
a major german protestant think tank recently invited a group of business people and church leaders to take a deeper look at the problem and discuss the necessity of work ethics in today 's working environment . profession vs. job " we 've realized that we are n't in touch with business people anymore , " said protestant theologian peter mörbel , the conference 's host .
" we do n't know enough about the new working world , about the service society , for example .
the church 's idea of the business world is still strongly influenced by the ideas of industry and agriculture .
we now have to get to know the new branches .
that 's why we get together and talk about topics that are important to both , the business world and the church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aiming for a job - or for a profession ? at the heart of the round-table discussions were two words : beruf , or " profession , " and " job . " " germans understand the term ' job ' simply as an opportunity to earn a living , something you do for a short while , without having any ties and maybe even without having to take any responsibility , " explained manfred kock , former head of the german protestant church .
" in contrast to that , a profession is something that has to do with your talents and interests that you have either through fate , genes , parents or god .
what can i do with these gifts ?
how can i use them to serve a good purpose ? " instead , kock said , most people today just go to work so that they can pay their rent , food and holiday expenses - they have a job , not a profession .
and this is totally understandable , he said : at a time when employees seem little more than statistics or another cost to companies and when hundreds or thousands of people at the same company regularly lose their jobs , people are no longer willing to put their heart and soul into their work .
this creates a lack of commitment and solidarity from both the company and their employees . it 's part of the church 's responsibility to confront and discuss these sore points , according to kock . " i believe the economy needs to be tamed by what we call duty and responsibility , " he said .
" the economy only works well when it 's standing on both legs : when companies make enough money , and when they are , at the same time , committed to the people for whom they are doing the business . "
success is more than money for andreas rohde , a young lawyer and spokesman for wirtschaftsjunioren bonn , the junior chamber of commerce in bonn , this kind of work ethic has a clear and direct impact on the work he does himself . " i see my clients and my employees as human beings and not just as a work force or as someone who will pay me a fee for the work i do , " said rohde " of course , there 's always the dilemma of how to deal with certain financial rules and expectations , which i - as a christian - do n't like .
sometimes i have to just bite the bullet and refuse certain orders . " charity begins at home , he said .
but it should n't end at the door to your office .
so for rohde , there 's a lot more to success than just making a lot of money .
and although much of the business world probably would n't share this point of view , his fellow conference participants agreed with him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the workplace has become ever more stressful a more diverse group of participants , more young people or those in favor of tighter market competition would no doubt have extolled the benefits of flexible employment terms , for example , or the importance of profits and shareholder value above all else .
but the choice of participants was a deliberate one , said conference host mörbel .
changing words into deeds " we chose certain topics to get the dialogue started in the first place , " he said .
" if you want to include too many contrasting viewpoints , you can easily overload such a meeting .
therefore , i tried to be careful when i planned the conference .
but maybe i was too careful . " for mörbel , the conference was a starting point .
several more round-table discussions of this kind will follow in bonn , he said .
and it 's hoped that as the discussions develop , the participants will start being able to turn their words into deeds , wherever they work and whatever they do . " to meet like-minded people merely makes me all the more determined to stay on the same path and to encourage others to support work ethics which imply reliability and a sense of responsibility instead of a craving for power or money , " patt concluded . svenja üing -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?

" we have reiterated our belief and our attachment to the freedom of the press and freedom of expression as part of our fundamental values , " austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik told journalists monday after chairing a meeting with her european union colleagues . " we have equally referred to the religious beliefs that are to be respected in our societies as fundamental values as well , " she added . cartoons portraying the prophet mohammed wearing a time-bomb shaped turban , published in a danish newspaper last september and reprinted in a norwegian magazine in january , have sparked uproar in the muslim world where images of the prophet are considered blasphemous . the row has taken a new dimension over the past days , with danish flags being burnt , products being boycotted and copenhagen starting to take measures to protect its citizens living in muslim countries . plassnik said that the eu " strongly rejects " threats to its citizens and that : " we do hope that this issue can be solved through constructive dialogue between the parties involved " . eu foreign policy chief javier solana insisted that the eu did not want to hurt anybody . " we have condemned any expression or acts that attempt to demonize any religion and that is what we try to convey to the leaders of the arab world -lrb- and -rrb- the islamic world , " he added . muslim boycott of danish products egypt 's powerful opposition muslim brotherhood on monday was the latest group to join a chorus of calls for the boycott of danish and norwegian products . the incident has threatened to deal an unprecedented blow to the muslim and arab world 's usually healthy relations with scandinavian governments , who are major donors in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sorry we do n't sell products made in denmark " reads a sign in a supermarket in saudi arabia retailers in the gulf have already started pulling danish and norwegian products off the shelves and danish manufacturers have voiced their concern should the boycott gain further momentum .

" we see double standards in the european media , which is fearful of being accused of anti-semitism but which invokes freedom of expression for a caricature on islam , " mussa told reporters . most arab governments have vocally condemned the series of 12 cartoons , which show the prophet as a wild-eyed knife-wielding bedouin flanked by two women shrouded in black . attacks against eu offices libya announced sunday it had decided to close its diplomatic representation in copenhagen " in light of the attacks against the prophet mohammed and the silence of the danish authorities .

at another gaza demonstration , protestors burned the danish flag . denmark wo n't apologize the danish government has said the views expressed by the jyllands-posten newspaper did not reflect its own but has consistently refused to apologize and has insisted it would defend freedom of expression . an official from a danish dairy products company said two of its salespersons were molested in saudi arabia , in the holy muslim city of mecca . the danish government " vigorously condemns these attacks as well as the fact that danish flags have been burnt in the arab world and expects the governments of these countries to do the same , " danish foreign minister per stig moeller said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palestinian child steps on a danish national flag , as a sign of disrespect in an internet statement whose authenticity could not be verified , an iraqi insurgent group - the army of mujahedeen -lrb- holy warriors -rrb- - called on its members to attack any reachable danish and norwegian targets . the danish foreign ministry issued a warning to its nationals in seven arab countries to be extra vigilant , while the danish branch of the red cross said it had evacuated two of its aid workers in gaza and one in yemen . the cartoons have triggered one of scandinavia 's most serious diplomatic incidents in recent years but a poll published over the weekend showed that most danes felt their government should not apologize over the cartoons . arab newspapers have frequently been criticized for carrying anti-semitic opinions and cartoons . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel warns palestinians over hamas german chancellor angela merkel on monday warned that berlin would cut funding to a hamas-led palestinian authority unless the radical islamist group renounced violence .

meanwhile angela merkel called iran " a threat " to democracy on sunday . iran 's foreign ministry insisted on sunday that the only solution to the standoff with the west over its nuclear program is through negotiations and not a referral to the united nations security council .
tehran threatened to halt " all voluntary cooperation " with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- if the west decides to pass the case on to the un . tehran , which decided to resume uranium enrichment research despite international objection , has defended its nuclear activity saying it only wants to make fuel for civil atomic power .
the west fears the project masks a secret nuclear weapons program . " all our friends in europe and the iaea board know the islamic republic 's position : referring the case to or informing the un security council will lead to iran stopping all voluntary cooperation , " foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told a news conference . the west , however , is sticking to its hard line that a draft composed by britain , france and germany at an emergency meeting in london on monday includes the suggestion to ask the iaea to refer the matter to the security council .
although the eu trio has spent two and a half years negotiating with tehran over its atomic program , they say time is running out and are seriously considering putting the issue up for a vote on economic sanctions . merkel gets tough and calls iran a threat to democratic world in germany , where politicians have been cautious on the issue , the rhetoric became audibly more stringent over the weekend with chancellor angela merkel taking the hardest line yet in her words on the issue . merkel said at the start of her first visit to israel on sunday that iran threatens not only the jewish state but the entire democratic world .
" iran is not just a threat to israel , but also to the democratic countries of this world . " adding that both germany and israel shared the same view on iran 's ambitions , merkel said : " i do n't see the slightest difference in the views of germany and israel .
it is clear that iran should not get the ability to enrich uranium . " merkel also condemned iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad for his anti-israeli remarks .
ahmadinejad has said the jewish state should be " wiped off the map " and doubted that six million jews had been killed by the nazis during world war ii .
" it 's unacceptable that iran 's president rejects and falsifies history , " she said . acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert thanked merkel for supporting israel on the question of iran 's nuclear program .
" i would ... like to thank you for your position on iran .
it is a topic that causes great concern here in israel , " he said . a case for sanctions ? earlier at the weekend , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier suggested a tougher german line by saying it would be unwise to rule out economic sanctions . in an interview with the german weekly magazine der spiegel , the minister said " the latest signals from tehran are contradictory at best . "
he added : " i 'm aware of the criticisms that iran is using tricks and playing for time – and i ca n't seriously deny them . " german defense minister franz josef jung also left open the possibility of sanctions .
speaking to the frankfurter allgemeinen sonntagszeitung , he said if russia and china went along with the strategy , economic sanctions could be effective in convincing iran to give up its " obvious intentions of developing atomic weapons . " iran calls for diplomacy in a last-ditch effort to avoid a un referral and sanctions , iran called for talks with britain , france and germany in brussels on monday .
javad vaeedi , deputy head of iran 's supreme national security council , will meet diplomats from the eu-3 . " europeans should be patient and try to find a formula to resolve this nuclear issue , " said foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi .
" we are determined to remove any ambiguities over our nuclear ambitions and also protect our right . " in the past iran has repeatedly said it would never abandon its drive to enrich uranium – a necessary step for developing nuclear power reactors and , when highly enriched , nuclear bombs . the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors will hear arguments on feb .

" the document came about because of " a series of worrying events -lrb- that -rrb- has recently taken place in a number of member states , " such as bans on gay pride marches , hate speeches by political and religious leaders , breaking up of demonstrations by police , homophobic violence and constitutional amendments prohibiting same-sex unions . catholic leaders immediately criticized the resolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church opposes violence against gays but does not support gay unions " the declaration shows an aversion for certain values of our tradition , notably religious values , " aldo giordano , the secretary-general of the council of european bishops ' conferences , told vatican radio .
" such resolutions risk delegitimizing the european parliament .
it should be clear that certain subjects , especially those relating to the family , are not within the direct competence of the european union but are the recognized competence of nations . " that argument was echoed by those opposing the resolution in parliament . " i think that this is a case of europe getting involved in things that are none of europe 's business , " said angelika niebler , one of 27 conservative german members of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- who voted against the declaration . an essential reaction to homophobia ? while an eu directive requires member states to protect gay people against discrimination regarding employment , national laws vary widely in other areas .
while a range of countries , including belgium , britain , denmark , france , germany and spain , have legalized gay civil unions , others are far from doing so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia is not the most gay-friendly place in europe in latvia , for example , the eu anti-discrimination directive has not been implemented and a constitutional amendment defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman . " the situation is a bleak one , " said ilze brands kehris , the director of the latvian center for human rights and ethnic studies .
" it 's absolutely essential that we have these kinds of reactions internationally . " she added that her country 's young democracy still had a lot to learn . " the soviet period blocked any kind of development on tolerance issues , " she said .
" you have to activate civil society in coalition with the international signals to bring change over time in latvia . " will actions follow ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and pope benedict xvi have similar views on gay marriage in poland , where president lech kaczynski barred gay pride marches during his tenure as mayor of warsaw and prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz called for state protection against homosexual " contamination " of society , gay rights activists also said they had high hopes for the resolution . " when you hear from the prime minister that homosexuality is abnormal , that we should be cured , that they will try to cure us by force , this is quite frightening , " said robert biedron , the head of warsaw-based campaign against homophobia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel mention gay rights next time she meets marcinkiewicz ?
" i think that this resolution is very important for new european member states as a reminder on which way the new democracies should go , " he added . but while welcoming the resolution , german gay rights activist jörg litwinschuh said it 's only worth something if actions follow . " if nothing changes , sanctions have to happen , " he said , adding that his initiative queer nations would also lobby chancellor angela merkel to address discrimination against gay people in her meetings with foreign leaders . recognizing the nazis ' gay victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will resemble the one fore jewish holocaust victims litwinschuh is the executive director of a consortium of german scientists and celebrities that plans to reopen the magnus hirschfeld institute , the first center to study homosexuality , which was destroyed by the nazis in 1933 . he said that he was particularly pleased that the resolution also called on " member states concerned finally to accord full recognition to homosexuals as targets and victims of the nazi regime . " a big step in that direction was already taken last week , when berlin announced plans to build a national memorial for homosexuals persecuted by the nazis . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to build memorial to gays persecuted by nazis the berlin government has given the go-ahead for a memorial designed by a scandinavian artist-duo in central berlin commemorating thousands of homosexuals persecuted by nazi germany .

but chancellor angela merkel may have gone a bit too far during her visit to jerusalem , according to dw 's peter philipp . ahead of her middle east visit , the chancellor already showed that she knows how to act on the diplomatic stage and that she 's not intimidated by difficult situations .
in jerusalem , she confirmed this impression again , although the timing for merkel 's visit was awkward : israeli prime minister sharon is still in a coma ; the election campaign has started ; the radical islamic hamas has been elected in the palestinian territories ; and the dispute over iran 's nuclear ambitions is smoldering in the background . that 's reason enough to delay a courtesy call .
but a german head of government 's debut visit in israel is part of the ritual between the two countries .
and after it was already delayed once because of sharon 's illness and foreign minister steinmeier 's cancellation of his visit due to a german intelligence service scandal , it was important that angela merkel went there .
what was more important was what she - as the first foreign politician to visit since the palestinian election - had to say about the vote : hamas must recognize israel 's right to exist , renounce violence and accept the peace process .
otherwise , foreign - especially european - support would be unthinkable .
the message does n't only stem from germany 's special relationship to israel , but also from foreign countries ' genuine concern about continuation of the peace process .
back in time ?
hamas ' election victory threatens to turn back the wheels of history , and aid to the palestinians could - as it was before the oslo accords - be construed once again as supporting the fight against israel .
the europeans wo n't allow that .
who could be more apt than than angela merkel to say that , as germany contributes the biggest chunk of the eu 's 500 million euros -lrb- $ 609 million -rrb- in aid to the palestinians ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president has provoked outrage in west with his comments but in another respect , the chancellor may have gone a bit too far in her solidarity with israel .
however , the europeans ' lack of a concept in dealing with the question of iran 's nuclear policy may be to blame .
although the europeans fluctuate between criticism , threat and coaxing , merkel said that iran was a " threat to the democratic countries of this earth . "
she surely reflected israeli beliefs , but her comments missed the mark .
criticism is certainly warranted of iranian president ahmadinejad 's diatribes against israel as well as his unspeakable remarks about the holocaust .
and to a certain degree , distrust towards tehran 's real nuclear plans may be warranted .
however , iran is not a danger to democracy worldwide . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel warns palestinians over hamas angela merkel has used the second day of her middle east tour to call on leaders from both sides of the israeli-palestinian conflict to continue along the difficult path to peace .

meanwhile angela merkel called iran " a threat " to democracy on sunday . iran 's foreign ministry insisted on sunday that the only solution to the standoff with the west over its nuclear program is through negotiations and not a referral to the united nations security council .
tehran threatened to halt " all voluntary cooperation " with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- if the west decides to pass the case on to the un . tehran , which decided to resume uranium enrichment research despite international objection , has defended its nuclear activity saying it only wants to make fuel for civil atomic power .
the west fears the project masks a secret nuclear weapons program . " all our friends in europe and the iaea board know the islamic republic 's position : referring the case to or informing the un security council will lead to iran stopping all voluntary cooperation , " foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told a news conference . the west , however , is sticking to its hard line that a draft composed by britain , france and germany at an emergency meeting in london on monday includes the suggestion to ask the iaea to refer the matter to the security council .
although the eu trio has spent two and a half years negotiating with tehran over its atomic program , they say time is running out and are seriously considering putting the issue up for a vote on economic sanctions . merkel gets tough and calls iran a threat to democratic world in germany , where politicians have been cautious on the issue , the rhetoric became audibly more stringent over the weekend with chancellor angela merkel taking the hardest line yet in her words on the issue . merkel said at the start of her first visit to israel on sunday that iran threatens not only the jewish state but the entire democratic world .
" iran is not just a threat to israel , but also to the democratic countries of this world . " adding that both germany and israel shared the same view on iran 's ambitions , merkel said : " i do n't see the slightest difference in the views of germany and israel .
it is clear that iran should not get the ability to enrich uranium . " merkel also condemned iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad for his anti-israeli remarks .
ahmadinejad has said the jewish state should be " wiped off the map " and doubted that six million jews had been killed by the nazis during world war ii .
" it 's unacceptable that iran 's president rejects and falsifies history , " she said . acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert thanked merkel for supporting israel on the question of iran 's nuclear program .
" i would ... like to thank you for your position on iran .
it is a topic that causes great concern here in israel , " he said . a case for sanctions ? earlier at the weekend , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier suggested a tougher german line by saying it would be unwise to rule out economic sanctions . in an interview with the german weekly magazine der spiegel , the minister said " the latest signals from tehran are contradictory at best . "
he added : " i 'm aware of the criticisms that iran is using tricks and playing for time – and i ca n't seriously deny them . " german defense minister franz josef jung also left open the possibility of sanctions .
speaking to the frankfurter allgemeinen sonntagszeitung , he said if russia and china went along with the strategy , economic sanctions could be effective in convincing iran to give up its " obvious intentions of developing atomic weapons . " iran calls for diplomacy in a last-ditch effort to avoid a un referral and sanctions , iran called for talks with britain , france and germany in brussels on monday .
javad vaeedi , deputy head of iran 's supreme national security council , will meet diplomats from the eu-3 . " europeans should be patient and try to find a formula to resolve this nuclear issue , " said foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi .
" we are determined to remove any ambiguities over our nuclear ambitions and also protect our right . " in the past iran has repeatedly said it would never abandon its drive to enrich uranium – a necessary step for developing nuclear power reactors and , when highly enriched , nuclear bombs . the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors will hear arguments on feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.01.2006 the ethics of success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers and the unemployed should be made to feel like more than just cattle business people and church leaders met in bonn to discuss work ethics in today 's achievement-oriented society at a time when increasing numbers of germans feel like failures or have low esteem because they 're unemployed . the german economy has been struggling through several tough years now , but experts are now starting to talk about a light at the end of the tunnel .
if you talk to people on the street , though , it 's a very different story .
many still ca n't seem to imagine that things will improve any time soon .
and the main reason for this skepticism is germany 's ailing job market . more than 4.5 million germans are unemployed .
others only have temporary jobs or work for little or no money .
and the result is not only that increasing numbers of people feel like failures or have low self-esteem , but that those lucky enough to be employed are under greater pressure than ever before . " what counts today is how you assert yourself , how you 're able compete on the market , how loud you are , " said anke patt , a journalist who has recently started her own business .
" and sometimes it counts how good you are at fitting in and swimming with the current . " after world war ii , and especially during the 1960s and 1970s , having a job in germany usually meant that you would start working for a certain company in your late teens or 20s , that you climbed up the career ladder step by step , and that you stayed with that same company throughout your working life .
it was a time of growing social and job security .
but all this has changed dramatically and irreversibly . as a result , many germans feel insecure and fear they will be failures in life .
a major german protestant think tank recently invited a group of business people and church leaders to take a deeper look at the problem and discuss the necessity of work ethics in today 's working environment . profession vs. job " we 've realized that we are n't in touch with business people anymore , " said protestant theologian peter mörbel , the conference 's host .
" we do n't know enough about the new working world , about the service society , for example .
the church 's idea of the business world is still strongly influenced by the ideas of industry and agriculture .
we now have to get to know the new branches .
that 's why we get together and talk about topics that are important to both , the business world and the church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aiming for a job - or for a profession ? at the heart of the round-table discussions were two words : beruf , or " profession , " and " job . " " germans understand the term ' job ' simply as an opportunity to earn a living , something you do for a short while , without having any ties and maybe even without having to take any responsibility , " explained manfred kock , former head of the german protestant church .
" in contrast to that , a profession is something that has to do with your talents and interests that you have either through fate , genes , parents or god .
what can i do with these gifts ?
how can i use them to serve a good purpose ? " instead , kock said , most people today just go to work so that they can pay their rent , food and holiday expenses - they have a job , not a profession .
and this is totally understandable , he said : at a time when employees seem little more than statistics or another cost to companies and when hundreds or thousands of people at the same company regularly lose their jobs , people are no longer willing to put their heart and soul into their work .
this creates a lack of commitment and solidarity from both the company and their employees . it 's part of the church 's responsibility to confront and discuss these sore points , according to kock . " i believe the economy needs to be tamed by what we call duty and responsibility , " he said .
" the economy only works well when it 's standing on both legs : when companies make enough money , and when they are , at the same time , committed to the people for whom they are doing the business . "
success is more than money for andreas rohde , a young lawyer and spokesman for wirtschaftsjunioren bonn , the junior chamber of commerce in bonn , this kind of work ethic has a clear and direct impact on the work he does himself . " i see my clients and my employees as human beings and not just as a work force or as someone who will pay me a fee for the work i do , " said rohde " of course , there 's always the dilemma of how to deal with certain financial rules and expectations , which i - as a christian - do n't like .
sometimes i have to just bite the bullet and refuse certain orders . " charity begins at home , he said .
but it should n't end at the door to your office .
so for rohde , there 's a lot more to success than just making a lot of money .
and although much of the business world probably would n't share this point of view , his fellow conference participants agreed with him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the workplace has become ever more stressful a more diverse group of participants , more young people or those in favor of tighter market competition would no doubt have extolled the benefits of flexible employment terms , for example , or the importance of profits and shareholder value above all else .
but the choice of participants was a deliberate one , said conference host mörbel .
changing words into deeds " we chose certain topics to get the dialogue started in the first place , " he said .
" if you want to include too many contrasting viewpoints , you can easily overload such a meeting .
therefore , i tried to be careful when i planned the conference .
but maybe i was too careful . " for mörbel , the conference was a starting point .
several more round-table discussions of this kind will follow in bonn , he said .
and it 's hoped that as the discussions develop , the participants will start being able to turn their words into deeds , wherever they work and whatever they do . " to meet like-minded people merely makes me all the more determined to stay on the same path and to encourage others to support work ethics which imply reliability and a sense of responsibility instead of a craving for power or money , " patt concluded . svenja üing -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?

that 's why we get together and talk about topics that are important to both , the business world and the church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aiming for a job - or for a profession ? at the heart of the round-table discussions were two words : beruf , or " profession , " and " job . " " germans understand the term ' job ' simply as an opportunity to earn a living , something you do for a short while , without having any ties and maybe even without having to take any responsibility , " explained manfred kock , former head of the german protestant church .
" in contrast to that , a profession is something that has to do with your talents and interests that you have either through fate , genes , parents or god .
what can i do with these gifts ?
how can i use them to serve a good purpose ? " instead , kock said , most people today just go to work so that they can pay their rent , food and holiday expenses - they have a job , not a profession .
and this is totally understandable , he said : at a time when employees seem little more than statistics or another cost to companies and when hundreds or thousands of people at the same company regularly lose their jobs , people are no longer willing to put their heart and soul into their work .
this creates a lack of commitment and solidarity from both the company and their employees . it 's part of the church 's responsibility to confront and discuss these sore points , according to kock . " i believe the economy needs to be tamed by what we call duty and responsibility , " he said .
" the economy only works well when it 's standing on both legs : when companies make enough money , and when they are , at the same time , committed to the people for whom they are doing the business . "
success is more than money for andreas rohde , a young lawyer and spokesman for wirtschaftsjunioren bonn , the junior chamber of commerce in bonn , this kind of work ethic has a clear and direct impact on the work he does himself . " i see my clients and my employees as human beings and not just as a work force or as someone who will pay me a fee for the work i do , " said rohde " of course , there 's always the dilemma of how to deal with certain financial rules and expectations , which i - as a christian - do n't like .
sometimes i have to just bite the bullet and refuse certain orders . " charity begins at home , he said .
but it should n't end at the door to your office .
so for rohde , there 's a lot more to success than just making a lot of money .
and although much of the business world probably would n't share this point of view , his fellow conference participants agreed with him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the workplace has become ever more stressful a more diverse group of participants , more young people or those in favor of tighter market competition would no doubt have extolled the benefits of flexible employment terms , for example , or the importance of profits and shareholder value above all else .

" if you want to include too many contrasting viewpoints , you can easily overload such a meeting .
therefore , i tried to be careful when i planned the conference .

several more round-table discussions of this kind will follow in bonn , he said .
and it 's hoped that as the discussions develop , the participants will start being able to turn their words into deeds , wherever they work and whatever they do .

if you talk to people on the street , though , it 's a very different story .
many still ca n't seem to imagine that things will improve any time soon .
and the main reason for this skepticism is germany 's ailing job market . more than 4.5 million germans are unemployed .
others only have temporary jobs or work for little or no money .
and the result is not only that increasing numbers of people feel like failures or have low self-esteem , but that those lucky enough to be employed are under greater pressure than ever before . " what counts today is how you assert yourself , how you 're able compete on the market , how loud you are , " said anke patt , a journalist who has recently started her own business .
" and sometimes it counts how good you are at fitting in and swimming with the current . " after world war ii , and especially during the 1960s and 1970s , having a job in germany usually meant that you would start working for a certain company in your late teens or 20s , that you climbed up the career ladder step by step , and that you stayed with that same company throughout your working life .
it was a time of growing social and job security .
but all this has changed dramatically and irreversibly . as a result , many germans feel insecure and fear they will be failures in life .
a major german protestant think tank recently invited a group of business people and church leaders to take a deeper look at the problem and discuss the necessity of work ethics in today 's working environment . profession vs. job " we 've realized that we are n't in touch with business people anymore , " said protestant theologian peter mörbel , the conference 's host .
" we do n't know enough about the new working world , about the service society , for example .
the church 's idea of the business world is still strongly influenced by the ideas of industry and agriculture .
we now have to get to know the new branches .
that 's why we get together and talk about topics that are important to both , the business world and the church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aiming for a job - or for a profession ? at the heart of the round-table discussions were two words : beruf , or " profession , " and " job . " " germans understand the term ' job ' simply as an opportunity to earn a living , something you do for a short while , without having any ties and maybe even without having to take any responsibility , " explained manfred kock , former head of the german protestant church .
" in contrast to that , a profession is something that has to do with your talents and interests that you have either through fate , genes , parents or god .
what can i do with these gifts ?
how can i use them to serve a good purpose ? " instead , kock said , most people today just go to work so that they can pay their rent , food and holiday expenses - they have a job , not a profession .
and this is totally understandable , he said : at a time when employees seem little more than statistics or another cost to companies and when hundreds or thousands of people at the same company regularly lose their jobs , people are no longer willing to put their heart and soul into their work .

" the document came about because of " a series of worrying events -lrb- that -rrb- has recently taken place in a number of member states , " such as bans on gay pride marches , hate speeches by political and religious leaders , breaking up of demonstrations by police , homophobic violence and constitutional amendments prohibiting same-sex unions . catholic leaders immediately criticized the resolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church opposes violence against gays but does not support gay unions " the declaration shows an aversion for certain values of our tradition , notably religious values , " aldo giordano , the secretary-general of the council of european bishops ' conferences , told vatican radio .
" such resolutions risk delegitimizing the european parliament .
it should be clear that certain subjects , especially those relating to the family , are not within the direct competence of the european union but are the recognized competence of nations . " that argument was echoed by those opposing the resolution in parliament . " i think that this is a case of europe getting involved in things that are none of europe 's business , " said angelika niebler , one of 27 conservative german members of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- who voted against the declaration . an essential reaction to homophobia ? while an eu directive requires member states to protect gay people against discrimination regarding employment , national laws vary widely in other areas .
while a range of countries , including belgium , britain , denmark , france , germany and spain , have legalized gay civil unions , others are far from doing so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia is not the most gay-friendly place in europe in latvia , for example , the eu anti-discrimination directive has not been implemented and a constitutional amendment defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman . " the situation is a bleak one , " said ilze brands kehris , the director of the latvian center for human rights and ethnic studies .
" it 's absolutely essential that we have these kinds of reactions internationally . " she added that her country 's young democracy still had a lot to learn . " the soviet period blocked any kind of development on tolerance issues , " she said .
" you have to activate civil society in coalition with the international signals to bring change over time in latvia . " will actions follow ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and pope benedict xvi have similar views on gay marriage in poland , where president lech kaczynski barred gay pride marches during his tenure as mayor of warsaw and prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz called for state protection against homosexual " contamination " of society , gay rights activists also said they had high hopes for the resolution . " when you hear from the prime minister that homosexuality is abnormal , that we should be cured , that they will try to cure us by force , this is quite frightening , " said robert biedron , the head of warsaw-based campaign against homophobia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel mention gay rights next time she meets marcinkiewicz ?
" i think that this resolution is very important for new european member states as a reminder on which way the new democracies should go , " he added . but while welcoming the resolution , german gay rights activist jörg litwinschuh said it 's only worth something if actions follow . " if nothing changes , sanctions have to happen , " he said , adding that his initiative queer nations would also lobby chancellor angela merkel to address discrimination against gay people in her meetings with foreign leaders . recognizing the nazis ' gay victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will resemble the one fore jewish holocaust victims litwinschuh is the executive director of a consortium of german scientists and celebrities that plans to reopen the magnus hirschfeld institute , the first center to study homosexuality , which was destroyed by the nazis in 1933 . he said that he was particularly pleased that the resolution also called on " member states concerned finally to accord full recognition to homosexuals as targets and victims of the nazi regime .

" we have reiterated our belief and our attachment to the freedom of the press and freedom of expression as part of our fundamental values , " austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik told journalists monday after chairing a meeting with her european union colleagues . " we have equally referred to the religious beliefs that are to be respected in our societies as fundamental values as well , " she added . cartoons portraying the prophet mohammed wearing a time-bomb shaped turban , published in a danish newspaper last september and reprinted in a norwegian magazine in january , have sparked uproar in the muslim world where images of the prophet are considered blasphemous . the row has taken a new dimension over the past days , with danish flags being burnt , products being boycotted and copenhagen starting to take measures to protect its citizens living in muslim countries . plassnik said that the eu " strongly rejects " threats to its citizens and that : " we do hope that this issue can be solved through constructive dialogue between the parties involved " . eu foreign policy chief javier solana insisted that the eu did not want to hurt anybody . " we have condemned any expression or acts that attempt to demonize any religion and that is what we try to convey to the leaders of the arab world -lrb- and -rrb- the islamic world , " he added . muslim boycott of danish products egypt 's powerful opposition muslim brotherhood on monday was the latest group to join a chorus of calls for the boycott of danish and norwegian products . the incident has threatened to deal an unprecedented blow to the muslim and arab world 's usually healthy relations with scandinavian governments , who are major donors in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sorry we do n't sell products made in denmark " reads a sign in a supermarket in saudi arabia retailers in the gulf have already started pulling danish and norwegian products off the shelves and danish manufacturers have voiced their concern should the boycott gain further momentum . " double standards " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson warned a saudi official during a meeting in the swiss ski resort of davos that any boycott of danish products was tantamount to a boycott of european goods . mandelson 's spokesman warned riyadh it could have to take the matter to the world trade organisation if the saudi government encouraged the boycott . arab league secretary general amr mussa , in tunis for a meeting of arab interior ministers , decried the " double standards " in the european media .

9 to feb .
19 , did n't have a formal motto , but was more serious in its focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosslick says this year 's berlinale will be more serious in tone and content " i know sex , football and politics was big last time , " kosslick said .
" but this time , if there is a trend , then it 's definitely political .
all around the world , there 's a very strong tendency of political cinema , one that 's close to reality and shows a tough world , and i 'm glad that the berlinale is taking part in it . " the political theme runs through almost all sections of the berlinale this time .
" syriana , " a political thriller starring george clooney is being screened out of competition .
" bye bye berlusconi ! " a satire by jan henrik stahlberg will feature in the panorama section and british michael winterbottom 's " the road to guantanamo " about three muslims held up at the us lockup in cuba will show in the competition section . asked whether the latter was a comment on the iraq war and us policies , kosslick said it was rather " a statement for human rights . " if i had my way , then i 'd meet the 450 guantanamo inmates , who are being held there in violation of every human right and are tortured , on the red carpet during the screening of the film , " kosslick added .
" but unfortunately i ca n't . " bigger tha n ever in addition to promising some seriously thought-provoking fare , this year 's berlinale , which is the first of europe 's three major festivals in the new year , has gotten even bigger , reflecting its surging popularity amid germany 's economic stagnation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlinale offers a mind-boggling array of events and shows kosslick and his staff went through a record 4,000 films submitted to pick the 400 for the main competition and various sidebar events . a total number of 26 films are in the competition section , 19 of them will compete for the golden and silver bears and 17 films are world premieres . a record number of 18,000 film buyers , sellers , producers , directors and actors as well as journalists from around the world will also be thronging the screenings and press conferences around the glitzy potsdamer platz in downtown berlin . reconfirming the festival 's reputation as a launching pad for hollywood and european films at the start of the year , beki probst , head of the festival 's european film market , where buyers and sellers from around the world gather , said the section had won lots of new customers from the us , asia as well as within europe .
the film market has shown a 45 percent increase this year with 254 companies attending . " it 's definitely established berlin as an important place , " probst said .
" now the feeling is ' berlin is a must ' . " four germa n e n tries kosslick , who is in his fifth year as berlinale director and is credited with boosting german film , has stayed true to his reputation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book cover of michel houellebecq 's " elementary particles " this time , germany is entering the competition with four films : oskar röhler 's " elementary particles , " an on-screen adaptation of french literary bad boy michael houellebecq 's tale of a sexually-obsessed person , matthias glasner 's " free will , " a story of a compulsive rapist , valeska grisebach 's " longing , " a picture about a love triangle set in the former communist east and a film about exorcism in 1970s west germany by hans-christian schmid , called " requiem . " " the four are absolutely justified .
they 're very different , " kosslick said , adding tongue-in-cheek : " if you do n't want to laugh to death , then you should go and see the german films . " star power true to its form , the berlinale this year will also draw in the stars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " my good friend george clooney , " is how kosslick describes the hollywood star berlin favorite george clooney , isabella rossellini , meryl streep , vin diesel , roberto benigni und claude chabrol among others will add some glamour to the berlin winter .
the international jury will be headed by english actress charlotte rampling and will include veteran german actor armin müller-stahl . " snow cake , " a british-canadian co-production starring sigourney weaver as an autistic woman , opens the festival .

meanwhile angela merkel called iran " a threat " to democracy on sunday . iran 's foreign ministry insisted on sunday that the only solution to the standoff with the west over its nuclear program is through negotiations and not a referral to the united nations security council .
tehran threatened to halt " all voluntary cooperation " with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- if the west decides to pass the case on to the un . tehran , which decided to resume uranium enrichment research despite international objection , has defended its nuclear activity saying it only wants to make fuel for civil atomic power .
the west fears the project masks a secret nuclear weapons program . " all our friends in europe and the iaea board know the islamic republic 's position : referring the case to or informing the un security council will lead to iran stopping all voluntary cooperation , " foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told a news conference . the west , however , is sticking to its hard line that a draft composed by britain , france and germany at an emergency meeting in london on monday includes the suggestion to ask the iaea to refer the matter to the security council .
although the eu trio has spent two and a half years negotiating with tehran over its atomic program , they say time is running out and are seriously considering putting the issue up for a vote on economic sanctions . merkel gets tough and calls iran a threat to democratic world in germany , where politicians have been cautious on the issue , the rhetoric became audibly more stringent over the weekend with chancellor angela merkel taking the hardest line yet in her words on the issue . merkel said at the start of her first visit to israel on sunday that iran threatens not only the jewish state but the entire democratic world .
" iran is not just a threat to israel , but also to the democratic countries of this world . " adding that both germany and israel shared the same view on iran 's ambitions , merkel said : " i do n't see the slightest difference in the views of germany and israel .
it is clear that iran should not get the ability to enrich uranium . " merkel also condemned iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad for his anti-israeli remarks .
ahmadinejad has said the jewish state should be " wiped off the map " and doubted that six million jews had been killed by the nazis during world war ii .
" it 's unacceptable that iran 's president rejects and falsifies history , " she said . acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert thanked merkel for supporting israel on the question of iran 's nuclear program .
" i would ... like to thank you for your position on iran .
it is a topic that causes great concern here in israel , " he said . a case for sanctions ? earlier at the weekend , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier suggested a tougher german line by saying it would be unwise to rule out economic sanctions . in an interview with the german weekly magazine der spiegel , the minister said " the latest signals from tehran are contradictory at best . "
he added : " i 'm aware of the criticisms that iran is using tricks and playing for time – and i ca n't seriously deny them . " german defense minister franz josef jung also left open the possibility of sanctions .
speaking to the frankfurter allgemeinen sonntagszeitung , he said if russia and china went along with the strategy , economic sanctions could be effective in convincing iran to give up its " obvious intentions of developing atomic weapons . " iran calls for diplomacy in a last-ditch effort to avoid a un referral and sanctions , iran called for talks with britain , france and germany in brussels on monday .
javad vaeedi , deputy head of iran 's supreme national security council , will meet diplomats from the eu-3 . " europeans should be patient and try to find a formula to resolve this nuclear issue , " said foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi .
" we are determined to remove any ambiguities over our nuclear ambitions and also protect our right . " in the past iran has repeatedly said it would never abandon its drive to enrich uranium – a necessary step for developing nuclear power reactors and , when highly enriched , nuclear bombs . the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors will hear arguments on feb .
2 from the eu-3 and the united states as well as from russia and china who fear an escalation of the crisis and un economic sanctions against iran . dw staff -lrb- ktz / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clock ticks in iran nuclear standoff unless iran changes its stance on nuclear enrichment , it has little chance of avoiding a un security council referral , said british foreign secretary straw ahead of talks aimed to get iran to cooperate .
-lrb- jan .
28 , 2006 -rrb- in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia as diplomatic efforts to curb iran 's nuclear ambitions near the un , the european powers are working to ensure tehran 's compliance .
to do that , say experts , they will need russia , and the threat of military action .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.01.2006 the ethics of success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers and the unemployed should be made to feel like more than just cattle business people and church leaders met in bonn to discuss work ethics in today 's achievement-oriented society at a time when increasing numbers of germans feel like failures or have low esteem because they 're unemployed . the german economy has been struggling through several tough years now , but experts are now starting to talk about a light at the end of the tunnel .
if you talk to people on the street , though , it 's a very different story .
many still ca n't seem to imagine that things will improve any time soon .
and the main reason for this skepticism is germany 's ailing job market . more than 4.5 million germans are unemployed .
others only have temporary jobs or work for little or no money .
and the result is not only that increasing numbers of people feel like failures or have low self-esteem , but that those lucky enough to be employed are under greater pressure than ever before . " what counts today is how you assert yourself , how you 're able compete on the market , how loud you are , " said anke patt , a journalist who has recently started her own business .
" and sometimes it counts how good you are at fitting in and swimming with the current . " after world war ii , and especially during the 1960s and 1970s , having a job in germany usually meant that you would start working for a certain company in your late teens or 20s , that you climbed up the career ladder step by step , and that you stayed with that same company throughout your working life .
it was a time of growing social and job security .
but all this has changed dramatically and irreversibly . as a result , many germans feel insecure and fear they will be failures in life .
a major german protestant think tank recently invited a group of business people and church leaders to take a deeper look at the problem and discuss the necessity of work ethics in today 's working environment . profession vs. job " we 've realized that we are n't in touch with business people anymore , " said protestant theologian peter mörbel , the conference 's host .
" we do n't know enough about the new working world , about the service society , for example .
the church 's idea of the business world is still strongly influenced by the ideas of industry and agriculture .
we now have to get to know the new branches .
that 's why we get together and talk about topics that are important to both , the business world and the church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aiming for a job - or for a profession ? at the heart of the round-table discussions were two words : beruf , or " profession , " and " job . " " germans understand the term ' job ' simply as an opportunity to earn a living , something you do for a short while , without having any ties and maybe even without having to take any responsibility , " explained manfred kock , former head of the german protestant church .
" in contrast to that , a profession is something that has to do with your talents and interests that you have either through fate , genes , parents or god .
what can i do with these gifts ?
how can i use them to serve a good purpose ? " instead , kock said , most people today just go to work so that they can pay their rent , food and holiday expenses - they have a job , not a profession .
and this is totally understandable , he said : at a time when employees seem little more than statistics or another cost to companies and when hundreds or thousands of people at the same company regularly lose their jobs , people are no longer willing to put their heart and soul into their work .
this creates a lack of commitment and solidarity from both the company and their employees . it 's part of the church 's responsibility to confront and discuss these sore points , according to kock . " i believe the economy needs to be tamed by what we call duty and responsibility , " he said .
" the economy only works well when it 's standing on both legs : when companies make enough money , and when they are , at the same time , committed to the people for whom they are doing the business . "
success is more than money for andreas rohde , a young lawyer and spokesman for wirtschaftsjunioren bonn , the junior chamber of commerce in bonn , this kind of work ethic has a clear and direct impact on the work he does himself . " i see my clients and my employees as human beings and not just as a work force or as someone who will pay me a fee for the work i do , " said rohde " of course , there 's always the dilemma of how to deal with certain financial rules and expectations , which i - as a christian - do n't like .
sometimes i have to just bite the bullet and refuse certain orders . " charity begins at home , he said .
but it should n't end at the door to your office .
so for rohde , there 's a lot more to success than just making a lot of money .
and although much of the business world probably would n't share this point of view , his fellow conference participants agreed with him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the workplace has become ever more stressful a more diverse group of participants , more young people or those in favor of tighter market competition would no doubt have extolled the benefits of flexible employment terms , for example , or the importance of profits and shareholder value above all else .
but the choice of participants was a deliberate one , said conference host mörbel .
changing words into deeds " we chose certain topics to get the dialogue started in the first place , " he said .
" if you want to include too many contrasting viewpoints , you can easily overload such a meeting .
therefore , i tried to be careful when i planned the conference .
but maybe i was too careful . " for mörbel , the conference was a starting point .
several more round-table discussions of this kind will follow in bonn , he said .
and it 's hoped that as the discussions develop , the participants will start being able to turn their words into deeds , wherever they work and whatever they do . " to meet like-minded people merely makes me all the more determined to stay on the same path and to encourage others to support work ethics which imply reliability and a sense of responsibility instead of a craving for power or money , " patt concluded . svenja üing -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?

but chancellor angela merkel may have gone a bit too far during her visit to jerusalem , according to dw 's peter philipp . ahead of her middle east visit , the chancellor already showed that she knows how to act on the diplomatic stage and that she 's not intimidated by difficult situations .
in jerusalem , she confirmed this impression again , although the timing for merkel 's visit was awkward : israeli prime minister sharon is still in a coma ; the election campaign has started ; the radical islamic hamas has been elected in the palestinian territories ; and the dispute over iran 's nuclear ambitions is smoldering in the background . that 's reason enough to delay a courtesy call .
but a german head of government 's debut visit in israel is part of the ritual between the two countries .
and after it was already delayed once because of sharon 's illness and foreign minister steinmeier 's cancellation of his visit due to a german intelligence service scandal , it was important that angela merkel went there .
what was more important was what she - as the first foreign politician to visit since the palestinian election - had to say about the vote : hamas must recognize israel 's right to exist , renounce violence and accept the peace process .

but chancellor angela merkel may have gone a bit too far during her visit to jerusalem , according to dw 's peter philipp . ahead of her middle east visit , the chancellor already showed that she knows how to act on the diplomatic stage and that she 's not intimidated by difficult situations .
in jerusalem , she confirmed this impression again , although the timing for merkel 's visit was awkward : israeli prime minister sharon is still in a coma ; the election campaign has started ; the radical islamic hamas has been elected in the palestinian territories ; and the dispute over iran 's nuclear ambitions is smoldering in the background . that 's reason enough to delay a courtesy call .
but a german head of government 's debut visit in israel is part of the ritual between the two countries .
and after it was already delayed once because of sharon 's illness and foreign minister steinmeier 's cancellation of his visit due to a german intelligence service scandal , it was important that angela merkel went there .
what was more important was what she - as the first foreign politician to visit since the palestinian election - had to say about the vote : hamas must recognize israel 's right to exist , renounce violence and accept the peace process .
otherwise , foreign - especially european - support would be unthinkable .
the message does n't only stem from germany 's special relationship to israel , but also from foreign countries ' genuine concern about continuation of the peace process .
back in time ?
hamas ' election victory threatens to turn back the wheels of history , and aid to the palestinians could - as it was before the oslo accords - be construed once again as supporting the fight against israel .
the europeans wo n't allow that .
who could be more apt than than angela merkel to say that , as germany contributes the biggest chunk of the eu 's 500 million euros -lrb- $ 609 million -rrb- in aid to the palestinians ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president has provoked outrage in west with his comments but in another respect , the chancellor may have gone a bit too far in her solidarity with israel .
however , the europeans ' lack of a concept in dealing with the question of iran 's nuclear policy may be to blame .
although the europeans fluctuate between criticism , threat and coaxing , merkel said that iran was a " threat to the democratic countries of this earth . "
she surely reflected israeli beliefs , but her comments missed the mark .
criticism is certainly warranted of iranian president ahmadinejad 's diatribes against israel as well as his unspeakable remarks about the holocaust .
and to a certain degree , distrust towards tehran 's real nuclear plans may be warranted .

" we have reiterated our belief and our attachment to the freedom of the press and freedom of expression as part of our fundamental values , " austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik told journalists monday after chairing a meeting with her european union colleagues . " we have equally referred to the religious beliefs that are to be respected in our societies as fundamental values as well , " she added . cartoons portraying the prophet mohammed wearing a time-bomb shaped turban , published in a danish newspaper last september and reprinted in a norwegian magazine in january , have sparked uproar in the muslim world where images of the prophet are considered blasphemous . the row has taken a new dimension over the past days , with danish flags being burnt , products being boycotted and copenhagen starting to take measures to protect its citizens living in muslim countries . plassnik said that the eu " strongly rejects " threats to its citizens and that : " we do hope that this issue can be solved through constructive dialogue between the parties involved " . eu foreign policy chief javier solana insisted that the eu did not want to hurt anybody .

" we see double standards in the european media , which is fearful of being accused of anti-semitism but which invokes freedom of expression for a caricature on islam , " mussa told reporters . most arab governments have vocally condemned the series of 12 cartoons , which show the prophet as a wild-eyed knife-wielding bedouin flanked by two women shrouded in black . attacks against eu offices libya announced sunday it had decided to close its diplomatic representation in copenhagen " in light of the attacks against the prophet mohammed and the silence of the danish authorities .

at another gaza demonstration , protestors burned the danish flag . denmark wo n't apologize the danish government has said the views expressed by the jyllands-posten newspaper did not reflect its own but has consistently refused to apologize and has insisted it would defend freedom of expression . an official from a danish dairy products company said two of its salespersons were molested in saudi arabia , in the holy muslim city of mecca . the danish government " vigorously condemns these attacks as well as the fact that danish flags have been burnt in the arab world and expects the governments of these countries to do the same , " danish foreign minister per stig moeller said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palestinian child steps on a danish national flag , as a sign of disrespect in an internet statement whose authenticity could not be verified , an iraqi insurgent group - the army of mujahedeen -lrb- holy warriors -rrb- - called on its members to attack any reachable danish and norwegian targets . the danish foreign ministry issued a warning to its nationals in seven arab countries to be extra vigilant , while the danish branch of the red cross said it had evacuated two of its aid workers in gaza and one in yemen . the cartoons have triggered one of scandinavia 's most serious diplomatic incidents in recent years but a poll published over the weekend showed that most danes felt their government should not apologize over the cartoons . arab newspapers have frequently been criticized for carrying anti-semitic opinions and cartoons . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel warns palestinians over hamas german chancellor angela merkel on monday warned that berlin would cut funding to a hamas-led palestinian authority unless the radical islamist group renounced violence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.01.2006 the ethics of success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers and the unemployed should be made to feel like more than just cattle business people and church leaders met in bonn to discuss work ethics in today 's achievement-oriented society at a time when increasing numbers of germans feel like failures or have low esteem because they 're unemployed . the german economy has been struggling through several tough years now , but experts are now starting to talk about a light at the end of the tunnel .
if you talk to people on the street , though , it 's a very different story .
many still ca n't seem to imagine that things will improve any time soon .
and the main reason for this skepticism is germany 's ailing job market . more than 4.5 million germans are unemployed .
others only have temporary jobs or work for little or no money .
and the result is not only that increasing numbers of people feel like failures or have low self-esteem , but that those lucky enough to be employed are under greater pressure than ever before . " what counts today is how you assert yourself , how you 're able compete on the market , how loud you are , " said anke patt , a journalist who has recently started her own business .
" and sometimes it counts how good you are at fitting in and swimming with the current . " after world war ii , and especially during the 1960s and 1970s , having a job in germany usually meant that you would start working for a certain company in your late teens or 20s , that you climbed up the career ladder step by step , and that you stayed with that same company throughout your working life .
it was a time of growing social and job security .
but all this has changed dramatically and irreversibly . as a result , many germans feel insecure and fear they will be failures in life .
a major german protestant think tank recently invited a group of business people and church leaders to take a deeper look at the problem and discuss the necessity of work ethics in today 's working environment . profession vs. job " we 've realized that we are n't in touch with business people anymore , " said protestant theologian peter mörbel , the conference 's host .
" we do n't know enough about the new working world , about the service society , for example .
the church 's idea of the business world is still strongly influenced by the ideas of industry and agriculture .
we now have to get to know the new branches .
that 's why we get together and talk about topics that are important to both , the business world and the church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aiming for a job - or for a profession ? at the heart of the round-table discussions were two words : beruf , or " profession , " and " job . " " germans understand the term ' job ' simply as an opportunity to earn a living , something you do for a short while , without having any ties and maybe even without having to take any responsibility , " explained manfred kock , former head of the german protestant church .
" in contrast to that , a profession is something that has to do with your talents and interests that you have either through fate , genes , parents or god .
what can i do with these gifts ?
how can i use them to serve a good purpose ? " instead , kock said , most people today just go to work so that they can pay their rent , food and holiday expenses - they have a job , not a profession .
and this is totally understandable , he said : at a time when employees seem little more than statistics or another cost to companies and when hundreds or thousands of people at the same company regularly lose their jobs , people are no longer willing to put their heart and soul into their work .
this creates a lack of commitment and solidarity from both the company and their employees . it 's part of the church 's responsibility to confront and discuss these sore points , according to kock . " i believe the economy needs to be tamed by what we call duty and responsibility , " he said .
" the economy only works well when it 's standing on both legs : when companies make enough money , and when they are , at the same time , committed to the people for whom they are doing the business . "
success is more than money for andreas rohde , a young lawyer and spokesman for wirtschaftsjunioren bonn , the junior chamber of commerce in bonn , this kind of work ethic has a clear and direct impact on the work he does himself . " i see my clients and my employees as human beings and not just as a work force or as someone who will pay me a fee for the work i do , " said rohde " of course , there 's always the dilemma of how to deal with certain financial rules and expectations , which i - as a christian - do n't like .
sometimes i have to just bite the bullet and refuse certain orders . " charity begins at home , he said .
but it should n't end at the door to your office .
so for rohde , there 's a lot more to success than just making a lot of money .
and although much of the business world probably would n't share this point of view , his fellow conference participants agreed with him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the workplace has become ever more stressful a more diverse group of participants , more young people or those in favor of tighter market competition would no doubt have extolled the benefits of flexible employment terms , for example , or the importance of profits and shareholder value above all else .
but the choice of participants was a deliberate one , said conference host mörbel .
changing words into deeds " we chose certain topics to get the dialogue started in the first place , " he said .
" if you want to include too many contrasting viewpoints , you can easily overload such a meeting .
therefore , i tried to be careful when i planned the conference .
but maybe i was too careful . " for mörbel , the conference was a starting point .
several more round-table discussions of this kind will follow in bonn , he said .
and it 's hoped that as the discussions develop , the participants will start being able to turn their words into deeds , wherever they work and whatever they do . " to meet like-minded people merely makes me all the more determined to stay on the same path and to encourage others to support work ethics which imply reliability and a sense of responsibility instead of a craving for power or money , " patt concluded . svenja üing -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?

if you talk to people on the street , though , it 's a very different story .
many still ca n't seem to imagine that things will improve any time soon .
and the main reason for this skepticism is germany 's ailing job market . more than 4.5 million germans are unemployed .
others only have temporary jobs or work for little or no money .
and the result is not only that increasing numbers of people feel like failures or have low self-esteem , but that those lucky enough to be employed are under greater pressure than ever before . " what counts today is how you assert yourself , how you 're able compete on the market , how loud you are , " said anke patt , a journalist who has recently started her own business .
" and sometimes it counts how good you are at fitting in and swimming with the current . " after world war ii , and especially during the 1960s and 1970s , having a job in germany usually meant that you would start working for a certain company in your late teens or 20s , that you climbed up the career ladder step by step , and that you stayed with that same company throughout your working life .
it was a time of growing social and job security .
but all this has changed dramatically and irreversibly . as a result , many germans feel insecure and fear they will be failures in life .
a major german protestant think tank recently invited a group of business people and church leaders to take a deeper look at the problem and discuss the necessity of work ethics in today 's working environment . profession vs. job " we 've realized that we are n't in touch with business people anymore , " said protestant theologian peter mörbel , the conference 's host .
" we do n't know enough about the new working world , about the service society , for example .
the church 's idea of the business world is still strongly influenced by the ideas of industry and agriculture .
we now have to get to know the new branches .
that 's why we get together and talk about topics that are important to both , the business world and the church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aiming for a job - or for a profession ? at the heart of the round-table discussions were two words : beruf , or " profession , " and " job . " " germans understand the term ' job ' simply as an opportunity to earn a living , something you do for a short while , without having any ties and maybe even without having to take any responsibility , " explained manfred kock , former head of the german protestant church .
" in contrast to that , a profession is something that has to do with your talents and interests that you have either through fate , genes , parents or god .
what can i do with these gifts ?
how can i use them to serve a good purpose ? " instead , kock said , most people today just go to work so that they can pay their rent , food and holiday expenses - they have a job , not a profession .
and this is totally understandable , he said : at a time when employees seem little more than statistics or another cost to companies and when hundreds or thousands of people at the same company regularly lose their jobs , people are no longer willing to put their heart and soul into their work .
this creates a lack of commitment and solidarity from both the company and their employees . it 's part of the church 's responsibility to confront and discuss these sore points , according to kock . " i believe the economy needs to be tamed by what we call duty and responsibility , " he said .
" the economy only works well when it 's standing on both legs : when companies make enough money , and when they are , at the same time , committed to the people for whom they are doing the business . "
success is more than money for andreas rohde , a young lawyer and spokesman for wirtschaftsjunioren bonn , the junior chamber of commerce in bonn , this kind of work ethic has a clear and direct impact on the work he does himself . " i see my clients and my employees as human beings and not just as a work force or as someone who will pay me a fee for the work i do , " said rohde " of course , there 's always the dilemma of how to deal with certain financial rules and expectations , which i - as a christian - do n't like .
sometimes i have to just bite the bullet and refuse certain orders . " charity begins at home , he said .
but it should n't end at the door to your office .
so for rohde , there 's a lot more to success than just making a lot of money .
and although much of the business world probably would n't share this point of view , his fellow conference participants agreed with him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the workplace has become ever more stressful a more diverse group of participants , more young people or those in favor of tighter market competition would no doubt have extolled the benefits of flexible employment terms , for example , or the importance of profits and shareholder value above all else .
but the choice of participants was a deliberate one , said conference host mörbel .
changing words into deeds " we chose certain topics to get the dialogue started in the first place , " he said .
" if you want to include too many contrasting viewpoints , you can easily overload such a meeting .
therefore , i tried to be careful when i planned the conference .
but maybe i was too careful . " for mörbel , the conference was a starting point .
several more round-table discussions of this kind will follow in bonn , he said .
and it 's hoped that as the discussions develop , the participants will start being able to turn their words into deeds , wherever they work and whatever they do . " to meet like-minded people merely makes me all the more determined to stay on the same path and to encourage others to support work ethics which imply reliability and a sense of responsibility instead of a craving for power or money , " patt concluded . svenja üing -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?

" i see my clients and my employees as human beings and not just as a work force or as someone who will pay me a fee for the work i do , " said rohde " of course , there 's always the dilemma of how to deal with certain financial rules and expectations , which i - as a christian - do n't like .
sometimes i have to just bite the bullet and refuse certain orders . " charity begins at home , he said .
but it should n't end at the door to your office .
so for rohde , there 's a lot more to success than just making a lot of money .
and although much of the business world probably would n't share this point of view , his fellow conference participants agreed with him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the workplace has become ever more stressful a more diverse group of participants , more young people or those in favor of tighter market competition would no doubt have extolled the benefits of flexible employment terms , for example , or the importance of profits and shareholder value above all else .
but the choice of participants was a deliberate one , said conference host mörbel .
changing words into deeds " we chose certain topics to get the dialogue started in the first place , " he said .
" if you want to include too many contrasting viewpoints , you can easily overload such a meeting .
therefore , i tried to be careful when i planned the conference .
but maybe i was too careful . " for mörbel , the conference was a starting point .
several more round-table discussions of this kind will follow in bonn , he said .
and it 's hoped that as the discussions develop , the participants will start being able to turn their words into deeds , wherever they work and whatever they do . " to meet like-minded people merely makes me all the more determined to stay on the same path and to encourage others to support work ethics which imply reliability and a sense of responsibility instead of a craving for power or money , " patt concluded . svenja üing -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?

" they have been a terrorist organization .
they have to change their methods and they have to accept that violence is incompatible with democracy , " solana told afp as he arrived for a day of talks in brussels . " they have to also recognize israel , because in the end what we are trying to do is construct a two-state model and to do that , you have to talk to the other , " he added . the brussels meeting is the first chance for the 25-nation bloc 's ministers to talk since the long-ruling fatah faction lost last week 's palestinian elections to hamas . the eu is unlikely to take any rash decisions .
diplomats stress it has time while waiting for a palestinian government to be formed , and in the meantime palestinian authority head mahmoud abbas remains its key contact . " we would like very much to support president abbas at this period of time , " said solana .
" this is what we are going to do today . " us looks to eu for resolve the united states expects europe to show as much resolve with hamas as it has in vowing to cut aid to the palestinians if the radical islamic group fails to renounce violence , us secretary of state condoleezza rice said on sunday . " first of all the europeans also list hamas as a terrorist organization , " rice said after arriving in london , where she is meeting with representatives of the other members of the mideast peace process quartet : the european union , russia and united nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice is confident that the quartet has a strong consensus about the middle east " supporting a peace process on the one hand ... and on the other hand , supporting the activities of a partner in that set of negotiations which does not recognize the existence of the other partner , it just does not work , " she said . rice underlined that the quartet partners have " forged a very strong consensus about the way forward " in the middle east . us president george w. bush last week warned of cuts in us aid to the palestinians if hamas does not dissolve its armed wing and renounce threats against israel . " if they do n't , we wo n't deal with them .
aid packages wo n't go forward , " bush told cbs television in an interview . the us hopes that economic pressure will elicit a renunciation of violence from hamas .

meanwhile angela merkel called iran " a threat " to democracy on sunday . iran 's foreign ministry insisted on sunday that the only solution to the standoff with the west over its nuclear program is through negotiations and not a referral to the united nations security council .
tehran threatened to halt " all voluntary cooperation " with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- if the west decides to pass the case on to the un . tehran , which decided to resume uranium enrichment research despite international objection , has defended its nuclear activity saying it only wants to make fuel for civil atomic power .
the west fears the project masks a secret nuclear weapons program . " all our friends in europe and the iaea board know the islamic republic 's position : referring the case to or informing the un security council will lead to iran stopping all voluntary cooperation , " foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told a news conference . the west , however , is sticking to its hard line that a draft composed by britain , france and germany at an emergency meeting in london on monday includes the suggestion to ask the iaea to refer the matter to the security council .
although the eu trio has spent two and a half years negotiating with tehran over its atomic program , they say time is running out and are seriously considering putting the issue up for a vote on economic sanctions . merkel gets tough and calls iran a threat to democratic world in germany , where politicians have been cautious on the issue , the rhetoric became audibly more stringent over the weekend with chancellor angela merkel taking the hardest line yet in her words on the issue . merkel said at the start of her first visit to israel on sunday that iran threatens not only the jewish state but the entire democratic world .
" iran is not just a threat to israel , but also to the democratic countries of this world . " adding that both germany and israel shared the same view on iran 's ambitions , merkel said : " i do n't see the slightest difference in the views of germany and israel .
it is clear that iran should not get the ability to enrich uranium . " merkel also condemned iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad for his anti-israeli remarks .
ahmadinejad has said the jewish state should be " wiped off the map " and doubted that six million jews had been killed by the nazis during world war ii .
" it 's unacceptable that iran 's president rejects and falsifies history , " she said . acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert thanked merkel for supporting israel on the question of iran 's nuclear program .
" i would ... like to thank you for your position on iran .
it is a topic that causes great concern here in israel , " he said . a case for sanctions ? earlier at the weekend , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier suggested a tougher german line by saying it would be unwise to rule out economic sanctions . in an interview with the german weekly magazine der spiegel , the minister said " the latest signals from tehran are contradictory at best . "
he added : " i 'm aware of the criticisms that iran is using tricks and playing for time – and i ca n't seriously deny them . " german defense minister franz josef jung also left open the possibility of sanctions .
speaking to the frankfurter allgemeinen sonntagszeitung , he said if russia and china went along with the strategy , economic sanctions could be effective in convincing iran to give up its " obvious intentions of developing atomic weapons . " iran calls for diplomacy in a last-ditch effort to avoid a un referral and sanctions , iran called for talks with britain , france and germany in brussels on monday .

meanwhile angela merkel called iran " a threat " to democracy on sunday . iran 's foreign ministry insisted on sunday that the only solution to the standoff with the west over its nuclear program is through negotiations and not a referral to the united nations security council .
tehran threatened to halt " all voluntary cooperation " with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- if the west decides to pass the case on to the un . tehran , which decided to resume uranium enrichment research despite international objection , has defended its nuclear activity saying it only wants to make fuel for civil atomic power .
the west fears the project masks a secret nuclear weapons program . " all our friends in europe and the iaea board know the islamic republic 's position : referring the case to or informing the un security council will lead to iran stopping all voluntary cooperation , " foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told a news conference . the west , however , is sticking to its hard line that a draft composed by britain , france and germany at an emergency meeting in london on monday includes the suggestion to ask the iaea to refer the matter to the security council .
although the eu trio has spent two and a half years negotiating with tehran over its atomic program , they say time is running out and are seriously considering putting the issue up for a vote on economic sanctions . merkel gets tough and calls iran a threat to democratic world in germany , where politicians have been cautious on the issue , the rhetoric became audibly more stringent over the weekend with chancellor angela merkel taking the hardest line yet in her words on the issue . merkel said at the start of her first visit to israel on sunday that iran threatens not only the jewish state but the entire democratic world .
" iran is not just a threat to israel , but also to the democratic countries of this world . " adding that both germany and israel shared the same view on iran 's ambitions , merkel said : " i do n't see the slightest difference in the views of germany and israel .
it is clear that iran should not get the ability to enrich uranium . " merkel also condemned iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad for his anti-israeli remarks .
ahmadinejad has said the jewish state should be " wiped off the map " and doubted that six million jews had been killed by the nazis during world war ii .
" it 's unacceptable that iran 's president rejects and falsifies history , " she said . acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert thanked merkel for supporting israel on the question of iran 's nuclear program .
" i would ... like to thank you for your position on iran .
it is a topic that causes great concern here in israel , " he said . a case for sanctions ? earlier at the weekend , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier suggested a tougher german line by saying it would be unwise to rule out economic sanctions . in an interview with the german weekly magazine der spiegel , the minister said " the latest signals from tehran are contradictory at best . "
he added : " i 'm aware of the criticisms that iran is using tricks and playing for time – and i ca n't seriously deny them . " german defense minister franz josef jung also left open the possibility of sanctions .
speaking to the frankfurter allgemeinen sonntagszeitung , he said if russia and china went along with the strategy , economic sanctions could be effective in convincing iran to give up its " obvious intentions of developing atomic weapons .

" the document came about because of " a series of worrying events -lrb- that -rrb- has recently taken place in a number of member states , " such as bans on gay pride marches , hate speeches by political and religious leaders , breaking up of demonstrations by police , homophobic violence and constitutional amendments prohibiting same-sex unions . catholic leaders immediately criticized the resolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church opposes violence against gays but does not support gay unions " the declaration shows an aversion for certain values of our tradition , notably religious values , " aldo giordano , the secretary-general of the council of european bishops ' conferences , told vatican radio .
" such resolutions risk delegitimizing the european parliament .
it should be clear that certain subjects , especially those relating to the family , are not within the direct competence of the european union but are the recognized competence of nations . " that argument was echoed by those opposing the resolution in parliament . " i think that this is a case of europe getting involved in things that are none of europe 's business , " said angelika niebler , one of 27 conservative german members of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- who voted against the declaration . an essential reaction to homophobia ? while an eu directive requires member states to protect gay people against discrimination regarding employment , national laws vary widely in other areas .
while a range of countries , including belgium , britain , denmark , france , germany and spain , have legalized gay civil unions , others are far from doing so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia is not the most gay-friendly place in europe in latvia , for example , the eu anti-discrimination directive has not been implemented and a constitutional amendment defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman . " the situation is a bleak one , " said ilze brands kehris , the director of the latvian center for human rights and ethnic studies .
" it 's absolutely essential that we have these kinds of reactions internationally . " she added that her country 's young democracy still had a lot to learn . " the soviet period blocked any kind of development on tolerance issues , " she said .
" you have to activate civil society in coalition with the international signals to bring change over time in latvia . " will actions follow ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and pope benedict xvi have similar views on gay marriage in poland , where president lech kaczynski barred gay pride marches during his tenure as mayor of warsaw and prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz called for state protection against homosexual " contamination " of society , gay rights activists also said they had high hopes for the resolution . " when you hear from the prime minister that homosexuality is abnormal , that we should be cured , that they will try to cure us by force , this is quite frightening , " said robert biedron , the head of warsaw-based campaign against homophobia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel mention gay rights next time she meets marcinkiewicz ?
" i think that this resolution is very important for new european member states as a reminder on which way the new democracies should go , " he added . but while welcoming the resolution , german gay rights activist jörg litwinschuh said it 's only worth something if actions follow . " if nothing changes , sanctions have to happen , " he said , adding that his initiative queer nations would also lobby chancellor angela merkel to address discrimination against gay people in her meetings with foreign leaders . recognizing the nazis ' gay victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will resemble the one fore jewish holocaust victims litwinschuh is the executive director of a consortium of german scientists and celebrities that plans to reopen the magnus hirschfeld institute , the first center to study homosexuality , which was destroyed by the nazis in 1933 . he said that he was particularly pleased that the resolution also called on " member states concerned finally to accord full recognition to homosexuals as targets and victims of the nazi regime . " a big step in that direction was already taken last week , when berlin announced plans to build a national memorial for homosexuals persecuted by the nazis . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to build memorial to gays persecuted by nazis the berlin government has given the go-ahead for a memorial designed by a scandinavian artist-duo in central berlin commemorating thousands of homosexuals persecuted by nazi germany .

meanwhile angela merkel called iran " a threat " to democracy on sunday . iran 's foreign ministry insisted on sunday that the only solution to the standoff with the west over its nuclear program is through negotiations and not a referral to the united nations security council .
tehran threatened to halt " all voluntary cooperation " with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- if the west decides to pass the case on to the un . tehran , which decided to resume uranium enrichment research despite international objection , has defended its nuclear activity saying it only wants to make fuel for civil atomic power .
the west fears the project masks a secret nuclear weapons program .

the stars will be out in full force though . keeping in mind last year 's sex-and porn-themed berlin film festival which spurred at least one tabloid to dub it " sexinale , " berlinale director dieter kosslick is skirting clear of controversy this time . speaking at a packed press conference in berlin on monday , kosslick said the festival , which runs from feb .
9 to feb .
19 , did n't have a formal motto , but was more serious in its focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosslick says this year 's berlinale will be more serious in tone and content " i know sex , football and politics was big last time , " kosslick said .
" but this time , if there is a trend , then it 's definitely political .
all around the world , there 's a very strong tendency of political cinema , one that 's close to reality and shows a tough world , and i 'm glad that the berlinale is taking part in it . " the political theme runs through almost all sections of the berlinale this time .
" syriana , " a political thriller starring george clooney is being screened out of competition .
" bye bye berlusconi ! " a satire by jan henrik stahlberg will feature in the panorama section and british michael winterbottom 's " the road to guantanamo " about three muslims held up at the us lockup in cuba will show in the competition section . asked whether the latter was a comment on the iraq war and us policies , kosslick said it was rather " a statement for human rights . " if i had my way , then i 'd meet the 450 guantanamo inmates , who are being held there in violation of every human right and are tortured , on the red carpet during the screening of the film , " kosslick added .
" but unfortunately i ca n't . " bigger tha n ever in addition to promising some seriously thought-provoking fare , this year 's berlinale , which is the first of europe 's three major festivals in the new year , has gotten even bigger , reflecting its surging popularity amid germany 's economic stagnation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlinale offers a mind-boggling array of events and shows kosslick and his staff went through a record 4,000 films submitted to pick the 400 for the main competition and various sidebar events . a total number of 26 films are in the competition section , 19 of them will compete for the golden and silver bears and 17 films are world premieres . a record number of 18,000 film buyers , sellers , producers , directors and actors as well as journalists from around the world will also be thronging the screenings and press conferences around the glitzy potsdamer platz in downtown berlin . reconfirming the festival 's reputation as a launching pad for hollywood and european films at the start of the year , beki probst , head of the festival 's european film market , where buyers and sellers from around the world gather , said the section had won lots of new customers from the us , asia as well as within europe .
the film market has shown a 45 percent increase this year with 254 companies attending . " it 's definitely established berlin as an important place , " probst said .
" now the feeling is ' berlin is a must ' . " four germa n e n tries kosslick , who is in his fifth year as berlinale director and is credited with boosting german film , has stayed true to his reputation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book cover of michel houellebecq 's " elementary particles " this time , germany is entering the competition with four films : oskar röhler 's " elementary particles , " an on-screen adaptation of french literary bad boy michael houellebecq 's tale of a sexually-obsessed person , matthias glasner 's " free will , " a story of a compulsive rapist , valeska grisebach 's " longing , " a picture about a love triangle set in the former communist east and a film about exorcism in 1970s west germany by hans-christian schmid , called " requiem . " " the four are absolutely justified .
they 're very different , " kosslick said , adding tongue-in-cheek : " if you do n't want to laugh to death , then you should go and see the german films . " star power true to its form , the berlinale this year will also draw in the stars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " my good friend george clooney , " is how kosslick describes the hollywood star berlin favorite george clooney , isabella rossellini , meryl streep , vin diesel , roberto benigni und claude chabrol among others will add some glamour to the berlin winter .
the international jury will be headed by english actress charlotte rampling and will include veteran german actor armin müller-stahl . " snow cake , " a british-canadian co-production starring sigourney weaver as an autistic woman , opens the festival .
weaver is expected on the red carpet along with co-star alan rickman . away from the glamour and the buzz , kosslick said the festival , which costs an estimated 16 million euros -lrb- $ 19.5 million -rrb- , was financially well-secured too thanks to new sponsors .

meanwhile angela merkel called iran " a threat " to democracy on sunday . iran 's foreign ministry insisted on sunday that the only solution to the standoff with the west over its nuclear program is through negotiations and not a referral to the united nations security council .
tehran threatened to halt " all voluntary cooperation " with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- if the west decides to pass the case on to the un . tehran , which decided to resume uranium enrichment research despite international objection , has defended its nuclear activity saying it only wants to make fuel for civil atomic power .
the west fears the project masks a secret nuclear weapons program . " all our friends in europe and the iaea board know the islamic republic 's position : referring the case to or informing the un security council will lead to iran stopping all voluntary cooperation , " foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told a news conference . the west , however , is sticking to its hard line that a draft composed by britain , france and germany at an emergency meeting in london on monday includes the suggestion to ask the iaea to refer the matter to the security council .
although the eu trio has spent two and a half years negotiating with tehran over its atomic program , they say time is running out and are seriously considering putting the issue up for a vote on economic sanctions . merkel gets tough and calls iran a threat to democratic world in germany , where politicians have been cautious on the issue , the rhetoric became audibly more stringent over the weekend with chancellor angela merkel taking the hardest line yet in her words on the issue . merkel said at the start of her first visit to israel on sunday that iran threatens not only the jewish state but the entire democratic world .
" iran is not just a threat to israel , but also to the democratic countries of this world . " adding that both germany and israel shared the same view on iran 's ambitions , merkel said : " i do n't see the slightest difference in the views of germany and israel .
it is clear that iran should not get the ability to enrich uranium . " merkel also condemned iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad for his anti-israeli remarks .
ahmadinejad has said the jewish state should be " wiped off the map " and doubted that six million jews had been killed by the nazis during world war ii .
" it 's unacceptable that iran 's president rejects and falsifies history , " she said . acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert thanked merkel for supporting israel on the question of iran 's nuclear program .
" i would ... like to thank you for your position on iran .
it is a topic that causes great concern here in israel , " he said . a case for sanctions ? earlier at the weekend , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier suggested a tougher german line by saying it would be unwise to rule out economic sanctions . in an interview with the german weekly magazine der spiegel , the minister said " the latest signals from tehran are contradictory at best . "
he added : " i 'm aware of the criticisms that iran is using tricks and playing for time – and i ca n't seriously deny them . " german defense minister franz josef jung also left open the possibility of sanctions .
speaking to the frankfurter allgemeinen sonntagszeitung , he said if russia and china went along with the strategy , economic sanctions could be effective in convincing iran to give up its " obvious intentions of developing atomic weapons . " iran calls for diplomacy in a last-ditch effort to avoid a un referral and sanctions , iran called for talks with britain , france and germany in brussels on monday .
javad vaeedi , deputy head of iran 's supreme national security council , will meet diplomats from the eu-3 . " europeans should be patient and try to find a formula to resolve this nuclear issue , " said foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi .
" we are determined to remove any ambiguities over our nuclear ambitions and also protect our right . " in the past iran has repeatedly said it would never abandon its drive to enrich uranium – a necessary step for developing nuclear power reactors and , when highly enriched , nuclear bombs . the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors will hear arguments on feb .

" we have reiterated our belief and our attachment to the freedom of the press and freedom of expression as part of our fundamental values , " austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik told journalists monday after chairing a meeting with her european union colleagues . " we have equally referred to the religious beliefs that are to be respected in our societies as fundamental values as well , " she added . cartoons portraying the prophet mohammed wearing a time-bomb shaped turban , published in a danish newspaper last september and reprinted in a norwegian magazine in january , have sparked uproar in the muslim world where images of the prophet are considered blasphemous . the row has taken a new dimension over the past days , with danish flags being burnt , products being boycotted and copenhagen starting to take measures to protect its citizens living in muslim countries . plassnik said that the eu " strongly rejects " threats to its citizens and that : " we do hope that this issue can be solved through constructive dialogue between the parties involved " . eu foreign policy chief javier solana insisted that the eu did not want to hurt anybody . " we have condemned any expression or acts that attempt to demonize any religion and that is what we try to convey to the leaders of the arab world -lrb- and -rrb- the islamic world , " he added . muslim boycott of danish products egypt 's powerful opposition muslim brotherhood on monday was the latest group to join a chorus of calls for the boycott of danish and norwegian products . the incident has threatened to deal an unprecedented blow to the muslim and arab world 's usually healthy relations with scandinavian governments , who are major donors in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sorry we do n't sell products made in denmark " reads a sign in a supermarket in saudi arabia retailers in the gulf have already started pulling danish and norwegian products off the shelves and danish manufacturers have voiced their concern should the boycott gain further momentum . " double standards " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson warned a saudi official during a meeting in the swiss ski resort of davos that any boycott of danish products was tantamount to a boycott of european goods . mandelson 's spokesman warned riyadh it could have to take the matter to the world trade organisation if the saudi government encouraged the boycott . arab league secretary general amr mussa , in tunis for a meeting of arab interior ministers , decried the " double standards " in the european media . " we see double standards in the european media , which is fearful of being accused of anti-semitism but which invokes freedom of expression for a caricature on islam , " mussa told reporters . most arab governments have vocally condemned the series of 12 cartoons , which show the prophet as a wild-eyed knife-wielding bedouin flanked by two women shrouded in black . attacks against eu offices libya announced sunday it had decided to close its diplomatic representation in copenhagen " in light of the attacks against the prophet mohammed and the silence of the danish authorities . " in a further step , the arab league and the organisation of the islamic conference have announced their intention to seek a un resolution banning attacks against religious beliefs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palestinian militant cradles his weapon next to the eu building in the gaza strip in the gaza strip , masked palestinian gunmen carrying rocket launchers demonstrated in front of eu offices monday and warned they would prevent danes and norwegians from entering the territory until copenhagen apologized .
at another gaza demonstration , protestors burned the danish flag . denmark wo n't apologize the danish government has said the views expressed by the jyllands-posten newspaper did not reflect its own but has consistently refused to apologize and has insisted it would defend freedom of expression . an official from a danish dairy products company said two of its salespersons were molested in saudi arabia , in the holy muslim city of mecca . the danish government " vigorously condemns these attacks as well as the fact that danish flags have been burnt in the arab world and expects the governments of these countries to do the same , " danish foreign minister per stig moeller said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palestinian child steps on a danish national flag , as a sign of disrespect in an internet statement whose authenticity could not be verified , an iraqi insurgent group - the army of mujahedeen -lrb- holy warriors -rrb- - called on its members to attack any reachable danish and norwegian targets . the danish foreign ministry issued a warning to its nationals in seven arab countries to be extra vigilant , while the danish branch of the red cross said it had evacuated two of its aid workers in gaza and one in yemen . the cartoons have triggered one of scandinavia 's most serious diplomatic incidents in recent years but a poll published over the weekend showed that most danes felt their government should not apologize over the cartoons . arab newspapers have frequently been criticized for carrying anti-semitic opinions and cartoons . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel warns palestinians over hamas german chancellor angela merkel on monday warned that berlin would cut funding to a hamas-led palestinian authority unless the radical islamist group renounced violence .

but chancellor angela merkel may have gone a bit too far during her visit to jerusalem , according to dw 's peter philipp . ahead of her middle east visit , the chancellor already showed that she knows how to act on the diplomatic stage and that she 's not intimidated by difficult situations .
in jerusalem , she confirmed this impression again , although the timing for merkel 's visit was awkward : israeli prime minister sharon is still in a coma ; the election campaign has started ; the radical islamic hamas has been elected in the palestinian territories ; and the dispute over iran 's nuclear ambitions is smoldering in the background . that 's reason enough to delay a courtesy call .
but a german head of government 's debut visit in israel is part of the ritual between the two countries .
and after it was already delayed once because of sharon 's illness and foreign minister steinmeier 's cancellation of his visit due to a german intelligence service scandal , it was important that angela merkel went there .
what was more important was what she - as the first foreign politician to visit since the palestinian election - had to say about the vote : hamas must recognize israel 's right to exist , renounce violence and accept the peace process .
otherwise , foreign - especially european - support would be unthinkable .
the message does n't only stem from germany 's special relationship to israel , but also from foreign countries ' genuine concern about continuation of the peace process .

if you talk to people on the street , though , it 's a very different story .
many still ca n't seem to imagine that things will improve any time soon .
and the main reason for this skepticism is germany 's ailing job market . more than 4.5 million germans are unemployed .
others only have temporary jobs or work for little or no money .
and the result is not only that increasing numbers of people feel like failures or have low self-esteem , but that those lucky enough to be employed are under greater pressure than ever before . " what counts today is how you assert yourself , how you 're able compete on the market , how loud you are , " said anke patt , a journalist who has recently started her own business .
" and sometimes it counts how good you are at fitting in and swimming with the current . " after world war ii , and especially during the 1960s and 1970s , having a job in germany usually meant that you would start working for a certain company in your late teens or 20s , that you climbed up the career ladder step by step , and that you stayed with that same company throughout your working life .
it was a time of growing social and job security .
but all this has changed dramatically and irreversibly . as a result , many germans feel insecure and fear they will be failures in life .
a major german protestant think tank recently invited a group of business people and church leaders to take a deeper look at the problem and discuss the necessity of work ethics in today 's working environment . profession vs. job " we 've realized that we are n't in touch with business people anymore , " said protestant theologian peter mörbel , the conference 's host .
" we do n't know enough about the new working world , about the service society , for example .
the church 's idea of the business world is still strongly influenced by the ideas of industry and agriculture .
we now have to get to know the new branches .
that 's why we get together and talk about topics that are important to both , the business world and the church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aiming for a job - or for a profession ? at the heart of the round-table discussions were two words : beruf , or " profession , " and " job . " " germans understand the term ' job ' simply as an opportunity to earn a living , something you do for a short while , without having any ties and maybe even without having to take any responsibility , " explained manfred kock , former head of the german protestant church .
" in contrast to that , a profession is something that has to do with your talents and interests that you have either through fate , genes , parents or god .
what can i do with these gifts ?
how can i use them to serve a good purpose ? " instead , kock said , most people today just go to work so that they can pay their rent , food and holiday expenses - they have a job , not a profession .
and this is totally understandable , he said : at a time when employees seem little more than statistics or another cost to companies and when hundreds or thousands of people at the same company regularly lose their jobs , people are no longer willing to put their heart and soul into their work .
this creates a lack of commitment and solidarity from both the company and their employees . it 's part of the church 's responsibility to confront and discuss these sore points , according to kock . " i believe the economy needs to be tamed by what we call duty and responsibility , " he said .
" the economy only works well when it 's standing on both legs : when companies make enough money , and when they are , at the same time , committed to the people for whom they are doing the business . "
success is more than money for andreas rohde , a young lawyer and spokesman for wirtschaftsjunioren bonn , the junior chamber of commerce in bonn , this kind of work ethic has a clear and direct impact on the work he does himself . " i see my clients and my employees as human beings and not just as a work force or as someone who will pay me a fee for the work i do , " said rohde " of course , there 's always the dilemma of how to deal with certain financial rules and expectations , which i - as a christian - do n't like .
sometimes i have to just bite the bullet and refuse certain orders . " charity begins at home , he said .
but it should n't end at the door to your office .
so for rohde , there 's a lot more to success than just making a lot of money .
and although much of the business world probably would n't share this point of view , his fellow conference participants agreed with him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the workplace has become ever more stressful a more diverse group of participants , more young people or those in favor of tighter market competition would no doubt have extolled the benefits of flexible employment terms , for example , or the importance of profits and shareholder value above all else .

changing words into deeds " we chose certain topics to get the dialogue started in the first place , " he said .
" if you want to include too many contrasting viewpoints , you can easily overload such a meeting .
therefore , i tried to be careful when i planned the conference .
but maybe i was too careful . " for mörbel , the conference was a starting point .
several more round-table discussions of this kind will follow in bonn , he said .
and it 's hoped that as the discussions develop , the participants will start being able to turn their words into deeds , wherever they work and whatever they do . " to meet like-minded people merely makes me all the more determined to stay on the same path and to encourage others to support work ethics which imply reliability and a sense of responsibility instead of a craving for power or money , " patt concluded . svenja üing -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?

if you talk to people on the street , though , it 's a very different story .
many still ca n't seem to imagine that things will improve any time soon .
and the main reason for this skepticism is germany 's ailing job market . more than 4.5 million germans are unemployed .
others only have temporary jobs or work for little or no money .
and the result is not only that increasing numbers of people feel like failures or have low self-esteem , but that those lucky enough to be employed are under greater pressure than ever before . " what counts today is how you assert yourself , how you 're able compete on the market , how loud you are , " said anke patt , a journalist who has recently started her own business .
" and sometimes it counts how good you are at fitting in and swimming with the current . " after world war ii , and especially during the 1960s and 1970s , having a job in germany usually meant that you would start working for a certain company in your late teens or 20s , that you climbed up the career ladder step by step , and that you stayed with that same company throughout your working life .
it was a time of growing social and job security .
but all this has changed dramatically and irreversibly . as a result , many germans feel insecure and fear they will be failures in life .
a major german protestant think tank recently invited a group of business people and church leaders to take a deeper look at the problem and discuss the necessity of work ethics in today 's working environment . profession vs. job " we 've realized that we are n't in touch with business people anymore , " said protestant theologian peter mörbel , the conference 's host .
" we do n't know enough about the new working world , about the service society , for example .
the church 's idea of the business world is still strongly influenced by the ideas of industry and agriculture .
we now have to get to know the new branches .
that 's why we get together and talk about topics that are important to both , the business world and the church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aiming for a job - or for a profession ? at the heart of the round-table discussions were two words : beruf , or " profession , " and " job . " " germans understand the term ' job ' simply as an opportunity to earn a living , something you do for a short while , without having any ties and maybe even without having to take any responsibility , " explained manfred kock , former head of the german protestant church .
" in contrast to that , a profession is something that has to do with your talents and interests that you have either through fate , genes , parents or god .
what can i do with these gifts ?
how can i use them to serve a good purpose ? " instead , kock said , most people today just go to work so that they can pay their rent , food and holiday expenses - they have a job , not a profession .
and this is totally understandable , he said : at a time when employees seem little more than statistics or another cost to companies and when hundreds or thousands of people at the same company regularly lose their jobs , people are no longer willing to put their heart and soul into their work .
this creates a lack of commitment and solidarity from both the company and their employees . it 's part of the church 's responsibility to confront and discuss these sore points , according to kock . " i believe the economy needs to be tamed by what we call duty and responsibility , " he said .
" the economy only works well when it 's standing on both legs : when companies make enough money , and when they are , at the same time , committed to the people for whom they are doing the business . "
success is more than money for andreas rohde , a young lawyer and spokesman for wirtschaftsjunioren bonn , the junior chamber of commerce in bonn , this kind of work ethic has a clear and direct impact on the work he does himself . " i see my clients and my employees as human beings and not just as a work force or as someone who will pay me a fee for the work i do , " said rohde " of course , there 's always the dilemma of how to deal with certain financial rules and expectations , which i - as a christian - do n't like .
sometimes i have to just bite the bullet and refuse certain orders . " charity begins at home , he said .
but it should n't end at the door to your office .
so for rohde , there 's a lot more to success than just making a lot of money .
and although much of the business world probably would n't share this point of view , his fellow conference participants agreed with him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the workplace has become ever more stressful a more diverse group of participants , more young people or those in favor of tighter market competition would no doubt have extolled the benefits of flexible employment terms , for example , or the importance of profits and shareholder value above all else .

therefore , i tried to be careful when i planned the conference .

several more round-table discussions of this kind will follow in bonn , he said .
and it 's hoped that as the discussions develop , the participants will start being able to turn their words into deeds , wherever they work and whatever they do . " to meet like-minded people merely makes me all the more determined to stay on the same path and to encourage others to support work ethics which imply reliability and a sense of responsibility instead of a craving for power or money , " patt concluded . svenja üing -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?

but the choice of participants was a deliberate one , said conference host mörbel .
changing words into deeds " we chose certain topics to get the dialogue started in the first place , " he said .
" if you want to include too many contrasting viewpoints , you can easily overload such a meeting .
therefore , i tried to be careful when i planned the conference .
but maybe i was too careful . " for mörbel , the conference was a starting point .
several more round-table discussions of this kind will follow in bonn , he said .
and it 's hoped that as the discussions develop , the participants will start being able to turn their words into deeds , wherever they work and whatever they do . " to meet like-minded people merely makes me all the more determined to stay on the same path and to encourage others to support work ethics which imply reliability and a sense of responsibility instead of a craving for power or money , " patt concluded . svenja üing -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?

and after it was already delayed once because of sharon 's illness and foreign minister steinmeier 's cancellation of his visit due to a german intelligence service scandal , it was important that angela merkel went there .

meanwhile angela merkel called iran " a threat " to democracy on sunday . iran 's foreign ministry insisted on sunday that the only solution to the standoff with the west over its nuclear program is through negotiations and not a referral to the united nations security council .
tehran threatened to halt " all voluntary cooperation " with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- if the west decides to pass the case on to the un . tehran , which decided to resume uranium enrichment research despite international objection , has defended its nuclear activity saying it only wants to make fuel for civil atomic power .
the west fears the project masks a secret nuclear weapons program . " all our friends in europe and the iaea board know the islamic republic 's position : referring the case to or informing the un security council will lead to iran stopping all voluntary cooperation , " foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told a news conference . the west , however , is sticking to its hard line that a draft composed by britain , france and germany at an emergency meeting in london on monday includes the suggestion to ask the iaea to refer the matter to the security council .
although the eu trio has spent two and a half years negotiating with tehran over its atomic program , they say time is running out and are seriously considering putting the issue up for a vote on economic sanctions . merkel gets tough and calls iran a threat to democratic world in germany , where politicians have been cautious on the issue , the rhetoric became audibly more stringent over the weekend with chancellor angela merkel taking the hardest line yet in her words on the issue . merkel said at the start of her first visit to israel on sunday that iran threatens not only the jewish state but the entire democratic world .
" iran is not just a threat to israel , but also to the democratic countries of this world . " adding that both germany and israel shared the same view on iran 's ambitions , merkel said : " i do n't see the slightest difference in the views of germany and israel .
it is clear that iran should not get the ability to enrich uranium . " merkel also condemned iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad for his anti-israeli remarks .
ahmadinejad has said the jewish state should be " wiped off the map " and doubted that six million jews had been killed by the nazis during world war ii .
" it 's unacceptable that iran 's president rejects and falsifies history , " she said . acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert thanked merkel for supporting israel on the question of iran 's nuclear program .
" i would ... like to thank you for your position on iran .
it is a topic that causes great concern here in israel , " he said . a case for sanctions ? earlier at the weekend , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier suggested a tougher german line by saying it would be unwise to rule out economic sanctions . in an interview with the german weekly magazine der spiegel , the minister said " the latest signals from tehran are contradictory at best . "
he added : " i 'm aware of the criticisms that iran is using tricks and playing for time – and i ca n't seriously deny them . " german defense minister franz josef jung also left open the possibility of sanctions .
speaking to the frankfurter allgemeinen sonntagszeitung , he said if russia and china went along with the strategy , economic sanctions could be effective in convincing iran to give up its " obvious intentions of developing atomic weapons . " iran calls for diplomacy in a last-ditch effort to avoid a un referral and sanctions , iran called for talks with britain , france and germany in brussels on monday .
javad vaeedi , deputy head of iran 's supreme national security council , will meet diplomats from the eu-3 . " europeans should be patient and try to find a formula to resolve this nuclear issue , " said foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi .
" we are determined to remove any ambiguities over our nuclear ambitions and also protect our right .

" the document came about because of " a series of worrying events -lrb- that -rrb- has recently taken place in a number of member states , " such as bans on gay pride marches , hate speeches by political and religious leaders , breaking up of demonstrations by police , homophobic violence and constitutional amendments prohibiting same-sex unions . catholic leaders immediately criticized the resolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church opposes violence against gays but does not support gay unions " the declaration shows an aversion for certain values of our tradition , notably religious values , " aldo giordano , the secretary-general of the council of european bishops ' conferences , told vatican radio .
" such resolutions risk delegitimizing the european parliament .
it should be clear that certain subjects , especially those relating to the family , are not within the direct competence of the european union but are the recognized competence of nations . " that argument was echoed by those opposing the resolution in parliament . " i think that this is a case of europe getting involved in things that are none of europe 's business , " said angelika niebler , one of 27 conservative german members of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- who voted against the declaration . an essential reaction to homophobia ? while an eu directive requires member states to protect gay people against discrimination regarding employment , national laws vary widely in other areas .
while a range of countries , including belgium , britain , denmark , france , germany and spain , have legalized gay civil unions , others are far from doing so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia is not the most gay-friendly place in europe in latvia , for example , the eu anti-discrimination directive has not been implemented and a constitutional amendment defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman . " the situation is a bleak one , " said ilze brands kehris , the director of the latvian center for human rights and ethnic studies .
" it 's absolutely essential that we have these kinds of reactions internationally . " she added that her country 's young democracy still had a lot to learn . " the soviet period blocked any kind of development on tolerance issues , " she said .
" you have to activate civil society in coalition with the international signals to bring change over time in latvia . " will actions follow ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and pope benedict xvi have similar views on gay marriage in poland , where president lech kaczynski barred gay pride marches during his tenure as mayor of warsaw and prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz called for state protection against homosexual " contamination " of society , gay rights activists also said they had high hopes for the resolution . " when you hear from the prime minister that homosexuality is abnormal , that we should be cured , that they will try to cure us by force , this is quite frightening , " said robert biedron , the head of warsaw-based campaign against homophobia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel mention gay rights next time she meets marcinkiewicz ?
" i think that this resolution is very important for new european member states as a reminder on which way the new democracies should go , " he added . but while welcoming the resolution , german gay rights activist jörg litwinschuh said it 's only worth something if actions follow . " if nothing changes , sanctions have to happen , " he said , adding that his initiative queer nations would also lobby chancellor angela merkel to address discrimination against gay people in her meetings with foreign leaders . recognizing the nazis ' gay victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will resemble the one fore jewish holocaust victims litwinschuh is the executive director of a consortium of german scientists and celebrities that plans to reopen the magnus hirschfeld institute , the first center to study homosexuality , which was destroyed by the nazis in 1933 . he said that he was particularly pleased that the resolution also called on " member states concerned finally to accord full recognition to homosexuals as targets and victims of the nazi regime . " a big step in that direction was already taken last week , when berlin announced plans to build a national memorial for homosexuals persecuted by the nazis . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to build memorial to gays persecuted by nazis the berlin government has given the go-ahead for a memorial designed by a scandinavian artist-duo in central berlin commemorating thousands of homosexuals persecuted by nazi germany .

" they have been a terrorist organization .

" they have been a terrorist organization .
they have to change their methods and they have to accept that violence is incompatible with democracy , " solana told afp as he arrived for a day of talks in brussels . " they have to also recognize israel , because in the end what we are trying to do is construct a two-state model and to do that , you have to talk to the other , " he added . the brussels meeting is the first chance for the 25-nation bloc 's ministers to talk since the long-ruling fatah faction lost last week 's palestinian elections to hamas . the eu is unlikely to take any rash decisions .
diplomats stress it has time while waiting for a palestinian government to be formed , and in the meantime palestinian authority head mahmoud abbas remains its key contact . " we would like very much to support president abbas at this period of time , " said solana .
" this is what we are going to do today . " us looks to eu for resolve the united states expects europe to show as much resolve with hamas as it has in vowing to cut aid to the palestinians if the radical islamic group fails to renounce violence , us secretary of state condoleezza rice said on sunday .

meanwhile angela merkel called iran " a threat " to democracy on sunday . iran 's foreign ministry insisted on sunday that the only solution to the standoff with the west over its nuclear program is through negotiations and not a referral to the united nations security council .
tehran threatened to halt " all voluntary cooperation " with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- if the west decides to pass the case on to the un . tehran , which decided to resume uranium enrichment research despite international objection , has defended its nuclear activity saying it only wants to make fuel for civil atomic power .
the west fears the project masks a secret nuclear weapons program . " all our friends in europe and the iaea board know the islamic republic 's position : referring the case to or informing the un security council will lead to iran stopping all voluntary cooperation , " foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told a news conference . the west , however , is sticking to its hard line that a draft composed by britain , france and germany at an emergency meeting in london on monday includes the suggestion to ask the iaea to refer the matter to the security council .
although the eu trio has spent two and a half years negotiating with tehran over its atomic program , they say time is running out and are seriously considering putting the issue up for a vote on economic sanctions . merkel gets tough and calls iran a threat to democratic world in germany , where politicians have been cautious on the issue , the rhetoric became audibly more stringent over the weekend with chancellor angela merkel taking the hardest line yet in her words on the issue . merkel said at the start of her first visit to israel on sunday that iran threatens not only the jewish state but the entire democratic world .
" iran is not just a threat to israel , but also to the democratic countries of this world . " adding that both germany and israel shared the same view on iran 's ambitions , merkel said : " i do n't see the slightest difference in the views of germany and israel .
it is clear that iran should not get the ability to enrich uranium . " merkel also condemned iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad for his anti-israeli remarks .
ahmadinejad has said the jewish state should be " wiped off the map " and doubted that six million jews had been killed by the nazis during world war ii .
" it 's unacceptable that iran 's president rejects and falsifies history , " she said . acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert thanked merkel for supporting israel on the question of iran 's nuclear program .
" i would ... like to thank you for your position on iran .
it is a topic that causes great concern here in israel , " he said . a case for sanctions ? earlier at the weekend , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier suggested a tougher german line by saying it would be unwise to rule out economic sanctions . in an interview with the german weekly magazine der spiegel , the minister said " the latest signals from tehran are contradictory at best . "
he added : " i 'm aware of the criticisms that iran is using tricks and playing for time – and i ca n't seriously deny them . " german defense minister franz josef jung also left open the possibility of sanctions .
speaking to the frankfurter allgemeinen sonntagszeitung , he said if russia and china went along with the strategy , economic sanctions could be effective in convincing iran to give up its " obvious intentions of developing atomic weapons . " iran calls for diplomacy in a last-ditch effort to avoid a un referral and sanctions , iran called for talks with britain , france and germany in brussels on monday .
javad vaeedi , deputy head of iran 's supreme national security council , will meet diplomats from the eu-3 . " europeans should be patient and try to find a formula to resolve this nuclear issue , " said foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi .
" we are determined to remove any ambiguities over our nuclear ambitions and also protect our right . " in the past iran has repeatedly said it would never abandon its drive to enrich uranium – a necessary step for developing nuclear power reactors and , when highly enriched , nuclear bombs . the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors will hear arguments on feb .

28 , 2006 -rrb- in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia as diplomatic efforts to curb iran 's nuclear ambitions near the un , the european powers are working to ensure tehran 's compliance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.01.2006 the ethics of success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers and the unemployed should be made to feel like more than just cattle business people and church leaders met in bonn to discuss work ethics in today 's achievement-oriented society at a time when increasing numbers of germans feel like failures or have low esteem because they 're unemployed . the german economy has been struggling through several tough years now , but experts are now starting to talk about a light at the end of the tunnel .
if you talk to people on the street , though , it 's a very different story .
many still ca n't seem to imagine that things will improve any time soon .
and the main reason for this skepticism is germany 's ailing job market . more than 4.5 million germans are unemployed .
others only have temporary jobs or work for little or no money .
and the result is not only that increasing numbers of people feel like failures or have low self-esteem , but that those lucky enough to be employed are under greater pressure than ever before . " what counts today is how you assert yourself , how you 're able compete on the market , how loud you are , " said anke patt , a journalist who has recently started her own business .
" and sometimes it counts how good you are at fitting in and swimming with the current . " after world war ii , and especially during the 1960s and 1970s , having a job in germany usually meant that you would start working for a certain company in your late teens or 20s , that you climbed up the career ladder step by step , and that you stayed with that same company throughout your working life .
it was a time of growing social and job security .
but all this has changed dramatically and irreversibly . as a result , many germans feel insecure and fear they will be failures in life .
a major german protestant think tank recently invited a group of business people and church leaders to take a deeper look at the problem and discuss the necessity of work ethics in today 's working environment . profession vs. job " we 've realized that we are n't in touch with business people anymore , " said protestant theologian peter mörbel , the conference 's host .
" we do n't know enough about the new working world , about the service society , for example .
the church 's idea of the business world is still strongly influenced by the ideas of industry and agriculture .
we now have to get to know the new branches .
that 's why we get together and talk about topics that are important to both , the business world and the church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aiming for a job - or for a profession ? at the heart of the round-table discussions were two words : beruf , or " profession , " and " job . " " germans understand the term ' job ' simply as an opportunity to earn a living , something you do for a short while , without having any ties and maybe even without having to take any responsibility , " explained manfred kock , former head of the german protestant church .
" in contrast to that , a profession is something that has to do with your talents and interests that you have either through fate , genes , parents or god .
what can i do with these gifts ?
how can i use them to serve a good purpose ? " instead , kock said , most people today just go to work so that they can pay their rent , food and holiday expenses - they have a job , not a profession .
and this is totally understandable , he said : at a time when employees seem little more than statistics or another cost to companies and when hundreds or thousands of people at the same company regularly lose their jobs , people are no longer willing to put their heart and soul into their work .
this creates a lack of commitment and solidarity from both the company and their employees . it 's part of the church 's responsibility to confront and discuss these sore points , according to kock . " i believe the economy needs to be tamed by what we call duty and responsibility , " he said .
" the economy only works well when it 's standing on both legs : when companies make enough money , and when they are , at the same time , committed to the people for whom they are doing the business . "
success is more than money for andreas rohde , a young lawyer and spokesman for wirtschaftsjunioren bonn , the junior chamber of commerce in bonn , this kind of work ethic has a clear and direct impact on the work he does himself . " i see my clients and my employees as human beings and not just as a work force or as someone who will pay me a fee for the work i do , " said rohde " of course , there 's always the dilemma of how to deal with certain financial rules and expectations , which i - as a christian - do n't like .
sometimes i have to just bite the bullet and refuse certain orders . " charity begins at home , he said .
but it should n't end at the door to your office .
so for rohde , there 's a lot more to success than just making a lot of money .
and although much of the business world probably would n't share this point of view , his fellow conference participants agreed with him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the workplace has become ever more stressful a more diverse group of participants , more young people or those in favor of tighter market competition would no doubt have extolled the benefits of flexible employment terms , for example , or the importance of profits and shareholder value above all else .
but the choice of participants was a deliberate one , said conference host mörbel .
changing words into deeds " we chose certain topics to get the dialogue started in the first place , " he said .
" if you want to include too many contrasting viewpoints , you can easily overload such a meeting .
therefore , i tried to be careful when i planned the conference .
but maybe i was too careful . " for mörbel , the conference was a starting point .
several more round-table discussions of this kind will follow in bonn , he said .
and it 's hoped that as the discussions develop , the participants will start being able to turn their words into deeds , wherever they work and whatever they do . " to meet like-minded people merely makes me all the more determined to stay on the same path and to encourage others to support work ethics which imply reliability and a sense of responsibility instead of a craving for power or money , " patt concluded . svenja üing -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?

" the economy only works well when it 's standing on both legs : when companies make enough money , and when they are , at the same time , committed to the people for whom they are doing the business . "
success is more than money for andreas rohde , a young lawyer and spokesman for wirtschaftsjunioren bonn , the junior chamber of commerce in bonn , this kind of work ethic has a clear and direct impact on the work he does himself . " i see my clients and my employees as human beings and not just as a work force or as someone who will pay me a fee for the work i do , " said rohde " of course , there 's always the dilemma of how to deal with certain financial rules and expectations , which i - as a christian - do n't like .
sometimes i have to just bite the bullet and refuse certain orders . " charity begins at home , he said .
but it should n't end at the door to your office .
so for rohde , there 's a lot more to success than just making a lot of money .
and although much of the business world probably would n't share this point of view , his fellow conference participants agreed with him .

if you talk to people on the street , though , it 's a very different story .
many still ca n't seem to imagine that things will improve any time soon .
and the main reason for this skepticism is germany 's ailing job market . more than 4.5 million germans are unemployed .
others only have temporary jobs or work for little or no money .
and the result is not only that increasing numbers of people feel like failures or have low self-esteem , but that those lucky enough to be employed are under greater pressure than ever before . " what counts today is how you assert yourself , how you 're able compete on the market , how loud you are , " said anke patt , a journalist who has recently started her own business .
" and sometimes it counts how good you are at fitting in and swimming with the current . " after world war ii , and especially during the 1960s and 1970s , having a job in germany usually meant that you would start working for a certain company in your late teens or 20s , that you climbed up the career ladder step by step , and that you stayed with that same company throughout your working life .
it was a time of growing social and job security .
but all this has changed dramatically and irreversibly . as a result , many germans feel insecure and fear they will be failures in life .
a major german protestant think tank recently invited a group of business people and church leaders to take a deeper look at the problem and discuss the necessity of work ethics in today 's working environment . profession vs. job " we 've realized that we are n't in touch with business people anymore , " said protestant theologian peter mörbel , the conference 's host .
" we do n't know enough about the new working world , about the service society , for example .
the church 's idea of the business world is still strongly influenced by the ideas of industry and agriculture .
we now have to get to know the new branches .
that 's why we get together and talk about topics that are important to both , the business world and the church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aiming for a job - or for a profession ? at the heart of the round-table discussions were two words : beruf , or " profession , " and " job . " " germans understand the term ' job ' simply as an opportunity to earn a living , something you do for a short while , without having any ties and maybe even without having to take any responsibility , " explained manfred kock , former head of the german protestant church .
" in contrast to that , a profession is something that has to do with your talents and interests that you have either through fate , genes , parents or god .
what can i do with these gifts ?
how can i use them to serve a good purpose ? " instead , kock said , most people today just go to work so that they can pay their rent , food and holiday expenses - they have a job , not a profession .
and this is totally understandable , he said : at a time when employees seem little more than statistics or another cost to companies and when hundreds or thousands of people at the same company regularly lose their jobs , people are no longer willing to put their heart and soul into their work .
this creates a lack of commitment and solidarity from both the company and their employees . it 's part of the church 's responsibility to confront and discuss these sore points , according to kock . " i believe the economy needs to be tamed by what we call duty and responsibility , " he said .
" the economy only works well when it 's standing on both legs : when companies make enough money , and when they are , at the same time , committed to the people for whom they are doing the business . "

if you talk to people on the street , though , it 's a very different story .
many still ca n't seem to imagine that things will improve any time soon .
and the main reason for this skepticism is germany 's ailing job market . more than 4.5 million germans are unemployed .
others only have temporary jobs or work for little or no money .
and the result is not only that increasing numbers of people feel like failures or have low self-esteem , but that those lucky enough to be employed are under greater pressure than ever before . " what counts today is how you assert yourself , how you 're able compete on the market , how loud you are , " said anke patt , a journalist who has recently started her own business .
" and sometimes it counts how good you are at fitting in and swimming with the current . " after world war ii , and especially during the 1960s and 1970s , having a job in germany usually meant that you would start working for a certain company in your late teens or 20s , that you climbed up the career ladder step by step , and that you stayed with that same company throughout your working life .
it was a time of growing social and job security .
but all this has changed dramatically and irreversibly . as a result , many germans feel insecure and fear they will be failures in life .
a major german protestant think tank recently invited a group of business people and church leaders to take a deeper look at the problem and discuss the necessity of work ethics in today 's working environment . profession vs. job " we 've realized that we are n't in touch with business people anymore , " said protestant theologian peter mörbel , the conference 's host .
" we do n't know enough about the new working world , about the service society , for example .
the church 's idea of the business world is still strongly influenced by the ideas of industry and agriculture .
we now have to get to know the new branches .
that 's why we get together and talk about topics that are important to both , the business world and the church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aiming for a job - or for a profession ? at the heart of the round-table discussions were two words : beruf , or " profession , " and " job . " " germans understand the term ' job ' simply as an opportunity to earn a living , something you do for a short while , without having any ties and maybe even without having to take any responsibility , " explained manfred kock , former head of the german protestant church .
" in contrast to that , a profession is something that has to do with your talents and interests that you have either through fate , genes , parents or god .
what can i do with these gifts ?
how can i use them to serve a good purpose ? " instead , kock said , most people today just go to work so that they can pay their rent , food and holiday expenses - they have a job , not a profession .
and this is totally understandable , he said : at a time when employees seem little more than statistics or another cost to companies and when hundreds or thousands of people at the same company regularly lose their jobs , people are no longer willing to put their heart and soul into their work .
this creates a lack of commitment and solidarity from both the company and their employees . it 's part of the church 's responsibility to confront and discuss these sore points , according to kock . " i believe the economy needs to be tamed by what we call duty and responsibility , " he said .
" the economy only works well when it 's standing on both legs : when companies make enough money , and when they are , at the same time , committed to the people for whom they are doing the business . "
success is more than money for andreas rohde , a young lawyer and spokesman for wirtschaftsjunioren bonn , the junior chamber of commerce in bonn , this kind of work ethic has a clear and direct impact on the work he does himself . " i see my clients and my employees as human beings and not just as a work force or as someone who will pay me a fee for the work i do , " said rohde " of course , there 's always the dilemma of how to deal with certain financial rules and expectations , which i - as a christian - do n't like .
sometimes i have to just bite the bullet and refuse certain orders . " charity begins at home , he said .
but it should n't end at the door to your office .
so for rohde , there 's a lot more to success than just making a lot of money .
and although much of the business world probably would n't share this point of view , his fellow conference participants agreed with him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the workplace has become ever more stressful a more diverse group of participants , more young people or those in favor of tighter market competition would no doubt have extolled the benefits of flexible employment terms , for example , or the importance of profits and shareholder value above all else .
but the choice of participants was a deliberate one , said conference host mörbel .
changing words into deeds " we chose certain topics to get the dialogue started in the first place , " he said .
" if you want to include too many contrasting viewpoints , you can easily overload such a meeting .
therefore , i tried to be careful when i planned the conference .
but maybe i was too careful . " for mörbel , the conference was a starting point .
several more round-table discussions of this kind will follow in bonn , he said .
and it 's hoped that as the discussions develop , the participants will start being able to turn their words into deeds , wherever they work and whatever they do . " to meet like-minded people merely makes me all the more determined to stay on the same path and to encourage others to support work ethics which imply reliability and a sense of responsibility instead of a craving for power or money , " patt concluded . svenja üing -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?

" we have reiterated our belief and our attachment to the freedom of the press and freedom of expression as part of our fundamental values , " austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik told journalists monday after chairing a meeting with her european union colleagues . " we have equally referred to the religious beliefs that are to be respected in our societies as fundamental values as well , " she added . cartoons portraying the prophet mohammed wearing a time-bomb shaped turban , published in a danish newspaper last september and reprinted in a norwegian magazine in january , have sparked uproar in the muslim world where images of the prophet are considered blasphemous . the row has taken a new dimension over the past days , with danish flags being burnt , products being boycotted and copenhagen starting to take measures to protect its citizens living in muslim countries . plassnik said that the eu " strongly rejects " threats to its citizens and that : " we do hope that this issue can be solved through constructive dialogue between the parties involved " . eu foreign policy chief javier solana insisted that the eu did not want to hurt anybody . " we have condemned any expression or acts that attempt to demonize any religion and that is what we try to convey to the leaders of the arab world -lrb- and -rrb- the islamic world , " he added . muslim boycott of danish products egypt 's powerful opposition muslim brotherhood on monday was the latest group to join a chorus of calls for the boycott of danish and norwegian products . the incident has threatened to deal an unprecedented blow to the muslim and arab world 's usually healthy relations with scandinavian governments , who are major donors in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sorry we do n't sell products made in denmark " reads a sign in a supermarket in saudi arabia retailers in the gulf have already started pulling danish and norwegian products off the shelves and danish manufacturers have voiced their concern should the boycott gain further momentum . " double standards " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson warned a saudi official during a meeting in the swiss ski resort of davos that any boycott of danish products was tantamount to a boycott of european goods . mandelson 's spokesman warned riyadh it could have to take the matter to the world trade organisation if the saudi government encouraged the boycott . arab league secretary general amr mussa , in tunis for a meeting of arab interior ministers , decried the " double standards " in the european media . " we see double standards in the european media , which is fearful of being accused of anti-semitism but which invokes freedom of expression for a caricature on islam , " mussa told reporters . most arab governments have vocally condemned the series of 12 cartoons , which show the prophet as a wild-eyed knife-wielding bedouin flanked by two women shrouded in black . attacks against eu offices libya announced sunday it had decided to close its diplomatic representation in copenhagen " in light of the attacks against the prophet mohammed and the silence of the danish authorities . " in a further step , the arab league and the organisation of the islamic conference have announced their intention to seek a un resolution banning attacks against religious beliefs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palestinian militant cradles his weapon next to the eu building in the gaza strip in the gaza strip , masked palestinian gunmen carrying rocket launchers demonstrated in front of eu offices monday and warned they would prevent danes and norwegians from entering the territory until copenhagen apologized .
at another gaza demonstration , protestors burned the danish flag . denmark wo n't apologize the danish government has said the views expressed by the jyllands-posten newspaper did not reflect its own but has consistently refused to apologize and has insisted it would defend freedom of expression . an official from a danish dairy products company said two of its salespersons were molested in saudi arabia , in the holy muslim city of mecca . the danish government " vigorously condemns these attacks as well as the fact that danish flags have been burnt in the arab world and expects the governments of these countries to do the same , " danish foreign minister per stig moeller said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palestinian child steps on a danish national flag , as a sign of disrespect in an internet statement whose authenticity could not be verified , an iraqi insurgent group - the army of mujahedeen -lrb- holy warriors -rrb- - called on its members to attack any reachable danish and norwegian targets . the danish foreign ministry issued a warning to its nationals in seven arab countries to be extra vigilant , while the danish branch of the red cross said it had evacuated two of its aid workers in gaza and one in yemen . the cartoons have triggered one of scandinavia 's most serious diplomatic incidents in recent years but a poll published over the weekend showed that most danes felt their government should not apologize over the cartoons . arab newspapers have frequently been criticized for carrying anti-semitic opinions and cartoons . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel warns palestinians over hamas german chancellor angela merkel on monday warned that berlin would cut funding to a hamas-led palestinian authority unless the radical islamist group renounced violence .

the stars will be out in full force though . keeping in mind last year 's sex-and porn-themed berlin film festival which spurred at least one tabloid to dub it " sexinale , " berlinale director dieter kosslick is skirting clear of controversy this time . speaking at a packed press conference in berlin on monday , kosslick said the festival , which runs from feb .

" but this time , if there is a trend , then it 's definitely political .
all around the world , there 's a very strong tendency of political cinema , one that 's close to reality and shows a tough world , and i 'm glad that the berlinale is taking part in it . " the political theme runs through almost all sections of the berlinale this time .
" syriana , " a political thriller starring george clooney is being screened out of competition .
" bye bye berlusconi ! " a satire by jan henrik stahlberg will feature in the panorama section and british michael winterbottom 's " the road to guantanamo " about three muslims held up at the us lockup in cuba will show in the competition section . asked whether the latter was a comment on the iraq war and us policies , kosslick said it was rather " a statement for human rights . " if i had my way , then i 'd meet the 450 guantanamo inmates , who are being held there in violation of every human right and are tortured , on the red carpet during the screening of the film , " kosslick added .

but chancellor angela merkel may have gone a bit too far during her visit to jerusalem , according to dw 's peter philipp . ahead of her middle east visit , the chancellor already showed that she knows how to act on the diplomatic stage and that she 's not intimidated by difficult situations .
in jerusalem , she confirmed this impression again , although the timing for merkel 's visit was awkward : israeli prime minister sharon is still in a coma ; the election campaign has started ; the radical islamic hamas has been elected in the palestinian territories ; and the dispute over iran 's nuclear ambitions is smoldering in the background . that 's reason enough to delay a courtesy call .
but a german head of government 's debut visit in israel is part of the ritual between the two countries .
and after it was already delayed once because of sharon 's illness and foreign minister steinmeier 's cancellation of his visit due to a german intelligence service scandal , it was important that angela merkel went there .
what was more important was what she - as the first foreign politician to visit since the palestinian election - had to say about the vote : hamas must recognize israel 's right to exist , renounce violence and accept the peace process .
otherwise , foreign - especially european - support would be unthinkable .
the message does n't only stem from germany 's special relationship to israel , but also from foreign countries ' genuine concern about continuation of the peace process .

" the document came about because of " a series of worrying events -lrb- that -rrb- has recently taken place in a number of member states , " such as bans on gay pride marches , hate speeches by political and religious leaders , breaking up of demonstrations by police , homophobic violence and constitutional amendments prohibiting same-sex unions . catholic leaders immediately criticized the resolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church opposes violence against gays but does not support gay unions " the declaration shows an aversion for certain values of our tradition , notably religious values , " aldo giordano , the secretary-general of the council of european bishops ' conferences , told vatican radio .
" such resolutions risk delegitimizing the european parliament .
it should be clear that certain subjects , especially those relating to the family , are not within the direct competence of the european union but are the recognized competence of nations . " that argument was echoed by those opposing the resolution in parliament . " i think that this is a case of europe getting involved in things that are none of europe 's business , " said angelika niebler , one of 27 conservative german members of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- who voted against the declaration . an essential reaction to homophobia ? while an eu directive requires member states to protect gay people against discrimination regarding employment , national laws vary widely in other areas .
while a range of countries , including belgium , britain , denmark , france , germany and spain , have legalized gay civil unions , others are far from doing so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia is not the most gay-friendly place in europe in latvia , for example , the eu anti-discrimination directive has not been implemented and a constitutional amendment defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman . " the situation is a bleak one , " said ilze brands kehris , the director of the latvian center for human rights and ethnic studies .
" it 's absolutely essential that we have these kinds of reactions internationally . " she added that her country 's young democracy still had a lot to learn . " the soviet period blocked any kind of development on tolerance issues , " she said .
" you have to activate civil society in coalition with the international signals to bring change over time in latvia . " will actions follow ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and pope benedict xvi have similar views on gay marriage in poland , where president lech kaczynski barred gay pride marches during his tenure as mayor of warsaw and prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz called for state protection against homosexual " contamination " of society , gay rights activists also said they had high hopes for the resolution . " when you hear from the prime minister that homosexuality is abnormal , that we should be cured , that they will try to cure us by force , this is quite frightening , " said robert biedron , the head of warsaw-based campaign against homophobia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel mention gay rights next time she meets marcinkiewicz ?
" i think that this resolution is very important for new european member states as a reminder on which way the new democracies should go , " he added . but while welcoming the resolution , german gay rights activist jörg litwinschuh said it 's only worth something if actions follow . " if nothing changes , sanctions have to happen , " he said , adding that his initiative queer nations would also lobby chancellor angela merkel to address discrimination against gay people in her meetings with foreign leaders . recognizing the nazis ' gay victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will resemble the one fore jewish holocaust victims litwinschuh is the executive director of a consortium of german scientists and celebrities that plans to reopen the magnus hirschfeld institute , the first center to study homosexuality , which was destroyed by the nazis in 1933 . he said that he was particularly pleased that the resolution also called on " member states concerned finally to accord full recognition to homosexuals as targets and victims of the nazi regime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.01.2006 european parliamentarians stand up against homophobia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still not embraced by all of europe religious leaders and conservatives rejected the european parliament 's resolution against homophobia , but others hailed it as an important signal to eu countries where gays and lesbians still face discrimination . an overwhelming majority of eu parliamentarians adopted the resolution , which urges member states to grant gay people " the same respect , dignity and protection as the rest of society . " the document came about because of " a series of worrying events -lrb- that -rrb- has recently taken place in a number of member states , " such as bans on gay pride marches , hate speeches by political and religious leaders , breaking up of demonstrations by police , homophobic violence and constitutional amendments prohibiting same-sex unions . catholic leaders immediately criticized the resolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church opposes violence against gays but does not support gay unions " the declaration shows an aversion for certain values of our tradition , notably religious values , " aldo giordano , the secretary-general of the council of european bishops ' conferences , told vatican radio .
" such resolutions risk delegitimizing the european parliament .
it should be clear that certain subjects , especially those relating to the family , are not within the direct competence of the european union but are the recognized competence of nations . " that argument was echoed by those opposing the resolution in parliament . " i think that this is a case of europe getting involved in things that are none of europe 's business , " said angelika niebler , one of 27 conservative german members of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- who voted against the declaration . an essential reaction to homophobia ? while an eu directive requires member states to protect gay people against discrimination regarding employment , national laws vary widely in other areas .
while a range of countries , including belgium , britain , denmark , france , germany and spain , have legalized gay civil unions , others are far from doing so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia is not the most gay-friendly place in europe in latvia , for example , the eu anti-discrimination directive has not been implemented and a constitutional amendment defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman . " the situation is a bleak one , " said ilze brands kehris , the director of the latvian center for human rights and ethnic studies .
" it 's absolutely essential that we have these kinds of reactions internationally . " she added that her country 's young democracy still had a lot to learn . " the soviet period blocked any kind of development on tolerance issues , " she said .
" you have to activate civil society in coalition with the international signals to bring change over time in latvia . " will actions follow ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and pope benedict xvi have similar views on gay marriage in poland , where president lech kaczynski barred gay pride marches during his tenure as mayor of warsaw and prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz called for state protection against homosexual " contamination " of society , gay rights activists also said they had high hopes for the resolution . " when you hear from the prime minister that homosexuality is abnormal , that we should be cured , that they will try to cure us by force , this is quite frightening , " said robert biedron , the head of warsaw-based campaign against homophobia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel mention gay rights next time she meets marcinkiewicz ?
" i think that this resolution is very important for new european member states as a reminder on which way the new democracies should go , " he added . but while welcoming the resolution , german gay rights activist jörg litwinschuh said it 's only worth something if actions follow . " if nothing changes , sanctions have to happen , " he said , adding that his initiative queer nations would also lobby chancellor angela merkel to address discrimination against gay people in her meetings with foreign leaders . recognizing the nazis ' gay victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will resemble the one fore jewish holocaust victims litwinschuh is the executive director of a consortium of german scientists and celebrities that plans to reopen the magnus hirschfeld institute , the first center to study homosexuality , which was destroyed by the nazis in 1933 . he said that he was particularly pleased that the resolution also called on " member states concerned finally to accord full recognition to homosexuals as targets and victims of the nazi regime . " a big step in that direction was already taken last week , when berlin announced plans to build a national memorial for homosexuals persecuted by the nazis . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to build memorial to gays persecuted by nazis the berlin government has given the go-ahead for a memorial designed by a scandinavian artist-duo in central berlin commemorating thousands of homosexuals persecuted by nazi germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.01.2006 opinion : merkel misses the mark in middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor may have gone too far while in jerusalem solidarity with israel may be second nature to germany .
but chancellor angela merkel may have gone a bit too far during her visit to jerusalem , according to dw 's peter philipp . ahead of her middle east visit , the chancellor already showed that she knows how to act on the diplomatic stage and that she 's not intimidated by difficult situations .
in jerusalem , she confirmed this impression again , although the timing for merkel 's visit was awkward : israeli prime minister sharon is still in a coma ; the election campaign has started ; the radical islamic hamas has been elected in the palestinian territories ; and the dispute over iran 's nuclear ambitions is smoldering in the background . that 's reason enough to delay a courtesy call .
but a german head of government 's debut visit in israel is part of the ritual between the two countries .
and after it was already delayed once because of sharon 's illness and foreign minister steinmeier 's cancellation of his visit due to a german intelligence service scandal , it was important that angela merkel went there .
what was more important was what she - as the first foreign politician to visit since the palestinian election - had to say about the vote : hamas must recognize israel 's right to exist , renounce violence and accept the peace process .
otherwise , foreign - especially european - support would be unthinkable .
the message does n't only stem from germany 's special relationship to israel , but also from foreign countries ' genuine concern about continuation of the peace process .
back in time ?
hamas ' election victory threatens to turn back the wheels of history , and aid to the palestinians could - as it was before the oslo accords - be construed once again as supporting the fight against israel .
the europeans wo n't allow that .
who could be more apt than than angela merkel to say that , as germany contributes the biggest chunk of the eu 's 500 million euros -lrb- $ 609 million -rrb- in aid to the palestinians ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president has provoked outrage in west with his comments but in another respect , the chancellor may have gone a bit too far in her solidarity with israel .
however , the europeans ' lack of a concept in dealing with the question of iran 's nuclear policy may be to blame .
although the europeans fluctuate between criticism , threat and coaxing , merkel said that iran was a " threat to the democratic countries of this earth . "
she surely reflected israeli beliefs , but her comments missed the mark .
criticism is certainly warranted of iranian president ahmadinejad 's diatribes against israel as well as his unspeakable remarks about the holocaust .
and to a certain degree , distrust towards tehran 's real nuclear plans may be warranted .
however , iran is not a danger to democracy worldwide . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel warns palestinians over hamas angela merkel has used the second day of her middle east tour to call on leaders from both sides of the israeli-palestinian conflict to continue along the difficult path to peace .

30 , 2006 -rrb- eu says hamas must change to win its support hamas must change and renounce violence if it wants europe 's support , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday as eu foreign ministers met to discuss the militant group 's shock election win .

30 , 2006 -rrb- europe sticks to hard line on iran as merkel warns of threat iran has rejected the threat of a referral to the un security council , arguing that the only solution to the nuclear dispute is through negotiations .

if you talk to people on the street , though , it 's a very different story .
many still ca n't seem to imagine that things will improve any time soon .
and the main reason for this skepticism is germany 's ailing job market . more than 4.5 million germans are unemployed .
others only have temporary jobs or work for little or no money .
and the result is not only that increasing numbers of people feel like failures or have low self-esteem , but that those lucky enough to be employed are under greater pressure than ever before . " what counts today is how you assert yourself , how you 're able compete on the market , how loud you are , " said anke patt , a journalist who has recently started her own business .
" and sometimes it counts how good you are at fitting in and swimming with the current . " after world war ii , and especially during the 1960s and 1970s , having a job in germany usually meant that you would start working for a certain company in your late teens or 20s , that you climbed up the career ladder step by step , and that you stayed with that same company throughout your working life .
it was a time of growing social and job security .
but all this has changed dramatically and irreversibly . as a result , many germans feel insecure and fear they will be failures in life .
a major german protestant think tank recently invited a group of business people and church leaders to take a deeper look at the problem and discuss the necessity of work ethics in today 's working environment . profession vs. job " we 've realized that we are n't in touch with business people anymore , " said protestant theologian peter mörbel , the conference 's host .
" we do n't know enough about the new working world , about the service society , for example .
the church 's idea of the business world is still strongly influenced by the ideas of industry and agriculture .
we now have to get to know the new branches .
that 's why we get together and talk about topics that are important to both , the business world and the church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aiming for a job - or for a profession ? at the heart of the round-table discussions were two words : beruf , or " profession , " and " job . " " germans understand the term ' job ' simply as an opportunity to earn a living , something you do for a short while , without having any ties and maybe even without having to take any responsibility , " explained manfred kock , former head of the german protestant church .
" in contrast to that , a profession is something that has to do with your talents and interests that you have either through fate , genes , parents or god .
what can i do with these gifts ?
how can i use them to serve a good purpose ? " instead , kock said , most people today just go to work so that they can pay their rent , food and holiday expenses - they have a job , not a profession .
and this is totally understandable , he said : at a time when employees seem little more than statistics or another cost to companies and when hundreds or thousands of people at the same company regularly lose their jobs , people are no longer willing to put their heart and soul into their work .
this creates a lack of commitment and solidarity from both the company and their employees . it 's part of the church 's responsibility to confront and discuss these sore points , according to kock . " i believe the economy needs to be tamed by what we call duty and responsibility , " he said .
" the economy only works well when it 's standing on both legs : when companies make enough money , and when they are , at the same time , committed to the people for whom they are doing the business . "
success is more than money for andreas rohde , a young lawyer and spokesman for wirtschaftsjunioren bonn , the junior chamber of commerce in bonn , this kind of work ethic has a clear and direct impact on the work he does himself . " i see my clients and my employees as human beings and not just as a work force or as someone who will pay me a fee for the work i do , " said rohde " of course , there 's always the dilemma of how to deal with certain financial rules and expectations , which i - as a christian - do n't like .
sometimes i have to just bite the bullet and refuse certain orders . " charity begins at home , he said .
but it should n't end at the door to your office .
so for rohde , there 's a lot more to success than just making a lot of money .
and although much of the business world probably would n't share this point of view , his fellow conference participants agreed with him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the workplace has become ever more stressful a more diverse group of participants , more young people or those in favor of tighter market competition would no doubt have extolled the benefits of flexible employment terms , for example , or the importance of profits and shareholder value above all else .
but the choice of participants was a deliberate one , said conference host mörbel .
changing words into deeds " we chose certain topics to get the dialogue started in the first place , " he said .
" if you want to include too many contrasting viewpoints , you can easily overload such a meeting .
therefore , i tried to be careful when i planned the conference .
but maybe i was too careful . " for mörbel , the conference was a starting point .
several more round-table discussions of this kind will follow in bonn , he said .
and it 's hoped that as the discussions develop , the participants will start being able to turn their words into deeds , wherever they work and whatever they do . " to meet like-minded people merely makes me all the more determined to stay on the same path and to encourage others to support work ethics which imply reliability and a sense of responsibility instead of a craving for power or money , " patt concluded . svenja üing -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?

sometimes i have to just bite the bullet and refuse certain orders . " charity begins at home , he said .
but it should n't end at the door to your office .
so for rohde , there 's a lot more to success than just making a lot of money .
and although much of the business world probably would n't share this point of view , his fellow conference participants agreed with him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the workplace has become ever more stressful a more diverse group of participants , more young people or those in favor of tighter market competition would no doubt have extolled the benefits of flexible employment terms , for example , or the importance of profits and shareholder value above all else .
but the choice of participants was a deliberate one , said conference host mörbel .

" if you want to include too many contrasting viewpoints , you can easily overload such a meeting .
therefore , i tried to be careful when i planned the conference .
but maybe i was too careful . " for mörbel , the conference was a starting point .
several more round-table discussions of this kind will follow in bonn , he said .
and it 's hoped that as the discussions develop , the participants will start being able to turn their words into deeds , wherever they work and whatever they do . " to meet like-minded people merely makes me all the more determined to stay on the same path and to encourage others to support work ethics which imply reliability and a sense of responsibility instead of a craving for power or money , " patt concluded . svenja üing -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?

if you talk to people on the street , though , it 's a very different story .
many still ca n't seem to imagine that things will improve any time soon .
and the main reason for this skepticism is germany 's ailing job market . more than 4.5 million germans are unemployed .
others only have temporary jobs or work for little or no money .
and the result is not only that increasing numbers of people feel like failures or have low self-esteem , but that those lucky enough to be employed are under greater pressure than ever before . " what counts today is how you assert yourself , how you 're able compete on the market , how loud you are , " said anke patt , a journalist who has recently started her own business .
" and sometimes it counts how good you are at fitting in and swimming with the current . " after world war ii , and especially during the 1960s and 1970s , having a job in germany usually meant that you would start working for a certain company in your late teens or 20s , that you climbed up the career ladder step by step , and that you stayed with that same company throughout your working life .
it was a time of growing social and job security .
but all this has changed dramatically and irreversibly . as a result , many germans feel insecure and fear they will be failures in life .
a major german protestant think tank recently invited a group of business people and church leaders to take a deeper look at the problem and discuss the necessity of work ethics in today 's working environment . profession vs. job " we 've realized that we are n't in touch with business people anymore , " said protestant theologian peter mörbel , the conference 's host .
" we do n't know enough about the new working world , about the service society , for example .
the church 's idea of the business world is still strongly influenced by the ideas of industry and agriculture .
we now have to get to know the new branches .
that 's why we get together and talk about topics that are important to both , the business world and the church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aiming for a job - or for a profession ? at the heart of the round-table discussions were two words : beruf , or " profession , " and " job . " " germans understand the term ' job ' simply as an opportunity to earn a living , something you do for a short while , without having any ties and maybe even without having to take any responsibility , " explained manfred kock , former head of the german protestant church .
" in contrast to that , a profession is something that has to do with your talents and interests that you have either through fate , genes , parents or god .
what can i do with these gifts ?
how can i use them to serve a good purpose ? " instead , kock said , most people today just go to work so that they can pay their rent , food and holiday expenses - they have a job , not a profession .
and this is totally understandable , he said : at a time when employees seem little more than statistics or another cost to companies and when hundreds or thousands of people at the same company regularly lose their jobs , people are no longer willing to put their heart and soul into their work .
this creates a lack of commitment and solidarity from both the company and their employees . it 's part of the church 's responsibility to confront and discuss these sore points , according to kock . " i believe the economy needs to be tamed by what we call duty and responsibility , " he said .
" the economy only works well when it 's standing on both legs : when companies make enough money , and when they are , at the same time , committed to the people for whom they are doing the business . "
success is more than money for andreas rohde , a young lawyer and spokesman for wirtschaftsjunioren bonn , the junior chamber of commerce in bonn , this kind of work ethic has a clear and direct impact on the work he does himself . " i see my clients and my employees as human beings and not just as a work force or as someone who will pay me a fee for the work i do , " said rohde " of course , there 's always the dilemma of how to deal with certain financial rules and expectations , which i - as a christian - do n't like .

but chancellor angela merkel may have gone a bit too far during her visit to jerusalem , according to dw 's peter philipp . ahead of her middle east visit , the chancellor already showed that she knows how to act on the diplomatic stage and that she 's not intimidated by difficult situations .
in jerusalem , she confirmed this impression again , although the timing for merkel 's visit was awkward : israeli prime minister sharon is still in a coma ; the election campaign has started ; the radical islamic hamas has been elected in the palestinian territories ; and the dispute over iran 's nuclear ambitions is smoldering in the background . that 's reason enough to delay a courtesy call .
but a german head of government 's debut visit in israel is part of the ritual between the two countries .
and after it was already delayed once because of sharon 's illness and foreign minister steinmeier 's cancellation of his visit due to a german intelligence service scandal , it was important that angela merkel went there .
what was more important was what she - as the first foreign politician to visit since the palestinian election - had to say about the vote : hamas must recognize israel 's right to exist , renounce violence and accept the peace process .
otherwise , foreign - especially european - support would be unthinkable .
the message does n't only stem from germany 's special relationship to israel , but also from foreign countries ' genuine concern about continuation of the peace process .
back in time ?
hamas ' election victory threatens to turn back the wheels of history , and aid to the palestinians could - as it was before the oslo accords - be construed once again as supporting the fight against israel .
the europeans wo n't allow that .
who could be more apt than than angela merkel to say that , as germany contributes the biggest chunk of the eu 's 500 million euros -lrb- $ 609 million -rrb- in aid to the palestinians ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president has provoked outrage in west with his comments but in another respect , the chancellor may have gone a bit too far in her solidarity with israel .
however , the europeans ' lack of a concept in dealing with the question of iran 's nuclear policy may be to blame .
although the europeans fluctuate between criticism , threat and coaxing , merkel said that iran was a " threat to the democratic countries of this earth . "
she surely reflected israeli beliefs , but her comments missed the mark .
criticism is certainly warranted of iranian president ahmadinejad 's diatribes against israel as well as his unspeakable remarks about the holocaust .
and to a certain degree , distrust towards tehran 's real nuclear plans may be warranted .
however , iran is not a danger to democracy worldwide . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel warns palestinians over hamas angela merkel has used the second day of her middle east tour to call on leaders from both sides of the israeli-palestinian conflict to continue along the difficult path to peace .

" they have been a terrorist organization .
they have to change their methods and they have to accept that violence is incompatible with democracy , " solana told afp as he arrived for a day of talks in brussels . " they have to also recognize israel , because in the end what we are trying to do is construct a two-state model and to do that , you have to talk to the other , " he added . the brussels meeting is the first chance for the 25-nation bloc 's ministers to talk since the long-ruling fatah faction lost last week 's palestinian elections to hamas . the eu is unlikely to take any rash decisions .
diplomats stress it has time while waiting for a palestinian government to be formed , and in the meantime palestinian authority head mahmoud abbas remains its key contact . " we would like very much to support president abbas at this period of time , " said solana .
" this is what we are going to do today . " us looks to eu for resolve the united states expects europe to show as much resolve with hamas as it has in vowing to cut aid to the palestinians if the radical islamic group fails to renounce violence , us secretary of state condoleezza rice said on sunday . " first of all the europeans also list hamas as a terrorist organization , " rice said after arriving in london , where she is meeting with representatives of the other members of the mideast peace process quartet : the european union , russia and united nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice is confident that the quartet has a strong consensus about the middle east " supporting a peace process on the one hand ... and on the other hand , supporting the activities of a partner in that set of negotiations which does not recognize the existence of the other partner , it just does not work , " she said . rice underlined that the quartet partners have " forged a very strong consensus about the way forward " in the middle east . us president george w. bush last week warned of cuts in us aid to the palestinians if hamas does not dissolve its armed wing and renounce threats against israel . " if they do n't , we wo n't deal with them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.01.2006 opinion : merkel misses the mark in middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor may have gone too far while in jerusalem solidarity with israel may be second nature to germany .
but chancellor angela merkel may have gone a bit too far during her visit to jerusalem , according to dw 's peter philipp . ahead of her middle east visit , the chancellor already showed that she knows how to act on the diplomatic stage and that she 's not intimidated by difficult situations .
in jerusalem , she confirmed this impression again , although the timing for merkel 's visit was awkward : israeli prime minister sharon is still in a coma ; the election campaign has started ; the radical islamic hamas has been elected in the palestinian territories ; and the dispute over iran 's nuclear ambitions is smoldering in the background . that 's reason enough to delay a courtesy call .
but a german head of government 's debut visit in israel is part of the ritual between the two countries .
and after it was already delayed once because of sharon 's illness and foreign minister steinmeier 's cancellation of his visit due to a german intelligence service scandal , it was important that angela merkel went there .
what was more important was what she - as the first foreign politician to visit since the palestinian election - had to say about the vote : hamas must recognize israel 's right to exist , renounce violence and accept the peace process .
otherwise , foreign - especially european - support would be unthinkable .
the message does n't only stem from germany 's special relationship to israel , but also from foreign countries ' genuine concern about continuation of the peace process .
back in time ?
hamas ' election victory threatens to turn back the wheels of history , and aid to the palestinians could - as it was before the oslo accords - be construed once again as supporting the fight against israel .
the europeans wo n't allow that .
who could be more apt than than angela merkel to say that , as germany contributes the biggest chunk of the eu 's 500 million euros -lrb- $ 609 million -rrb- in aid to the palestinians ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president has provoked outrage in west with his comments but in another respect , the chancellor may have gone a bit too far in her solidarity with israel .
however , the europeans ' lack of a concept in dealing with the question of iran 's nuclear policy may be to blame .
although the europeans fluctuate between criticism , threat and coaxing , merkel said that iran was a " threat to the democratic countries of this earth . "
she surely reflected israeli beliefs , but her comments missed the mark .
criticism is certainly warranted of iranian president ahmadinejad 's diatribes against israel as well as his unspeakable remarks about the holocaust .
and to a certain degree , distrust towards tehran 's real nuclear plans may be warranted .
however , iran is not a danger to democracy worldwide . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel warns palestinians over hamas angela merkel has used the second day of her middle east tour to call on leaders from both sides of the israeli-palestinian conflict to continue along the difficult path to peace .

tehran threatened to halt " all voluntary cooperation " with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- if the west decides to pass the case on to the un . tehran , which decided to resume uranium enrichment research despite international objection , has defended its nuclear activity saying it only wants to make fuel for civil atomic power .
the west fears the project masks a secret nuclear weapons program . " all our friends in europe and the iaea board know the islamic republic 's position : referring the case to or informing the un security council will lead to iran stopping all voluntary cooperation , " foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told a news conference . the west , however , is sticking to its hard line that a draft composed by britain , france and germany at an emergency meeting in london on monday includes the suggestion to ask the iaea to refer the matter to the security council .

" iran calls for diplomacy in a last-ditch effort to avoid a un referral and sanctions , iran called for talks with britain , france and germany in brussels on monday .
javad vaeedi , deputy head of iran 's supreme national security council , will meet diplomats from the eu-3 . " europeans should be patient and try to find a formula to resolve this nuclear issue , " said foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi .

tehran threatened to halt " all voluntary cooperation " with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- if the west decides to pass the case on to the un . tehran , which decided to resume uranium enrichment research despite international objection , has defended its nuclear activity saying it only wants to make fuel for civil atomic power .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.01.2006 european parliamentarians stand up against homophobia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still not embraced by all of europe religious leaders and conservatives rejected the european parliament 's resolution against homophobia , but others hailed it as an important signal to eu countries where gays and lesbians still face discrimination . an overwhelming majority of eu parliamentarians adopted the resolution , which urges member states to grant gay people " the same respect , dignity and protection as the rest of society . " the document came about because of " a series of worrying events -lrb- that -rrb- has recently taken place in a number of member states , " such as bans on gay pride marches , hate speeches by political and religious leaders , breaking up of demonstrations by police , homophobic violence and constitutional amendments prohibiting same-sex unions . catholic leaders immediately criticized the resolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church opposes violence against gays but does not support gay unions " the declaration shows an aversion for certain values of our tradition , notably religious values , " aldo giordano , the secretary-general of the council of european bishops ' conferences , told vatican radio .
" such resolutions risk delegitimizing the european parliament .
it should be clear that certain subjects , especially those relating to the family , are not within the direct competence of the european union but are the recognized competence of nations . " that argument was echoed by those opposing the resolution in parliament . " i think that this is a case of europe getting involved in things that are none of europe 's business , " said angelika niebler , one of 27 conservative german members of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- who voted against the declaration . an essential reaction to homophobia ? while an eu directive requires member states to protect gay people against discrimination regarding employment , national laws vary widely in other areas .
while a range of countries , including belgium , britain , denmark , france , germany and spain , have legalized gay civil unions , others are far from doing so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia is not the most gay-friendly place in europe in latvia , for example , the eu anti-discrimination directive has not been implemented and a constitutional amendment defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman . " the situation is a bleak one , " said ilze brands kehris , the director of the latvian center for human rights and ethnic studies .
" it 's absolutely essential that we have these kinds of reactions internationally . " she added that her country 's young democracy still had a lot to learn . " the soviet period blocked any kind of development on tolerance issues , " she said .
" you have to activate civil society in coalition with the international signals to bring change over time in latvia . " will actions follow ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and pope benedict xvi have similar views on gay marriage in poland , where president lech kaczynski barred gay pride marches during his tenure as mayor of warsaw and prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz called for state protection against homosexual " contamination " of society , gay rights activists also said they had high hopes for the resolution . " when you hear from the prime minister that homosexuality is abnormal , that we should be cured , that they will try to cure us by force , this is quite frightening , " said robert biedron , the head of warsaw-based campaign against homophobia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel mention gay rights next time she meets marcinkiewicz ?
" i think that this resolution is very important for new european member states as a reminder on which way the new democracies should go , " he added . but while welcoming the resolution , german gay rights activist jörg litwinschuh said it 's only worth something if actions follow . " if nothing changes , sanctions have to happen , " he said , adding that his initiative queer nations would also lobby chancellor angela merkel to address discrimination against gay people in her meetings with foreign leaders . recognizing the nazis ' gay victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will resemble the one fore jewish holocaust victims litwinschuh is the executive director of a consortium of german scientists and celebrities that plans to reopen the magnus hirschfeld institute , the first center to study homosexuality , which was destroyed by the nazis in 1933 . he said that he was particularly pleased that the resolution also called on " member states concerned finally to accord full recognition to homosexuals as targets and victims of the nazi regime . " a big step in that direction was already taken last week , when berlin announced plans to build a national memorial for homosexuals persecuted by the nazis . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to build memorial to gays persecuted by nazis the berlin government has given the go-ahead for a memorial designed by a scandinavian artist-duo in central berlin commemorating thousands of homosexuals persecuted by nazi germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.01.2006 the ethics of success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers and the unemployed should be made to feel like more than just cattle business people and church leaders met in bonn to discuss work ethics in today 's achievement-oriented society at a time when increasing numbers of germans feel like failures or have low esteem because they 're unemployed . the german economy has been struggling through several tough years now , but experts are now starting to talk about a light at the end of the tunnel .
if you talk to people on the street , though , it 's a very different story .
many still ca n't seem to imagine that things will improve any time soon .
and the main reason for this skepticism is germany 's ailing job market . more than 4.5 million germans are unemployed .
others only have temporary jobs or work for little or no money .
and the result is not only that increasing numbers of people feel like failures or have low self-esteem , but that those lucky enough to be employed are under greater pressure than ever before . " what counts today is how you assert yourself , how you 're able compete on the market , how loud you are , " said anke patt , a journalist who has recently started her own business .
" and sometimes it counts how good you are at fitting in and swimming with the current . " after world war ii , and especially during the 1960s and 1970s , having a job in germany usually meant that you would start working for a certain company in your late teens or 20s , that you climbed up the career ladder step by step , and that you stayed with that same company throughout your working life .
it was a time of growing social and job security .
but all this has changed dramatically and irreversibly . as a result , many germans feel insecure and fear they will be failures in life .
a major german protestant think tank recently invited a group of business people and church leaders to take a deeper look at the problem and discuss the necessity of work ethics in today 's working environment . profession vs. job " we 've realized that we are n't in touch with business people anymore , " said protestant theologian peter mörbel , the conference 's host .
" we do n't know enough about the new working world , about the service society , for example .
the church 's idea of the business world is still strongly influenced by the ideas of industry and agriculture .
we now have to get to know the new branches .
that 's why we get together and talk about topics that are important to both , the business world and the church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aiming for a job - or for a profession ? at the heart of the round-table discussions were two words : beruf , or " profession , " and " job . " " germans understand the term ' job ' simply as an opportunity to earn a living , something you do for a short while , without having any ties and maybe even without having to take any responsibility , " explained manfred kock , former head of the german protestant church .
" in contrast to that , a profession is something that has to do with your talents and interests that you have either through fate , genes , parents or god .
what can i do with these gifts ?
how can i use them to serve a good purpose ? " instead , kock said , most people today just go to work so that they can pay their rent , food and holiday expenses - they have a job , not a profession .
and this is totally understandable , he said : at a time when employees seem little more than statistics or another cost to companies and when hundreds or thousands of people at the same company regularly lose their jobs , people are no longer willing to put their heart and soul into their work .
this creates a lack of commitment and solidarity from both the company and their employees . it 's part of the church 's responsibility to confront and discuss these sore points , according to kock . " i believe the economy needs to be tamed by what we call duty and responsibility , " he said .
" the economy only works well when it 's standing on both legs : when companies make enough money , and when they are , at the same time , committed to the people for whom they are doing the business . "
success is more than money for andreas rohde , a young lawyer and spokesman for wirtschaftsjunioren bonn , the junior chamber of commerce in bonn , this kind of work ethic has a clear and direct impact on the work he does himself . " i see my clients and my employees as human beings and not just as a work force or as someone who will pay me a fee for the work i do , " said rohde " of course , there 's always the dilemma of how to deal with certain financial rules and expectations , which i - as a christian - do n't like .
sometimes i have to just bite the bullet and refuse certain orders . " charity begins at home , he said .
but it should n't end at the door to your office .
so for rohde , there 's a lot more to success than just making a lot of money .
and although much of the business world probably would n't share this point of view , his fellow conference participants agreed with him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the workplace has become ever more stressful a more diverse group of participants , more young people or those in favor of tighter market competition would no doubt have extolled the benefits of flexible employment terms , for example , or the importance of profits and shareholder value above all else .
but the choice of participants was a deliberate one , said conference host mörbel .
changing words into deeds " we chose certain topics to get the dialogue started in the first place , " he said .
" if you want to include too many contrasting viewpoints , you can easily overload such a meeting .
therefore , i tried to be careful when i planned the conference .
but maybe i was too careful . " for mörbel , the conference was a starting point .
several more round-table discussions of this kind will follow in bonn , he said .
and it 's hoped that as the discussions develop , the participants will start being able to turn their words into deeds , wherever they work and whatever they do . " to meet like-minded people merely makes me all the more determined to stay on the same path and to encourage others to support work ethics which imply reliability and a sense of responsibility instead of a craving for power or money , " patt concluded . svenja üing -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?

many still ca n't seem to imagine that things will improve any time soon .
and the main reason for this skepticism is germany 's ailing job market . more than 4.5 million germans are unemployed .
others only have temporary jobs or work for little or no money .
and the result is not only that increasing numbers of people feel like failures or have low self-esteem , but that those lucky enough to be employed are under greater pressure than ever before . " what counts today is how you assert yourself , how you 're able compete on the market , how loud you are , " said anke patt , a journalist who has recently started her own business .
" and sometimes it counts how good you are at fitting in and swimming with the current . " after world war ii , and especially during the 1960s and 1970s , having a job in germany usually meant that you would start working for a certain company in your late teens or 20s , that you climbed up the career ladder step by step , and that you stayed with that same company throughout your working life .
it was a time of growing social and job security .
but all this has changed dramatically and irreversibly . as a result , many germans feel insecure and fear they will be failures in life .
a major german protestant think tank recently invited a group of business people and church leaders to take a deeper look at the problem and discuss the necessity of work ethics in today 's working environment . profession vs. job " we 've realized that we are n't in touch with business people anymore , " said protestant theologian peter mörbel , the conference 's host .
" we do n't know enough about the new working world , about the service society , for example .
the church 's idea of the business world is still strongly influenced by the ideas of industry and agriculture .
we now have to get to know the new branches .
that 's why we get together and talk about topics that are important to both , the business world and the church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aiming for a job - or for a profession ? at the heart of the round-table discussions were two words : beruf , or " profession , " and " job . " " germans understand the term ' job ' simply as an opportunity to earn a living , something you do for a short while , without having any ties and maybe even without having to take any responsibility , " explained manfred kock , former head of the german protestant church .
" in contrast to that , a profession is something that has to do with your talents and interests that you have either through fate , genes , parents or god .
what can i do with these gifts ?
how can i use them to serve a good purpose ? " instead , kock said , most people today just go to work so that they can pay their rent , food and holiday expenses - they have a job , not a profession .
and this is totally understandable , he said : at a time when employees seem little more than statistics or another cost to companies and when hundreds or thousands of people at the same company regularly lose their jobs , people are no longer willing to put their heart and soul into their work .
this creates a lack of commitment and solidarity from both the company and their employees . it 's part of the church 's responsibility to confront and discuss these sore points , according to kock . " i believe the economy needs to be tamed by what we call duty and responsibility , " he said .
" the economy only works well when it 's standing on both legs : when companies make enough money , and when they are , at the same time , committed to the people for whom they are doing the business . "
success is more than money for andreas rohde , a young lawyer and spokesman for wirtschaftsjunioren bonn , the junior chamber of commerce in bonn , this kind of work ethic has a clear and direct impact on the work he does himself . " i see my clients and my employees as human beings and not just as a work force or as someone who will pay me a fee for the work i do , " said rohde " of course , there 's always the dilemma of how to deal with certain financial rules and expectations , which i - as a christian - do n't like .
sometimes i have to just bite the bullet and refuse certain orders . " charity begins at home , he said .
but it should n't end at the door to your office .
so for rohde , there 's a lot more to success than just making a lot of money .
and although much of the business world probably would n't share this point of view , his fellow conference participants agreed with him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the workplace has become ever more stressful a more diverse group of participants , more young people or those in favor of tighter market competition would no doubt have extolled the benefits of flexible employment terms , for example , or the importance of profits and shareholder value above all else .
but the choice of participants was a deliberate one , said conference host mörbel .
changing words into deeds " we chose certain topics to get the dialogue started in the first place , " he said .
" if you want to include too many contrasting viewpoints , you can easily overload such a meeting .
therefore , i tried to be careful when i planned the conference .
but maybe i was too careful . " for mörbel , the conference was a starting point .
several more round-table discussions of this kind will follow in bonn , he said .
and it 's hoped that as the discussions develop , the participants will start being able to turn their words into deeds , wherever they work and whatever they do . " to meet like-minded people merely makes me all the more determined to stay on the same path and to encourage others to support work ethics which imply reliability and a sense of responsibility instead of a craving for power or money , " patt concluded . svenja üing -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?

but chancellor angela merkel may have gone a bit too far during her visit to jerusalem , according to dw 's peter philipp . ahead of her middle east visit , the chancellor already showed that she knows how to act on the diplomatic stage and that she 's not intimidated by difficult situations .
in jerusalem , she confirmed this impression again , although the timing for merkel 's visit was awkward : israeli prime minister sharon is still in a coma ; the election campaign has started ; the radical islamic hamas has been elected in the palestinian territories ; and the dispute over iran 's nuclear ambitions is smoldering in the background . that 's reason enough to delay a courtesy call .
but a german head of government 's debut visit in israel is part of the ritual between the two countries .
and after it was already delayed once because of sharon 's illness and foreign minister steinmeier 's cancellation of his visit due to a german intelligence service scandal , it was important that angela merkel went there .
what was more important was what she - as the first foreign politician to visit since the palestinian election - had to say about the vote : hamas must recognize israel 's right to exist , renounce violence and accept the peace process .
otherwise , foreign - especially european - support would be unthinkable .
the message does n't only stem from germany 's special relationship to israel , but also from foreign countries ' genuine concern about continuation of the peace process .
back in time ?
hamas ' election victory threatens to turn back the wheels of history , and aid to the palestinians could - as it was before the oslo accords - be construed once again as supporting the fight against israel .
the europeans wo n't allow that .
who could be more apt than than angela merkel to say that , as germany contributes the biggest chunk of the eu 's 500 million euros -lrb- $ 609 million -rrb- in aid to the palestinians ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president has provoked outrage in west with his comments but in another respect , the chancellor may have gone a bit too far in her solidarity with israel .
however , the europeans ' lack of a concept in dealing with the question of iran 's nuclear policy may be to blame .
although the europeans fluctuate between criticism , threat and coaxing , merkel said that iran was a " threat to the democratic countries of this earth . "
she surely reflected israeli beliefs , but her comments missed the mark .
criticism is certainly warranted of iranian president ahmadinejad 's diatribes against israel as well as his unspeakable remarks about the holocaust .
and to a certain degree , distrust towards tehran 's real nuclear plans may be warranted .
however , iran is not a danger to democracy worldwide . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel warns palestinians over hamas angela merkel has used the second day of her middle east tour to call on leaders from both sides of the israeli-palestinian conflict to continue along the difficult path to peace .

meanwhile angela merkel called iran " a threat " to democracy on sunday . iran 's foreign ministry insisted on sunday that the only solution to the standoff with the west over its nuclear program is through negotiations and not a referral to the united nations security council .
tehran threatened to halt " all voluntary cooperation " with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- if the west decides to pass the case on to the un . tehran , which decided to resume uranium enrichment research despite international objection , has defended its nuclear activity saying it only wants to make fuel for civil atomic power .
the west fears the project masks a secret nuclear weapons program . " all our friends in europe and the iaea board know the islamic republic 's position : referring the case to or informing the un security council will lead to iran stopping all voluntary cooperation , " foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told a news conference . the west , however , is sticking to its hard line that a draft composed by britain , france and germany at an emergency meeting in london on monday includes the suggestion to ask the iaea to refer the matter to the security council .
although the eu trio has spent two and a half years negotiating with tehran over its atomic program , they say time is running out and are seriously considering putting the issue up for a vote on economic sanctions . merkel gets tough and calls iran a threat to democratic world in germany , where politicians have been cautious on the issue , the rhetoric became audibly more stringent over the weekend with chancellor angela merkel taking the hardest line yet in her words on the issue . merkel said at the start of her first visit to israel on sunday that iran threatens not only the jewish state but the entire democratic world .
" iran is not just a threat to israel , but also to the democratic countries of this world . " adding that both germany and israel shared the same view on iran 's ambitions , merkel said : " i do n't see the slightest difference in the views of germany and israel .
it is clear that iran should not get the ability to enrich uranium . " merkel also condemned iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad for his anti-israeli remarks .
ahmadinejad has said the jewish state should be " wiped off the map " and doubted that six million jews had been killed by the nazis during world war ii .
" it 's unacceptable that iran 's president rejects and falsifies history , " she said . acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert thanked merkel for supporting israel on the question of iran 's nuclear program .
" i would ... like to thank you for your position on iran .
it is a topic that causes great concern here in israel , " he said . a case for sanctions ? earlier at the weekend , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier suggested a tougher german line by saying it would be unwise to rule out economic sanctions . in an interview with the german weekly magazine der spiegel , the minister said " the latest signals from tehran are contradictory at best . "
he added : " i 'm aware of the criticisms that iran is using tricks and playing for time – and i ca n't seriously deny them . " german defense minister franz josef jung also left open the possibility of sanctions .
speaking to the frankfurter allgemeinen sonntagszeitung , he said if russia and china went along with the strategy , economic sanctions could be effective in convincing iran to give up its " obvious intentions of developing atomic weapons . " iran calls for diplomacy in a last-ditch effort to avoid a un referral and sanctions , iran called for talks with britain , france and germany in brussels on monday .
javad vaeedi , deputy head of iran 's supreme national security council , will meet diplomats from the eu-3 . " europeans should be patient and try to find a formula to resolve this nuclear issue , " said foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi .
" we are determined to remove any ambiguities over our nuclear ambitions and also protect our right . " in the past iran has repeatedly said it would never abandon its drive to enrich uranium – a necessary step for developing nuclear power reactors and , when highly enriched , nuclear bombs . the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors will hear arguments on feb .

" but this time , if there is a trend , then it 's definitely political .
all around the world , there 's a very strong tendency of political cinema , one that 's close to reality and shows a tough world , and i 'm glad that the berlinale is taking part in it . " the political theme runs through almost all sections of the berlinale this time .
" syriana , " a political thriller starring george clooney is being screened out of competition .
" bye bye berlusconi ! " a satire by jan henrik stahlberg will feature in the panorama section and british michael winterbottom 's " the road to guantanamo " about three muslims held up at the us lockup in cuba will show in the competition section . asked whether the latter was a comment on the iraq war and us policies , kosslick said it was rather " a statement for human rights . " if i had my way , then i 'd meet the 450 guantanamo inmates , who are being held there in violation of every human right and are tortured , on the red carpet during the screening of the film , " kosslick added .
" but unfortunately i ca n't . " bigger tha n ever in addition to promising some seriously thought-provoking fare , this year 's berlinale , which is the first of europe 's three major festivals in the new year , has gotten even bigger , reflecting its surging popularity amid germany 's economic stagnation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlinale offers a mind-boggling array of events and shows kosslick and his staff went through a record 4,000 films submitted to pick the 400 for the main competition and various sidebar events . a total number of 26 films are in the competition section , 19 of them will compete for the golden and silver bears and 17 films are world premieres . a record number of 18,000 film buyers , sellers , producers , directors and actors as well as journalists from around the world will also be thronging the screenings and press conferences around the glitzy potsdamer platz in downtown berlin . reconfirming the festival 's reputation as a launching pad for hollywood and european films at the start of the year , beki probst , head of the festival 's european film market , where buyers and sellers from around the world gather , said the section had won lots of new customers from the us , asia as well as within europe .
the film market has shown a 45 percent increase this year with 254 companies attending . " it 's definitely established berlin as an important place , " probst said .
" now the feeling is ' berlin is a must ' . " four germa n e n tries kosslick , who is in his fifth year as berlinale director and is credited with boosting german film , has stayed true to his reputation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book cover of michel houellebecq 's " elementary particles " this time , germany is entering the competition with four films : oskar röhler 's " elementary particles , " an on-screen adaptation of french literary bad boy michael houellebecq 's tale of a sexually-obsessed person , matthias glasner 's " free will , " a story of a compulsive rapist , valeska grisebach 's " longing , " a picture about a love triangle set in the former communist east and a film about exorcism in 1970s west germany by hans-christian schmid , called " requiem . " " the four are absolutely justified .
they 're very different , " kosslick said , adding tongue-in-cheek : " if you do n't want to laugh to death , then you should go and see the german films . " star power true to its form , the berlinale this year will also draw in the stars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " my good friend george clooney , " is how kosslick describes the hollywood star berlin favorite george clooney , isabella rossellini , meryl streep , vin diesel , roberto benigni und claude chabrol among others will add some glamour to the berlin winter .
the international jury will be headed by english actress charlotte rampling and will include veteran german actor armin müller-stahl . " snow cake , " a british-canadian co-production starring sigourney weaver as an autistic woman , opens the festival .
weaver is expected on the red carpet along with co-star alan rickman . away from the glamour and the buzz , kosslick said the festival , which costs an estimated 16 million euros -lrb- $ 19.5 million -rrb- , was financially well-secured too thanks to new sponsors .

if you talk to people on the street , though , it 's a very different story .
many still ca n't seem to imagine that things will improve any time soon .
and the main reason for this skepticism is germany 's ailing job market . more than 4.5 million germans are unemployed .
others only have temporary jobs or work for little or no money .
and the result is not only that increasing numbers of people feel like failures or have low self-esteem , but that those lucky enough to be employed are under greater pressure than ever before . " what counts today is how you assert yourself , how you 're able compete on the market , how loud you are , " said anke patt , a journalist who has recently started her own business .
" and sometimes it counts how good you are at fitting in and swimming with the current . " after world war ii , and especially during the 1960s and 1970s , having a job in germany usually meant that you would start working for a certain company in your late teens or 20s , that you climbed up the career ladder step by step , and that you stayed with that same company throughout your working life .
it was a time of growing social and job security .
but all this has changed dramatically and irreversibly . as a result , many germans feel insecure and fear they will be failures in life .
a major german protestant think tank recently invited a group of business people and church leaders to take a deeper look at the problem and discuss the necessity of work ethics in today 's working environment . profession vs. job " we 've realized that we are n't in touch with business people anymore , " said protestant theologian peter mörbel , the conference 's host .
" we do n't know enough about the new working world , about the service society , for example .
the church 's idea of the business world is still strongly influenced by the ideas of industry and agriculture .
we now have to get to know the new branches .
that 's why we get together and talk about topics that are important to both , the business world and the church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aiming for a job - or for a profession ? at the heart of the round-table discussions were two words : beruf , or " profession , " and " job . " " germans understand the term ' job ' simply as an opportunity to earn a living , something you do for a short while , without having any ties and maybe even without having to take any responsibility , " explained manfred kock , former head of the german protestant church .
" in contrast to that , a profession is something that has to do with your talents and interests that you have either through fate , genes , parents or god .
what can i do with these gifts ?
how can i use them to serve a good purpose ? " instead , kock said , most people today just go to work so that they can pay their rent , food and holiday expenses - they have a job , not a profession .
and this is totally understandable , he said : at a time when employees seem little more than statistics or another cost to companies and when hundreds or thousands of people at the same company regularly lose their jobs , people are no longer willing to put their heart and soul into their work .
this creates a lack of commitment and solidarity from both the company and their employees . it 's part of the church 's responsibility to confront and discuss these sore points , according to kock . " i believe the economy needs to be tamed by what we call duty and responsibility , " he said .
" the economy only works well when it 's standing on both legs : when companies make enough money , and when they are , at the same time , committed to the people for whom they are doing the business . "
success is more than money for andreas rohde , a young lawyer and spokesman for wirtschaftsjunioren bonn , the junior chamber of commerce in bonn , this kind of work ethic has a clear and direct impact on the work he does himself . " i see my clients and my employees as human beings and not just as a work force or as someone who will pay me a fee for the work i do , " said rohde " of course , there 's always the dilemma of how to deal with certain financial rules and expectations , which i - as a christian - do n't like .
sometimes i have to just bite the bullet and refuse certain orders . " charity begins at home , he said .
but it should n't end at the door to your office .
so for rohde , there 's a lot more to success than just making a lot of money .
and although much of the business world probably would n't share this point of view , his fellow conference participants agreed with him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the workplace has become ever more stressful a more diverse group of participants , more young people or those in favor of tighter market competition would no doubt have extolled the benefits of flexible employment terms , for example , or the importance of profits and shareholder value above all else .
but the choice of participants was a deliberate one , said conference host mörbel .
changing words into deeds " we chose certain topics to get the dialogue started in the first place , " he said .
" if you want to include too many contrasting viewpoints , you can easily overload such a meeting .
therefore , i tried to be careful when i planned the conference .
but maybe i was too careful . " for mörbel , the conference was a starting point .
several more round-table discussions of this kind will follow in bonn , he said .
and it 's hoped that as the discussions develop , the participants will start being able to turn their words into deeds , wherever they work and whatever they do . " to meet like-minded people merely makes me all the more determined to stay on the same path and to encourage others to support work ethics which imply reliability and a sense of responsibility instead of a craving for power or money , " patt concluded . svenja üing -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?

if you talk to people on the street , though , it 's a very different story .
many still ca n't seem to imagine that things will improve any time soon .
and the main reason for this skepticism is germany 's ailing job market . more than 4.5 million germans are unemployed .
others only have temporary jobs or work for little or no money .
and the result is not only that increasing numbers of people feel like failures or have low self-esteem , but that those lucky enough to be employed are under greater pressure than ever before . " what counts today is how you assert yourself , how you 're able compete on the market , how loud you are , " said anke patt , a journalist who has recently started her own business .
" and sometimes it counts how good you are at fitting in and swimming with the current . " after world war ii , and especially during the 1960s and 1970s , having a job in germany usually meant that you would start working for a certain company in your late teens or 20s , that you climbed up the career ladder step by step , and that you stayed with that same company throughout your working life .
it was a time of growing social and job security .
but all this has changed dramatically and irreversibly . as a result , many germans feel insecure and fear they will be failures in life .
a major german protestant think tank recently invited a group of business people and church leaders to take a deeper look at the problem and discuss the necessity of work ethics in today 's working environment . profession vs. job " we 've realized that we are n't in touch with business people anymore , " said protestant theologian peter mörbel , the conference 's host .
" we do n't know enough about the new working world , about the service society , for example .
the church 's idea of the business world is still strongly influenced by the ideas of industry and agriculture .
we now have to get to know the new branches .
that 's why we get together and talk about topics that are important to both , the business world and the church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aiming for a job - or for a profession ? at the heart of the round-table discussions were two words : beruf , or " profession , " and " job . " " germans understand the term ' job ' simply as an opportunity to earn a living , something you do for a short while , without having any ties and maybe even without having to take any responsibility , " explained manfred kock , former head of the german protestant church .
" in contrast to that , a profession is something that has to do with your talents and interests that you have either through fate , genes , parents or god .
what can i do with these gifts ?
how can i use them to serve a good purpose ? " instead , kock said , most people today just go to work so that they can pay their rent , food and holiday expenses - they have a job , not a profession .
and this is totally understandable , he said : at a time when employees seem little more than statistics or another cost to companies and when hundreds or thousands of people at the same company regularly lose their jobs , people are no longer willing to put their heart and soul into their work .
this creates a lack of commitment and solidarity from both the company and their employees . it 's part of the church 's responsibility to confront and discuss these sore points , according to kock . " i believe the economy needs to be tamed by what we call duty and responsibility , " he said .
" the economy only works well when it 's standing on both legs : when companies make enough money , and when they are , at the same time , committed to the people for whom they are doing the business . "
success is more than money for andreas rohde , a young lawyer and spokesman for wirtschaftsjunioren bonn , the junior chamber of commerce in bonn , this kind of work ethic has a clear and direct impact on the work he does himself . " i see my clients and my employees as human beings and not just as a work force or as someone who will pay me a fee for the work i do , " said rohde " of course , there 's always the dilemma of how to deal with certain financial rules and expectations , which i - as a christian - do n't like .
sometimes i have to just bite the bullet and refuse certain orders . " charity begins at home , he said .
but it should n't end at the door to your office .
so for rohde , there 's a lot more to success than just making a lot of money .
and although much of the business world probably would n't share this point of view , his fellow conference participants agreed with him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the workplace has become ever more stressful a more diverse group of participants , more young people or those in favor of tighter market competition would no doubt have extolled the benefits of flexible employment terms , for example , or the importance of profits and shareholder value above all else .
but the choice of participants was a deliberate one , said conference host mörbel .
changing words into deeds " we chose certain topics to get the dialogue started in the first place , " he said .
" if you want to include too many contrasting viewpoints , you can easily overload such a meeting .
therefore , i tried to be careful when i planned the conference .
but maybe i was too careful . " for mörbel , the conference was a starting point .
several more round-table discussions of this kind will follow in bonn , he said .
and it 's hoped that as the discussions develop , the participants will start being able to turn their words into deeds , wherever they work and whatever they do . " to meet like-minded people merely makes me all the more determined to stay on the same path and to encourage others to support work ethics which imply reliability and a sense of responsibility instead of a craving for power or money , " patt concluded . svenja üing -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?

meanwhile angela merkel called iran " a threat " to democracy on sunday . iran 's foreign ministry insisted on sunday that the only solution to the standoff with the west over its nuclear program is through negotiations and not a referral to the united nations security council .
tehran threatened to halt " all voluntary cooperation " with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- if the west decides to pass the case on to the un . tehran , which decided to resume uranium enrichment research despite international objection , has defended its nuclear activity saying it only wants to make fuel for civil atomic power .
the west fears the project masks a secret nuclear weapons program . " all our friends in europe and the iaea board know the islamic republic 's position : referring the case to or informing the un security council will lead to iran stopping all voluntary cooperation , " foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told a news conference . the west , however , is sticking to its hard line that a draft composed by britain , france and germany at an emergency meeting in london on monday includes the suggestion to ask the iaea to refer the matter to the security council .
although the eu trio has spent two and a half years negotiating with tehran over its atomic program , they say time is running out and are seriously considering putting the issue up for a vote on economic sanctions . merkel gets tough and calls iran a threat to democratic world in germany , where politicians have been cautious on the issue , the rhetoric became audibly more stringent over the weekend with chancellor angela merkel taking the hardest line yet in her words on the issue . merkel said at the start of her first visit to israel on sunday that iran threatens not only the jewish state but the entire democratic world .
" iran is not just a threat to israel , but also to the democratic countries of this world . " adding that both germany and israel shared the same view on iran 's ambitions , merkel said : " i do n't see the slightest difference in the views of germany and israel .
it is clear that iran should not get the ability to enrich uranium . " merkel also condemned iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad for his anti-israeli remarks .
ahmadinejad has said the jewish state should be " wiped off the map " and doubted that six million jews had been killed by the nazis during world war ii .
" it 's unacceptable that iran 's president rejects and falsifies history , " she said . acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert thanked merkel for supporting israel on the question of iran 's nuclear program .
" i would ... like to thank you for your position on iran .
it is a topic that causes great concern here in israel , " he said . a case for sanctions ? earlier at the weekend , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier suggested a tougher german line by saying it would be unwise to rule out economic sanctions . in an interview with the german weekly magazine der spiegel , the minister said " the latest signals from tehran are contradictory at best . "
he added : " i 'm aware of the criticisms that iran is using tricks and playing for time – and i ca n't seriously deny them . " german defense minister franz josef jung also left open the possibility of sanctions .
speaking to the frankfurter allgemeinen sonntagszeitung , he said if russia and china went along with the strategy , economic sanctions could be effective in convincing iran to give up its " obvious intentions of developing atomic weapons . " iran calls for diplomacy in a last-ditch effort to avoid a un referral and sanctions , iran called for talks with britain , france and germany in brussels on monday .
javad vaeedi , deputy head of iran 's supreme national security council , will meet diplomats from the eu-3 . " europeans should be patient and try to find a formula to resolve this nuclear issue , " said foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi .
" we are determined to remove any ambiguities over our nuclear ambitions and also protect our right . " in the past iran has repeatedly said it would never abandon its drive to enrich uranium – a necessary step for developing nuclear power reactors and , when highly enriched , nuclear bombs . the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors will hear arguments on feb .

if you talk to people on the street , though , it 's a very different story .
many still ca n't seem to imagine that things will improve any time soon .
and the main reason for this skepticism is germany 's ailing job market . more than 4.5 million germans are unemployed .
others only have temporary jobs or work for little or no money .
and the result is not only that increasing numbers of people feel like failures or have low self-esteem , but that those lucky enough to be employed are under greater pressure than ever before . " what counts today is how you assert yourself , how you 're able compete on the market , how loud you are , " said anke patt , a journalist who has recently started her own business .
" and sometimes it counts how good you are at fitting in and swimming with the current . " after world war ii , and especially during the 1960s and 1970s , having a job in germany usually meant that you would start working for a certain company in your late teens or 20s , that you climbed up the career ladder step by step , and that you stayed with that same company throughout your working life .
it was a time of growing social and job security .
but all this has changed dramatically and irreversibly . as a result , many germans feel insecure and fear they will be failures in life .
a major german protestant think tank recently invited a group of business people and church leaders to take a deeper look at the problem and discuss the necessity of work ethics in today 's working environment . profession vs. job " we 've realized that we are n't in touch with business people anymore , " said protestant theologian peter mörbel , the conference 's host .
" we do n't know enough about the new working world , about the service society , for example .
the church 's idea of the business world is still strongly influenced by the ideas of industry and agriculture .
we now have to get to know the new branches .
that 's why we get together and talk about topics that are important to both , the business world and the church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aiming for a job - or for a profession ? at the heart of the round-table discussions were two words : beruf , or " profession , " and " job . " " germans understand the term ' job ' simply as an opportunity to earn a living , something you do for a short while , without having any ties and maybe even without having to take any responsibility , " explained manfred kock , former head of the german protestant church .
" in contrast to that , a profession is something that has to do with your talents and interests that you have either through fate , genes , parents or god .
what can i do with these gifts ?
how can i use them to serve a good purpose ? " instead , kock said , most people today just go to work so that they can pay their rent , food and holiday expenses - they have a job , not a profession .
and this is totally understandable , he said : at a time when employees seem little more than statistics or another cost to companies and when hundreds or thousands of people at the same company regularly lose their jobs , people are no longer willing to put their heart and soul into their work .
this creates a lack of commitment and solidarity from both the company and their employees . it 's part of the church 's responsibility to confront and discuss these sore points , according to kock . " i believe the economy needs to be tamed by what we call duty and responsibility , " he said .
" the economy only works well when it 's standing on both legs : when companies make enough money , and when they are , at the same time , committed to the people for whom they are doing the business . "
success is more than money for andreas rohde , a young lawyer and spokesman for wirtschaftsjunioren bonn , the junior chamber of commerce in bonn , this kind of work ethic has a clear and direct impact on the work he does himself . " i see my clients and my employees as human beings and not just as a work force or as someone who will pay me a fee for the work i do , " said rohde " of course , there 's always the dilemma of how to deal with certain financial rules and expectations , which i - as a christian - do n't like .
sometimes i have to just bite the bullet and refuse certain orders . " charity begins at home , he said .
but it should n't end at the door to your office .
so for rohde , there 's a lot more to success than just making a lot of money .
and although much of the business world probably would n't share this point of view , his fellow conference participants agreed with him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the workplace has become ever more stressful a more diverse group of participants , more young people or those in favor of tighter market competition would no doubt have extolled the benefits of flexible employment terms , for example , or the importance of profits and shareholder value above all else .
but the choice of participants was a deliberate one , said conference host mörbel .
changing words into deeds " we chose certain topics to get the dialogue started in the first place , " he said .
" if you want to include too many contrasting viewpoints , you can easily overload such a meeting .
therefore , i tried to be careful when i planned the conference .
but maybe i was too careful . " for mörbel , the conference was a starting point .
several more round-table discussions of this kind will follow in bonn , he said .
and it 's hoped that as the discussions develop , the participants will start being able to turn their words into deeds , wherever they work and whatever they do . " to meet like-minded people merely makes me all the more determined to stay on the same path and to encourage others to support work ethics which imply reliability and a sense of responsibility instead of a craving for power or money , " patt concluded . svenja üing -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.01.2006 the ethics of success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers and the unemployed should be made to feel like more than just cattle business people and church leaders met in bonn to discuss work ethics in today 's achievement-oriented society at a time when increasing numbers of germans feel like failures or have low esteem because they 're unemployed . the german economy has been struggling through several tough years now , but experts are now starting to talk about a light at the end of the tunnel .
if you talk to people on the street , though , it 's a very different story .
many still ca n't seem to imagine that things will improve any time soon .
and the main reason for this skepticism is germany 's ailing job market . more than 4.5 million germans are unemployed .
others only have temporary jobs or work for little or no money .
and the result is not only that increasing numbers of people feel like failures or have low self-esteem , but that those lucky enough to be employed are under greater pressure than ever before . " what counts today is how you assert yourself , how you 're able compete on the market , how loud you are , " said anke patt , a journalist who has recently started her own business .
" and sometimes it counts how good you are at fitting in and swimming with the current . " after world war ii , and especially during the 1960s and 1970s , having a job in germany usually meant that you would start working for a certain company in your late teens or 20s , that you climbed up the career ladder step by step , and that you stayed with that same company throughout your working life .
it was a time of growing social and job security .
but all this has changed dramatically and irreversibly . as a result , many germans feel insecure and fear they will be failures in life .
a major german protestant think tank recently invited a group of business people and church leaders to take a deeper look at the problem and discuss the necessity of work ethics in today 's working environment . profession vs. job " we 've realized that we are n't in touch with business people anymore , " said protestant theologian peter mörbel , the conference 's host .
" we do n't know enough about the new working world , about the service society , for example .
the church 's idea of the business world is still strongly influenced by the ideas of industry and agriculture .
we now have to get to know the new branches .
that 's why we get together and talk about topics that are important to both , the business world and the church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aiming for a job - or for a profession ? at the heart of the round-table discussions were two words : beruf , or " profession , " and " job . " " germans understand the term ' job ' simply as an opportunity to earn a living , something you do for a short while , without having any ties and maybe even without having to take any responsibility , " explained manfred kock , former head of the german protestant church .
" in contrast to that , a profession is something that has to do with your talents and interests that you have either through fate , genes , parents or god .
what can i do with these gifts ?
how can i use them to serve a good purpose ? " instead , kock said , most people today just go to work so that they can pay their rent , food and holiday expenses - they have a job , not a profession .
and this is totally understandable , he said : at a time when employees seem little more than statistics or another cost to companies and when hundreds or thousands of people at the same company regularly lose their jobs , people are no longer willing to put their heart and soul into their work .
this creates a lack of commitment and solidarity from both the company and their employees . it 's part of the church 's responsibility to confront and discuss these sore points , according to kock . " i believe the economy needs to be tamed by what we call duty and responsibility , " he said .
" the economy only works well when it 's standing on both legs : when companies make enough money , and when they are , at the same time , committed to the people for whom they are doing the business . "
success is more than money for andreas rohde , a young lawyer and spokesman for wirtschaftsjunioren bonn , the junior chamber of commerce in bonn , this kind of work ethic has a clear and direct impact on the work he does himself . " i see my clients and my employees as human beings and not just as a work force or as someone who will pay me a fee for the work i do , " said rohde " of course , there 's always the dilemma of how to deal with certain financial rules and expectations , which i - as a christian - do n't like .
sometimes i have to just bite the bullet and refuse certain orders . " charity begins at home , he said .
but it should n't end at the door to your office .
so for rohde , there 's a lot more to success than just making a lot of money .
and although much of the business world probably would n't share this point of view , his fellow conference participants agreed with him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the workplace has become ever more stressful a more diverse group of participants , more young people or those in favor of tighter market competition would no doubt have extolled the benefits of flexible employment terms , for example , or the importance of profits and shareholder value above all else .
but the choice of participants was a deliberate one , said conference host mörbel .
changing words into deeds " we chose certain topics to get the dialogue started in the first place , " he said .
" if you want to include too many contrasting viewpoints , you can easily overload such a meeting .
therefore , i tried to be careful when i planned the conference .
but maybe i was too careful . " for mörbel , the conference was a starting point .
several more round-table discussions of this kind will follow in bonn , he said .
and it 's hoped that as the discussions develop , the participants will start being able to turn their words into deeds , wherever they work and whatever they do . " to meet like-minded people merely makes me all the more determined to stay on the same path and to encourage others to support work ethics which imply reliability and a sense of responsibility instead of a craving for power or money , " patt concluded . svenja üing -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.01.2006 opinion : merkel misses the mark in middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor may have gone too far while in jerusalem solidarity with israel may be second nature to germany .
but chancellor angela merkel may have gone a bit too far during her visit to jerusalem , according to dw 's peter philipp . ahead of her middle east visit , the chancellor already showed that she knows how to act on the diplomatic stage and that she 's not intimidated by difficult situations .
in jerusalem , she confirmed this impression again , although the timing for merkel 's visit was awkward : israeli prime minister sharon is still in a coma ; the election campaign has started ; the radical islamic hamas has been elected in the palestinian territories ; and the dispute over iran 's nuclear ambitions is smoldering in the background . that 's reason enough to delay a courtesy call .
but a german head of government 's debut visit in israel is part of the ritual between the two countries .
and after it was already delayed once because of sharon 's illness and foreign minister steinmeier 's cancellation of his visit due to a german intelligence service scandal , it was important that angela merkel went there .
what was more important was what she - as the first foreign politician to visit since the palestinian election - had to say about the vote : hamas must recognize israel 's right to exist , renounce violence and accept the peace process .
otherwise , foreign - especially european - support would be unthinkable .
the message does n't only stem from germany 's special relationship to israel , but also from foreign countries ' genuine concern about continuation of the peace process .
back in time ?
hamas ' election victory threatens to turn back the wheels of history , and aid to the palestinians could - as it was before the oslo accords - be construed once again as supporting the fight against israel .
the europeans wo n't allow that .
who could be more apt than than angela merkel to say that , as germany contributes the biggest chunk of the eu 's 500 million euros -lrb- $ 609 million -rrb- in aid to the palestinians ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president has provoked outrage in west with his comments but in another respect , the chancellor may have gone a bit too far in her solidarity with israel .
however , the europeans ' lack of a concept in dealing with the question of iran 's nuclear policy may be to blame .
although the europeans fluctuate between criticism , threat and coaxing , merkel said that iran was a " threat to the democratic countries of this earth . "
she surely reflected israeli beliefs , but her comments missed the mark .
criticism is certainly warranted of iranian president ahmadinejad 's diatribes against israel as well as his unspeakable remarks about the holocaust .
and to a certain degree , distrust towards tehran 's real nuclear plans may be warranted .

meanwhile angela merkel called iran " a threat " to democracy on sunday . iran 's foreign ministry insisted on sunday that the only solution to the standoff with the west over its nuclear program is through negotiations and not a referral to the united nations security council .
tehran threatened to halt " all voluntary cooperation " with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- if the west decides to pass the case on to the un . tehran , which decided to resume uranium enrichment research despite international objection , has defended its nuclear activity saying it only wants to make fuel for civil atomic power .
the west fears the project masks a secret nuclear weapons program . " all our friends in europe and the iaea board know the islamic republic 's position : referring the case to or informing the un security council will lead to iran stopping all voluntary cooperation , " foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told a news conference . the west , however , is sticking to its hard line that a draft composed by britain , france and germany at an emergency meeting in london on monday includes the suggestion to ask the iaea to refer the matter to the security council .
although the eu trio has spent two and a half years negotiating with tehran over its atomic program , they say time is running out and are seriously considering putting the issue up for a vote on economic sanctions . merkel gets tough and calls iran a threat to democratic world in germany , where politicians have been cautious on the issue , the rhetoric became audibly more stringent over the weekend with chancellor angela merkel taking the hardest line yet in her words on the issue . merkel said at the start of her first visit to israel on sunday that iran threatens not only the jewish state but the entire democratic world .
" iran is not just a threat to israel , but also to the democratic countries of this world . " adding that both germany and israel shared the same view on iran 's ambitions , merkel said : " i do n't see the slightest difference in the views of germany and israel .
it is clear that iran should not get the ability to enrich uranium . " merkel also condemned iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad for his anti-israeli remarks .
ahmadinejad has said the jewish state should be " wiped off the map " and doubted that six million jews had been killed by the nazis during world war ii .
" it 's unacceptable that iran 's president rejects and falsifies history , " she said . acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert thanked merkel for supporting israel on the question of iran 's nuclear program .
" i would ... like to thank you for your position on iran .

he added : " i 'm aware of the criticisms that iran is using tricks and playing for time – and i ca n't seriously deny them . " german defense minister franz josef jung also left open the possibility of sanctions .

tehran threatened to halt " all voluntary cooperation " with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- if the west decides to pass the case on to the un . tehran , which decided to resume uranium enrichment research despite international objection , has defended its nuclear activity saying it only wants to make fuel for civil atomic power .
the west fears the project masks a secret nuclear weapons program . " all our friends in europe and the iaea board know the islamic republic 's position : referring the case to or informing the un security council will lead to iran stopping all voluntary cooperation , " foreign minister manouchehr mottaki told a news conference . the west , however , is sticking to its hard line that a draft composed by britain , france and germany at an emergency meeting in london on monday includes the suggestion to ask the iaea to refer the matter to the security council .
although the eu trio has spent two and a half years negotiating with tehran over its atomic program , they say time is running out and are seriously considering putting the issue up for a vote on economic sanctions . merkel gets tough and calls iran a threat to democratic world in germany , where politicians have been cautious on the issue , the rhetoric became audibly more stringent over the weekend with chancellor angela merkel taking the hardest line yet in her words on the issue . merkel said at the start of her first visit to israel on sunday that iran threatens not only the jewish state but the entire democratic world .
" iran is not just a threat to israel , but also to the democratic countries of this world . " adding that both germany and israel shared the same view on iran 's ambitions , merkel said : " i do n't see the slightest difference in the views of germany and israel .
it is clear that iran should not get the ability to enrich uranium . " merkel also condemned iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad for his anti-israeli remarks .
ahmadinejad has said the jewish state should be " wiped off the map " and doubted that six million jews had been killed by the nazis during world war ii .
" it 's unacceptable that iran 's president rejects and falsifies history , " she said . acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert thanked merkel for supporting israel on the question of iran 's nuclear program .
" i would ... like to thank you for your position on iran .
it is a topic that causes great concern here in israel , " he said . a case for sanctions ? earlier at the weekend , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier suggested a tougher german line by saying it would be unwise to rule out economic sanctions . in an interview with the german weekly magazine der spiegel , the minister said " the latest signals from tehran are contradictory at best . "
he added : " i 'm aware of the criticisms that iran is using tricks and playing for time – and i ca n't seriously deny them . " german defense minister franz josef jung also left open the possibility of sanctions .
speaking to the frankfurter allgemeinen sonntagszeitung , he said if russia and china went along with the strategy , economic sanctions could be effective in convincing iran to give up its " obvious intentions of developing atomic weapons . " iran calls for diplomacy in a last-ditch effort to avoid a un referral and sanctions , iran called for talks with britain , france and germany in brussels on monday .
javad vaeedi , deputy head of iran 's supreme national security council , will meet diplomats from the eu-3 . " europeans should be patient and try to find a formula to resolve this nuclear issue , " said foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi .
" we are determined to remove any ambiguities over our nuclear ambitions and also protect our right . " in the past iran has repeatedly said it would never abandon its drive to enrich uranium – a necessary step for developing nuclear power reactors and , when highly enriched , nuclear bombs . the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors will hear arguments on feb .
2 from the eu-3 and the united states as well as from russia and china who fear an escalation of the crisis and un economic sanctions against iran . dw staff -lrb- ktz / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clock ticks in iran nuclear standoff unless iran changes its stance on nuclear enrichment , it has little chance of avoiding a un security council referral , said british foreign secretary straw ahead of talks aimed to get iran to cooperate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.01.2006 european parliamentarians stand up against homophobia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still not embraced by all of europe religious leaders and conservatives rejected the european parliament 's resolution against homophobia , but others hailed it as an important signal to eu countries where gays and lesbians still face discrimination . an overwhelming majority of eu parliamentarians adopted the resolution , which urges member states to grant gay people " the same respect , dignity and protection as the rest of society . " the document came about because of " a series of worrying events -lrb- that -rrb- has recently taken place in a number of member states , " such as bans on gay pride marches , hate speeches by political and religious leaders , breaking up of demonstrations by police , homophobic violence and constitutional amendments prohibiting same-sex unions . catholic leaders immediately criticized the resolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church opposes violence against gays but does not support gay unions " the declaration shows an aversion for certain values of our tradition , notably religious values , " aldo giordano , the secretary-general of the council of european bishops ' conferences , told vatican radio .
" such resolutions risk delegitimizing the european parliament .
it should be clear that certain subjects , especially those relating to the family , are not within the direct competence of the european union but are the recognized competence of nations . " that argument was echoed by those opposing the resolution in parliament . " i think that this is a case of europe getting involved in things that are none of europe 's business , " said angelika niebler , one of 27 conservative german members of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- who voted against the declaration . an essential reaction to homophobia ? while an eu directive requires member states to protect gay people against discrimination regarding employment , national laws vary widely in other areas .
while a range of countries , including belgium , britain , denmark , france , germany and spain , have legalized gay civil unions , others are far from doing so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia is not the most gay-friendly place in europe in latvia , for example , the eu anti-discrimination directive has not been implemented and a constitutional amendment defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman . " the situation is a bleak one , " said ilze brands kehris , the director of the latvian center for human rights and ethnic studies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.01.2006 european parliamentarians stand up against homophobia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still not embraced by all of europe religious leaders and conservatives rejected the european parliament 's resolution against homophobia , but others hailed it as an important signal to eu countries where gays and lesbians still face discrimination . an overwhelming majority of eu parliamentarians adopted the resolution , which urges member states to grant gay people " the same respect , dignity and protection as the rest of society . " the document came about because of " a series of worrying events -lrb- that -rrb- has recently taken place in a number of member states , " such as bans on gay pride marches , hate speeches by political and religious leaders , breaking up of demonstrations by police , homophobic violence and constitutional amendments prohibiting same-sex unions . catholic leaders immediately criticized the resolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church opposes violence against gays but does not support gay unions " the declaration shows an aversion for certain values of our tradition , notably religious values , " aldo giordano , the secretary-general of the council of european bishops ' conferences , told vatican radio .
" such resolutions risk delegitimizing the european parliament .
it should be clear that certain subjects , especially those relating to the family , are not within the direct competence of the european union but are the recognized competence of nations . " that argument was echoed by those opposing the resolution in parliament . " i think that this is a case of europe getting involved in things that are none of europe 's business , " said angelika niebler , one of 27 conservative german members of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- who voted against the declaration . an essential reaction to homophobia ? while an eu directive requires member states to protect gay people against discrimination regarding employment , national laws vary widely in other areas .
while a range of countries , including belgium , britain , denmark , france , germany and spain , have legalized gay civil unions , others are far from doing so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia is not the most gay-friendly place in europe in latvia , for example , the eu anti-discrimination directive has not been implemented and a constitutional amendment defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman . " the situation is a bleak one , " said ilze brands kehris , the director of the latvian center for human rights and ethnic studies .

" we have reiterated our belief and our attachment to the freedom of the press and freedom of expression as part of our fundamental values , " austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik told journalists monday after chairing a meeting with her european union colleagues . " we have equally referred to the religious beliefs that are to be respected in our societies as fundamental values as well , " she added . cartoons portraying the prophet mohammed wearing a time-bomb shaped turban , published in a danish newspaper last september and reprinted in a norwegian magazine in january , have sparked uproar in the muslim world where images of the prophet are considered blasphemous . the row has taken a new dimension over the past days , with danish flags being burnt , products being boycotted and copenhagen starting to take measures to protect its citizens living in muslim countries . plassnik said that the eu " strongly rejects " threats to its citizens and that : " we do hope that this issue can be solved through constructive dialogue between the parties involved " . eu foreign policy chief javier solana insisted that the eu did not want to hurt anybody . " we have condemned any expression or acts that attempt to demonize any religion and that is what we try to convey to the leaders of the arab world -lrb- and -rrb- the islamic world , " he added . muslim boycott of danish products egypt 's powerful opposition muslim brotherhood on monday was the latest group to join a chorus of calls for the boycott of danish and norwegian products . the incident has threatened to deal an unprecedented blow to the muslim and arab world 's usually healthy relations with scandinavian governments , who are major donors in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sorry we do n't sell products made in denmark " reads a sign in a supermarket in saudi arabia retailers in the gulf have already started pulling danish and norwegian products off the shelves and danish manufacturers have voiced their concern should the boycott gain further momentum . " double standards " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson warned a saudi official during a meeting in the swiss ski resort of davos that any boycott of danish products was tantamount to a boycott of european goods . mandelson 's spokesman warned riyadh it could have to take the matter to the world trade organisation if the saudi government encouraged the boycott . arab league secretary general amr mussa , in tunis for a meeting of arab interior ministers , decried the " double standards " in the european media .

9 , veers away from the sex and sizzle which dominanted last year 's fare , to focus on political themes .
the stars will be out in full force though . keeping in mind last year 's sex-and porn-themed berlin film festival which spurred at least one tabloid to dub it " sexinale , " berlinale director dieter kosslick is skirting clear of controversy this time . speaking at a packed press conference in berlin on monday , kosslick said the festival , which runs from feb .
9 to feb .
19 , did n't have a formal motto , but was more serious in its focus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosslick says this year 's berlinale will be more serious in tone and content " i know sex , football and politics was big last time , " kosslick said .
" but this time , if there is a trend , then it 's definitely political .
all around the world , there 's a very strong tendency of political cinema , one that 's close to reality and shows a tough world , and i 'm glad that the berlinale is taking part in it . " the political theme runs through almost all sections of the berlinale this time .
" syriana , " a political thriller starring george clooney is being screened out of competition .
" bye bye berlusconi ! " a satire by jan henrik stahlberg will feature in the panorama section and british michael winterbottom 's " the road to guantanamo " about three muslims held up at the us lockup in cuba will show in the competition section . asked whether the latter was a comment on the iraq war and us policies , kosslick said it was rather " a statement for human rights . " if i had my way , then i 'd meet the 450 guantanamo inmates , who are being held there in violation of every human right and are tortured , on the red carpet during the screening of the film , " kosslick added .
" but unfortunately i ca n't . " bigger tha n ever in addition to promising some seriously thought-provoking fare , this year 's berlinale , which is the first of europe 's three major festivals in the new year , has gotten even bigger , reflecting its surging popularity amid germany 's economic stagnation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlinale offers a mind-boggling array of events and shows kosslick and his staff went through a record 4,000 films submitted to pick the 400 for the main competition and various sidebar events . a total number of 26 films are in the competition section , 19 of them will compete for the golden and silver bears and 17 films are world premieres . a record number of 18,000 film buyers , sellers , producers , directors and actors as well as journalists from around the world will also be thronging the screenings and press conferences around the glitzy potsdamer platz in downtown berlin . reconfirming the festival 's reputation as a launching pad for hollywood and european films at the start of the year , beki probst , head of the festival 's european film market , where buyers and sellers from around the world gather , said the section had won lots of new customers from the us , asia as well as within europe .
the film market has shown a 45 percent increase this year with 254 companies attending . " it 's definitely established berlin as an important place , " probst said .
" now the feeling is ' berlin is a must ' . " four germa n e n tries kosslick , who is in his fifth year as berlinale director and is credited with boosting german film , has stayed true to his reputation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book cover of michel houellebecq 's " elementary particles " this time , germany is entering the competition with four films : oskar röhler 's " elementary particles , " an on-screen adaptation of french literary bad boy michael houellebecq 's tale of a sexually-obsessed person , matthias glasner 's " free will , " a story of a compulsive rapist , valeska grisebach 's " longing , " a picture about a love triangle set in the former communist east and a film about exorcism in 1970s west germany by hans-christian schmid , called " requiem . " " the four are absolutely justified .
they 're very different , " kosslick said , adding tongue-in-cheek : " if you do n't want to laugh to death , then you should go and see the german films . " star power true to its form , the berlinale this year will also draw in the stars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " my good friend george clooney , " is how kosslick describes the hollywood star berlin favorite george clooney , isabella rossellini , meryl streep , vin diesel , roberto benigni und claude chabrol among others will add some glamour to the berlin winter .

weaver is expected on the red carpet along with co-star alan rickman . away from the glamour and the buzz , kosslick said the festival , which costs an estimated 16 million euros -lrb- $ 19.5 million -rrb- , was financially well-secured too thanks to new sponsors .

rheumatoid arthritis is linked to over-production of the synovial tissue which lines the joints .
in lab tests , scientists found statins could induce the cells that produce this tissue to kill themselves .
the study , led by japan 's jichi medical school , features in the journal arthritis & rheumatism . "
the potential use of statins to reduce inflammation is a very interesting and exciting concept . "
ailsa bosworth statins have already been shown to induce cell death - or apoptosis - in both normal cells and tumour cells .
the japanese team found a particular type of statin , fluvastatin , could produce the same effect on synovial cells taken from people with rheumatoid arthritis .
however , the drug had no effect on cells taken from people with another form of arthritis called oestoarthropathy .
higher concentration the concentrations of statins used in the experiment were much higher than those that would normally be prescribed to patients .
the researchers said it was possible that lower concentrations of the drugs may have a similar effect on patients , but accept that more work is needed .
dr madeleine devey , medical adviser to the arthritis research campaign , said : " there have been several studies on the potential anti-inflammatory effects of statins in rheumatoid arthritis .
" this interesting paper suggests a possible mechanism for these effects supporting their potential benefit in treatment . "
ailsa bosworth , of the national rheumatoid arthritis society , said much good work was currently being done to try to minimise the inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis , including the introduction of anti-tnf drugs .
" the potential use of statins to reduce inflammation is a very interesting and exciting concept . "
heart study the role of statins in treating people with rheumatoid arthritis is to be studied further in a major trial funded by the arthritis research campaign and the british heart foundation .
more than 3,500 patients with rheumatoid arthritis are to take part in the study , which is designed to find out if statins will cut the numbers dying from heart attacks and strokes .
people with rheumatoid arthritis face an increased risk of dying from cardiovascular complications compared with the general population .
but despite this , few are routinely prescribed statins .
doctors taking part in the trial say that if , as expected , statins were shown to reduce cardiovascular deaths in rheumatoid arthritis patients , then most patients with the condition should be routinely put on the drugs .

rheumatoid arthritis is linked to over-production of the synovial tissue which lines the joints .
in lab tests , scientists found statins could induce the cells that produce this tissue to kill themselves .
the study , led by japan 's jichi medical school , features in the journal arthritis & rheumatism .
the potential use of statins to reduce inflammation is a very interesting and exciting concept .
ailsa bosworth statins have already been shown to induce cell death - or apoptosis - in both normal cells and tumour cells .
the japanese team found a particular type of statin , fluvastatin , could produce the same effect on synovial cells taken from people with rheumatoid arthritis .
however , the drug had no effect on cells taken from people with another form of arthritis called oestoarthropathy .
higher concentration the concentrations of statins used in the experiment were much higher than those that would normally be prescribed to patients .
the researchers said it was possible that lower concentrations of the drugs may have a similar effect on patients , but accept that more work is needed .
dr madeleine devey , medical adviser to the arthritis research campaign , said : " there have been several studies on the potential anti-inflammatory effects of statins in rheumatoid arthritis .
" this interesting paper suggests a possible mechanism for these effects supporting their potential benefit in treatment . "
ailsa bosworth , of the national rheumatoid arthritis society , said much good work was currently being done to try to minimise the inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis , including the introduction of anti-tnf drugs .
" the potential use of statins to reduce inflammation is a very interesting and exciting concept . "
heart study the role of statins in treating people with rheumatoid arthritis is to be studied further in a major trial funded by the arthritis research campaign and the british heart foundation .
more than 3,500 patients with rheumatoid arthritis are to take part in the study , which is designed to find out if statins will cut the numbers dying from heart attacks and strokes .
people with rheumatoid arthritis face an increased risk of dying from cardiovascular complications compared with the general population .
but despite this , few are routinely prescribed statins .
doctors taking part in the trial say that if , as expected , statins were shown to reduce cardiovascular deaths in rheumatoid arthritis patients , then most patients with the condition should be routinely put on the drugs .

geraint davies is head of a new committee to control flood risk in wales which starts work on 1 april .
mr davies said the body 's work would be " critical " to meet the challenges of climate change and the rise in sea level over the coming years .
he wants people with an interest in the issue from across wales to help .
half a million people in wales live and work in areas at risk of flooding and the estimated cost of damage is projected to increase from £ 70m to £ 1.4bn by 2080 , said mr davies .
more than 170,000 homes , businesses , roads , railways , together with thousands of acres of farmland , lie in flood risk areas in the country . "
our priority is to protect people and property from the growing risk of flooding " geraint davies the new flood risk management wales committee has been set up by the welsh assembly government .
it is an executive committee of environment agency wales and will have an budget of £ 32m .
mr davies said : " global warming and climate change are now generally understood but the possible risks to jobs , homes and natural habitats from flooding are not .
" the effect of climate change is a major challenge we face which can contribute to the increased frequency and intensity of flooding . "
' protect people ' he said authorities must shift their focus beyond the traditional emphasis on building and maintaining flood defences .
" we need to look at how we manage the land and ensure that local communities have their day .
" our priority is to protect people and property from the growing risk of flooding , " mr davies added .
people from all walks of life - including industry , farming , community work and conservation - are being sought to take up either two-year or four-year appointments on flood risk management wales .
" we need a range of experience on the committee so that the decisions that we make are balanced and in the best interests . "

the move is part of a new " look behind the label " campaign which aims to inform shoppers of the way the group sources its products .
adverts will also highlight moves to cut salt and fat in m & s foods , recycle packaging and protect animal welfare .
the move comes as uk consumers are showing an increasing appetite for so-called fair trade products .
last year , figures released by the fairtrade foundation showed sales of ethical products grew by more than 50 % during 2004 .
shopper conscience meanwhile , a survey commissioned by m & s showed almost a third of shoppers had put clothes back on the rails amid concerns about their origins . "

on the food front , one in five shoppers had left goods on the shelves as a result of concerns about where they had come from or how it was made , the poll discovered .
" customers want good value , but they care more than ever how food and clothing products are made , " said m & s chief executive stuart rose .
" launching fairtrade cotton builds on our innovative work in areas such as sustainable fishing , reducing fats , salts and additives in our food and banning harmful chemicals from children 's clothing . "
supply constraints limited stock of fairtrade cotton means that initially the new m & s range will only consist of men 's and women 's t-shirts and socks and be stocked at just 40 stores .
however , mr rose vowed to extend the number of stores carrying the clothing line when more supplies of fairtrade cotton became available - if there was sufficient demand .
" we 'll see how it goes , it 's a bit like the introduction of organic foods some years ago - let 's test the market , " he told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
the cotton comes from farmers in the gujarat region of india who are given a stable price for their cotton , plus a fairtrade premium that should enable them to improve their working and living conditions .
while m & s will become the " first major retailer " to sell a fairtrade clothing range when the goods go on sale in march , mr rose added that it was " unlikely " that the chain 's whole clothing range would become fairtrade .
