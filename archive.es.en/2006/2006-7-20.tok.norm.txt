dw-world.de spoke to the foreign policy expert for germany 's green party , kerstin müller , on the world 's obligation to do more in the war-torn region . dw-world.de : you called for a clear signal at the donor conference for darfur held in brussels this week .
what should it look like ? first of all , there needs to be a clear signal demanding an end to the violence .
since 2003 , a civil war has been raging there .
the janjaweed militia , armed by the khartoum government , continues to terrorize the population with violence , displacing them .
mass rapes are on the daily agenda . in the meantime , 2 million people live in refugee camps .
almost 300,000 have died .
some people even talk of genocide .
the international community is responsible here to send clear signals to both sides that the violence must end . how can the international community pressure the sudanese government to accept a un mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2 million people have been displaced from their homes in darfur so far , an african union force has tried to protect the population .
unfortunately , they do n't have the ability to do so .
so it 's been decided that the united nations should take over here by the end of the year at the latest .
but the sudanese government wo n't agree to such a un mission in darfur .
we need this mission , though , and with a strong mandate , which is truly in a position to protect the population . i expect the german government and the international community to exert pressure on the sudanese government to agree to such a un mission .
if that is n't enough , then individual-related sanctions should be implemented , for example against the president or certain members of the government .
this is possible according to un resolutions .
but it is n't practiced , unfortunately , also not by the europeans .
these would be instruments which could force the khartoum government to consent and then quickly bring a un mission into the country . why is it so difficult for the international community to officially call the crimes in darfur genocide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller has visited the region several times last year , there was a united nations fact-finding committee .
it spoke of serious crimes against humanity , but said it could not determine genocide .
it could n't prove this of the khartoum government .
i have been in the region several times .
it is very clear to me that this is also about ethnic displacement and on a large scale , in which the janjaweed militia is armed by the government and receives support , for example through bombings and military flights .
so this is clearly a case of the most serious crimes against humanity .
i would even speak of a sneaking genocide . in my opinion , the international community is obligated and responsible .
kofi annan has repeatedly pointed this out .
for me , this is a very important conflict .
there ca n't be a second rwanda .
i am concerned that just because this is n't about europe or the middle east , but africa , that one looks away or is of the opinion that the africans should solve this themselves .
but they are not in a position to do so , as you can see from the african union mission .
we also have the responsibility to protect people in africa . naser shrouf interviewed kerstin müller -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato foreign ministers discuss darfur , expansion expansion of the military alliance and cooperation with other states to fight terrorism were on the agenda for nato foreign ministers during their meeting in april .
-lrb- april 26 , 2006 -rrb- " the stronger the eu forces become , the better " in an interview with dw-world.de , victoria nuland , us permanent representative to nato , spoke about the ongoing activities of the north atlantic treaty organization as well as plans for its future expansion .
-lrb- april 11 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : helping africa is europe 's political and moral duty horst köhler is convinced that africa 's ideas will solve africa 's problem .
that conviction marked the choice of countries he visited during his second trip to the continent as germany 's president .
-lrb- april 12 , 2006 -rrb- feedback how should the international community be involved in peacekeeping in darfur ?

a train station in haifa after a hit by a hezbollah missile while clear evidence exists that iran supports hezbollah militarily , the movement does not really pose a threat to israel , middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de. joche n hippler teaches a n d researches at the i n stitute for developme n t a n d peace -lrb- inef -rrb- at duisburg-esse n u n iversity . dw-world.de : militarily speaki n g , how stro n g is hezbollah ? jochen hippler : the problem is that we only get information about its military might indirectly via western and israeli secret service circles .
that means that we can not check how reliable the information is .
you have to keep that in mind when speaking about hezbollah .
having said that , it 's possible to say that hezbollah is an important military factor within lebanon , but it 's a third-rate power by international comparison .
estimates say that there are about 2,000 to 5,000 people in the militia and about 500 to 700 military personnel that have received training .
that 's quite a lot for lebanon .
but compared to syria or israel , it 's a negligible number . what ki n d of weapo n s does hezbollah have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hezbollah gunman aims his ak-47 hand guns and ak-47 , i.e. kalashnikovs , are standard in the region .
there are estimates that hezbollah has about 8,000 to 10,000 katyusha rockets that have a range of about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- and a few iranian-built missiles that are said to have a range of up to 60 , 70 kilometers .
that can not be proven for sure because of the problematic sources .
on top of that , there are obviously air defense missiles . there has bee n talk about hezbollah 's n ew military stre n gth over the last couple of days .
is this justified ? i think that 's exaggerated and propaganda .
if you wage war against lebanon because of two kidnapped israeli soldiers , of course it 's necessary to justify this war .
to justify the destruction of lebanese infrastructure by saying that two israeli soldiers have been kidnapped is n't really convincing - especially when keeping in mind that israel has imprisoned up to 10,000 palestinians .
that 's why it 's necessary to emphasize hezbollah 's threat .
when all is said and done , hezbollah can not do much more harm than a pin prick - albeit a painful one . are fears that tel aviv could be hit by hezbollah missiles exaggerated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli airstrike hits the center of the southern suburbs of beirut in principle , tel aviv should be beyond reach .
but we have to think about what we mean when we talk about missiles .
there are missiles of the kind that have been launched in afghanistan or also in lebanon .
they are self-made .
they do n't have more explosive force than a hand grenade or a relatively small explosive charge .
it 's clearly horrific when one is hit with it , but it has a largely symbolic significance in terms of the strategic balance of power .
you can scare and kill people with it .
but it can not be compared to 200 daily air raids on lebanon and the threat to bomb the country back 20 to 30 years .
when we look at the middle east conflict , we have to realize that of course both the arab and the israeli players have blood on their hands .
if we look at the current , concrete situation in lebanon , it 's fairly clear that the israeli position is violating international law . what role does ira n play i n supporti n g hezbollah militarily ? neither iran nor hezbollah make a big fuss about their cooperation .
what we hear , we hear from israeli or western secret service circles .
according to this information , iran does indeed seem to support hezbollah financially - that 's not in doubt .
iran also seems to have delivered weapons and missiles with a range of up to 70 kilometers - there 's clear evidence for that .
but we can not really prove whether the missiles come from iran directly or whether they have reached hezbollah via middlemen . what about syria ? the syrian role is not clear .
in the past there has been a strong tactical support for hezbollah from syria .
that 's maybe a little confusing as the syrian dictatorship is actually a completely secular one and has nothing to do with shiite extremism .
still , the islamist movement hezbollah has received support .
politically speaking , syrian president assad has more or less sided with hezbollah .
since the withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon , it 's not quite clear whether they are just loudmouthed or whether there 's more to it than verbal radicalism . steffen leidel interviewed jochen hippler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreigners flee lebanon amid calls for " humanitarian corridor " germany has pledged one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in emergency aid for lebanon as some 3,000 germans and thousands of other nationals still wait to leave the war-shattered country .
-lrb- july 19 , 2006 -rrb- experts : eu mediation in middle east requires a common line the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .
yet time is running out for international diplomatic intervention .
what role could the european union play in the negotiation process ?
-lrb- july 18 , 2006 -rrb- what drives hezbollah ?
who has what interests in the escalation of violence in the middle east following a phase of relative quiet ?

there are estimates that hezbollah has about 8,000 to 10,000 katyusha rockets that have a range of about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- and a few iranian-built missiles that are said to have a range of up to 60 , 70 kilometers .
that can not be proven for sure because of the problematic sources .
on top of that , there are obviously air defense missiles . there has bee n talk about hezbollah 's n ew military stre n gth over the last couple of days .
is this justified ? i think that 's exaggerated and propaganda .
if you wage war against lebanon because of two kidnapped israeli soldiers , of course it 's necessary to justify this war .
to justify the destruction of lebanese infrastructure by saying that two israeli soldiers have been kidnapped is n't really convincing - especially when keeping in mind that israel has imprisoned up to 10,000 palestinians .
that 's why it 's necessary to emphasize hezbollah 's threat .
when all is said and done , hezbollah can not do much more harm than a pin prick - albeit a painful one . are fears that tel aviv could be hit by hezbollah missiles exaggerated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli airstrike hits the center of the southern suburbs of beirut in principle , tel aviv should be beyond reach .
but we have to think about what we mean when we talk about missiles .
there are missiles of the kind that have been launched in afghanistan or also in lebanon .
they are self-made .
they do n't have more explosive force than a hand grenade or a relatively small explosive charge .
it 's clearly horrific when one is hit with it , but it has a largely symbolic significance in terms of the strategic balance of power .
you can scare and kill people with it .
but it can not be compared to 200 daily air raids on lebanon and the threat to bomb the country back 20 to 30 years .
when we look at the middle east conflict , we have to realize that of course both the arab and the israeli players have blood on their hands .
if we look at the current , concrete situation in lebanon , it 's fairly clear that the israeli position is violating international law . what role does ira n play i n supporti n g hezbollah militarily ? neither iran nor hezbollah make a big fuss about their cooperation .
what we hear , we hear from israeli or western secret service circles .
according to this information , iran does indeed seem to support hezbollah financially - that 's not in doubt .
iran also seems to have delivered weapons and missiles with a range of up to 70 kilometers - there 's clear evidence for that .
but we can not really prove whether the missiles come from iran directly or whether they have reached hezbollah via middlemen . what about syria ? the syrian role is not clear .
in the past there has been a strong tactical support for hezbollah from syria .
that 's maybe a little confusing as the syrian dictatorship is actually a completely secular one and has nothing to do with shiite extremism .
still , the islamist movement hezbollah has received support .
politically speaking , syrian president assad has more or less sided with hezbollah .
since the withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon , it 's not quite clear whether they are just loudmouthed or whether there 's more to it than verbal radicalism . steffen leidel interviewed jochen hippler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreigners flee lebanon amid calls for " humanitarian corridor " germany has pledged one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in emergency aid for lebanon as some 3,000 germans and thousands of other nationals still wait to leave the war-shattered country .

a train station in haifa after a hit by a hezbollah missile while clear evidence exists that iran supports hezbollah militarily , the movement does not really pose a threat to israel , middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de. joche n hippler teaches a n d researches at the i n stitute for developme n t a n d peace -lrb- inef -rrb- at duisburg-esse n u n iversity . dw-world.de : militarily speaki n g , how stro n g is hezbollah ? jochen hippler : the problem is that we only get information about its military might indirectly via western and israeli secret service circles .
that means that we can not check how reliable the information is .
you have to keep that in mind when speaking about hezbollah .
having said that , it 's possible to say that hezbollah is an important military factor within lebanon , but it 's a third-rate power by international comparison .
estimates say that there are about 2,000 to 5,000 people in the militia and about 500 to 700 military personnel that have received training .

dw-world.de spoke to the foreign policy expert for germany 's green party , kerstin müller , on the world 's obligation to do more in the war-torn region . dw-world.de : you called for a clear signal at the donor conference for darfur held in brussels this week .
what should it look like ? first of all , there needs to be a clear signal demanding an end to the violence .
since 2003 , a civil war has been raging there .
the janjaweed militia , armed by the khartoum government , continues to terrorize the population with violence , displacing them .
mass rapes are on the daily agenda . in the meantime , 2 million people live in refugee camps .
almost 300,000 have died .
some people even talk of genocide .
the international community is responsible here to send clear signals to both sides that the violence must end . how can the international community pressure the sudanese government to accept a un mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2 million people have been displaced from their homes in darfur so far , an african union force has tried to protect the population .
unfortunately , they do n't have the ability to do so .
so it 's been decided that the united nations should take over here by the end of the year at the latest .
but the sudanese government wo n't agree to such a un mission in darfur .
we need this mission , though , and with a strong mandate , which is truly in a position to protect the population . i expect the german government and the international community to exert pressure on the sudanese government to agree to such a un mission .
if that is n't enough , then individual-related sanctions should be implemented , for example against the president or certain members of the government .
this is possible according to un resolutions .
but it is n't practiced , unfortunately , also not by the europeans .
these would be instruments which could force the khartoum government to consent and then quickly bring a un mission into the country . why is it so difficult for the international community to officially call the crimes in darfur genocide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller has visited the region several times last year , there was a united nations fact-finding committee .
it spoke of serious crimes against humanity , but said it could not determine genocide .
it could n't prove this of the khartoum government .
i have been in the region several times .
it is very clear to me that this is also about ethnic displacement and on a large scale , in which the janjaweed militia is armed by the government and receives support , for example through bombings and military flights .
so this is clearly a case of the most serious crimes against humanity .
i would even speak of a sneaking genocide . in my opinion , the international community is obligated and responsible .
kofi annan has repeatedly pointed this out .
for me , this is a very important conflict .
there ca n't be a second rwanda .
i am concerned that just because this is n't about europe or the middle east , but africa , that one looks away or is of the opinion that the africans should solve this themselves .
but they are not in a position to do so , as you can see from the african union mission .
we also have the responsibility to protect people in africa . naser shrouf interviewed kerstin müller -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato foreign ministers discuss darfur , expansion expansion of the military alliance and cooperation with other states to fight terrorism were on the agenda for nato foreign ministers during their meeting in april .

some people even talk of genocide .
the international community is responsible here to send clear signals to both sides that the violence must end . how can the international community pressure the sudanese government to accept a un mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2 million people have been displaced from their homes in darfur so far , an african union force has tried to protect the population .
unfortunately , they do n't have the ability to do so .
so it 's been decided that the united nations should take over here by the end of the year at the latest .
but the sudanese government wo n't agree to such a un mission in darfur .
we need this mission , though , and with a strong mandate , which is truly in a position to protect the population . i expect the german government and the international community to exert pressure on the sudanese government to agree to such a un mission .
if that is n't enough , then individual-related sanctions should be implemented , for example against the president or certain members of the government .
this is possible according to un resolutions .
but it is n't practiced , unfortunately , also not by the europeans .
these would be instruments which could force the khartoum government to consent and then quickly bring a un mission into the country . why is it so difficult for the international community to officially call the crimes in darfur genocide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller has visited the region several times last year , there was a united nations fact-finding committee .
it spoke of serious crimes against humanity , but said it could not determine genocide .
it could n't prove this of the khartoum government .
i have been in the region several times .
it is very clear to me that this is also about ethnic displacement and on a large scale , in which the janjaweed militia is armed by the government and receives support , for example through bombings and military flights .
so this is clearly a case of the most serious crimes against humanity .
i would even speak of a sneaking genocide . in my opinion , the international community is obligated and responsible .
kofi annan has repeatedly pointed this out .
for me , this is a very important conflict .
there ca n't be a second rwanda .
i am concerned that just because this is n't about europe or the middle east , but africa , that one looks away or is of the opinion that the africans should solve this themselves .
but they are not in a position to do so , as you can see from the african union mission .
we also have the responsibility to protect people in africa . naser shrouf interviewed kerstin müller -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato foreign ministers discuss darfur , expansion expansion of the military alliance and cooperation with other states to fight terrorism were on the agenda for nato foreign ministers during their meeting in april .
-lrb- april 26 , 2006 -rrb- " the stronger the eu forces become , the better " in an interview with dw-world.de , victoria nuland , us permanent representative to nato , spoke about the ongoing activities of the north atlantic treaty organization as well as plans for its future expansion .
-lrb- april 11 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : helping africa is europe 's political and moral duty horst köhler is convinced that africa 's ideas will solve africa 's problem .
that conviction marked the choice of countries he visited during his second trip to the continent as germany 's president .

" it 's not negative like ahmadinejad 's letter to bush .
he is not criticising germany , " he told reuters .

the move is part of a major shakeup of the bmw 's management . the 50-year-old reithofer , who is currently the management board member responsible for production , is to take over from current chief executive helmut panke on sept .
1 , the company said in a statement .
the announcement followed a meeting of the carmaker 's board and comes in the wake of weeks of speculation about possible changes in the group 's upper management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new head of bmw " with this decision the supervisory board has determined the course of the company 's long-term management , " said board chairman joachim milberg .
with bmw 's flexible production system considered to be a model for the car industry , reithofer has long been considered to be a candidate to replace panke , who has presided over record earnings at the munich-based group .
bmw expects profits before tax to rise this year by 3.3 per cent to a record four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.05 billion -rrb- .
panke hits bmw retirement age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is panke too old to lead bmw ?
the german press has been speculating that panke 's contract was unlikely to be renewed when it runs out early next year because the company 's policy is for managers to retire at 60 .
panke , who turns 60 in august , had hoped that his contract would be extended .
" i enjoy being captain , " he said last week .
however , senior bmw executives are understood to have signaled to panke some time ago that it was unlikely that his contract would be extended .
as part of the management restructuring , the company 's research and development chief burkhard göschel , who is 60 , is to bow out from his present post .
göschel is to be replaced by klaus draeger , who heads bmw 's limousine division .
reithofer 's current job is to go to frank-peter arndt , who currently heads bmw 's plant in the bavarian town of dingolfing .. dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pumps millions of euros into hydrogen-powered tech in an attempt to reduce environmental pollution , germany shifts into high-gear to produce cleaner vehicle technology .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.07.2006 " hezbollah ca n't do much more harm than a pin prick " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merely symbolic ?
a train station in haifa after a hit by a hezbollah missile while clear evidence exists that iran supports hezbollah militarily , the movement does not really pose a threat to israel , middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de. joche n hippler teaches a n d researches at the i n stitute for developme n t a n d peace -lrb- inef -rrb- at duisburg-esse n u n iversity . dw-world.de : militarily speaki n g , how stro n g is hezbollah ? jochen hippler : the problem is that we only get information about its military might indirectly via western and israeli secret service circles .
that means that we can not check how reliable the information is .
you have to keep that in mind when speaking about hezbollah .
having said that , it 's possible to say that hezbollah is an important military factor within lebanon , but it 's a third-rate power by international comparison .
estimates say that there are about 2,000 to 5,000 people in the militia and about 500 to 700 military personnel that have received training .
that 's quite a lot for lebanon .
but compared to syria or israel , it 's a negligible number . what ki n d of weapo n s does hezbollah have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hezbollah gunman aims his ak-47 hand guns and ak-47 , i.e. kalashnikovs , are standard in the region .
there are estimates that hezbollah has about 8,000 to 10,000 katyusha rockets that have a range of about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- and a few iranian-built missiles that are said to have a range of up to 60 , 70 kilometers .
that can not be proven for sure because of the problematic sources .
on top of that , there are obviously air defense missiles . there has bee n talk about hezbollah 's n ew military stre n gth over the last couple of days .
is this justified ? i think that 's exaggerated and propaganda .
if you wage war against lebanon because of two kidnapped israeli soldiers , of course it 's necessary to justify this war .
to justify the destruction of lebanese infrastructure by saying that two israeli soldiers have been kidnapped is n't really convincing - especially when keeping in mind that israel has imprisoned up to 10,000 palestinians .
that 's why it 's necessary to emphasize hezbollah 's threat .
when all is said and done , hezbollah can not do much more harm than a pin prick - albeit a painful one . are fears that tel aviv could be hit by hezbollah missiles exaggerated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli airstrike hits the center of the southern suburbs of beirut in principle , tel aviv should be beyond reach .
but we have to think about what we mean when we talk about missiles .
there are missiles of the kind that have been launched in afghanistan or also in lebanon .
they are self-made .
they do n't have more explosive force than a hand grenade or a relatively small explosive charge .
it 's clearly horrific when one is hit with it , but it has a largely symbolic significance in terms of the strategic balance of power .
you can scare and kill people with it .
but it can not be compared to 200 daily air raids on lebanon and the threat to bomb the country back 20 to 30 years .
when we look at the middle east conflict , we have to realize that of course both the arab and the israeli players have blood on their hands .
if we look at the current , concrete situation in lebanon , it 's fairly clear that the israeli position is violating international law . what role does ira n play i n supporti n g hezbollah militarily ? neither iran nor hezbollah make a big fuss about their cooperation .
what we hear , we hear from israeli or western secret service circles .
according to this information , iran does indeed seem to support hezbollah financially - that 's not in doubt .
iran also seems to have delivered weapons and missiles with a range of up to 70 kilometers - there 's clear evidence for that .
but we can not really prove whether the missiles come from iran directly or whether they have reached hezbollah via middlemen . what about syria ? the syrian role is not clear .
in the past there has been a strong tactical support for hezbollah from syria .
that 's maybe a little confusing as the syrian dictatorship is actually a completely secular one and has nothing to do with shiite extremism .
still , the islamist movement hezbollah has received support .
politically speaking , syrian president assad has more or less sided with hezbollah .
since the withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon , it 's not quite clear whether they are just loudmouthed or whether there 's more to it than verbal radicalism . steffen leidel interviewed jochen hippler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreigners flee lebanon amid calls for " humanitarian corridor " germany has pledged one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in emergency aid for lebanon as some 3,000 germans and thousands of other nationals still wait to leave the war-shattered country .
-lrb- july 19 , 2006 -rrb- experts : eu mediation in middle east requires a common line the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .
yet time is running out for international diplomatic intervention .

a train station in haifa after a hit by a hezbollah missile while clear evidence exists that iran supports hezbollah militarily , the movement does not really pose a threat to israel , middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de. joche n hippler teaches a n d researches at the i n stitute for developme n t a n d peace -lrb- inef -rrb- at duisburg-esse n u n iversity . dw-world.de : militarily speaki n g , how stro n g is hezbollah ? jochen hippler : the problem is that we only get information about its military might indirectly via western and israeli secret service circles .
that means that we can not check how reliable the information is .
you have to keep that in mind when speaking about hezbollah .
having said that , it 's possible to say that hezbollah is an important military factor within lebanon , but it 's a third-rate power by international comparison .
estimates say that there are about 2,000 to 5,000 people in the militia and about 500 to 700 military personnel that have received training .
that 's quite a lot for lebanon .
but compared to syria or israel , it 's a negligible number . what ki n d of weapo n s does hezbollah have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hezbollah gunman aims his ak-47 hand guns and ak-47 , i.e. kalashnikovs , are standard in the region .
there are estimates that hezbollah has about 8,000 to 10,000 katyusha rockets that have a range of about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- and a few iranian-built missiles that are said to have a range of up to 60 , 70 kilometers .
that can not be proven for sure because of the problematic sources .
on top of that , there are obviously air defense missiles . there has bee n talk about hezbollah 's n ew military stre n gth over the last couple of days .
is this justified ? i think that 's exaggerated and propaganda .
if you wage war against lebanon because of two kidnapped israeli soldiers , of course it 's necessary to justify this war .
to justify the destruction of lebanese infrastructure by saying that two israeli soldiers have been kidnapped is n't really convincing - especially when keeping in mind that israel has imprisoned up to 10,000 palestinians .
that 's why it 's necessary to emphasize hezbollah 's threat .
when all is said and done , hezbollah can not do much more harm than a pin prick - albeit a painful one . are fears that tel aviv could be hit by hezbollah missiles exaggerated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli airstrike hits the center of the southern suburbs of beirut in principle , tel aviv should be beyond reach .
but we have to think about what we mean when we talk about missiles .
there are missiles of the kind that have been launched in afghanistan or also in lebanon .
they are self-made .
they do n't have more explosive force than a hand grenade or a relatively small explosive charge .
it 's clearly horrific when one is hit with it , but it has a largely symbolic significance in terms of the strategic balance of power .
you can scare and kill people with it .
but it can not be compared to 200 daily air raids on lebanon and the threat to bomb the country back 20 to 30 years .
when we look at the middle east conflict , we have to realize that of course both the arab and the israeli players have blood on their hands .
if we look at the current , concrete situation in lebanon , it 's fairly clear that the israeli position is violating international law . what role does ira n play i n supporti n g hezbollah militarily ? neither iran nor hezbollah make a big fuss about their cooperation .
what we hear , we hear from israeli or western secret service circles .
according to this information , iran does indeed seem to support hezbollah financially - that 's not in doubt .
iran also seems to have delivered weapons and missiles with a range of up to 70 kilometers - there 's clear evidence for that .
but we can not really prove whether the missiles come from iran directly or whether they have reached hezbollah via middlemen . what about syria ? the syrian role is not clear .
in the past there has been a strong tactical support for hezbollah from syria .
that 's maybe a little confusing as the syrian dictatorship is actually a completely secular one and has nothing to do with shiite extremism .
still , the islamist movement hezbollah has received support .
politically speaking , syrian president assad has more or less sided with hezbollah .
since the withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon , it 's not quite clear whether they are just loudmouthed or whether there 's more to it than verbal radicalism . steffen leidel interviewed jochen hippler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreigners flee lebanon amid calls for " humanitarian corridor " germany has pledged one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in emergency aid for lebanon as some 3,000 germans and thousands of other nationals still wait to leave the war-shattered country .
-lrb- july 19 , 2006 -rrb- experts : eu mediation in middle east requires a common line the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .
yet time is running out for international diplomatic intervention .
what role could the european union play in the negotiation process ?

a train station in haifa after a hit by a hezbollah missile while clear evidence exists that iran supports hezbollah militarily , the movement does not really pose a threat to israel , middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de. joche n hippler teaches a n d researches at the i n stitute for developme n t a n d peace -lrb- inef -rrb- at duisburg-esse n u n iversity . dw-world.de : militarily speaki n g , how stro n g is hezbollah ? jochen hippler : the problem is that we only get information about its military might indirectly via western and israeli secret service circles .
that means that we can not check how reliable the information is .
you have to keep that in mind when speaking about hezbollah .
having said that , it 's possible to say that hezbollah is an important military factor within lebanon , but it 's a third-rate power by international comparison .
estimates say that there are about 2,000 to 5,000 people in the militia and about 500 to 700 military personnel that have received training .
that 's quite a lot for lebanon .
but compared to syria or israel , it 's a negligible number . what ki n d of weapo n s does hezbollah have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hezbollah gunman aims his ak-47 hand guns and ak-47 , i.e. kalashnikovs , are standard in the region .
there are estimates that hezbollah has about 8,000 to 10,000 katyusha rockets that have a range of about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- and a few iranian-built missiles that are said to have a range of up to 60 , 70 kilometers .
that can not be proven for sure because of the problematic sources .
on top of that , there are obviously air defense missiles . there has bee n talk about hezbollah 's n ew military stre n gth over the last couple of days .
is this justified ? i think that 's exaggerated and propaganda .
if you wage war against lebanon because of two kidnapped israeli soldiers , of course it 's necessary to justify this war .
to justify the destruction of lebanese infrastructure by saying that two israeli soldiers have been kidnapped is n't really convincing - especially when keeping in mind that israel has imprisoned up to 10,000 palestinians .
that 's why it 's necessary to emphasize hezbollah 's threat .
when all is said and done , hezbollah can not do much more harm than a pin prick - albeit a painful one . are fears that tel aviv could be hit by hezbollah missiles exaggerated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli airstrike hits the center of the southern suburbs of beirut in principle , tel aviv should be beyond reach .
but we have to think about what we mean when we talk about missiles .
there are missiles of the kind that have been launched in afghanistan or also in lebanon .
they are self-made .
they do n't have more explosive force than a hand grenade or a relatively small explosive charge .
it 's clearly horrific when one is hit with it , but it has a largely symbolic significance in terms of the strategic balance of power .
you can scare and kill people with it .
but it can not be compared to 200 daily air raids on lebanon and the threat to bomb the country back 20 to 30 years .
when we look at the middle east conflict , we have to realize that of course both the arab and the israeli players have blood on their hands .
if we look at the current , concrete situation in lebanon , it 's fairly clear that the israeli position is violating international law . what role does ira n play i n supporti n g hezbollah militarily ? neither iran nor hezbollah make a big fuss about their cooperation .
what we hear , we hear from israeli or western secret service circles .
according to this information , iran does indeed seem to support hezbollah financially - that 's not in doubt .
iran also seems to have delivered weapons and missiles with a range of up to 70 kilometers - there 's clear evidence for that .
but we can not really prove whether the missiles come from iran directly or whether they have reached hezbollah via middlemen . what about syria ? the syrian role is not clear .
in the past there has been a strong tactical support for hezbollah from syria .
that 's maybe a little confusing as the syrian dictatorship is actually a completely secular one and has nothing to do with shiite extremism .
still , the islamist movement hezbollah has received support .
politically speaking , syrian president assad has more or less sided with hezbollah .
since the withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon , it 's not quite clear whether they are just loudmouthed or whether there 's more to it than verbal radicalism . steffen leidel interviewed jochen hippler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreigners flee lebanon amid calls for " humanitarian corridor " germany has pledged one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in emergency aid for lebanon as some 3,000 germans and thousands of other nationals still wait to leave the war-shattered country .

dw-world.de spoke to the foreign policy expert for germany 's green party , kerstin müller , on the world 's obligation to do more in the war-torn region . dw-world.de : you called for a clear signal at the donor conference for darfur held in brussels this week .
what should it look like ? first of all , there needs to be a clear signal demanding an end to the violence .
since 2003 , a civil war has been raging there .
the janjaweed militia , armed by the khartoum government , continues to terrorize the population with violence , displacing them .
mass rapes are on the daily agenda . in the meantime , 2 million people live in refugee camps .
almost 300,000 have died .
some people even talk of genocide .
the international community is responsible here to send clear signals to both sides that the violence must end . how can the international community pressure the sudanese government to accept a un mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2 million people have been displaced from their homes in darfur so far , an african union force has tried to protect the population .
unfortunately , they do n't have the ability to do so .
so it 's been decided that the united nations should take over here by the end of the year at the latest .
but the sudanese government wo n't agree to such a un mission in darfur .
we need this mission , though , and with a strong mandate , which is truly in a position to protect the population . i expect the german government and the international community to exert pressure on the sudanese government to agree to such a un mission .
if that is n't enough , then individual-related sanctions should be implemented , for example against the president or certain members of the government .
this is possible according to un resolutions .
but it is n't practiced , unfortunately , also not by the europeans .
these would be instruments which could force the khartoum government to consent and then quickly bring a un mission into the country . why is it so difficult for the international community to officially call the crimes in darfur genocide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller has visited the region several times last year , there was a united nations fact-finding committee .
it spoke of serious crimes against humanity , but said it could not determine genocide .
it could n't prove this of the khartoum government .
i have been in the region several times .
it is very clear to me that this is also about ethnic displacement and on a large scale , in which the janjaweed militia is armed by the government and receives support , for example through bombings and military flights .
so this is clearly a case of the most serious crimes against humanity .
i would even speak of a sneaking genocide . in my opinion , the international community is obligated and responsible .
kofi annan has repeatedly pointed this out .
for me , this is a very important conflict .
there ca n't be a second rwanda .
i am concerned that just because this is n't about europe or the middle east , but africa , that one looks away or is of the opinion that the africans should solve this themselves .
but they are not in a position to do so , as you can see from the african union mission .
we also have the responsibility to protect people in africa . naser shrouf interviewed kerstin müller -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato foreign ministers discuss darfur , expansion expansion of the military alliance and cooperation with other states to fight terrorism were on the agenda for nato foreign ministers during their meeting in april .
-lrb- april 26 , 2006 -rrb- " the stronger the eu forces become , the better " in an interview with dw-world.de , victoria nuland , us permanent representative to nato , spoke about the ongoing activities of the north atlantic treaty organization as well as plans for its future expansion .
-lrb- april 11 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : helping africa is europe 's political and moral duty horst köhler is convinced that africa 's ideas will solve africa 's problem .
that conviction marked the choice of countries he visited during his second trip to the continent as germany 's president .

the iranian leader , who minces no words in his distrust of the west , took swipes at israel and the us . he lashed out at the us-led invasion of afghanistan and iraq , abuses of detainees in guantanamo bay and washington 's staunch support for israel .
he even admonished bush , a born-again christian , to be be more pious , saying that his actions were inconsistent with christian teachings . in contrast , the letter to merkel was different in tone - " not so confrontational , " the official said . " it 's not negative like ahmadinejad 's letter to bush .
he is not criticising germany , " he told reuters .

" there 's nothing about the nuclear issue -lrb- in the letter -rrb- , " a german government official told reuters on condition of anonymity . " it 's all related to germany and how we have to find a solution to the palestinian problems and zionism and so on .
it 's rather weird , " said the official who saw the letter on thursday . zionism is a political movement that supports a homeland for the jewish people in palestine , and lead to the establishment of the state of israel . a touchy subject the letter comes at a time when germany 's relations with iran have become more tense after ahmadinejad 's repeated denial of the holocaust .
again this week , he made comments questioning whether the holocaust was being used as a tool by the west to dominate the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is contemplating a response the german official who read the letter said it was an " extremely touchy " subject , and added that the government did not yet know if or how it would respond .

" holocaust denial is a crime in germany punishable with up to five years in prison . less confrontational than us letter in may , ahmadinejad wrote us president george w. bush an 18-page letter discussing religious values , history and international relations .
the iranian leader , who minces no words in his distrust of the west , took swipes at israel and the us . he lashed out at the us-led invasion of afghanistan and iraq , abuses of detainees in guantanamo bay and washington 's staunch support for israel .
he even admonished bush , a born-again christian , to be be more pious , saying that his actions were inconsistent with christian teachings . in contrast , the letter to merkel was different in tone - " not so confrontational , " the official said . " it 's not negative like ahmadinejad 's letter to bush .
he is not criticising germany , " he told reuters .
" it 's basically about how we have to work together and solve the problems of the world together . " no mention of nuclear standoff the german official said it was interesting that the letter did not discuss iran 's nuclear standoff with the united states , european union and other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear facility in natan iran is facing possible action at the un security council over suspicions that it is developing nuclear weapons under the cloak of its energy program .

" we were constantly afraid of being bombed but we had no choice , " one german woman on a bus convoy to syria told reporters .
the road has been targeted by the israelis in the past few days . others disembarking in larnaca , cyprus , expressed relief that they made it to safety . " i am so sad to be going back to france , " zeina , 40 , who was on holiday with her family said .
" but i was so frightened by the first bombs .
it is such a relief to be here . " some expressed fear over those they left behind . dunia shabaan , a lebanese-german woman came to the german embassy meeting point with her young children .
" we feel bad leaving our parents behind but we have to leave because our children are terrified by the sounds of the bombs , " she said , crying . " i do n't know if my parents will be alive when i reach germany . " terror on the streets evacuees also described the terror on the streets of beirut during the israeli bombings in the past week . " there were houses getting blown up five minutes from where we were , " samantha bradley , a 33-year-old mother of two from central england . melbourne secretary soirse flanagan , 35 , whose middle east holiday literally went up in smoke with the israeli offensive , admitted she was desperate to get out as quickly as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners expressed fear at being so close to the bombings " you just keep hearing bombs .
it 's pretty scary , it all happened very quickly and escalated very quickly . " some expressed rage over the bombing campaign .
" i am really angry at what israel is doing , " belgian sigrit hoste said .
" it is a disproportionate attack - they are killing civilians only . " canadian ludovic marcotte , 29 , said his ordeal under israeli bombardment in his ancestral homeland would remain with him even when he got home to montreal : " being in a war zone really changes the way you look at life . " coping as well as they can as european and other governments struggle to cope with thousands of their nationals stuck in middle of the fighting , frustration erupted over bottlenecks . on the beirut docks , there were angry scenes as westerners battled for a precious place for their loved ones , while swamped embassy staff tried to calm growing tensions . " this is disgusting , " yelled one canadian woman at lebanese guards preventing them from storming the seafront building where consular officials were allotting places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many dual nationals fear for those left behind rough figures suggested as many as 13,000 people had already escaped or would be brought to safety by thursday . but according to figures provided by embassies and governments , up to 57,000 more foreign and dual nationals could be aiming to flee the country on the few spaces available to sanctuary , 160 kilometers away in cyprus . logistical nightmare the quickening rescue effort by so many countries was causing a logistical nightmare , with ships jostling for space in the harbor and scores of buses transporting evacuees getting snarled in traffic jams . " they 've had five days to do something , why are we stuck here , " asked one man in frustration . the sudden demand for buses and ships meant charter prices had soared 10-fold or more , and some countries suddenly found their hastily made plans turned upside down . australia , for instance , had chartered a greek vessel to take 350 of its citizens out on wednesday - but discovered just before it was meant to dock that the ship was double-booked .
instead , some 100 of its priority cases , mainly families with young children and handicapped people , were taken to a british warship which was already loading hundreds of british citizens . as some left , they took time to reflect on what they were leaving behind . " god knows what will happen to this country after we leave , " a lebanese-french woman wept as she boarded a french ferry .

will the country plunge into yet another recession by causing betrayed entrepreneurs to pack up and leave ? here is what happened : this week , judges in germany 's financial capital frankfurt sided with a kitchen helper at a restaurant who had the audacity to ignore her boss ' explicit warning that it was absolutely verboten to take home food without paying . believe it or not , but this lady - if you can call her that - dared to eat a yoghurt , valued at a minimum of 40 euro cents -lrb- that 's a whopping 50 us cents -rrb- .
luckily , the employers found out about the crime and did what they had to do : they fired the woman immediately . taking her case before a judge , the woman argued that the yoghurt had already been past its expiration date - as if that really mattered .
at least the court did n't care about that particular point , either .
judges did , however , say that technically the woman had not breached company rules since she ate the stolen yoghurt on the premises rather than taking it to her home . seems like the poor restaurant owners will have to be even more careful when they read new employees the riot act .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.07.2006 darfur : " the violence must end " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union alone ca n't handle the darfur conflcit sudan is resisting pressure to accept a un mission in darfur .
dw-world.de spoke to the foreign policy expert for germany 's green party , kerstin müller , on the world 's obligation to do more in the war-torn region . dw-world.de : you called for a clear signal at the donor conference for darfur held in brussels this week .
what should it look like ? first of all , there needs to be a clear signal demanding an end to the violence .
since 2003 , a civil war has been raging there .
the janjaweed militia , armed by the khartoum government , continues to terrorize the population with violence , displacing them .
mass rapes are on the daily agenda . in the meantime , 2 million people live in refugee camps .
almost 300,000 have died .
some people even talk of genocide .
the international community is responsible here to send clear signals to both sides that the violence must end . how can the international community pressure the sudanese government to accept a un mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2 million people have been displaced from their homes in darfur so far , an african union force has tried to protect the population .
unfortunately , they do n't have the ability to do so .
so it 's been decided that the united nations should take over here by the end of the year at the latest .
but the sudanese government wo n't agree to such a un mission in darfur .
we need this mission , though , and with a strong mandate , which is truly in a position to protect the population . i expect the german government and the international community to exert pressure on the sudanese government to agree to such a un mission .
if that is n't enough , then individual-related sanctions should be implemented , for example against the president or certain members of the government .
this is possible according to un resolutions .
but it is n't practiced , unfortunately , also not by the europeans .
these would be instruments which could force the khartoum government to consent and then quickly bring a un mission into the country . why is it so difficult for the international community to officially call the crimes in darfur genocide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller has visited the region several times last year , there was a united nations fact-finding committee .
it spoke of serious crimes against humanity , but said it could not determine genocide .
it could n't prove this of the khartoum government .
i have been in the region several times .
it is very clear to me that this is also about ethnic displacement and on a large scale , in which the janjaweed militia is armed by the government and receives support , for example through bombings and military flights .
so this is clearly a case of the most serious crimes against humanity .
i would even speak of a sneaking genocide . in my opinion , the international community is obligated and responsible .
kofi annan has repeatedly pointed this out .
for me , this is a very important conflict .
there ca n't be a second rwanda .
i am concerned that just because this is n't about europe or the middle east , but africa , that one looks away or is of the opinion that the africans should solve this themselves .
but they are not in a position to do so , as you can see from the african union mission .
we also have the responsibility to protect people in africa . naser shrouf interviewed kerstin müller -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato foreign ministers discuss darfur , expansion expansion of the military alliance and cooperation with other states to fight terrorism were on the agenda for nato foreign ministers during their meeting in april .
-lrb- april 26 , 2006 -rrb- " the stronger the eu forces become , the better " in an interview with dw-world.de , victoria nuland , us permanent representative to nato , spoke about the ongoing activities of the north atlantic treaty organization as well as plans for its future expansion .

panke hits bmw retirement age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is panke too old to lead bmw ?
the german press has been speculating that panke 's contract was unlikely to be renewed when it runs out early next year because the company 's policy is for managers to retire at 60 .
panke , who turns 60 in august , had hoped that his contract would be extended .
" i enjoy being captain , " he said last week .
however , senior bmw executives are understood to have signaled to panke some time ago that it was unlikely that his contract would be extended .

" we were constantly afraid of being bombed but we had no choice , " one german woman on a bus convoy to syria told reporters .
the road has been targeted by the israelis in the past few days . others disembarking in larnaca , cyprus , expressed relief that they made it to safety . " i am so sad to be going back to france , " zeina , 40 , who was on holiday with her family said .
" but i was so frightened by the first bombs .
it is such a relief to be here . " some expressed fear over those they left behind . dunia shabaan , a lebanese-german woman came to the german embassy meeting point with her young children .
" we feel bad leaving our parents behind but we have to leave because our children are terrified by the sounds of the bombs , " she said , crying . " i do n't know if my parents will be alive when i reach germany . " terror on the streets evacuees also described the terror on the streets of beirut during the israeli bombings in the past week . " there were houses getting blown up five minutes from where we were , " samantha bradley , a 33-year-old mother of two from central england . melbourne secretary soirse flanagan , 35 , whose middle east holiday literally went up in smoke with the israeli offensive , admitted she was desperate to get out as quickly as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners expressed fear at being so close to the bombings " you just keep hearing bombs .
it 's pretty scary , it all happened very quickly and escalated very quickly . " some expressed rage over the bombing campaign .
" i am really angry at what israel is doing , " belgian sigrit hoste said .
" it is a disproportionate attack - they are killing civilians only . " canadian ludovic marcotte , 29 , said his ordeal under israeli bombardment in his ancestral homeland would remain with him even when he got home to montreal : " being in a war zone really changes the way you look at life . " coping as well as they can as european and other governments struggle to cope with thousands of their nationals stuck in middle of the fighting , frustration erupted over bottlenecks . on the beirut docks , there were angry scenes as westerners battled for a precious place for their loved ones , while swamped embassy staff tried to calm growing tensions . " this is disgusting , " yelled one canadian woman at lebanese guards preventing them from storming the seafront building where consular officials were allotting places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many dual nationals fear for those left behind rough figures suggested as many as 13,000 people had already escaped or would be brought to safety by thursday . but according to figures provided by embassies and governments , up to 57,000 more foreign and dual nationals could be aiming to flee the country on the few spaces available to sanctuary , 160 kilometers away in cyprus . logistical nightmare the quickening rescue effort by so many countries was causing a logistical nightmare , with ships jostling for space in the harbor and scores of buses transporting evacuees getting snarled in traffic jams . " they 've had five days to do something , why are we stuck here , " asked one man in frustration . the sudden demand for buses and ships meant charter prices had soared 10-fold or more , and some countries suddenly found their hastily made plans turned upside down . australia , for instance , had chartered a greek vessel to take 350 of its citizens out on wednesday - but discovered just before it was meant to dock that the ship was double-booked .
instead , some 100 of its priority cases , mainly families with young children and handicapped people , were taken to a british warship which was already loading hundreds of british citizens . as some left , they took time to reflect on what they were leaving behind . " god knows what will happen to this country after we leave , " a lebanese-french woman wept as she boarded a french ferry .

dw-world.de spoke to the foreign policy expert for germany 's green party , kerstin müller , on the world 's obligation to do more in the war-torn region . dw-world.de : you called for a clear signal at the donor conference for darfur held in brussels this week .
what should it look like ? first of all , there needs to be a clear signal demanding an end to the violence .
since 2003 , a civil war has been raging there .
the janjaweed militia , armed by the khartoum government , continues to terrorize the population with violence , displacing them .
mass rapes are on the daily agenda . in the meantime , 2 million people live in refugee camps .
almost 300,000 have died .
some people even talk of genocide .
the international community is responsible here to send clear signals to both sides that the violence must end . how can the international community pressure the sudanese government to accept a un mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2 million people have been displaced from their homes in darfur so far , an african union force has tried to protect the population .
unfortunately , they do n't have the ability to do so .
so it 's been decided that the united nations should take over here by the end of the year at the latest .
but the sudanese government wo n't agree to such a un mission in darfur .
we need this mission , though , and with a strong mandate , which is truly in a position to protect the population . i expect the german government and the international community to exert pressure on the sudanese government to agree to such a un mission .
if that is n't enough , then individual-related sanctions should be implemented , for example against the president or certain members of the government .
this is possible according to un resolutions .
but it is n't practiced , unfortunately , also not by the europeans .
these would be instruments which could force the khartoum government to consent and then quickly bring a un mission into the country . why is it so difficult for the international community to officially call the crimes in darfur genocide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller has visited the region several times last year , there was a united nations fact-finding committee .
it spoke of serious crimes against humanity , but said it could not determine genocide .
it could n't prove this of the khartoum government .
i have been in the region several times .
it is very clear to me that this is also about ethnic displacement and on a large scale , in which the janjaweed militia is armed by the government and receives support , for example through bombings and military flights .
so this is clearly a case of the most serious crimes against humanity .
i would even speak of a sneaking genocide . in my opinion , the international community is obligated and responsible .
kofi annan has repeatedly pointed this out .
for me , this is a very important conflict .
there ca n't be a second rwanda .
i am concerned that just because this is n't about europe or the middle east , but africa , that one looks away or is of the opinion that the africans should solve this themselves .
but they are not in a position to do so , as you can see from the african union mission .
we also have the responsibility to protect people in africa . naser shrouf interviewed kerstin müller -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato foreign ministers discuss darfur , expansion expansion of the military alliance and cooperation with other states to fight terrorism were on the agenda for nato foreign ministers during their meeting in april .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.07.2006 opinion : us resorting to heartless tactics in the middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush says the united states wo n't get involved in the conflict yet washington is sending hesitant signals to the middle east , saying intervention at this time would n't be helpful .
this is a callous delay tactic , which condones further casualties , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . after a week of massive airstrikes by the israeli air force on lebanon , washington has said it will deploy us marines to the region .
not , like in 1957 and 1982 , to restore peace and order in lebanon , but rather to evacuate us citizens . peace and order have to wait .
us president george w. bush has made that more than clear .
he is not willing to support immediate measures to end the war .
he does n't want to send his secretary of state on her way to the region for a few more days .
in washington , that will have to take " about another week . " another week like the last one ?
with hundreds of civilian casualties , hundreds of thousands of refugees and billions in damage to the lebanese infrastructure ?
it is absurd and inhuman to constitute a new order in lebanon based on this suffering and misery of innocent people . the us president apparently has a very limited perception .
it seems the government in jerusalem insinuated to him that it needs this one week to vitally weaken hezbollah now and in the long term .
the white house gives jerusalem the go-ahead - no matter how high the price . every day claims new casualties of course , it is certainly true that a quick ceasefire , if one were to even come about , would n't solve the basic problem .
hezbollah remains a powerful force in southern lebanon .
the central government in beirut could n't send its troops there .
sooner or later , the next cross-border conflicts could be expected .
and everything would start anew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli troops have entered lebanon but is the situation going to be any different in a week ?
is hezbollah going to be beaten then ?
in washington , no one can predict this with certainty .
even in jerusalem and tel aviv , the prognoses by politicians and the military vary between " several days " and " several months . " efforts are doomed to fail if no us action is taken in the course of its history , lebanon has weathered through many a bleak period .
it was often the lebanese themselves who were responsible for this .
but over and over , the country has also become the plaything for foreign powers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the israeli attacks have caused extensive damage in lebanon in the current case , both play a role .
hezbollah is a lebanese force , which nevertheless acts as an extended arm of syria and iran .
and israel can count on the - so far - unrestricted support of washington .
what could the hectic efforts by the europeans or the united nations to end the conflict even accomplish ? all of these efforts are doomed to fail , as long as washington does n't give up its stance of " wait and see . "
president bush appears to be indifferent to the fact that the united states will make even more enemies in the world with this position - and further disqualify itself from its reclaimed role of being the " world 's sheriff . " the one thing that can be said for certain about bush in this context : he has proven yet again that he is always willing to make unpopular decisions . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " hezbollah ca n't do much more harm than a pin prick " while clear evidence exists that iran supports hezbollah militarily , the movement does not really pose a threat to israel , middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de.
-lrb- july 20 , 2006 -rrb- experts : eu mediation in middle east requires a common line the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .
yet time is running out for international diplomatic intervention .

the janjaweed militia , armed by the khartoum government , continues to terrorize the population with violence , displacing them .
mass rapes are on the daily agenda . in the meantime , 2 million people live in refugee camps .
almost 300,000 have died .
some people even talk of genocide .
the international community is responsible here to send clear signals to both sides that the violence must end . how can the international community pressure the sudanese government to accept a un mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2 million people have been displaced from their homes in darfur so far , an african union force has tried to protect the population .
unfortunately , they do n't have the ability to do so .
so it 's been decided that the united nations should take over here by the end of the year at the latest .
but the sudanese government wo n't agree to such a un mission in darfur .
we need this mission , though , and with a strong mandate , which is truly in a position to protect the population . i expect the german government and the international community to exert pressure on the sudanese government to agree to such a un mission .
if that is n't enough , then individual-related sanctions should be implemented , for example against the president or certain members of the government .
this is possible according to un resolutions .
but it is n't practiced , unfortunately , also not by the europeans .
these would be instruments which could force the khartoum government to consent and then quickly bring a un mission into the country . why is it so difficult for the international community to officially call the crimes in darfur genocide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller has visited the region several times last year , there was a united nations fact-finding committee .
it spoke of serious crimes against humanity , but said it could not determine genocide .
it could n't prove this of the khartoum government .
i have been in the region several times .
it is very clear to me that this is also about ethnic displacement and on a large scale , in which the janjaweed militia is armed by the government and receives support , for example through bombings and military flights .
so this is clearly a case of the most serious crimes against humanity .
i would even speak of a sneaking genocide . in my opinion , the international community is obligated and responsible .
kofi annan has repeatedly pointed this out .
for me , this is a very important conflict .
there ca n't be a second rwanda .
i am concerned that just because this is n't about europe or the middle east , but africa , that one looks away or is of the opinion that the africans should solve this themselves .
but they are not in a position to do so , as you can see from the african union mission .
we also have the responsibility to protect people in africa . naser shrouf interviewed kerstin müller -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato foreign ministers discuss darfur , expansion expansion of the military alliance and cooperation with other states to fight terrorism were on the agenda for nato foreign ministers during their meeting in april .

this is a callous delay tactic , which condones further casualties , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . after a week of massive airstrikes by the israeli air force on lebanon , washington has said it will deploy us marines to the region .
not , like in 1957 and 1982 , to restore peace and order in lebanon , but rather to evacuate us citizens . peace and order have to wait .
us president george w. bush has made that more than clear .
he is not willing to support immediate measures to end the war .
he does n't want to send his secretary of state on her way to the region for a few more days .
in washington , that will have to take " about another week . " another week like the last one ?
with hundreds of civilian casualties , hundreds of thousands of refugees and billions in damage to the lebanese infrastructure ?
it is absurd and inhuman to constitute a new order in lebanon based on this suffering and misery of innocent people . the us president apparently has a very limited perception .
it seems the government in jerusalem insinuated to him that it needs this one week to vitally weaken hezbollah now and in the long term .
the white house gives jerusalem the go-ahead - no matter how high the price . every day claims new casualties of course , it is certainly true that a quick ceasefire , if one were to even come about , would n't solve the basic problem .

even in jerusalem and tel aviv , the prognoses by politicians and the military vary between " several days " and " several months . " efforts are doomed to fail if no us action is taken in the course of its history , lebanon has weathered through many a bleak period .
it was often the lebanese themselves who were responsible for this .
but over and over , the country has also become the plaything for foreign powers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the israeli attacks have caused extensive damage in lebanon in the current case , both play a role .
hezbollah is a lebanese force , which nevertheless acts as an extended arm of syria and iran .
and israel can count on the - so far - unrestricted support of washington .
what could the hectic efforts by the europeans or the united nations to end the conflict even accomplish ? all of these efforts are doomed to fail , as long as washington does n't give up its stance of " wait and see . "
president bush appears to be indifferent to the fact that the united states will make even more enemies in the world with this position - and further disqualify itself from its reclaimed role of being the " world 's sheriff .

" there 's nothing about the nuclear issue -lrb- in the letter -rrb- , " a german government official told reuters on condition of anonymity . " it 's all related to germany and how we have to find a solution to the palestinian problems and zionism and so on .
it 's rather weird , " said the official who saw the letter on thursday . zionism is a political movement that supports a homeland for the jewish people in palestine , and lead to the establishment of the state of israel . a touchy subject the letter comes at a time when germany 's relations with iran have become more tense after ahmadinejad 's repeated denial of the holocaust .
again this week , he made comments questioning whether the holocaust was being used as a tool by the west to dominate the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is contemplating a response the german official who read the letter said it was an " extremely touchy " subject , and added that the government did not yet know if or how it would respond .
" there are a lot of propaganda phrases about israel and the jews in it . " holocaust denial is a crime in germany punishable with up to five years in prison . less confrontational than us letter in may , ahmadinejad wrote us president george w. bush an 18-page letter discussing religious values , history and international relations .
the iranian leader , who minces no words in his distrust of the west , took swipes at israel and the us . he lashed out at the us-led invasion of afghanistan and iraq , abuses of detainees in guantanamo bay and washington 's staunch support for israel .
he even admonished bush , a born-again christian , to be be more pious , saying that his actions were inconsistent with christian teachings . in contrast , the letter to merkel was different in tone - " not so confrontational , " the official said . " it 's not negative like ahmadinejad 's letter to bush .
he is not criticising germany , " he told reuters .
" it 's basically about how we have to work together and solve the problems of the world together . " no mention of nuclear standoff the german official said it was interesting that the letter did not discuss iran 's nuclear standoff with the united states , european union and other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear facility in natan iran is facing possible action at the un security council over suspicions that it is developing nuclear weapons under the cloak of its energy program .
tehran denies the charge , saying it is working on developing nuclear fuel to run power stations . germany , one of iran 's largest trading partners , has been working with the five permanent members of the united nations security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - to try to convince tehran to abandon uranium enrichment , considered the first step to nuclear armament . they have developed a package of incentives to induce iran to abandon its program .

" we were constantly afraid of being bombed but we had no choice , " one german woman on a bus convoy to syria told reporters .
the road has been targeted by the israelis in the past few days . others disembarking in larnaca , cyprus , expressed relief that they made it to safety . " i am so sad to be going back to france , " zeina , 40 , who was on holiday with her family said .
" but i was so frightened by the first bombs .
it is such a relief to be here . " some expressed fear over those they left behind . dunia shabaan , a lebanese-german woman came to the german embassy meeting point with her young children .
" we feel bad leaving our parents behind but we have to leave because our children are terrified by the sounds of the bombs , " she said , crying . " i do n't know if my parents will be alive when i reach germany . " terror on the streets evacuees also described the terror on the streets of beirut during the israeli bombings in the past week . " there were houses getting blown up five minutes from where we were , " samantha bradley , a 33-year-old mother of two from central england . melbourne secretary soirse flanagan , 35 , whose middle east holiday literally went up in smoke with the israeli offensive , admitted she was desperate to get out as quickly as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners expressed fear at being so close to the bombings " you just keep hearing bombs .
it 's pretty scary , it all happened very quickly and escalated very quickly . " some expressed rage over the bombing campaign .
" i am really angry at what israel is doing , " belgian sigrit hoste said .
" it is a disproportionate attack - they are killing civilians only . " canadian ludovic marcotte , 29 , said his ordeal under israeli bombardment in his ancestral homeland would remain with him even when he got home to montreal : " being in a war zone really changes the way you look at life . " coping as well as they can as european and other governments struggle to cope with thousands of their nationals stuck in middle of the fighting , frustration erupted over bottlenecks . on the beirut docks , there were angry scenes as westerners battled for a precious place for their loved ones , while swamped embassy staff tried to calm growing tensions . " this is disgusting , " yelled one canadian woman at lebanese guards preventing them from storming the seafront building where consular officials were allotting places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many dual nationals fear for those left behind rough figures suggested as many as 13,000 people had already escaped or would be brought to safety by thursday . but according to figures provided by embassies and governments , up to 57,000 more foreign and dual nationals could be aiming to flee the country on the few spaces available to sanctuary , 160 kilometers away in cyprus . logistical nightmare the quickening rescue effort by so many countries was causing a logistical nightmare , with ships jostling for space in the harbor and scores of buses transporting evacuees getting snarled in traffic jams . " they 've had five days to do something , why are we stuck here , " asked one man in frustration . the sudden demand for buses and ships meant charter prices had soared 10-fold or more , and some countries suddenly found their hastily made plans turned upside down . australia , for instance , had chartered a greek vessel to take 350 of its citizens out on wednesday - but discovered just before it was meant to dock that the ship was double-booked .
instead , some 100 of its priority cases , mainly families with young children and handicapped people , were taken to a british warship which was already loading hundreds of british citizens . as some left , they took time to reflect on what they were leaving behind . " god knows what will happen to this country after we leave , " a lebanese-french woman wept as she boarded a french ferry .

what should it look like ? first of all , there needs to be a clear signal demanding an end to the violence .
since 2003 , a civil war has been raging there .

mass rapes are on the daily agenda . in the meantime , 2 million people live in refugee camps .

the international community is responsible here to send clear signals to both sides that the violence must end . how can the international community pressure the sudanese government to accept a un mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2 million people have been displaced from their homes in darfur so far , an african union force has tried to protect the population .

we need this mission , though , and with a strong mandate , which is truly in a position to protect the population . i expect the german government and the international community to exert pressure on the sudanese government to agree to such a un mission .
if that is n't enough , then individual-related sanctions should be implemented , for example against the president or certain members of the government .
this is possible according to un resolutions .
but it is n't practiced , unfortunately , also not by the europeans .
these would be instruments which could force the khartoum government to consent and then quickly bring a un mission into the country . why is it so difficult for the international community to officially call the crimes in darfur genocide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller has visited the region several times last year , there was a united nations fact-finding committee .
it spoke of serious crimes against humanity , but said it could not determine genocide .
it could n't prove this of the khartoum government .
i have been in the region several times .
it is very clear to me that this is also about ethnic displacement and on a large scale , in which the janjaweed militia is armed by the government and receives support , for example through bombings and military flights .
so this is clearly a case of the most serious crimes against humanity .
i would even speak of a sneaking genocide . in my opinion , the international community is obligated and responsible .
kofi annan has repeatedly pointed this out .
for me , this is a very important conflict .
there ca n't be a second rwanda .

the move is part of a major shakeup of the bmw 's management . the 50-year-old reithofer , who is currently the management board member responsible for production , is to take over from current chief executive helmut panke on sept .
1 , the company said in a statement .
the announcement followed a meeting of the carmaker 's board and comes in the wake of weeks of speculation about possible changes in the group 's upper management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new head of bmw " with this decision the supervisory board has determined the course of the company 's long-term management , " said board chairman joachim milberg .
with bmw 's flexible production system considered to be a model for the car industry , reithofer has long been considered to be a candidate to replace panke , who has presided over record earnings at the munich-based group .
bmw expects profits before tax to rise this year by 3.3 per cent to a record four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.05 billion -rrb- .
panke hits bmw retirement age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is panke too old to lead bmw ?
the german press has been speculating that panke 's contract was unlikely to be renewed when it runs out early next year because the company 's policy is for managers to retire at 60 .
panke , who turns 60 in august , had hoped that his contract would be extended .
" i enjoy being captain , " he said last week .
however , senior bmw executives are understood to have signaled to panke some time ago that it was unlikely that his contract would be extended .
as part of the management restructuring , the company 's research and development chief burkhard göschel , who is 60 , is to bow out from his present post .
göschel is to be replaced by klaus draeger , who heads bmw 's limousine division .
reithofer 's current job is to go to frank-peter arndt , who currently heads bmw 's plant in the bavarian town of dingolfing .. dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pumps millions of euros into hydrogen-powered tech in an attempt to reduce environmental pollution , germany shifts into high-gear to produce cleaner vehicle technology .

the move is part of a major shakeup of the bmw 's management . the 50-year-old reithofer , who is currently the management board member responsible for production , is to take over from current chief executive helmut panke on sept .
1 , the company said in a statement .
the announcement followed a meeting of the carmaker 's board and comes in the wake of weeks of speculation about possible changes in the group 's upper management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new head of bmw " with this decision the supervisory board has determined the course of the company 's long-term management , " said board chairman joachim milberg .
with bmw 's flexible production system considered to be a model for the car industry , reithofer has long been considered to be a candidate to replace panke , who has presided over record earnings at the munich-based group .
bmw expects profits before tax to rise this year by 3.3 per cent to a record four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.05 billion -rrb- .
panke hits bmw retirement age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is panke too old to lead bmw ?
the german press has been speculating that panke 's contract was unlikely to be renewed when it runs out early next year because the company 's policy is for managers to retire at 60 .
panke , who turns 60 in august , had hoped that his contract would be extended .
" i enjoy being captain , " he said last week .
however , senior bmw executives are understood to have signaled to panke some time ago that it was unlikely that his contract would be extended .
as part of the management restructuring , the company 's research and development chief burkhard göschel , who is 60 , is to bow out from his present post .
göschel is to be replaced by klaus draeger , who heads bmw 's limousine division .
reithofer 's current job is to go to frank-peter arndt , who currently heads bmw 's plant in the bavarian town of dingolfing .. dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pumps millions of euros into hydrogen-powered tech in an attempt to reduce environmental pollution , germany shifts into high-gear to produce cleaner vehicle technology .

dw-world.de spoke to the foreign policy expert for germany 's green party , kerstin müller , on the world 's obligation to do more in the war-torn region . dw-world.de : you called for a clear signal at the donor conference for darfur held in brussels this week .
what should it look like ? first of all , there needs to be a clear signal demanding an end to the violence .
since 2003 , a civil war has been raging there .
the janjaweed militia , armed by the khartoum government , continues to terrorize the population with violence , displacing them .
mass rapes are on the daily agenda . in the meantime , 2 million people live in refugee camps .
almost 300,000 have died .
some people even talk of genocide .
the international community is responsible here to send clear signals to both sides that the violence must end . how can the international community pressure the sudanese government to accept a un mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2 million people have been displaced from their homes in darfur so far , an african union force has tried to protect the population .
unfortunately , they do n't have the ability to do so .
so it 's been decided that the united nations should take over here by the end of the year at the latest .
but the sudanese government wo n't agree to such a un mission in darfur .
we need this mission , though , and with a strong mandate , which is truly in a position to protect the population . i expect the german government and the international community to exert pressure on the sudanese government to agree to such a un mission .
if that is n't enough , then individual-related sanctions should be implemented , for example against the president or certain members of the government .
this is possible according to un resolutions .
but it is n't practiced , unfortunately , also not by the europeans .
these would be instruments which could force the khartoum government to consent and then quickly bring a un mission into the country . why is it so difficult for the international community to officially call the crimes in darfur genocide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller has visited the region several times last year , there was a united nations fact-finding committee .
it spoke of serious crimes against humanity , but said it could not determine genocide .
it could n't prove this of the khartoum government .
i have been in the region several times .
it is very clear to me that this is also about ethnic displacement and on a large scale , in which the janjaweed militia is armed by the government and receives support , for example through bombings and military flights .
so this is clearly a case of the most serious crimes against humanity .
i would even speak of a sneaking genocide . in my opinion , the international community is obligated and responsible .
kofi annan has repeatedly pointed this out .
for me , this is a very important conflict .
there ca n't be a second rwanda .
i am concerned that just because this is n't about europe or the middle east , but africa , that one looks away or is of the opinion that the africans should solve this themselves .
but they are not in a position to do so , as you can see from the african union mission .
we also have the responsibility to protect people in africa . naser shrouf interviewed kerstin müller -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato foreign ministers discuss darfur , expansion expansion of the military alliance and cooperation with other states to fight terrorism were on the agenda for nato foreign ministers during their meeting in april .

" there 's nothing about the nuclear issue -lrb- in the letter -rrb- , " a german government official told reuters on condition of anonymity . " it 's all related to germany and how we have to find a solution to the palestinian problems and zionism and so on .
it 's rather weird , " said the official who saw the letter on thursday . zionism is a political movement that supports a homeland for the jewish people in palestine , and lead to the establishment of the state of israel . a touchy subject the letter comes at a time when germany 's relations with iran have become more tense after ahmadinejad 's repeated denial of the holocaust .
again this week , he made comments questioning whether the holocaust was being used as a tool by the west to dominate the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is contemplating a response the german official who read the letter said it was an " extremely touchy " subject , and added that the government did not yet know if or how it would respond .

the iranian leader , who minces no words in his distrust of the west , took swipes at israel and the us . he lashed out at the us-led invasion of afghanistan and iraq , abuses of detainees in guantanamo bay and washington 's staunch support for israel .
he even admonished bush , a born-again christian , to be be more pious , saying that his actions were inconsistent with christian teachings . in contrast , the letter to merkel was different in tone - " not so confrontational , " the official said . " it 's not negative like ahmadinejad 's letter to bush .
he is not criticising germany , " he told reuters .

" it 's all related to germany and how we have to find a solution to the palestinian problems and zionism and so on .
it 's rather weird , " said the official who saw the letter on thursday . zionism is a political movement that supports a homeland for the jewish people in palestine , and lead to the establishment of the state of israel . a touchy subject the letter comes at a time when germany 's relations with iran have become more tense after ahmadinejad 's repeated denial of the holocaust .
again this week , he made comments questioning whether the holocaust was being used as a tool by the west to dominate the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is contemplating a response the german official who read the letter said it was an " extremely touchy " subject , and added that the government did not yet know if or how it would respond .
" there are a lot of propaganda phrases about israel and the jews in it . " holocaust denial is a crime in germany punishable with up to five years in prison . less confrontational than us letter in may , ahmadinejad wrote us president george w. bush an 18-page letter discussing religious values , history and international relations .
the iranian leader , who minces no words in his distrust of the west , took swipes at israel and the us . he lashed out at the us-led invasion of afghanistan and iraq , abuses of detainees in guantanamo bay and washington 's staunch support for israel .
he even admonished bush , a born-again christian , to be be more pious , saying that his actions were inconsistent with christian teachings . in contrast , the letter to merkel was different in tone - " not so confrontational , " the official said . " it 's not negative like ahmadinejad 's letter to bush .
he is not criticising germany , " he told reuters .
" it 's basically about how we have to work together and solve the problems of the world together . " no mention of nuclear standoff the german official said it was interesting that the letter did not discuss iran 's nuclear standoff with the united states , european union and other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear facility in natan iran is facing possible action at the un security council over suspicions that it is developing nuclear weapons under the cloak of its energy program .
tehran denies the charge , saying it is working on developing nuclear fuel to run power stations . germany , one of iran 's largest trading partners , has been working with the five permanent members of the united nations security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - to try to convince tehran to abandon uranium enrichment , considered the first step to nuclear armament . they have developed a package of incentives to induce iran to abandon its program .
iran is expected to respond by mid-august . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran tops agenda at g8 ministers ' meeting in moscow foreign ministers of the group of eight countries are holding talks in moscow thursday that are expected to raise pressure on iran over its nuclear program .

" we were constantly afraid of being bombed but we had no choice , " one german woman on a bus convoy to syria told reporters .
the road has been targeted by the israelis in the past few days . others disembarking in larnaca , cyprus , expressed relief that they made it to safety . " i am so sad to be going back to france , " zeina , 40 , who was on holiday with her family said .
" but i was so frightened by the first bombs .
it is such a relief to be here . " some expressed fear over those they left behind . dunia shabaan , a lebanese-german woman came to the german embassy meeting point with her young children .
" we feel bad leaving our parents behind but we have to leave because our children are terrified by the sounds of the bombs , " she said , crying . " i do n't know if my parents will be alive when i reach germany . " terror on the streets evacuees also described the terror on the streets of beirut during the israeli bombings in the past week . " there were houses getting blown up five minutes from where we were , " samantha bradley , a 33-year-old mother of two from central england . melbourne secretary soirse flanagan , 35 , whose middle east holiday literally went up in smoke with the israeli offensive , admitted she was desperate to get out as quickly as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners expressed fear at being so close to the bombings " you just keep hearing bombs .
it 's pretty scary , it all happened very quickly and escalated very quickly . " some expressed rage over the bombing campaign .
" i am really angry at what israel is doing , " belgian sigrit hoste said .
" it is a disproportionate attack - they are killing civilians only . " canadian ludovic marcotte , 29 , said his ordeal under israeli bombardment in his ancestral homeland would remain with him even when he got home to montreal : " being in a war zone really changes the way you look at life . " coping as well as they can as european and other governments struggle to cope with thousands of their nationals stuck in middle of the fighting , frustration erupted over bottlenecks . on the beirut docks , there were angry scenes as westerners battled for a precious place for their loved ones , while swamped embassy staff tried to calm growing tensions . " this is disgusting , " yelled one canadian woman at lebanese guards preventing them from storming the seafront building where consular officials were allotting places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many dual nationals fear for those left behind rough figures suggested as many as 13,000 people had already escaped or would be brought to safety by thursday . but according to figures provided by embassies and governments , up to 57,000 more foreign and dual nationals could be aiming to flee the country on the few spaces available to sanctuary , 160 kilometers away in cyprus . logistical nightmare the quickening rescue effort by so many countries was causing a logistical nightmare , with ships jostling for space in the harbor and scores of buses transporting evacuees getting snarled in traffic jams . " they 've had five days to do something , why are we stuck here , " asked one man in frustration . the sudden demand for buses and ships meant charter prices had soared 10-fold or more , and some countries suddenly found their hastily made plans turned upside down . australia , for instance , had chartered a greek vessel to take 350 of its citizens out on wednesday - but discovered just before it was meant to dock that the ship was double-booked .
instead , some 100 of its priority cases , mainly families with young children and handicapped people , were taken to a british warship which was already loading hundreds of british citizens . as some left , they took time to reflect on what they were leaving behind . " god knows what will happen to this country after we leave , " a lebanese-french woman wept as she boarded a french ferry .

" there 's nothing about the nuclear issue -lrb- in the letter -rrb- , " a german government official told reuters on condition of anonymity . " it 's all related to germany and how we have to find a solution to the palestinian problems and zionism and so on .
it 's rather weird , " said the official who saw the letter on thursday . zionism is a political movement that supports a homeland for the jewish people in palestine , and lead to the establishment of the state of israel . a touchy subject the letter comes at a time when germany 's relations with iran have become more tense after ahmadinejad 's repeated denial of the holocaust .
again this week , he made comments questioning whether the holocaust was being used as a tool by the west to dominate the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is contemplating a response the german official who read the letter said it was an " extremely touchy " subject , and added that the government did not yet know if or how it would respond .
" there are a lot of propaganda phrases about israel and the jews in it . " holocaust denial is a crime in germany punishable with up to five years in prison . less confrontational than us letter in may , ahmadinejad wrote us president george w. bush an 18-page letter discussing religious values , history and international relations .
the iranian leader , who minces no words in his distrust of the west , took swipes at israel and the us . he lashed out at the us-led invasion of afghanistan and iraq , abuses of detainees in guantanamo bay and washington 's staunch support for israel .
he even admonished bush , a born-again christian , to be be more pious , saying that his actions were inconsistent with christian teachings . in contrast , the letter to merkel was different in tone - " not so confrontational , " the official said . " it 's not negative like ahmadinejad 's letter to bush .
he is not criticising germany , " he told reuters .
" it 's basically about how we have to work together and solve the problems of the world together . " no mention of nuclear standoff the german official said it was interesting that the letter did not discuss iran 's nuclear standoff with the united states , european union and other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear facility in natan iran is facing possible action at the un security council over suspicions that it is developing nuclear weapons under the cloak of its energy program .

a train station in haifa after a hit by a hezbollah missile while clear evidence exists that iran supports hezbollah militarily , the movement does not really pose a threat to israel , middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de. joche n hippler teaches a n d researches at the i n stitute for developme n t a n d peace -lrb- inef -rrb- at duisburg-esse n u n iversity . dw-world.de : militarily speaki n g , how stro n g is hezbollah ? jochen hippler : the problem is that we only get information about its military might indirectly via western and israeli secret service circles .
that means that we can not check how reliable the information is .
you have to keep that in mind when speaking about hezbollah .
having said that , it 's possible to say that hezbollah is an important military factor within lebanon , but it 's a third-rate power by international comparison .
estimates say that there are about 2,000 to 5,000 people in the militia and about 500 to 700 military personnel that have received training .
that 's quite a lot for lebanon .
but compared to syria or israel , it 's a negligible number . what ki n d of weapo n s does hezbollah have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hezbollah gunman aims his ak-47 hand guns and ak-47 , i.e. kalashnikovs , are standard in the region .
there are estimates that hezbollah has about 8,000 to 10,000 katyusha rockets that have a range of about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- and a few iranian-built missiles that are said to have a range of up to 60 , 70 kilometers .
that can not be proven for sure because of the problematic sources .
on top of that , there are obviously air defense missiles . there has bee n talk about hezbollah 's n ew military stre n gth over the last couple of days .
is this justified ? i think that 's exaggerated and propaganda .
if you wage war against lebanon because of two kidnapped israeli soldiers , of course it 's necessary to justify this war .
to justify the destruction of lebanese infrastructure by saying that two israeli soldiers have been kidnapped is n't really convincing - especially when keeping in mind that israel has imprisoned up to 10,000 palestinians .
that 's why it 's necessary to emphasize hezbollah 's threat .
when all is said and done , hezbollah can not do much more harm than a pin prick - albeit a painful one . are fears that tel aviv could be hit by hezbollah missiles exaggerated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli airstrike hits the center of the southern suburbs of beirut in principle , tel aviv should be beyond reach .
but we have to think about what we mean when we talk about missiles .
there are missiles of the kind that have been launched in afghanistan or also in lebanon .
they are self-made .
they do n't have more explosive force than a hand grenade or a relatively small explosive charge .
it 's clearly horrific when one is hit with it , but it has a largely symbolic significance in terms of the strategic balance of power .
you can scare and kill people with it .
but it can not be compared to 200 daily air raids on lebanon and the threat to bomb the country back 20 to 30 years .
when we look at the middle east conflict , we have to realize that of course both the arab and the israeli players have blood on their hands .
if we look at the current , concrete situation in lebanon , it 's fairly clear that the israeli position is violating international law . what role does ira n play i n supporti n g hezbollah militarily ? neither iran nor hezbollah make a big fuss about their cooperation .
what we hear , we hear from israeli or western secret service circles .
according to this information , iran does indeed seem to support hezbollah financially - that 's not in doubt .
iran also seems to have delivered weapons and missiles with a range of up to 70 kilometers - there 's clear evidence for that .
but we can not really prove whether the missiles come from iran directly or whether they have reached hezbollah via middlemen . what about syria ? the syrian role is not clear .
in the past there has been a strong tactical support for hezbollah from syria .
that 's maybe a little confusing as the syrian dictatorship is actually a completely secular one and has nothing to do with shiite extremism .
still , the islamist movement hezbollah has received support .
politically speaking , syrian president assad has more or less sided with hezbollah .
since the withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon , it 's not quite clear whether they are just loudmouthed or whether there 's more to it than verbal radicalism . steffen leidel interviewed jochen hippler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreigners flee lebanon amid calls for " humanitarian corridor " germany has pledged one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in emergency aid for lebanon as some 3,000 germans and thousands of other nationals still wait to leave the war-shattered country .

" we need a reinforced and more efficient fight against illegal immigration , fundamental for the credibility and coherence of our immigration and asylum policies , " frattini said .
" by being tough on illegal immigration we prevent immigrants from being exploited and we remove the key pull factor for illegal immigration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.07.2006 darfur : " the violence must end " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union alone ca n't handle the darfur conflcit sudan is resisting pressure to accept a un mission in darfur .
dw-world.de spoke to the foreign policy expert for germany 's green party , kerstin müller , on the world 's obligation to do more in the war-torn region . dw-world.de : you called for a clear signal at the donor conference for darfur held in brussels this week .
what should it look like ? first of all , there needs to be a clear signal demanding an end to the violence .
since 2003 , a civil war has been raging there .
the janjaweed militia , armed by the khartoum government , continues to terrorize the population with violence , displacing them .
mass rapes are on the daily agenda . in the meantime , 2 million people live in refugee camps .
almost 300,000 have died .
some people even talk of genocide .
the international community is responsible here to send clear signals to both sides that the violence must end . how can the international community pressure the sudanese government to accept a un mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2 million people have been displaced from their homes in darfur so far , an african union force has tried to protect the population .
unfortunately , they do n't have the ability to do so .
so it 's been decided that the united nations should take over here by the end of the year at the latest .
but the sudanese government wo n't agree to such a un mission in darfur .
we need this mission , though , and with a strong mandate , which is truly in a position to protect the population . i expect the german government and the international community to exert pressure on the sudanese government to agree to such a un mission .
if that is n't enough , then individual-related sanctions should be implemented , for example against the president or certain members of the government .
this is possible according to un resolutions .
but it is n't practiced , unfortunately , also not by the europeans .
these would be instruments which could force the khartoum government to consent and then quickly bring a un mission into the country . why is it so difficult for the international community to officially call the crimes in darfur genocide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller has visited the region several times last year , there was a united nations fact-finding committee .
it spoke of serious crimes against humanity , but said it could not determine genocide .
it could n't prove this of the khartoum government .
i have been in the region several times .
it is very clear to me that this is also about ethnic displacement and on a large scale , in which the janjaweed militia is armed by the government and receives support , for example through bombings and military flights .
so this is clearly a case of the most serious crimes against humanity .
i would even speak of a sneaking genocide . in my opinion , the international community is obligated and responsible .
kofi annan has repeatedly pointed this out .
for me , this is a very important conflict .
there ca n't be a second rwanda .
i am concerned that just because this is n't about europe or the middle east , but africa , that one looks away or is of the opinion that the africans should solve this themselves .
but they are not in a position to do so , as you can see from the african union mission .
we also have the responsibility to protect people in africa . naser shrouf interviewed kerstin müller -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato foreign ministers discuss darfur , expansion expansion of the military alliance and cooperation with other states to fight terrorism were on the agenda for nato foreign ministers during their meeting in april .
-lrb- april 26 , 2006 -rrb- " the stronger the eu forces become , the better " in an interview with dw-world.de , victoria nuland , us permanent representative to nato , spoke about the ongoing activities of the north atlantic treaty organization as well as plans for its future expansion .
-lrb- april 11 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : helping africa is europe 's political and moral duty horst köhler is convinced that africa 's ideas will solve africa 's problem .
that conviction marked the choice of countries he visited during his second trip to the continent as germany 's president .

a train station in haifa after a hit by a hezbollah missile while clear evidence exists that iran supports hezbollah militarily , the movement does not really pose a threat to israel , middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de. joche n hippler teaches a n d researches at the i n stitute for developme n t a n d peace -lrb- inef -rrb- at duisburg-esse n u n iversity . dw-world.de : militarily speaki n g , how stro n g is hezbollah ? jochen hippler : the problem is that we only get information about its military might indirectly via western and israeli secret service circles .
that means that we can not check how reliable the information is .
you have to keep that in mind when speaking about hezbollah .
having said that , it 's possible to say that hezbollah is an important military factor within lebanon , but it 's a third-rate power by international comparison .
estimates say that there are about 2,000 to 5,000 people in the militia and about 500 to 700 military personnel that have received training .
that 's quite a lot for lebanon .
but compared to syria or israel , it 's a negligible number . what ki n d of weapo n s does hezbollah have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hezbollah gunman aims his ak-47 hand guns and ak-47 , i.e. kalashnikovs , are standard in the region .
there are estimates that hezbollah has about 8,000 to 10,000 katyusha rockets that have a range of about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- and a few iranian-built missiles that are said to have a range of up to 60 , 70 kilometers .
that can not be proven for sure because of the problematic sources .
on top of that , there are obviously air defense missiles . there has bee n talk about hezbollah 's n ew military stre n gth over the last couple of days .
is this justified ? i think that 's exaggerated and propaganda .
if you wage war against lebanon because of two kidnapped israeli soldiers , of course it 's necessary to justify this war .
to justify the destruction of lebanese infrastructure by saying that two israeli soldiers have been kidnapped is n't really convincing - especially when keeping in mind that israel has imprisoned up to 10,000 palestinians .
that 's why it 's necessary to emphasize hezbollah 's threat .
when all is said and done , hezbollah can not do much more harm than a pin prick - albeit a painful one . are fears that tel aviv could be hit by hezbollah missiles exaggerated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli airstrike hits the center of the southern suburbs of beirut in principle , tel aviv should be beyond reach .
but we have to think about what we mean when we talk about missiles .
there are missiles of the kind that have been launched in afghanistan or also in lebanon .
they are self-made .
they do n't have more explosive force than a hand grenade or a relatively small explosive charge .
it 's clearly horrific when one is hit with it , but it has a largely symbolic significance in terms of the strategic balance of power .
you can scare and kill people with it .
but it can not be compared to 200 daily air raids on lebanon and the threat to bomb the country back 20 to 30 years .
when we look at the middle east conflict , we have to realize that of course both the arab and the israeli players have blood on their hands .
if we look at the current , concrete situation in lebanon , it 's fairly clear that the israeli position is violating international law . what role does ira n play i n supporti n g hezbollah militarily ? neither iran nor hezbollah make a big fuss about their cooperation .
what we hear , we hear from israeli or western secret service circles .
according to this information , iran does indeed seem to support hezbollah financially - that 's not in doubt .
iran also seems to have delivered weapons and missiles with a range of up to 70 kilometers - there 's clear evidence for that .
but we can not really prove whether the missiles come from iran directly or whether they have reached hezbollah via middlemen . what about syria ? the syrian role is not clear .
in the past there has been a strong tactical support for hezbollah from syria .
that 's maybe a little confusing as the syrian dictatorship is actually a completely secular one and has nothing to do with shiite extremism .
still , the islamist movement hezbollah has received support .
politically speaking , syrian president assad has more or less sided with hezbollah .
since the withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon , it 's not quite clear whether they are just loudmouthed or whether there 's more to it than verbal radicalism . steffen leidel interviewed jochen hippler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreigners flee lebanon amid calls for " humanitarian corridor " germany has pledged one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in emergency aid for lebanon as some 3,000 germans and thousands of other nationals still wait to leave the war-shattered country .

this is a callous delay tactic , which condones further casualties , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . after a week of massive airstrikes by the israeli air force on lebanon , washington has said it will deploy us marines to the region .
not , like in 1957 and 1982 , to restore peace and order in lebanon , but rather to evacuate us citizens . peace and order have to wait .
us president george w. bush has made that more than clear .
he is not willing to support immediate measures to end the war .
he does n't want to send his secretary of state on her way to the region for a few more days .
in washington , that will have to take " about another week . " another week like the last one ?
with hundreds of civilian casualties , hundreds of thousands of refugees and billions in damage to the lebanese infrastructure ?
it is absurd and inhuman to constitute a new order in lebanon based on this suffering and misery of innocent people . the us president apparently has a very limited perception .
it seems the government in jerusalem insinuated to him that it needs this one week to vitally weaken hezbollah now and in the long term .
the white house gives jerusalem the go-ahead - no matter how high the price . every day claims new casualties of course , it is certainly true that a quick ceasefire , if one were to even come about , would n't solve the basic problem .
hezbollah remains a powerful force in southern lebanon .
the central government in beirut could n't send its troops there .
sooner or later , the next cross-border conflicts could be expected .
and everything would start anew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli troops have entered lebanon but is the situation going to be any different in a week ?
is hezbollah going to be beaten then ?
in washington , no one can predict this with certainty .
even in jerusalem and tel aviv , the prognoses by politicians and the military vary between " several days " and " several months . " efforts are doomed to fail if no us action is taken in the course of its history , lebanon has weathered through many a bleak period .
it was often the lebanese themselves who were responsible for this .
but over and over , the country has also become the plaything for foreign powers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the israeli attacks have caused extensive damage in lebanon in the current case , both play a role .
hezbollah is a lebanese force , which nevertheless acts as an extended arm of syria and iran .
and israel can count on the - so far - unrestricted support of washington .
what could the hectic efforts by the europeans or the united nations to end the conflict even accomplish ? all of these efforts are doomed to fail , as long as washington does n't give up its stance of " wait and see . "
president bush appears to be indifferent to the fact that the united states will make even more enemies in the world with this position - and further disqualify itself from its reclaimed role of being the " world 's sheriff . " the one thing that can be said for certain about bush in this context : he has proven yet again that he is always willing to make unpopular decisions . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " hezbollah ca n't do much more harm than a pin prick " while clear evidence exists that iran supports hezbollah militarily , the movement does not really pose a threat to israel , middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de.
-lrb- july 20 , 2006 -rrb- experts : eu mediation in middle east requires a common line the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .

this is a callous delay tactic , which condones further casualties , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . after a week of massive airstrikes by the israeli air force on lebanon , washington has said it will deploy us marines to the region .
not , like in 1957 and 1982 , to restore peace and order in lebanon , but rather to evacuate us citizens . peace and order have to wait .
us president george w. bush has made that more than clear .
he is not willing to support immediate measures to end the war .
he does n't want to send his secretary of state on her way to the region for a few more days .
in washington , that will have to take " about another week . " another week like the last one ?
with hundreds of civilian casualties , hundreds of thousands of refugees and billions in damage to the lebanese infrastructure ?
it is absurd and inhuman to constitute a new order in lebanon based on this suffering and misery of innocent people . the us president apparently has a very limited perception .
it seems the government in jerusalem insinuated to him that it needs this one week to vitally weaken hezbollah now and in the long term .
the white house gives jerusalem the go-ahead - no matter how high the price . every day claims new casualties of course , it is certainly true that a quick ceasefire , if one were to even come about , would n't solve the basic problem .
hezbollah remains a powerful force in southern lebanon .
the central government in beirut could n't send its troops there .
sooner or later , the next cross-border conflicts could be expected .
and everything would start anew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli troops have entered lebanon but is the situation going to be any different in a week ?
is hezbollah going to be beaten then ?
in washington , no one can predict this with certainty .
even in jerusalem and tel aviv , the prognoses by politicians and the military vary between " several days " and " several months . " efforts are doomed to fail if no us action is taken in the course of its history , lebanon has weathered through many a bleak period .
it was often the lebanese themselves who were responsible for this .
but over and over , the country has also become the plaything for foreign powers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the israeli attacks have caused extensive damage in lebanon in the current case , both play a role .
hezbollah is a lebanese force , which nevertheless acts as an extended arm of syria and iran .
and israel can count on the - so far - unrestricted support of washington .
what could the hectic efforts by the europeans or the united nations to end the conflict even accomplish ? all of these efforts are doomed to fail , as long as washington does n't give up its stance of " wait and see . "
president bush appears to be indifferent to the fact that the united states will make even more enemies in the world with this position - and further disqualify itself from its reclaimed role of being the " world 's sheriff . " the one thing that can be said for certain about bush in this context : he has proven yet again that he is always willing to make unpopular decisions . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " hezbollah ca n't do much more harm than a pin prick " while clear evidence exists that iran supports hezbollah militarily , the movement does not really pose a threat to israel , middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de.
-lrb- july 20 , 2006 -rrb- experts : eu mediation in middle east requires a common line the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .

a train station in haifa after a hit by a hezbollah missile while clear evidence exists that iran supports hezbollah militarily , the movement does not really pose a threat to israel , middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de. joche n hippler teaches a n d researches at the i n stitute for developme n t a n d peace -lrb- inef -rrb- at duisburg-esse n u n iversity . dw-world.de : militarily speaki n g , how stro n g is hezbollah ? jochen hippler : the problem is that we only get information about its military might indirectly via western and israeli secret service circles .
that means that we can not check how reliable the information is .
you have to keep that in mind when speaking about hezbollah .
having said that , it 's possible to say that hezbollah is an important military factor within lebanon , but it 's a third-rate power by international comparison .
estimates say that there are about 2,000 to 5,000 people in the militia and about 500 to 700 military personnel that have received training .
that 's quite a lot for lebanon .
but compared to syria or israel , it 's a negligible number . what ki n d of weapo n s does hezbollah have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hezbollah gunman aims his ak-47 hand guns and ak-47 , i.e. kalashnikovs , are standard in the region .
there are estimates that hezbollah has about 8,000 to 10,000 katyusha rockets that have a range of about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- and a few iranian-built missiles that are said to have a range of up to 60 , 70 kilometers .
that can not be proven for sure because of the problematic sources .
on top of that , there are obviously air defense missiles . there has bee n talk about hezbollah 's n ew military stre n gth over the last couple of days .
is this justified ? i think that 's exaggerated and propaganda .
if you wage war against lebanon because of two kidnapped israeli soldiers , of course it 's necessary to justify this war .
to justify the destruction of lebanese infrastructure by saying that two israeli soldiers have been kidnapped is n't really convincing - especially when keeping in mind that israel has imprisoned up to 10,000 palestinians .
that 's why it 's necessary to emphasize hezbollah 's threat .
when all is said and done , hezbollah can not do much more harm than a pin prick - albeit a painful one . are fears that tel aviv could be hit by hezbollah missiles exaggerated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli airstrike hits the center of the southern suburbs of beirut in principle , tel aviv should be beyond reach .
but we have to think about what we mean when we talk about missiles .
there are missiles of the kind that have been launched in afghanistan or also in lebanon .
they are self-made .
they do n't have more explosive force than a hand grenade or a relatively small explosive charge .
it 's clearly horrific when one is hit with it , but it has a largely symbolic significance in terms of the strategic balance of power .
you can scare and kill people with it .
but it can not be compared to 200 daily air raids on lebanon and the threat to bomb the country back 20 to 30 years .
when we look at the middle east conflict , we have to realize that of course both the arab and the israeli players have blood on their hands .
if we look at the current , concrete situation in lebanon , it 's fairly clear that the israeli position is violating international law . what role does ira n play i n supporti n g hezbollah militarily ? neither iran nor hezbollah make a big fuss about their cooperation .
what we hear , we hear from israeli or western secret service circles .
according to this information , iran does indeed seem to support hezbollah financially - that 's not in doubt .
iran also seems to have delivered weapons and missiles with a range of up to 70 kilometers - there 's clear evidence for that .
but we can not really prove whether the missiles come from iran directly or whether they have reached hezbollah via middlemen . what about syria ? the syrian role is not clear .
in the past there has been a strong tactical support for hezbollah from syria .
that 's maybe a little confusing as the syrian dictatorship is actually a completely secular one and has nothing to do with shiite extremism .
still , the islamist movement hezbollah has received support .
politically speaking , syrian president assad has more or less sided with hezbollah .
since the withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon , it 's not quite clear whether they are just loudmouthed or whether there 's more to it than verbal radicalism . steffen leidel interviewed jochen hippler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreigners flee lebanon amid calls for " humanitarian corridor " germany has pledged one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in emergency aid for lebanon as some 3,000 germans and thousands of other nationals still wait to leave the war-shattered country .

dw-world.de spoke to the foreign policy expert for germany 's green party , kerstin müller , on the world 's obligation to do more in the war-torn region . dw-world.de : you called for a clear signal at the donor conference for darfur held in brussels this week .
what should it look like ? first of all , there needs to be a clear signal demanding an end to the violence .
since 2003 , a civil war has been raging there .
the janjaweed militia , armed by the khartoum government , continues to terrorize the population with violence , displacing them .
mass rapes are on the daily agenda . in the meantime , 2 million people live in refugee camps .
almost 300,000 have died .
some people even talk of genocide .
the international community is responsible here to send clear signals to both sides that the violence must end . how can the international community pressure the sudanese government to accept a un mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2 million people have been displaced from their homes in darfur so far , an african union force has tried to protect the population .
unfortunately , they do n't have the ability to do so .
so it 's been decided that the united nations should take over here by the end of the year at the latest .
but the sudanese government wo n't agree to such a un mission in darfur .
we need this mission , though , and with a strong mandate , which is truly in a position to protect the population . i expect the german government and the international community to exert pressure on the sudanese government to agree to such a un mission .
if that is n't enough , then individual-related sanctions should be implemented , for example against the president or certain members of the government .
this is possible according to un resolutions .
but it is n't practiced , unfortunately , also not by the europeans .
these would be instruments which could force the khartoum government to consent and then quickly bring a un mission into the country . why is it so difficult for the international community to officially call the crimes in darfur genocide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller has visited the region several times last year , there was a united nations fact-finding committee .
it spoke of serious crimes against humanity , but said it could not determine genocide .
it could n't prove this of the khartoum government .
i have been in the region several times .
it is very clear to me that this is also about ethnic displacement and on a large scale , in which the janjaweed militia is armed by the government and receives support , for example through bombings and military flights .
so this is clearly a case of the most serious crimes against humanity .
i would even speak of a sneaking genocide . in my opinion , the international community is obligated and responsible .
kofi annan has repeatedly pointed this out .
for me , this is a very important conflict .
there ca n't be a second rwanda .
i am concerned that just because this is n't about europe or the middle east , but africa , that one looks away or is of the opinion that the africans should solve this themselves .
but they are not in a position to do so , as you can see from the african union mission .
we also have the responsibility to protect people in africa . naser shrouf interviewed kerstin müller -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato foreign ministers discuss darfur , expansion expansion of the military alliance and cooperation with other states to fight terrorism were on the agenda for nato foreign ministers during their meeting in april .

it is very clear to me that this is also about ethnic displacement and on a large scale , in which the janjaweed militia is armed by the government and receives support , for example through bombings and military flights .

i would even speak of a sneaking genocide . in my opinion , the international community is obligated and responsible .
kofi annan has repeatedly pointed this out .

but they are not in a position to do so , as you can see from the african union mission .

" we were constantly afraid of being bombed but we had no choice , " one german woman on a bus convoy to syria told reporters .
the road has been targeted by the israelis in the past few days . others disembarking in larnaca , cyprus , expressed relief that they made it to safety . " i am so sad to be going back to france , " zeina , 40 , who was on holiday with her family said .
" but i was so frightened by the first bombs .
it is such a relief to be here . " some expressed fear over those they left behind . dunia shabaan , a lebanese-german woman came to the german embassy meeting point with her young children .
" we feel bad leaving our parents behind but we have to leave because our children are terrified by the sounds of the bombs , " she said , crying . " i do n't know if my parents will be alive when i reach germany . " terror on the streets evacuees also described the terror on the streets of beirut during the israeli bombings in the past week . " there were houses getting blown up five minutes from where we were , " samantha bradley , a 33-year-old mother of two from central england . melbourne secretary soirse flanagan , 35 , whose middle east holiday literally went up in smoke with the israeli offensive , admitted she was desperate to get out as quickly as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners expressed fear at being so close to the bombings " you just keep hearing bombs .
it 's pretty scary , it all happened very quickly and escalated very quickly . " some expressed rage over the bombing campaign .
" i am really angry at what israel is doing , " belgian sigrit hoste said .
" it is a disproportionate attack - they are killing civilians only . " canadian ludovic marcotte , 29 , said his ordeal under israeli bombardment in his ancestral homeland would remain with him even when he got home to montreal : " being in a war zone really changes the way you look at life . " coping as well as they can as european and other governments struggle to cope with thousands of their nationals stuck in middle of the fighting , frustration erupted over bottlenecks . on the beirut docks , there were angry scenes as westerners battled for a precious place for their loved ones , while swamped embassy staff tried to calm growing tensions . " this is disgusting , " yelled one canadian woman at lebanese guards preventing them from storming the seafront building where consular officials were allotting places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many dual nationals fear for those left behind rough figures suggested as many as 13,000 people had already escaped or would be brought to safety by thursday . but according to figures provided by embassies and governments , up to 57,000 more foreign and dual nationals could be aiming to flee the country on the few spaces available to sanctuary , 160 kilometers away in cyprus . logistical nightmare the quickening rescue effort by so many countries was causing a logistical nightmare , with ships jostling for space in the harbor and scores of buses transporting evacuees getting snarled in traffic jams . " they 've had five days to do something , why are we stuck here , " asked one man in frustration . the sudden demand for buses and ships meant charter prices had soared 10-fold or more , and some countries suddenly found their hastily made plans turned upside down . australia , for instance , had chartered a greek vessel to take 350 of its citizens out on wednesday - but discovered just before it was meant to dock that the ship was double-booked .
instead , some 100 of its priority cases , mainly families with young children and handicapped people , were taken to a british warship which was already loading hundreds of british citizens . as some left , they took time to reflect on what they were leaving behind . " god knows what will happen to this country after we leave , " a lebanese-french woman wept as she boarded a french ferry .

" we need a reinforced and more efficient fight against illegal immigration , fundamental for the credibility and coherence of our immigration and asylum policies , " frattini said .
" by being tough on illegal immigration we prevent immigrants from being exploited and we remove the key pull factor for illegal immigration . " improvi n g eu coordi n atio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a red cross worker hands out biscuits to would-be immigrants in los cristianos on the canary island of tenerife the plan is part of a wider package of proposals aimed at improving coordination between eu members , which also focuses in particular on a code for short-stay visas for third-country nationals . if the proposals are approved by eu member states and the european parliament , they would make it much easier to carry out operations similar to a technical assistance mission slowly getting off the ground in the canary islands . the spanish islands off the northwestern coast of africa are facing waves of clandestine immigrants with more than 10,000 estimated to have arrived by sea since the beginning of the year . the eu borders agency is running a mission to help the canaries with identifying immigrants and repatriating them as well as monitoring the senegalese and mauritanian coasts . help for malta bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malta 's capital , valetta malta could also soon receive eu help in the form of italian and greek patrols for east african immigrants trying to reach the tiny mediterranean island from libya . however , some member states hold reservations towards the mission as long as libya does not give permission to patrol in its waters , frattini said . the difficulty of coordinating the struggle against clandestine immigration has been highlighted recently by the plight of 51 eritreans who were picked up by a spanish trawler off malta but whom valetta refuses to accept . after they remained five days adrift on the trawler , madrid pledged wednesday to take in some of them but insists that from a legal point of view it should be up to libya and then malta to handle them . the diplomatic standoff signals a tough new policy by malta , the eu 's smallest member state , which claims it already has more than its share of clandestine immigrants - more than 2,000 - seeking to reach europe from africa . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel launches search for new integration policy german chancellor angela merkel on friday launched a drive to find ways of better integrating immigrants in the european union 's most populous country .

what should it look like ? first of all , there needs to be a clear signal demanding an end to the violence .
since 2003 , a civil war has been raging there .
the janjaweed militia , armed by the khartoum government , continues to terrorize the population with violence , displacing them .
mass rapes are on the daily agenda . in the meantime , 2 million people live in refugee camps .
almost 300,000 have died .

unfortunately , they do n't have the ability to do so .
so it 's been decided that the united nations should take over here by the end of the year at the latest .
but the sudanese government wo n't agree to such a un mission in darfur .
we need this mission , though , and with a strong mandate , which is truly in a position to protect the population . i expect the german government and the international community to exert pressure on the sudanese government to agree to such a un mission .
if that is n't enough , then individual-related sanctions should be implemented , for example against the president or certain members of the government .
this is possible according to un resolutions .
but it is n't practiced , unfortunately , also not by the europeans .
these would be instruments which could force the khartoum government to consent and then quickly bring a un mission into the country . why is it so difficult for the international community to officially call the crimes in darfur genocide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller has visited the region several times last year , there was a united nations fact-finding committee .
it spoke of serious crimes against humanity , but said it could not determine genocide .
it could n't prove this of the khartoum government .
i have been in the region several times .
it is very clear to me that this is also about ethnic displacement and on a large scale , in which the janjaweed militia is armed by the government and receives support , for example through bombings and military flights .
so this is clearly a case of the most serious crimes against humanity .
i would even speak of a sneaking genocide . in my opinion , the international community is obligated and responsible .
kofi annan has repeatedly pointed this out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.07.2006 " hezbollah ca n't do much more harm than a pin prick " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merely symbolic ?
a train station in haifa after a hit by a hezbollah missile while clear evidence exists that iran supports hezbollah militarily , the movement does not really pose a threat to israel , middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de. joche n hippler teaches a n d researches at the i n stitute for developme n t a n d peace -lrb- inef -rrb- at duisburg-esse n u n iversity . dw-world.de : militarily speaki n g , how stro n g is hezbollah ? jochen hippler : the problem is that we only get information about its military might indirectly via western and israeli secret service circles .
that means that we can not check how reliable the information is .
you have to keep that in mind when speaking about hezbollah .
having said that , it 's possible to say that hezbollah is an important military factor within lebanon , but it 's a third-rate power by international comparison .
estimates say that there are about 2,000 to 5,000 people in the militia and about 500 to 700 military personnel that have received training .
that 's quite a lot for lebanon .
but compared to syria or israel , it 's a negligible number . what ki n d of weapo n s does hezbollah have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hezbollah gunman aims his ak-47 hand guns and ak-47 , i.e. kalashnikovs , are standard in the region .
there are estimates that hezbollah has about 8,000 to 10,000 katyusha rockets that have a range of about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- and a few iranian-built missiles that are said to have a range of up to 60 , 70 kilometers .
that can not be proven for sure because of the problematic sources .
on top of that , there are obviously air defense missiles . there has bee n talk about hezbollah 's n ew military stre n gth over the last couple of days .
is this justified ? i think that 's exaggerated and propaganda .
if you wage war against lebanon because of two kidnapped israeli soldiers , of course it 's necessary to justify this war .
to justify the destruction of lebanese infrastructure by saying that two israeli soldiers have been kidnapped is n't really convincing - especially when keeping in mind that israel has imprisoned up to 10,000 palestinians .
that 's why it 's necessary to emphasize hezbollah 's threat .
when all is said and done , hezbollah can not do much more harm than a pin prick - albeit a painful one . are fears that tel aviv could be hit by hezbollah missiles exaggerated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli airstrike hits the center of the southern suburbs of beirut in principle , tel aviv should be beyond reach .
but we have to think about what we mean when we talk about missiles .
there are missiles of the kind that have been launched in afghanistan or also in lebanon .
they are self-made .
they do n't have more explosive force than a hand grenade or a relatively small explosive charge .
it 's clearly horrific when one is hit with it , but it has a largely symbolic significance in terms of the strategic balance of power .
you can scare and kill people with it .
but it can not be compared to 200 daily air raids on lebanon and the threat to bomb the country back 20 to 30 years .
when we look at the middle east conflict , we have to realize that of course both the arab and the israeli players have blood on their hands .
if we look at the current , concrete situation in lebanon , it 's fairly clear that the israeli position is violating international law . what role does ira n play i n supporti n g hezbollah militarily ? neither iran nor hezbollah make a big fuss about their cooperation .
what we hear , we hear from israeli or western secret service circles .
according to this information , iran does indeed seem to support hezbollah financially - that 's not in doubt .
iran also seems to have delivered weapons and missiles with a range of up to 70 kilometers - there 's clear evidence for that .
but we can not really prove whether the missiles come from iran directly or whether they have reached hezbollah via middlemen . what about syria ? the syrian role is not clear .
in the past there has been a strong tactical support for hezbollah from syria .
that 's maybe a little confusing as the syrian dictatorship is actually a completely secular one and has nothing to do with shiite extremism .
still , the islamist movement hezbollah has received support .
politically speaking , syrian president assad has more or less sided with hezbollah .
since the withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon , it 's not quite clear whether they are just loudmouthed or whether there 's more to it than verbal radicalism . steffen leidel interviewed jochen hippler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreigners flee lebanon amid calls for " humanitarian corridor " germany has pledged one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in emergency aid for lebanon as some 3,000 germans and thousands of other nationals still wait to leave the war-shattered country .

a train station in haifa after a hit by a hezbollah missile while clear evidence exists that iran supports hezbollah militarily , the movement does not really pose a threat to israel , middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de. joche n hippler teaches a n d researches at the i n stitute for developme n t a n d peace -lrb- inef -rrb- at duisburg-esse n u n iversity . dw-world.de : militarily speaki n g , how stro n g is hezbollah ? jochen hippler : the problem is that we only get information about its military might indirectly via western and israeli secret service circles .
that means that we can not check how reliable the information is .
you have to keep that in mind when speaking about hezbollah .
having said that , it 's possible to say that hezbollah is an important military factor within lebanon , but it 's a third-rate power by international comparison .
estimates say that there are about 2,000 to 5,000 people in the militia and about 500 to 700 military personnel that have received training .
that 's quite a lot for lebanon .
but compared to syria or israel , it 's a negligible number . what ki n d of weapo n s does hezbollah have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hezbollah gunman aims his ak-47 hand guns and ak-47 , i.e. kalashnikovs , are standard in the region .
there are estimates that hezbollah has about 8,000 to 10,000 katyusha rockets that have a range of about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- and a few iranian-built missiles that are said to have a range of up to 60 , 70 kilometers .
that can not be proven for sure because of the problematic sources .
on top of that , there are obviously air defense missiles . there has bee n talk about hezbollah 's n ew military stre n gth over the last couple of days .
is this justified ? i think that 's exaggerated and propaganda .
if you wage war against lebanon because of two kidnapped israeli soldiers , of course it 's necessary to justify this war .
to justify the destruction of lebanese infrastructure by saying that two israeli soldiers have been kidnapped is n't really convincing - especially when keeping in mind that israel has imprisoned up to 10,000 palestinians .
that 's why it 's necessary to emphasize hezbollah 's threat .
when all is said and done , hezbollah can not do much more harm than a pin prick - albeit a painful one . are fears that tel aviv could be hit by hezbollah missiles exaggerated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli airstrike hits the center of the southern suburbs of beirut in principle , tel aviv should be beyond reach .
but we have to think about what we mean when we talk about missiles .
there are missiles of the kind that have been launched in afghanistan or also in lebanon .
they are self-made .
they do n't have more explosive force than a hand grenade or a relatively small explosive charge .
it 's clearly horrific when one is hit with it , but it has a largely symbolic significance in terms of the strategic balance of power .
you can scare and kill people with it .
but it can not be compared to 200 daily air raids on lebanon and the threat to bomb the country back 20 to 30 years .
when we look at the middle east conflict , we have to realize that of course both the arab and the israeli players have blood on their hands .
if we look at the current , concrete situation in lebanon , it 's fairly clear that the israeli position is violating international law . what role does ira n play i n supporti n g hezbollah militarily ? neither iran nor hezbollah make a big fuss about their cooperation .
what we hear , we hear from israeli or western secret service circles .
according to this information , iran does indeed seem to support hezbollah financially - that 's not in doubt .
iran also seems to have delivered weapons and missiles with a range of up to 70 kilometers - there 's clear evidence for that .
but we can not really prove whether the missiles come from iran directly or whether they have reached hezbollah via middlemen . what about syria ? the syrian role is not clear .
in the past there has been a strong tactical support for hezbollah from syria .
that 's maybe a little confusing as the syrian dictatorship is actually a completely secular one and has nothing to do with shiite extremism .
still , the islamist movement hezbollah has received support .
politically speaking , syrian president assad has more or less sided with hezbollah .
since the withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon , it 's not quite clear whether they are just loudmouthed or whether there 's more to it than verbal radicalism . steffen leidel interviewed jochen hippler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreigners flee lebanon amid calls for " humanitarian corridor " germany has pledged one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in emergency aid for lebanon as some 3,000 germans and thousands of other nationals still wait to leave the war-shattered country .

blame it on germany 's new nonchalance after the world cup , but a frankfurt court really seems to have crossed the line .
it ruled in favor of a cold-blooded thief who stole goods worth at least 40 cents from her employer . what is the world coming to , we ask ourselves , when unsuspecting , righteous members of society can no longer rely on the support of germany 's judicial system ?
will the country plunge into yet another recession by causing betrayed entrepreneurs to pack up and leave ? here is what happened : this week , judges in germany 's financial capital frankfurt sided with a kitchen helper at a restaurant who had the audacity to ignore her boss ' explicit warning that it was absolutely verboten to take home food without paying . believe it or not , but this lady - if you can call her that - dared to eat a yoghurt , valued at a minimum of 40 euro cents -lrb- that 's a whopping 50 us cents -rrb- .
luckily , the employers found out about the crime and did what they had to do : they fired the woman immediately . taking her case before a judge , the woman argued that the yoghurt had already been past its expiration date - as if that really mattered .
at least the court did n't care about that particular point , either .
judges did , however , say that technically the woman had not breached company rules since she ate the stolen yoghurt on the premises rather than taking it to her home . seems like the poor restaurant owners will have to be even more careful when they read new employees the riot act .

the iranian leader , who minces no words in his distrust of the west , took swipes at israel and the us . he lashed out at the us-led invasion of afghanistan and iraq , abuses of detainees in guantanamo bay and washington 's staunch support for israel .
he even admonished bush , a born-again christian , to be be more pious , saying that his actions were inconsistent with christian teachings . in contrast , the letter to merkel was different in tone - " not so confrontational , " the official said . " it 's not negative like ahmadinejad 's letter to bush .
he is not criticising germany , " he told reuters .

dw-world.de spoke to the foreign policy expert for germany 's green party , kerstin müller , on the world 's obligation to do more in the war-torn region . dw-world.de : you called for a clear signal at the donor conference for darfur held in brussels this week .
what should it look like ? first of all , there needs to be a clear signal demanding an end to the violence .
since 2003 , a civil war has been raging there .
the janjaweed militia , armed by the khartoum government , continues to terrorize the population with violence , displacing them .
mass rapes are on the daily agenda . in the meantime , 2 million people live in refugee camps .
almost 300,000 have died .
some people even talk of genocide .
the international community is responsible here to send clear signals to both sides that the violence must end . how can the international community pressure the sudanese government to accept a un mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2 million people have been displaced from their homes in darfur so far , an african union force has tried to protect the population .
unfortunately , they do n't have the ability to do so .
so it 's been decided that the united nations should take over here by the end of the year at the latest .
but the sudanese government wo n't agree to such a un mission in darfur .
we need this mission , though , and with a strong mandate , which is truly in a position to protect the population . i expect the german government and the international community to exert pressure on the sudanese government to agree to such a un mission .
if that is n't enough , then individual-related sanctions should be implemented , for example against the president or certain members of the government .
this is possible according to un resolutions .
but it is n't practiced , unfortunately , also not by the europeans .
these would be instruments which could force the khartoum government to consent and then quickly bring a un mission into the country . why is it so difficult for the international community to officially call the crimes in darfur genocide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller has visited the region several times last year , there was a united nations fact-finding committee .
it spoke of serious crimes against humanity , but said it could not determine genocide .
it could n't prove this of the khartoum government .
i have been in the region several times .
it is very clear to me that this is also about ethnic displacement and on a large scale , in which the janjaweed militia is armed by the government and receives support , for example through bombings and military flights .
so this is clearly a case of the most serious crimes against humanity .
i would even speak of a sneaking genocide . in my opinion , the international community is obligated and responsible .
kofi annan has repeatedly pointed this out .
for me , this is a very important conflict .
there ca n't be a second rwanda .
i am concerned that just because this is n't about europe or the middle east , but africa , that one looks away or is of the opinion that the africans should solve this themselves .
but they are not in a position to do so , as you can see from the african union mission .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.07.2006 darfur : " the violence must end " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union alone ca n't handle the darfur conflcit sudan is resisting pressure to accept a un mission in darfur .
dw-world.de spoke to the foreign policy expert for germany 's green party , kerstin müller , on the world 's obligation to do more in the war-torn region . dw-world.de : you called for a clear signal at the donor conference for darfur held in brussels this week .
what should it look like ? first of all , there needs to be a clear signal demanding an end to the violence .
since 2003 , a civil war has been raging there .
the janjaweed militia , armed by the khartoum government , continues to terrorize the population with violence , displacing them .
mass rapes are on the daily agenda . in the meantime , 2 million people live in refugee camps .
almost 300,000 have died .
some people even talk of genocide .
the international community is responsible here to send clear signals to both sides that the violence must end . how can the international community pressure the sudanese government to accept a un mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2 million people have been displaced from their homes in darfur so far , an african union force has tried to protect the population .
unfortunately , they do n't have the ability to do so .
so it 's been decided that the united nations should take over here by the end of the year at the latest .
but the sudanese government wo n't agree to such a un mission in darfur .
we need this mission , though , and with a strong mandate , which is truly in a position to protect the population . i expect the german government and the international community to exert pressure on the sudanese government to agree to such a un mission .
if that is n't enough , then individual-related sanctions should be implemented , for example against the president or certain members of the government .
this is possible according to un resolutions .
but it is n't practiced , unfortunately , also not by the europeans .
these would be instruments which could force the khartoum government to consent and then quickly bring a un mission into the country . why is it so difficult for the international community to officially call the crimes in darfur genocide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller has visited the region several times last year , there was a united nations fact-finding committee .
it spoke of serious crimes against humanity , but said it could not determine genocide .
it could n't prove this of the khartoum government .
i have been in the region several times .
it is very clear to me that this is also about ethnic displacement and on a large scale , in which the janjaweed militia is armed by the government and receives support , for example through bombings and military flights .
so this is clearly a case of the most serious crimes against humanity .

a train station in haifa after a hit by a hezbollah missile while clear evidence exists that iran supports hezbollah militarily , the movement does not really pose a threat to israel , middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de. joche n hippler teaches a n d researches at the i n stitute for developme n t a n d peace -lrb- inef -rrb- at duisburg-esse n u n iversity . dw-world.de : militarily speaki n g , how stro n g is hezbollah ? jochen hippler : the problem is that we only get information about its military might indirectly via western and israeli secret service circles .
that means that we can not check how reliable the information is .
you have to keep that in mind when speaking about hezbollah .
having said that , it 's possible to say that hezbollah is an important military factor within lebanon , but it 's a third-rate power by international comparison .
estimates say that there are about 2,000 to 5,000 people in the militia and about 500 to 700 military personnel that have received training .
that 's quite a lot for lebanon .
but compared to syria or israel , it 's a negligible number . what ki n d of weapo n s does hezbollah have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hezbollah gunman aims his ak-47 hand guns and ak-47 , i.e. kalashnikovs , are standard in the region .
there are estimates that hezbollah has about 8,000 to 10,000 katyusha rockets that have a range of about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- and a few iranian-built missiles that are said to have a range of up to 60 , 70 kilometers .
that can not be proven for sure because of the problematic sources .
on top of that , there are obviously air defense missiles . there has bee n talk about hezbollah 's n ew military stre n gth over the last couple of days .
is this justified ? i think that 's exaggerated and propaganda .
if you wage war against lebanon because of two kidnapped israeli soldiers , of course it 's necessary to justify this war .
to justify the destruction of lebanese infrastructure by saying that two israeli soldiers have been kidnapped is n't really convincing - especially when keeping in mind that israel has imprisoned up to 10,000 palestinians .
that 's why it 's necessary to emphasize hezbollah 's threat .
when all is said and done , hezbollah can not do much more harm than a pin prick - albeit a painful one . are fears that tel aviv could be hit by hezbollah missiles exaggerated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli airstrike hits the center of the southern suburbs of beirut in principle , tel aviv should be beyond reach .
but we have to think about what we mean when we talk about missiles .
there are missiles of the kind that have been launched in afghanistan or also in lebanon .
they are self-made .
they do n't have more explosive force than a hand grenade or a relatively small explosive charge .
it 's clearly horrific when one is hit with it , but it has a largely symbolic significance in terms of the strategic balance of power .
you can scare and kill people with it .
but it can not be compared to 200 daily air raids on lebanon and the threat to bomb the country back 20 to 30 years .
when we look at the middle east conflict , we have to realize that of course both the arab and the israeli players have blood on their hands .
if we look at the current , concrete situation in lebanon , it 's fairly clear that the israeli position is violating international law . what role does ira n play i n supporti n g hezbollah militarily ? neither iran nor hezbollah make a big fuss about their cooperation .
what we hear , we hear from israeli or western secret service circles .
according to this information , iran does indeed seem to support hezbollah financially - that 's not in doubt .
iran also seems to have delivered weapons and missiles with a range of up to 70 kilometers - there 's clear evidence for that .
but we can not really prove whether the missiles come from iran directly or whether they have reached hezbollah via middlemen . what about syria ? the syrian role is not clear .
in the past there has been a strong tactical support for hezbollah from syria .
that 's maybe a little confusing as the syrian dictatorship is actually a completely secular one and has nothing to do with shiite extremism .
still , the islamist movement hezbollah has received support .
politically speaking , syrian president assad has more or less sided with hezbollah .
since the withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon , it 's not quite clear whether they are just loudmouthed or whether there 's more to it than verbal radicalism . steffen leidel interviewed jochen hippler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreigners flee lebanon amid calls for " humanitarian corridor " germany has pledged one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in emergency aid for lebanon as some 3,000 germans and thousands of other nationals still wait to leave the war-shattered country .

if you wage war against lebanon because of two kidnapped israeli soldiers , of course it 's necessary to justify this war .
to justify the destruction of lebanese infrastructure by saying that two israeli soldiers have been kidnapped is n't really convincing - especially when keeping in mind that israel has imprisoned up to 10,000 palestinians .
that 's why it 's necessary to emphasize hezbollah 's threat .
when all is said and done , hezbollah can not do much more harm than a pin prick - albeit a painful one . are fears that tel aviv could be hit by hezbollah missiles exaggerated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli airstrike hits the center of the southern suburbs of beirut in principle , tel aviv should be beyond reach .
but we have to think about what we mean when we talk about missiles .
there are missiles of the kind that have been launched in afghanistan or also in lebanon .
they are self-made .
they do n't have more explosive force than a hand grenade or a relatively small explosive charge .
it 's clearly horrific when one is hit with it , but it has a largely symbolic significance in terms of the strategic balance of power .
you can scare and kill people with it .
but it can not be compared to 200 daily air raids on lebanon and the threat to bomb the country back 20 to 30 years .
when we look at the middle east conflict , we have to realize that of course both the arab and the israeli players have blood on their hands .
if we look at the current , concrete situation in lebanon , it 's fairly clear that the israeli position is violating international law . what role does ira n play i n supporti n g hezbollah militarily ? neither iran nor hezbollah make a big fuss about their cooperation .
what we hear , we hear from israeli or western secret service circles .
according to this information , iran does indeed seem to support hezbollah financially - that 's not in doubt .
iran also seems to have delivered weapons and missiles with a range of up to 70 kilometers - there 's clear evidence for that .
but we can not really prove whether the missiles come from iran directly or whether they have reached hezbollah via middlemen . what about syria ? the syrian role is not clear .
in the past there has been a strong tactical support for hezbollah from syria .
that 's maybe a little confusing as the syrian dictatorship is actually a completely secular one and has nothing to do with shiite extremism .
still , the islamist movement hezbollah has received support .
politically speaking , syrian president assad has more or less sided with hezbollah .
since the withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon , it 's not quite clear whether they are just loudmouthed or whether there 's more to it than verbal radicalism . steffen leidel interviewed jochen hippler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreigners flee lebanon amid calls for " humanitarian corridor " germany has pledged one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in emergency aid for lebanon as some 3,000 germans and thousands of other nationals still wait to leave the war-shattered country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.07.2006 darfur : " the violence must end " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union alone ca n't handle the darfur conflcit sudan is resisting pressure to accept a un mission in darfur .
dw-world.de spoke to the foreign policy expert for germany 's green party , kerstin müller , on the world 's obligation to do more in the war-torn region . dw-world.de : you called for a clear signal at the donor conference for darfur held in brussels this week .
what should it look like ? first of all , there needs to be a clear signal demanding an end to the violence .
since 2003 , a civil war has been raging there .
the janjaweed militia , armed by the khartoum government , continues to terrorize the population with violence , displacing them .
mass rapes are on the daily agenda . in the meantime , 2 million people live in refugee camps .
almost 300,000 have died .
some people even talk of genocide .
the international community is responsible here to send clear signals to both sides that the violence must end . how can the international community pressure the sudanese government to accept a un mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2 million people have been displaced from their homes in darfur so far , an african union force has tried to protect the population .
unfortunately , they do n't have the ability to do so .
so it 's been decided that the united nations should take over here by the end of the year at the latest .
but the sudanese government wo n't agree to such a un mission in darfur .
we need this mission , though , and with a strong mandate , which is truly in a position to protect the population . i expect the german government and the international community to exert pressure on the sudanese government to agree to such a un mission .
if that is n't enough , then individual-related sanctions should be implemented , for example against the president or certain members of the government .
this is possible according to un resolutions .
but it is n't practiced , unfortunately , also not by the europeans .
these would be instruments which could force the khartoum government to consent and then quickly bring a un mission into the country . why is it so difficult for the international community to officially call the crimes in darfur genocide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller has visited the region several times last year , there was a united nations fact-finding committee .
it spoke of serious crimes against humanity , but said it could not determine genocide .
it could n't prove this of the khartoum government .
i have been in the region several times .
it is very clear to me that this is also about ethnic displacement and on a large scale , in which the janjaweed militia is armed by the government and receives support , for example through bombings and military flights .
so this is clearly a case of the most serious crimes against humanity .
i would even speak of a sneaking genocide . in my opinion , the international community is obligated and responsible .
kofi annan has repeatedly pointed this out .
for me , this is a very important conflict .
there ca n't be a second rwanda .
i am concerned that just because this is n't about europe or the middle east , but africa , that one looks away or is of the opinion that the africans should solve this themselves .
but they are not in a position to do so , as you can see from the african union mission .
we also have the responsibility to protect people in africa . naser shrouf interviewed kerstin müller -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato foreign ministers discuss darfur , expansion expansion of the military alliance and cooperation with other states to fight terrorism were on the agenda for nato foreign ministers during their meeting in april .
-lrb- april 26 , 2006 -rrb- " the stronger the eu forces become , the better " in an interview with dw-world.de , victoria nuland , us permanent representative to nato , spoke about the ongoing activities of the north atlantic treaty organization as well as plans for its future expansion .
-lrb- april 11 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : helping africa is europe 's political and moral duty horst köhler is convinced that africa 's ideas will solve africa 's problem .
that conviction marked the choice of countries he visited during his second trip to the continent as germany 's president .

the iranian leader , who minces no words in his distrust of the west , took swipes at israel and the us . he lashed out at the us-led invasion of afghanistan and iraq , abuses of detainees in guantanamo bay and washington 's staunch support for israel .
he even admonished bush , a born-again christian , to be be more pious , saying that his actions were inconsistent with christian teachings . in contrast , the letter to merkel was different in tone - " not so confrontational , " the official said . " it 's not negative like ahmadinejad 's letter to bush .
he is not criticising germany , " he told reuters .

" it 's all related to germany and how we have to find a solution to the palestinian problems and zionism and so on .
it 's rather weird , " said the official who saw the letter on thursday . zionism is a political movement that supports a homeland for the jewish people in palestine , and lead to the establishment of the state of israel . a touchy subject the letter comes at a time when germany 's relations with iran have become more tense after ahmadinejad 's repeated denial of the holocaust .

he even admonished bush , a born-again christian , to be be more pious , saying that his actions were inconsistent with christian teachings . in contrast , the letter to merkel was different in tone - " not so confrontational , " the official said . " it 's not negative like ahmadinejad 's letter to bush .
he is not criticising germany , " he told reuters .

" i enjoy being captain , " he said last week .
however , senior bmw executives are understood to have signaled to panke some time ago that it was unlikely that his contract would be extended .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.07.2006 darfur : " the violence must end " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union alone ca n't handle the darfur conflcit sudan is resisting pressure to accept a un mission in darfur .
dw-world.de spoke to the foreign policy expert for germany 's green party , kerstin müller , on the world 's obligation to do more in the war-torn region . dw-world.de : you called for a clear signal at the donor conference for darfur held in brussels this week .
what should it look like ? first of all , there needs to be a clear signal demanding an end to the violence .
since 2003 , a civil war has been raging there .
the janjaweed militia , armed by the khartoum government , continues to terrorize the population with violence , displacing them .
mass rapes are on the daily agenda . in the meantime , 2 million people live in refugee camps .
almost 300,000 have died .
some people even talk of genocide .
the international community is responsible here to send clear signals to both sides that the violence must end . how can the international community pressure the sudanese government to accept a un mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2 million people have been displaced from their homes in darfur so far , an african union force has tried to protect the population .
unfortunately , they do n't have the ability to do so .
so it 's been decided that the united nations should take over here by the end of the year at the latest .
but the sudanese government wo n't agree to such a un mission in darfur .
we need this mission , though , and with a strong mandate , which is truly in a position to protect the population . i expect the german government and the international community to exert pressure on the sudanese government to agree to such a un mission .
if that is n't enough , then individual-related sanctions should be implemented , for example against the president or certain members of the government .
this is possible according to un resolutions .
but it is n't practiced , unfortunately , also not by the europeans .
these would be instruments which could force the khartoum government to consent and then quickly bring a un mission into the country . why is it so difficult for the international community to officially call the crimes in darfur genocide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller has visited the region several times last year , there was a united nations fact-finding committee .
it spoke of serious crimes against humanity , but said it could not determine genocide .
it could n't prove this of the khartoum government .
i have been in the region several times .
it is very clear to me that this is also about ethnic displacement and on a large scale , in which the janjaweed militia is armed by the government and receives support , for example through bombings and military flights .
so this is clearly a case of the most serious crimes against humanity .
i would even speak of a sneaking genocide . in my opinion , the international community is obligated and responsible .
kofi annan has repeatedly pointed this out .
for me , this is a very important conflict .
there ca n't be a second rwanda .
i am concerned that just because this is n't about europe or the middle east , but africa , that one looks away or is of the opinion that the africans should solve this themselves .
but they are not in a position to do so , as you can see from the african union mission .
we also have the responsibility to protect people in africa . naser shrouf interviewed kerstin müller -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato foreign ministers discuss darfur , expansion expansion of the military alliance and cooperation with other states to fight terrorism were on the agenda for nato foreign ministers during their meeting in april .
-lrb- april 26 , 2006 -rrb- " the stronger the eu forces become , the better " in an interview with dw-world.de , victoria nuland , us permanent representative to nato , spoke about the ongoing activities of the north atlantic treaty organization as well as plans for its future expansion .

dw-world.de spoke to the foreign policy expert for germany 's green party , kerstin müller , on the world 's obligation to do more in the war-torn region . dw-world.de : you called for a clear signal at the donor conference for darfur held in brussels this week .
what should it look like ? first of all , there needs to be a clear signal demanding an end to the violence .
since 2003 , a civil war has been raging there .
the janjaweed militia , armed by the khartoum government , continues to terrorize the population with violence , displacing them .
mass rapes are on the daily agenda . in the meantime , 2 million people live in refugee camps .
almost 300,000 have died .
some people even talk of genocide .
the international community is responsible here to send clear signals to both sides that the violence must end . how can the international community pressure the sudanese government to accept a un mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2 million people have been displaced from their homes in darfur so far , an african union force has tried to protect the population .
unfortunately , they do n't have the ability to do so .
so it 's been decided that the united nations should take over here by the end of the year at the latest .
but the sudanese government wo n't agree to such a un mission in darfur .
we need this mission , though , and with a strong mandate , which is truly in a position to protect the population . i expect the german government and the international community to exert pressure on the sudanese government to agree to such a un mission .
if that is n't enough , then individual-related sanctions should be implemented , for example against the president or certain members of the government .
this is possible according to un resolutions .
but it is n't practiced , unfortunately , also not by the europeans .
these would be instruments which could force the khartoum government to consent and then quickly bring a un mission into the country . why is it so difficult for the international community to officially call the crimes in darfur genocide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller has visited the region several times last year , there was a united nations fact-finding committee .
it spoke of serious crimes against humanity , but said it could not determine genocide .
it could n't prove this of the khartoum government .
i have been in the region several times .
it is very clear to me that this is also about ethnic displacement and on a large scale , in which the janjaweed militia is armed by the government and receives support , for example through bombings and military flights .
so this is clearly a case of the most serious crimes against humanity .
i would even speak of a sneaking genocide . in my opinion , the international community is obligated and responsible .
kofi annan has repeatedly pointed this out .
for me , this is a very important conflict .
there ca n't be a second rwanda .
i am concerned that just because this is n't about europe or the middle east , but africa , that one looks away or is of the opinion that the africans should solve this themselves .
but they are not in a position to do so , as you can see from the african union mission .
we also have the responsibility to protect people in africa . naser shrouf interviewed kerstin müller -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato foreign ministers discuss darfur , expansion expansion of the military alliance and cooperation with other states to fight terrorism were on the agenda for nato foreign ministers during their meeting in april .

this is a callous delay tactic , which condones further casualties , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . after a week of massive airstrikes by the israeli air force on lebanon , washington has said it will deploy us marines to the region .
not , like in 1957 and 1982 , to restore peace and order in lebanon , but rather to evacuate us citizens . peace and order have to wait .
us president george w. bush has made that more than clear .
he is not willing to support immediate measures to end the war .
he does n't want to send his secretary of state on her way to the region for a few more days .
in washington , that will have to take " about another week . " another week like the last one ?
with hundreds of civilian casualties , hundreds of thousands of refugees and billions in damage to the lebanese infrastructure ?
it is absurd and inhuman to constitute a new order in lebanon based on this suffering and misery of innocent people . the us president apparently has a very limited perception .
it seems the government in jerusalem insinuated to him that it needs this one week to vitally weaken hezbollah now and in the long term .
the white house gives jerusalem the go-ahead - no matter how high the price . every day claims new casualties of course , it is certainly true that a quick ceasefire , if one were to even come about , would n't solve the basic problem .
hezbollah remains a powerful force in southern lebanon .

and everything would start anew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli troops have entered lebanon but is the situation going to be any different in a week ?

in washington , no one can predict this with certainty .
even in jerusalem and tel aviv , the prognoses by politicians and the military vary between " several days " and " several months . " efforts are doomed to fail if no us action is taken in the course of its history , lebanon has weathered through many a bleak period .

a train station in haifa after a hit by a hezbollah missile while clear evidence exists that iran supports hezbollah militarily , the movement does not really pose a threat to israel , middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de. joche n hippler teaches a n d researches at the i n stitute for developme n t a n d peace -lrb- inef -rrb- at duisburg-esse n u n iversity . dw-world.de : militarily speaki n g , how stro n g is hezbollah ? jochen hippler : the problem is that we only get information about its military might indirectly via western and israeli secret service circles .
that means that we can not check how reliable the information is .
you have to keep that in mind when speaking about hezbollah .
having said that , it 's possible to say that hezbollah is an important military factor within lebanon , but it 's a third-rate power by international comparison .
estimates say that there are about 2,000 to 5,000 people in the militia and about 500 to 700 military personnel that have received training .
that 's quite a lot for lebanon .
but compared to syria or israel , it 's a negligible number . what ki n d of weapo n s does hezbollah have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hezbollah gunman aims his ak-47 hand guns and ak-47 , i.e. kalashnikovs , are standard in the region .
there are estimates that hezbollah has about 8,000 to 10,000 katyusha rockets that have a range of about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- and a few iranian-built missiles that are said to have a range of up to 60 , 70 kilometers .
that can not be proven for sure because of the problematic sources .
on top of that , there are obviously air defense missiles . there has bee n talk about hezbollah 's n ew military stre n gth over the last couple of days .
is this justified ? i think that 's exaggerated and propaganda .
if you wage war against lebanon because of two kidnapped israeli soldiers , of course it 's necessary to justify this war .
to justify the destruction of lebanese infrastructure by saying that two israeli soldiers have been kidnapped is n't really convincing - especially when keeping in mind that israel has imprisoned up to 10,000 palestinians .
that 's why it 's necessary to emphasize hezbollah 's threat .
when all is said and done , hezbollah can not do much more harm than a pin prick - albeit a painful one . are fears that tel aviv could be hit by hezbollah missiles exaggerated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli airstrike hits the center of the southern suburbs of beirut in principle , tel aviv should be beyond reach .
but we have to think about what we mean when we talk about missiles .
there are missiles of the kind that have been launched in afghanistan or also in lebanon .
they are self-made .
they do n't have more explosive force than a hand grenade or a relatively small explosive charge .
it 's clearly horrific when one is hit with it , but it has a largely symbolic significance in terms of the strategic balance of power .
you can scare and kill people with it .
but it can not be compared to 200 daily air raids on lebanon and the threat to bomb the country back 20 to 30 years .
when we look at the middle east conflict , we have to realize that of course both the arab and the israeli players have blood on their hands .
if we look at the current , concrete situation in lebanon , it 's fairly clear that the israeli position is violating international law . what role does ira n play i n supporti n g hezbollah militarily ? neither iran nor hezbollah make a big fuss about their cooperation .
what we hear , we hear from israeli or western secret service circles .
according to this information , iran does indeed seem to support hezbollah financially - that 's not in doubt .
iran also seems to have delivered weapons and missiles with a range of up to 70 kilometers - there 's clear evidence for that .
but we can not really prove whether the missiles come from iran directly or whether they have reached hezbollah via middlemen . what about syria ? the syrian role is not clear .
in the past there has been a strong tactical support for hezbollah from syria .
that 's maybe a little confusing as the syrian dictatorship is actually a completely secular one and has nothing to do with shiite extremism .
still , the islamist movement hezbollah has received support .
politically speaking , syrian president assad has more or less sided with hezbollah .
since the withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon , it 's not quite clear whether they are just loudmouthed or whether there 's more to it than verbal radicalism . steffen leidel interviewed jochen hippler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreigners flee lebanon amid calls for " humanitarian corridor " germany has pledged one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in emergency aid for lebanon as some 3,000 germans and thousands of other nationals still wait to leave the war-shattered country .

having said that , it 's possible to say that hezbollah is an important military factor within lebanon , but it 's a third-rate power by international comparison .
estimates say that there are about 2,000 to 5,000 people in the militia and about 500 to 700 military personnel that have received training .
that 's quite a lot for lebanon .
but compared to syria or israel , it 's a negligible number . what ki n d of weapo n s does hezbollah have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hezbollah gunman aims his ak-47 hand guns and ak-47 , i.e. kalashnikovs , are standard in the region .
there are estimates that hezbollah has about 8,000 to 10,000 katyusha rockets that have a range of about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- and a few iranian-built missiles that are said to have a range of up to 60 , 70 kilometers .
that can not be proven for sure because of the problematic sources .
on top of that , there are obviously air defense missiles . there has bee n talk about hezbollah 's n ew military stre n gth over the last couple of days .
is this justified ? i think that 's exaggerated and propaganda .
if you wage war against lebanon because of two kidnapped israeli soldiers , of course it 's necessary to justify this war .
to justify the destruction of lebanese infrastructure by saying that two israeli soldiers have been kidnapped is n't really convincing - especially when keeping in mind that israel has imprisoned up to 10,000 palestinians .
that 's why it 's necessary to emphasize hezbollah 's threat .
when all is said and done , hezbollah can not do much more harm than a pin prick - albeit a painful one . are fears that tel aviv could be hit by hezbollah missiles exaggerated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli airstrike hits the center of the southern suburbs of beirut in principle , tel aviv should be beyond reach .
but we have to think about what we mean when we talk about missiles .
there are missiles of the kind that have been launched in afghanistan or also in lebanon .
they are self-made .
they do n't have more explosive force than a hand grenade or a relatively small explosive charge .
it 's clearly horrific when one is hit with it , but it has a largely symbolic significance in terms of the strategic balance of power .
you can scare and kill people with it .
but it can not be compared to 200 daily air raids on lebanon and the threat to bomb the country back 20 to 30 years .
when we look at the middle east conflict , we have to realize that of course both the arab and the israeli players have blood on their hands .
if we look at the current , concrete situation in lebanon , it 's fairly clear that the israeli position is violating international law . what role does ira n play i n supporti n g hezbollah militarily ? neither iran nor hezbollah make a big fuss about their cooperation .
what we hear , we hear from israeli or western secret service circles .
according to this information , iran does indeed seem to support hezbollah financially - that 's not in doubt .
iran also seems to have delivered weapons and missiles with a range of up to 70 kilometers - there 's clear evidence for that .
but we can not really prove whether the missiles come from iran directly or whether they have reached hezbollah via middlemen . what about syria ? the syrian role is not clear .
in the past there has been a strong tactical support for hezbollah from syria .
that 's maybe a little confusing as the syrian dictatorship is actually a completely secular one and has nothing to do with shiite extremism .
still , the islamist movement hezbollah has received support .

dw-world.de spoke to the foreign policy expert for germany 's green party , kerstin müller , on the world 's obligation to do more in the war-torn region . dw-world.de : you called for a clear signal at the donor conference for darfur held in brussels this week .
what should it look like ? first of all , there needs to be a clear signal demanding an end to the violence .
since 2003 , a civil war has been raging there .
the janjaweed militia , armed by the khartoum government , continues to terrorize the population with violence , displacing them .
mass rapes are on the daily agenda . in the meantime , 2 million people live in refugee camps .
almost 300,000 have died .
some people even talk of genocide .
the international community is responsible here to send clear signals to both sides that the violence must end . how can the international community pressure the sudanese government to accept a un mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2 million people have been displaced from their homes in darfur so far , an african union force has tried to protect the population .
unfortunately , they do n't have the ability to do so .
so it 's been decided that the united nations should take over here by the end of the year at the latest .
but the sudanese government wo n't agree to such a un mission in darfur .
we need this mission , though , and with a strong mandate , which is truly in a position to protect the population . i expect the german government and the international community to exert pressure on the sudanese government to agree to such a un mission .
if that is n't enough , then individual-related sanctions should be implemented , for example against the president or certain members of the government .
this is possible according to un resolutions .
but it is n't practiced , unfortunately , also not by the europeans .
these would be instruments which could force the khartoum government to consent and then quickly bring a un mission into the country . why is it so difficult for the international community to officially call the crimes in darfur genocide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller has visited the region several times last year , there was a united nations fact-finding committee .
it spoke of serious crimes against humanity , but said it could not determine genocide .
it could n't prove this of the khartoum government .
i have been in the region several times .
it is very clear to me that this is also about ethnic displacement and on a large scale , in which the janjaweed militia is armed by the government and receives support , for example through bombings and military flights .
so this is clearly a case of the most serious crimes against humanity .
i would even speak of a sneaking genocide . in my opinion , the international community is obligated and responsible .
kofi annan has repeatedly pointed this out .
for me , this is a very important conflict .
there ca n't be a second rwanda .
i am concerned that just because this is n't about europe or the middle east , but africa , that one looks away or is of the opinion that the africans should solve this themselves .
but they are not in a position to do so , as you can see from the african union mission .
we also have the responsibility to protect people in africa . naser shrouf interviewed kerstin müller -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato foreign ministers discuss darfur , expansion expansion of the military alliance and cooperation with other states to fight terrorism were on the agenda for nato foreign ministers during their meeting in april .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.07.2006 iranian leader asks german chancellor for help with zionism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad is notorious for his firebrand speeches two months after sending us president bush a letter , mahmoud ahmadinejad has written angela merkel a letter requesting aid in solving the palestinian problem and dealing with zionism . the iranian news agency irna said the message had been handed to the german charge d 'affaires in tehran by foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , who visited berlin in june . german officials confirmed the receipt of the letter but until late thursday declined to comment on the contents . " there 's nothing about the nuclear issue -lrb- in the letter -rrb- , " a german government official told reuters on condition of anonymity . " it 's all related to germany and how we have to find a solution to the palestinian problems and zionism and so on .
it 's rather weird , " said the official who saw the letter on thursday . zionism is a political movement that supports a homeland for the jewish people in palestine , and lead to the establishment of the state of israel . a touchy subject the letter comes at a time when germany 's relations with iran have become more tense after ahmadinejad 's repeated denial of the holocaust .
again this week , he made comments questioning whether the holocaust was being used as a tool by the west to dominate the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is contemplating a response the german official who read the letter said it was an " extremely touchy " subject , and added that the government did not yet know if or how it would respond .
" there are a lot of propaganda phrases about israel and the jews in it . " holocaust denial is a crime in germany punishable with up to five years in prison . less confrontational than us letter in may , ahmadinejad wrote us president george w. bush an 18-page letter discussing religious values , history and international relations .
the iranian leader , who minces no words in his distrust of the west , took swipes at israel and the us . he lashed out at the us-led invasion of afghanistan and iraq , abuses of detainees in guantanamo bay and washington 's staunch support for israel .
he even admonished bush , a born-again christian , to be be more pious , saying that his actions were inconsistent with christian teachings . in contrast , the letter to merkel was different in tone - " not so confrontational , " the official said . " it 's not negative like ahmadinejad 's letter to bush .
he is not criticising germany , " he told reuters .
" it 's basically about how we have to work together and solve the problems of the world together . " no mention of nuclear standoff the german official said it was interesting that the letter did not discuss iran 's nuclear standoff with the united states , european union and other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear facility in natan iran is facing possible action at the un security council over suspicions that it is developing nuclear weapons under the cloak of its energy program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.07.2006 iranian leader asks german chancellor for help with zionism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad is notorious for his firebrand speeches two months after sending us president bush a letter , mahmoud ahmadinejad has written angela merkel a letter requesting aid in solving the palestinian problem and dealing with zionism . the iranian news agency irna said the message had been handed to the german charge d 'affaires in tehran by foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , who visited berlin in june . german officials confirmed the receipt of the letter but until late thursday declined to comment on the contents . " there 's nothing about the nuclear issue -lrb- in the letter -rrb- , " a german government official told reuters on condition of anonymity . " it 's all related to germany and how we have to find a solution to the palestinian problems and zionism and so on .
it 's rather weird , " said the official who saw the letter on thursday . zionism is a political movement that supports a homeland for the jewish people in palestine , and lead to the establishment of the state of israel . a touchy subject the letter comes at a time when germany 's relations with iran have become more tense after ahmadinejad 's repeated denial of the holocaust .
again this week , he made comments questioning whether the holocaust was being used as a tool by the west to dominate the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is contemplating a response the german official who read the letter said it was an " extremely touchy " subject , and added that the government did not yet know if or how it would respond .
" there are a lot of propaganda phrases about israel and the jews in it . " holocaust denial is a crime in germany punishable with up to five years in prison . less confrontational than us letter in may , ahmadinejad wrote us president george w. bush an 18-page letter discussing religious values , history and international relations .
the iranian leader , who minces no words in his distrust of the west , took swipes at israel and the us . he lashed out at the us-led invasion of afghanistan and iraq , abuses of detainees in guantanamo bay and washington 's staunch support for israel .
he even admonished bush , a born-again christian , to be be more pious , saying that his actions were inconsistent with christian teachings . in contrast , the letter to merkel was different in tone - " not so confrontational , " the official said . " it 's not negative like ahmadinejad 's letter to bush .
he is not criticising germany , " he told reuters .
" it 's basically about how we have to work together and solve the problems of the world together . " no mention of nuclear standoff the german official said it was interesting that the letter did not discuss iran 's nuclear standoff with the united states , european union and other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear facility in natan iran is facing possible action at the un security council over suspicions that it is developing nuclear weapons under the cloak of its energy program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.07.2006 " hezbollah ca n't do much more harm than a pin prick " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merely symbolic ?
a train station in haifa after a hit by a hezbollah missile while clear evidence exists that iran supports hezbollah militarily , the movement does not really pose a threat to israel , middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de. joche n hippler teaches a n d researches at the i n stitute for developme n t a n d peace -lrb- inef -rrb- at duisburg-esse n u n iversity . dw-world.de : militarily speaki n g , how stro n g is hezbollah ? jochen hippler : the problem is that we only get information about its military might indirectly via western and israeli secret service circles .
that means that we can not check how reliable the information is .
you have to keep that in mind when speaking about hezbollah .
having said that , it 's possible to say that hezbollah is an important military factor within lebanon , but it 's a third-rate power by international comparison .
estimates say that there are about 2,000 to 5,000 people in the militia and about 500 to 700 military personnel that have received training .
that 's quite a lot for lebanon .
but compared to syria or israel , it 's a negligible number . what ki n d of weapo n s does hezbollah have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hezbollah gunman aims his ak-47 hand guns and ak-47 , i.e. kalashnikovs , are standard in the region .
there are estimates that hezbollah has about 8,000 to 10,000 katyusha rockets that have a range of about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- and a few iranian-built missiles that are said to have a range of up to 60 , 70 kilometers .
that can not be proven for sure because of the problematic sources .
on top of that , there are obviously air defense missiles . there has bee n talk about hezbollah 's n ew military stre n gth over the last couple of days .
is this justified ? i think that 's exaggerated and propaganda .
if you wage war against lebanon because of two kidnapped israeli soldiers , of course it 's necessary to justify this war .
to justify the destruction of lebanese infrastructure by saying that two israeli soldiers have been kidnapped is n't really convincing - especially when keeping in mind that israel has imprisoned up to 10,000 palestinians .
that 's why it 's necessary to emphasize hezbollah 's threat .
when all is said and done , hezbollah can not do much more harm than a pin prick - albeit a painful one . are fears that tel aviv could be hit by hezbollah missiles exaggerated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli airstrike hits the center of the southern suburbs of beirut in principle , tel aviv should be beyond reach .
but we have to think about what we mean when we talk about missiles .
there are missiles of the kind that have been launched in afghanistan or also in lebanon .
they are self-made .
they do n't have more explosive force than a hand grenade or a relatively small explosive charge .
it 's clearly horrific when one is hit with it , but it has a largely symbolic significance in terms of the strategic balance of power .
you can scare and kill people with it .
but it can not be compared to 200 daily air raids on lebanon and the threat to bomb the country back 20 to 30 years .
when we look at the middle east conflict , we have to realize that of course both the arab and the israeli players have blood on their hands .
if we look at the current , concrete situation in lebanon , it 's fairly clear that the israeli position is violating international law . what role does ira n play i n supporti n g hezbollah militarily ? neither iran nor hezbollah make a big fuss about their cooperation .
what we hear , we hear from israeli or western secret service circles .
according to this information , iran does indeed seem to support hezbollah financially - that 's not in doubt .
iran also seems to have delivered weapons and missiles with a range of up to 70 kilometers - there 's clear evidence for that .
but we can not really prove whether the missiles come from iran directly or whether they have reached hezbollah via middlemen . what about syria ? the syrian role is not clear .
in the past there has been a strong tactical support for hezbollah from syria .
that 's maybe a little confusing as the syrian dictatorship is actually a completely secular one and has nothing to do with shiite extremism .
still , the islamist movement hezbollah has received support .
politically speaking , syrian president assad has more or less sided with hezbollah .
since the withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon , it 's not quite clear whether they are just loudmouthed or whether there 's more to it than verbal radicalism . steffen leidel interviewed jochen hippler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreigners flee lebanon amid calls for " humanitarian corridor " germany has pledged one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in emergency aid for lebanon as some 3,000 germans and thousands of other nationals still wait to leave the war-shattered country .
-lrb- july 19 , 2006 -rrb- experts : eu mediation in middle east requires a common line the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .
yet time is running out for international diplomatic intervention .
what role could the european union play in the negotiation process ?

dw-world.de spoke to the foreign policy expert for germany 's green party , kerstin müller , on the world 's obligation to do more in the war-torn region . dw-world.de : you called for a clear signal at the donor conference for darfur held in brussels this week .
what should it look like ? first of all , there needs to be a clear signal demanding an end to the violence .
since 2003 , a civil war has been raging there .
the janjaweed militia , armed by the khartoum government , continues to terrorize the population with violence , displacing them .
mass rapes are on the daily agenda . in the meantime , 2 million people live in refugee camps .
almost 300,000 have died .
some people even talk of genocide .
the international community is responsible here to send clear signals to both sides that the violence must end . how can the international community pressure the sudanese government to accept a un mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2 million people have been displaced from their homes in darfur so far , an african union force has tried to protect the population .
unfortunately , they do n't have the ability to do so .
so it 's been decided that the united nations should take over here by the end of the year at the latest .
but the sudanese government wo n't agree to such a un mission in darfur .
we need this mission , though , and with a strong mandate , which is truly in a position to protect the population . i expect the german government and the international community to exert pressure on the sudanese government to agree to such a un mission .
if that is n't enough , then individual-related sanctions should be implemented , for example against the president or certain members of the government .
this is possible according to un resolutions .
but it is n't practiced , unfortunately , also not by the europeans .
these would be instruments which could force the khartoum government to consent and then quickly bring a un mission into the country . why is it so difficult for the international community to officially call the crimes in darfur genocide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller has visited the region several times last year , there was a united nations fact-finding committee .
it spoke of serious crimes against humanity , but said it could not determine genocide .
it could n't prove this of the khartoum government .
i have been in the region several times .
it is very clear to me that this is also about ethnic displacement and on a large scale , in which the janjaweed militia is armed by the government and receives support , for example through bombings and military flights .
so this is clearly a case of the most serious crimes against humanity .
i would even speak of a sneaking genocide . in my opinion , the international community is obligated and responsible .
kofi annan has repeatedly pointed this out .
for me , this is a very important conflict .
there ca n't be a second rwanda .
i am concerned that just because this is n't about europe or the middle east , but africa , that one looks away or is of the opinion that the africans should solve this themselves .
but they are not in a position to do so , as you can see from the african union mission .

what should it look like ? first of all , there needs to be a clear signal demanding an end to the violence .

" there 's nothing about the nuclear issue -lrb- in the letter -rrb- , " a german government official told reuters on condition of anonymity . " it 's all related to germany and how we have to find a solution to the palestinian problems and zionism and so on .
it 's rather weird , " said the official who saw the letter on thursday . zionism is a political movement that supports a homeland for the jewish people in palestine , and lead to the establishment of the state of israel . a touchy subject the letter comes at a time when germany 's relations with iran have become more tense after ahmadinejad 's repeated denial of the holocaust .
again this week , he made comments questioning whether the holocaust was being used as a tool by the west to dominate the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is contemplating a response the german official who read the letter said it was an " extremely touchy " subject , and added that the government did not yet know if or how it would respond .
" there are a lot of propaganda phrases about israel and the jews in it . " holocaust denial is a crime in germany punishable with up to five years in prison . less confrontational than us letter in may , ahmadinejad wrote us president george w. bush an 18-page letter discussing religious values , history and international relations .
the iranian leader , who minces no words in his distrust of the west , took swipes at israel and the us . he lashed out at the us-led invasion of afghanistan and iraq , abuses of detainees in guantanamo bay and washington 's staunch support for israel .
he even admonished bush , a born-again christian , to be be more pious , saying that his actions were inconsistent with christian teachings . in contrast , the letter to merkel was different in tone - " not so confrontational , " the official said . " it 's not negative like ahmadinejad 's letter to bush .
he is not criticising germany , " he told reuters .
" it 's basically about how we have to work together and solve the problems of the world together . " no mention of nuclear standoff the german official said it was interesting that the letter did not discuss iran 's nuclear standoff with the united states , european union and other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear facility in natan iran is facing possible action at the un security council over suspicions that it is developing nuclear weapons under the cloak of its energy program .
tehran denies the charge , saying it is working on developing nuclear fuel to run power stations . germany , one of iran 's largest trading partners , has been working with the five permanent members of the united nations security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - to try to convince tehran to abandon uranium enrichment , considered the first step to nuclear armament . they have developed a package of incentives to induce iran to abandon its program .
iran is expected to respond by mid-august . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran tops agenda at g8 ministers ' meeting in moscow foreign ministers of the group of eight countries are holding talks in moscow thursday that are expected to raise pressure on iran over its nuclear program .

blame it on germany 's new nonchalance after the world cup , but a frankfurt court really seems to have crossed the line .
it ruled in favor of a cold-blooded thief who stole goods worth at least 40 cents from her employer . what is the world coming to , we ask ourselves , when unsuspecting , righteous members of society can no longer rely on the support of germany 's judicial system ?
will the country plunge into yet another recession by causing betrayed entrepreneurs to pack up and leave ? here is what happened : this week , judges in germany 's financial capital frankfurt sided with a kitchen helper at a restaurant who had the audacity to ignore her boss ' explicit warning that it was absolutely verboten to take home food without paying . believe it or not , but this lady - if you can call her that - dared to eat a yoghurt , valued at a minimum of 40 euro cents -lrb- that 's a whopping 50 us cents -rrb- .
luckily , the employers found out about the crime and did what they had to do : they fired the woman immediately . taking her case before a judge , the woman argued that the yoghurt had already been past its expiration date - as if that really mattered .
at least the court did n't care about that particular point , either .
judges did , however , say that technically the woman had not breached company rules since she ate the stolen yoghurt on the premises rather than taking it to her home . seems like the poor restaurant owners will have to be even more careful when they read new employees the riot act .
if they can find new employees , that is . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flyout menus , or how to enjoy your curry away from home unconfirmed rumors circulating in berlin these days suggest that germany and the united kingdom may be on the verge of a diplomatic scandal over the surprising question of who 's got the better tikka masala .

" we need a reinforced and more efficient fight against illegal immigration , fundamental for the credibility and coherence of our immigration and asylum policies , " frattini said .

the move is part of a major shakeup of the bmw 's management . the 50-year-old reithofer , who is currently the management board member responsible for production , is to take over from current chief executive helmut panke on sept .
1 , the company said in a statement .
the announcement followed a meeting of the carmaker 's board and comes in the wake of weeks of speculation about possible changes in the group 's upper management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new head of bmw " with this decision the supervisory board has determined the course of the company 's long-term management , " said board chairman joachim milberg .
with bmw 's flexible production system considered to be a model for the car industry , reithofer has long been considered to be a candidate to replace panke , who has presided over record earnings at the munich-based group .
bmw expects profits before tax to rise this year by 3.3 per cent to a record four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.05 billion -rrb- .
panke hits bmw retirement age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is panke too old to lead bmw ?
the german press has been speculating that panke 's contract was unlikely to be renewed when it runs out early next year because the company 's policy is for managers to retire at 60 .
panke , who turns 60 in august , had hoped that his contract would be extended .
" i enjoy being captain , " he said last week .
however , senior bmw executives are understood to have signaled to panke some time ago that it was unlikely that his contract would be extended .

the move is part of a major shakeup of the bmw 's management . the 50-year-old reithofer , who is currently the management board member responsible for production , is to take over from current chief executive helmut panke on sept .
1 , the company said in a statement .
the announcement followed a meeting of the carmaker 's board and comes in the wake of weeks of speculation about possible changes in the group 's upper management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new head of bmw " with this decision the supervisory board has determined the course of the company 's long-term management , " said board chairman joachim milberg .
with bmw 's flexible production system considered to be a model for the car industry , reithofer has long been considered to be a candidate to replace panke , who has presided over record earnings at the munich-based group .
bmw expects profits before tax to rise this year by 3.3 per cent to a record four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.05 billion -rrb- .
panke hits bmw retirement age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is panke too old to lead bmw ?
the german press has been speculating that panke 's contract was unlikely to be renewed when it runs out early next year because the company 's policy is for managers to retire at 60 .
panke , who turns 60 in august , had hoped that his contract would be extended .
" i enjoy being captain , " he said last week .
however , senior bmw executives are understood to have signaled to panke some time ago that it was unlikely that his contract would be extended .

dw-world.de spoke to the foreign policy expert for germany 's green party , kerstin müller , on the world 's obligation to do more in the war-torn region . dw-world.de : you called for a clear signal at the donor conference for darfur held in brussels this week .
what should it look like ? first of all , there needs to be a clear signal demanding an end to the violence .
since 2003 , a civil war has been raging there .
the janjaweed militia , armed by the khartoum government , continues to terrorize the population with violence , displacing them .
mass rapes are on the daily agenda . in the meantime , 2 million people live in refugee camps .
almost 300,000 have died .
some people even talk of genocide .
the international community is responsible here to send clear signals to both sides that the violence must end . how can the international community pressure the sudanese government to accept a un mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2 million people have been displaced from their homes in darfur so far , an african union force has tried to protect the population .
unfortunately , they do n't have the ability to do so .
so it 's been decided that the united nations should take over here by the end of the year at the latest .
but the sudanese government wo n't agree to such a un mission in darfur .
we need this mission , though , and with a strong mandate , which is truly in a position to protect the population . i expect the german government and the international community to exert pressure on the sudanese government to agree to such a un mission .
if that is n't enough , then individual-related sanctions should be implemented , for example against the president or certain members of the government .
this is possible according to un resolutions .
but it is n't practiced , unfortunately , also not by the europeans .
these would be instruments which could force the khartoum government to consent and then quickly bring a un mission into the country . why is it so difficult for the international community to officially call the crimes in darfur genocide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller has visited the region several times last year , there was a united nations fact-finding committee .
it spoke of serious crimes against humanity , but said it could not determine genocide .
it could n't prove this of the khartoum government .
i have been in the region several times .
it is very clear to me that this is also about ethnic displacement and on a large scale , in which the janjaweed militia is armed by the government and receives support , for example through bombings and military flights .
so this is clearly a case of the most serious crimes against humanity .
i would even speak of a sneaking genocide . in my opinion , the international community is obligated and responsible .
kofi annan has repeatedly pointed this out .
for me , this is a very important conflict .
there ca n't be a second rwanda .
i am concerned that just because this is n't about europe or the middle east , but africa , that one looks away or is of the opinion that the africans should solve this themselves .
but they are not in a position to do so , as you can see from the african union mission .
we also have the responsibility to protect people in africa . naser shrouf interviewed kerstin müller -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato foreign ministers discuss darfur , expansion expansion of the military alliance and cooperation with other states to fight terrorism were on the agenda for nato foreign ministers during their meeting in april .
-lrb- april 26 , 2006 -rrb- " the stronger the eu forces become , the better " in an interview with dw-world.de , victoria nuland , us permanent representative to nato , spoke about the ongoing activities of the north atlantic treaty organization as well as plans for its future expansion .
-lrb- april 11 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : helping africa is europe 's political and moral duty horst köhler is convinced that africa 's ideas will solve africa 's problem .
that conviction marked the choice of countries he visited during his second trip to the continent as germany 's president .

hezbollah is a lebanese force , which nevertheless acts as an extended arm of syria and iran .
and israel can count on the - so far - unrestricted support of washington .
what could the hectic efforts by the europeans or the united nations to end the conflict even accomplish ? all of these efforts are doomed to fail , as long as washington does n't give up its stance of " wait and see . "
president bush appears to be indifferent to the fact that the united states will make even more enemies in the world with this position - and further disqualify itself from its reclaimed role of being the " world 's sheriff .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.07.2006 " hezbollah ca n't do much more harm than a pin prick " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merely symbolic ?
a train station in haifa after a hit by a hezbollah missile while clear evidence exists that iran supports hezbollah militarily , the movement does not really pose a threat to israel , middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de. joche n hippler teaches a n d researches at the i n stitute for developme n t a n d peace -lrb- inef -rrb- at duisburg-esse n u n iversity . dw-world.de : militarily speaki n g , how stro n g is hezbollah ? jochen hippler : the problem is that we only get information about its military might indirectly via western and israeli secret service circles .
that means that we can not check how reliable the information is .
you have to keep that in mind when speaking about hezbollah .
having said that , it 's possible to say that hezbollah is an important military factor within lebanon , but it 's a third-rate power by international comparison .
estimates say that there are about 2,000 to 5,000 people in the militia and about 500 to 700 military personnel that have received training .
that 's quite a lot for lebanon .
but compared to syria or israel , it 's a negligible number . what ki n d of weapo n s does hezbollah have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hezbollah gunman aims his ak-47 hand guns and ak-47 , i.e. kalashnikovs , are standard in the region .
there are estimates that hezbollah has about 8,000 to 10,000 katyusha rockets that have a range of about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- and a few iranian-built missiles that are said to have a range of up to 60 , 70 kilometers .
that can not be proven for sure because of the problematic sources .
on top of that , there are obviously air defense missiles . there has bee n talk about hezbollah 's n ew military stre n gth over the last couple of days .
is this justified ? i think that 's exaggerated and propaganda .
if you wage war against lebanon because of two kidnapped israeli soldiers , of course it 's necessary to justify this war .
to justify the destruction of lebanese infrastructure by saying that two israeli soldiers have been kidnapped is n't really convincing - especially when keeping in mind that israel has imprisoned up to 10,000 palestinians .
that 's why it 's necessary to emphasize hezbollah 's threat .
when all is said and done , hezbollah can not do much more harm than a pin prick - albeit a painful one . are fears that tel aviv could be hit by hezbollah missiles exaggerated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli airstrike hits the center of the southern suburbs of beirut in principle , tel aviv should be beyond reach .
but we have to think about what we mean when we talk about missiles .
there are missiles of the kind that have been launched in afghanistan or also in lebanon .
they are self-made .
they do n't have more explosive force than a hand grenade or a relatively small explosive charge .
it 's clearly horrific when one is hit with it , but it has a largely symbolic significance in terms of the strategic balance of power .
you can scare and kill people with it .
but it can not be compared to 200 daily air raids on lebanon and the threat to bomb the country back 20 to 30 years .
when we look at the middle east conflict , we have to realize that of course both the arab and the israeli players have blood on their hands .
if we look at the current , concrete situation in lebanon , it 's fairly clear that the israeli position is violating international law . what role does ira n play i n supporti n g hezbollah militarily ? neither iran nor hezbollah make a big fuss about their cooperation .
what we hear , we hear from israeli or western secret service circles .
according to this information , iran does indeed seem to support hezbollah financially - that 's not in doubt .
iran also seems to have delivered weapons and missiles with a range of up to 70 kilometers - there 's clear evidence for that .
but we can not really prove whether the missiles come from iran directly or whether they have reached hezbollah via middlemen . what about syria ? the syrian role is not clear .
in the past there has been a strong tactical support for hezbollah from syria .
that 's maybe a little confusing as the syrian dictatorship is actually a completely secular one and has nothing to do with shiite extremism .
still , the islamist movement hezbollah has received support .
politically speaking , syrian president assad has more or less sided with hezbollah .
since the withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon , it 's not quite clear whether they are just loudmouthed or whether there 's more to it than verbal radicalism . steffen leidel interviewed jochen hippler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreigners flee lebanon amid calls for " humanitarian corridor " germany has pledged one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in emergency aid for lebanon as some 3,000 germans and thousands of other nationals still wait to leave the war-shattered country .

a train station in haifa after a hit by a hezbollah missile while clear evidence exists that iran supports hezbollah militarily , the movement does not really pose a threat to israel , middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de. joche n hippler teaches a n d researches at the i n stitute for developme n t a n d peace -lrb- inef -rrb- at duisburg-esse n u n iversity . dw-world.de : militarily speaki n g , how stro n g is hezbollah ? jochen hippler : the problem is that we only get information about its military might indirectly via western and israeli secret service circles .
that means that we can not check how reliable the information is .
you have to keep that in mind when speaking about hezbollah .
having said that , it 's possible to say that hezbollah is an important military factor within lebanon , but it 's a third-rate power by international comparison .
estimates say that there are about 2,000 to 5,000 people in the militia and about 500 to 700 military personnel that have received training .
that 's quite a lot for lebanon .
but compared to syria or israel , it 's a negligible number . what ki n d of weapo n s does hezbollah have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hezbollah gunman aims his ak-47 hand guns and ak-47 , i.e. kalashnikovs , are standard in the region .
there are estimates that hezbollah has about 8,000 to 10,000 katyusha rockets that have a range of about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- and a few iranian-built missiles that are said to have a range of up to 60 , 70 kilometers .
that can not be proven for sure because of the problematic sources .
on top of that , there are obviously air defense missiles . there has bee n talk about hezbollah 's n ew military stre n gth over the last couple of days .
is this justified ? i think that 's exaggerated and propaganda .
if you wage war against lebanon because of two kidnapped israeli soldiers , of course it 's necessary to justify this war .
to justify the destruction of lebanese infrastructure by saying that two israeli soldiers have been kidnapped is n't really convincing - especially when keeping in mind that israel has imprisoned up to 10,000 palestinians .
that 's why it 's necessary to emphasize hezbollah 's threat .
when all is said and done , hezbollah can not do much more harm than a pin prick - albeit a painful one . are fears that tel aviv could be hit by hezbollah missiles exaggerated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli airstrike hits the center of the southern suburbs of beirut in principle , tel aviv should be beyond reach .
but we have to think about what we mean when we talk about missiles .
there are missiles of the kind that have been launched in afghanistan or also in lebanon .
they are self-made .
they do n't have more explosive force than a hand grenade or a relatively small explosive charge .
it 's clearly horrific when one is hit with it , but it has a largely symbolic significance in terms of the strategic balance of power .
you can scare and kill people with it .
but it can not be compared to 200 daily air raids on lebanon and the threat to bomb the country back 20 to 30 years .
when we look at the middle east conflict , we have to realize that of course both the arab and the israeli players have blood on their hands .
if we look at the current , concrete situation in lebanon , it 's fairly clear that the israeli position is violating international law . what role does ira n play i n supporti n g hezbollah militarily ? neither iran nor hezbollah make a big fuss about their cooperation .
what we hear , we hear from israeli or western secret service circles .
according to this information , iran does indeed seem to support hezbollah financially - that 's not in doubt .
iran also seems to have delivered weapons and missiles with a range of up to 70 kilometers - there 's clear evidence for that .
but we can not really prove whether the missiles come from iran directly or whether they have reached hezbollah via middlemen . what about syria ? the syrian role is not clear .
in the past there has been a strong tactical support for hezbollah from syria .
that 's maybe a little confusing as the syrian dictatorship is actually a completely secular one and has nothing to do with shiite extremism .
still , the islamist movement hezbollah has received support .
politically speaking , syrian president assad has more or less sided with hezbollah .
since the withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon , it 's not quite clear whether they are just loudmouthed or whether there 's more to it than verbal radicalism . steffen leidel interviewed jochen hippler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreigners flee lebanon amid calls for " humanitarian corridor " germany has pledged one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in emergency aid for lebanon as some 3,000 germans and thousands of other nationals still wait to leave the war-shattered country .
-lrb- july 19 , 2006 -rrb- experts : eu mediation in middle east requires a common line the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .

a train station in haifa after a hit by a hezbollah missile while clear evidence exists that iran supports hezbollah militarily , the movement does not really pose a threat to israel , middle east expert jochen hippler told dw-world.de. joche n hippler teaches a n d researches at the i n stitute for developme n t a n d peace -lrb- inef -rrb- at duisburg-esse n u n iversity . dw-world.de : militarily speaki n g , how stro n g is hezbollah ? jochen hippler : the problem is that we only get information about its military might indirectly via western and israeli secret service circles .
that means that we can not check how reliable the information is .
you have to keep that in mind when speaking about hezbollah .
having said that , it 's possible to say that hezbollah is an important military factor within lebanon , but it 's a third-rate power by international comparison .
estimates say that there are about 2,000 to 5,000 people in the militia and about 500 to 700 military personnel that have received training .
that 's quite a lot for lebanon .
but compared to syria or israel , it 's a negligible number . what ki n d of weapo n s does hezbollah have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hezbollah gunman aims his ak-47 hand guns and ak-47 , i.e. kalashnikovs , are standard in the region .
there are estimates that hezbollah has about 8,000 to 10,000 katyusha rockets that have a range of about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- and a few iranian-built missiles that are said to have a range of up to 60 , 70 kilometers .
that can not be proven for sure because of the problematic sources .
on top of that , there are obviously air defense missiles . there has bee n talk about hezbollah 's n ew military stre n gth over the last couple of days .
is this justified ? i think that 's exaggerated and propaganda .
if you wage war against lebanon because of two kidnapped israeli soldiers , of course it 's necessary to justify this war .
to justify the destruction of lebanese infrastructure by saying that two israeli soldiers have been kidnapped is n't really convincing - especially when keeping in mind that israel has imprisoned up to 10,000 palestinians .
that 's why it 's necessary to emphasize hezbollah 's threat .
when all is said and done , hezbollah can not do much more harm than a pin prick - albeit a painful one . are fears that tel aviv could be hit by hezbollah missiles exaggerated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli airstrike hits the center of the southern suburbs of beirut in principle , tel aviv should be beyond reach .
but we have to think about what we mean when we talk about missiles .
there are missiles of the kind that have been launched in afghanistan or also in lebanon .
they are self-made .
they do n't have more explosive force than a hand grenade or a relatively small explosive charge .
it 's clearly horrific when one is hit with it , but it has a largely symbolic significance in terms of the strategic balance of power .
you can scare and kill people with it .
but it can not be compared to 200 daily air raids on lebanon and the threat to bomb the country back 20 to 30 years .
when we look at the middle east conflict , we have to realize that of course both the arab and the israeli players have blood on their hands .
if we look at the current , concrete situation in lebanon , it 's fairly clear that the israeli position is violating international law . what role does ira n play i n supporti n g hezbollah militarily ? neither iran nor hezbollah make a big fuss about their cooperation .
what we hear , we hear from israeli or western secret service circles .
according to this information , iran does indeed seem to support hezbollah financially - that 's not in doubt .
iran also seems to have delivered weapons and missiles with a range of up to 70 kilometers - there 's clear evidence for that .
but we can not really prove whether the missiles come from iran directly or whether they have reached hezbollah via middlemen . what about syria ? the syrian role is not clear .
in the past there has been a strong tactical support for hezbollah from syria .
that 's maybe a little confusing as the syrian dictatorship is actually a completely secular one and has nothing to do with shiite extremism .
still , the islamist movement hezbollah has received support .
politically speaking , syrian president assad has more or less sided with hezbollah .
since the withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon , it 's not quite clear whether they are just loudmouthed or whether there 's more to it than verbal radicalism . steffen leidel interviewed jochen hippler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreigners flee lebanon amid calls for " humanitarian corridor " germany has pledged one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in emergency aid for lebanon as some 3,000 germans and thousands of other nationals still wait to leave the war-shattered country .
-lrb- july 19 , 2006 -rrb- experts : eu mediation in middle east requires a common line the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .
yet time is running out for international diplomatic intervention .
what role could the european union play in the negotiation process ?
-lrb- july 18 , 2006 -rrb- what drives hezbollah ?
who has what interests in the escalation of violence in the middle east following a phase of relative quiet ?

" there 's nothing about the nuclear issue -lrb- in the letter -rrb- , " a german government official told reuters on condition of anonymity . " it 's all related to germany and how we have to find a solution to the palestinian problems and zionism and so on .
it 's rather weird , " said the official who saw the letter on thursday . zionism is a political movement that supports a homeland for the jewish people in palestine , and lead to the establishment of the state of israel . a touchy subject the letter comes at a time when germany 's relations with iran have become more tense after ahmadinejad 's repeated denial of the holocaust .
again this week , he made comments questioning whether the holocaust was being used as a tool by the west to dominate the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is contemplating a response the german official who read the letter said it was an " extremely touchy " subject , and added that the government did not yet know if or how it would respond .

" holocaust denial is a crime in germany punishable with up to five years in prison . less confrontational than us letter in may , ahmadinejad wrote us president george w. bush an 18-page letter discussing religious values , history and international relations .
the iranian leader , who minces no words in his distrust of the west , took swipes at israel and the us . he lashed out at the us-led invasion of afghanistan and iraq , abuses of detainees in guantanamo bay and washington 's staunch support for israel .
he even admonished bush , a born-again christian , to be be more pious , saying that his actions were inconsistent with christian teachings . in contrast , the letter to merkel was different in tone - " not so confrontational , " the official said . " it 's not negative like ahmadinejad 's letter to bush .
he is not criticising germany , " he told reuters .
" it 's basically about how we have to work together and solve the problems of the world together . " no mention of nuclear standoff the german official said it was interesting that the letter did not discuss iran 's nuclear standoff with the united states , european union and other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear facility in natan iran is facing possible action at the un security council over suspicions that it is developing nuclear weapons under the cloak of its energy program .
tehran denies the charge , saying it is working on developing nuclear fuel to run power stations . germany , one of iran 's largest trading partners , has been working with the five permanent members of the united nations security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - to try to convince tehran to abandon uranium enrichment , considered the first step to nuclear armament . they have developed a package of incentives to induce iran to abandon its program .

the universities admissions service , ucas , says while the uk as a whole has seen applications fall by 3.5 % , in wales they have increased by 1.8 % .
it is thought the decision not to introduce higher top-up fees for welsh students in wales may be a factor .
from september , students in england will pay up to £ 3,000 a year in fees .
it follows the controversial decision by the uk government to give university vice chancellors the powers to charge students that figure , as long as they attracted more students from poorer backgrounds .
in may last year opposition parties in the welsh assembly forced through a vote against higher fees for welsh students who study in wales .
these students will continue to pay the current £ 1,200 a year for their fees .
bbc wales education correspondent colette hume said it was this decision which gives welsh students living in wales a cheaper degree that could explain the rise in university applications .
ucas said the overall decrease of 17,184 applications to uk higher education courses this autumn should be seen in the context of the record increase of 8.2 % last year .
but this year 's decrease continues the downward trend revealed by the last two sets of ucas figures released this year .
' confident ' student leaders have said fear of debt was a major concern for undergraduates looking where to go this autumn .
assembly education minister jane davidson told bbc wales : " the key issue is we have universities of the highest quality .
in the last research assessment exercise we had many , many departments which were right at the top of the international tree .
" students can be confident in choosing wales and we want many more students from across the uk to do so . "
she added they would always encourage students to look for the course and university they wanted rather than consider fees first .
" we 're encouraging students of all backgrounds to go to university , " she said .
' cutting edge ' courses newport is among the universities in wales which are flourishing .
latest figures show an increase of 11.5 % more people applying to study there than this time last year .
it is the third successive year that the institution has seen a significant rise in applications .
last year it had the largest increase in full-time undergraduate applications of any uk university , with a 38.5 % rise .
newport university said it was proving exceptional for a number of reasons , including the range of cutting-edge courses , such as creative sound and music and performing arts .

it is called money claim online , which started in 2002 and is an internet version of the small claims court .
the chances of success when using it seem high .
only 20 % of claims are defended , which means they end up being heard by a judge in a county court .
most of the rest are undefended - so the claimant gets a court order automatically in his favour - or the defendant admits he owes the money and offers to pay by instalments or in full .
a few claims collapse because the claimant just gives up , perhaps if the defendant appears to have disappeared or gone bust .
the system is run by a government department called hm courts services which administers the court system in england and wales .
the manager of money claim online , ken fraser , says : " it 's a success , it extends the service .
people are no longer tied to going along in their dinner hour to their local county court . "
the court service in northern ireland has recently started its own internet version of their small claims court .
but would-be litigants in scotland are out of luck .
there is no such online service there .
suing banks one reason for the rapid growth in the use of money claim online is that thousands of people have started suing their banks for levying unfair overdraft charges .
the consumer action group , which has been behind this campaign , claims that 45,000 people have registered with its own web site this year and that it knows of at least 750 claims which have been lodged with the county courts .
the cag 's founder , mark gander , believes a majority have probably been started using money claim online .
" it is very attractive because it may be daunting to even go into a court office which will usually be full of solicitors , " he says .
however he points out that where a claim is particularly complicated or detailed , there may not be enough space on the money claim website to fully describe it .
the online claim form has a limit of 24 lines and 1080 characters .
that is because the system is aimed at simple money claims .
if your claim will not fit , then you will have to lodge it at a county court with written documents instead .
how does it work ?
the online process is fairly straightforward .
click on the money claim online web site and follow the menu of instructions .
it should all take about 15 minutes .
you can sue for any amount below £ 100,000 but you must have an address in england or wales -lrb- or a service address here if you live abroad -rrb- and be online with an e-mail address .
likewise , the people you are suing must also live in england or wales .
once you have registered and written up your claim you submit it and pay a fee by credit or debit card .
at this stage you do not have to prove your claim with evidence , you just have to state it with concise details .
it is important to note that the online service will not tell you if you have a valid claim .
for that you will need to ask a solicitor or a citizens advice bureau .
but you must be telling the truth , otherwise you could be prosecuted for contempt of court .
a bulk processing centre in northampton then sends out the documentation to the defendants in the name of northampton county court , telling them you are demanding the money .
what happens next ?
the defendant has 14 days in which to respond to the documents once they are served , which is itself reckoned to be 5 days after they were posted .
the cag has been encouraging people to use money claim online if he simply ignores the claim then you can use the online system to request judgement by default and even ask the court to enforce your claim immediately by sending round the bailiffs .
alternative responses from the defendant are paying in full admitting he owes all the money but fails to offer payment asks for time to pay admits he owes some money but not all of it or denies the claim altogether , perhaps lodging a counter-claim .
in some of these cases the online system effectively comes to a halt and you will then have to write back to northampton , using some forms , asking for the court to make a decision .
that might be to decide on an offer of delayed or staged payments with which you are unhappy .
and if you are met with a full defence of your claim , or do not want to accept a partial offer , then it will be transferred to a county court for a conventional hearing before a judge .
if you are suing a person , that will be at his or her county court ; if you are suing a business , it will be heard at your local county court .
self-employed getting money they are owed is a regular bugbear for self-employed workers who rely on the honesty and efficiency of their clients to be paid quickly .
i would encourage it for people who feel confident to do it .
but not everyone is .
many want assistance at each stage of the process john toner , national union of journalists the national union of journalists -lrb- nuj -rrb- takes a keen interest in the matter as thousands of its members are freelance .
john toner , the union 's freelance organiser , deals with hundreds of complaints from members every year , worried that they are not going to be paid by publications which have commissioned their work .
he welcomes the online service but says it does not suit everyone .
" i would encourage it for people who feel confident to do it .
but not everyone is .
many want assistance at each stage of the process . "
and he warns that if a case is contested and ends up in a court hearing , claimants should be thoroughly prepared .
" the small claims courts are more simple than people imagine and are designed to be free of solicitors , " he says .
" they are more informal but you still have to prove your case to the satisfaction of the judge and to the same standard as other courts .
it comes down to hard evidence . "

it is called money claim online , which started in 2002 and is an internet version of the small claims court .
the chances of success when using it seem high .
only 20 % of claims are defended , which means they end up being heard by a judge in a county court .
most of the rest are undefended - so the claimant gets a court order automatically in his favour - or the defendant admits he owes the money and offers to pay by instalments or in full .
a few claims collapse because the claimant just gives up , perhaps if the defendant appears to have disappeared or gone bust .
the system is run by a government department called hm courts services which administers the court system in england and wales .
the manager of money claim online , ken fraser , says : " it 's a success , it extends the service .
people are no longer tied to going along in their dinner hour to their local county court . "
the court service in northern ireland has recently started its own internet version of their small claims court .
but would-be litigants in scotland are out of luck .
there is no such online service there .
suing banks one reason for the rapid growth in the use of money claim online is that thousands of people have started suing their banks for levying unfair overdraft charges .
the consumer action group , which has been behind this campaign , claims that 45,000 people have registered with its own web site this year and that it knows of at least 750 claims which have been lodged with the county courts .
the cag 's founder , mark gander , believes a majority have probably been started using money claim online .
" it is very attractive because it may be daunting to even go into a court office which will usually be full of solicitors , " he says .
however he points out that where a claim is particularly complicated or detailed , there may not be enough space on the money claim website to fully describe it .
the online claim form has a limit of 24 lines and 1080 characters .
that is because the system is aimed at simple money claims .
if your claim will not fit , then you will have to lodge it at a county court with written documents instead .
how does it work ?
the online process is fairly straightforward .
click on the money claim online web site and follow the menu of instructions .
it should all take about 15 minutes .
you can sue for any amount below £ 100,000 but you must have an address in england or wales -lrb- or a service address here if you live abroad -rrb- and be online with an e-mail address .
likewise , the people you are suing must also live in england or wales .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- sue for money using the internet bbc news / business graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- business contents : your money -pipe- economy companies thursday , 20 july 2006 , 06:30 gmt 07:30 uk sue for money using the internet by ian pollock personal finance reporter , bbc news about 100,000 people this year are likely to take advantage of an online government service to sue those who owe them money .
it is called money claim online , which started in 2002 and is an internet version of the small claims court .
the chances of success when using it seem high .
only 20 % of claims are defended , which means they end up being heard by a judge in a county court .
most of the rest are undefended - so the claimant gets a court order automatically in his favour - or the defendant admits he owes the money and offers to pay by instalments or in full .
a few claims collapse because the claimant just gives up , perhaps if the defendant appears to have disappeared or gone bust .
the system is run by a government department called hm courts services which administers the court system in england and wales .
the manager of money claim online , ken fraser , says : " it 's a success , it extends the service .
people are no longer tied to going along in their dinner hour to their local county court . "
the court service in northern ireland has recently started its own internet version of their small claims court .
but would-be litigants in scotland are out of luck .
there is no such online service there .
suing banks one reason for the rapid growth in the use of money claim online is that thousands of people have started suing their banks for levying unfair overdraft charges .
the consumer action group , which has been behind this campaign , claims that 45,000 people have registered with its own web site this year and that it knows of at least 750 claims which have been lodged with the county courts .
the cag 's founder , mark gander , believes a majority have probably been started using money claim online .
" it is very attractive because it may be daunting to even go into a court office which will usually be full of solicitors , " he says .
however he points out that where a claim is particularly complicated or detailed , there may not be enough space on the money claim website to fully describe it .
the online claim form has a limit of 24 lines and 1080 characters .
that is because the system is aimed at simple money claims .
if your claim will not fit , then you will have to lodge it at a county court with written documents instead .
how does it work ?
the online process is fairly straightforward .
click on the money claim online web site and follow the menu of instructions .
it should all take about 15 minutes .
you can sue for any amount below £ 100,000 but you must have an address in england or wales -lrb- or a service address here if you live abroad -rrb- and be online with an e-mail address .
likewise , the people you are suing must also live in england or wales .
once you have registered and written up your claim you submit it and pay a fee by credit or debit card .
at this stage you do not have to prove your claim with evidence , you just have to state it with concise details .
it is important to note that the online service will not tell you if you have a valid claim .
for that you will need to ask a solicitor or a citizens advice bureau .
but you must be telling the truth , otherwise you could be prosecuted for contempt of court .
a bulk processing centre in northampton then sends out the documentation to the defendants in the name of northampton county court , telling them you are demanding the money .
what happens next ?
the defendant has 14 days in which to respond to the documents once they are served , which is itself reckoned to be 5 days after they were posted .
if he simply ignores the claim then you can use the online system to request judgement by default and even ask the court to enforce your claim immediately by sending round the bailiffs .
alternative responses from the defendant are paying in full admitting he owes all the money but fails to offer payment asks for time to pay admits he owes some money but not all of it or denies the claim altogether , perhaps lodging a counter-claim .
in some of these cases the online system effectively comes to a halt and you will then have to write back to northampton , using some forms , asking for the court to make a decision .
that might be to decide on an offer of delayed or staged payments with which you are unhappy .
and if you are met with a full defence of your claim , or do not want to accept a partial offer , then it will be transferred to a county court for a conventional hearing before a judge .
if you are suing a person , that will be at his or her county court ; if you are suing a business , it will be heard at your local county court .

prison governors say they are reluctant to use the tagging scheme because of repercussions if prisoners re-offend .
the number of prisoners tagged at any one time has fallen by a thousand in two years , and is down by 500 in the past six months .
the home office said possibly fewer inmates were eligible for tagging .
this is in spite of the fact the jail population is at record levels .
the home detention curfew scheme aims to relieve overcrowding by freeing non-violent prisoners up to four-and-a-half months before the end of their release date .
ministers are planning to provide 8,000 new prison cells to ease overcrowding , but many of them are unlikely to be ready for at least five years .
the home office is expected to confirm on thursday that more prisons will be built to cope with the increasing numbers of inmates .

the operation was resumed at first light on thursday when it was discovered that overnight rain had helped to quell the blaze .

james morrison is part of the new breed of singer-songwriters the fresh-faced british artist has already gained heavy airplay , and his debut album , undiscovered , has been number one on both the amazon pre-release chart and itunes album chart .
the 21-year-old 's gravelly voice lends him a sense of gritty experience , and he says he has already come through more than his share of life 's troubles .
and that is not just down to a cigarette habit .
" i do smoke , which does n't help , " he says .
" but i always had a husky voice when i was a kid . "
ironically , his distinctive singing voice may be the result of severe illness soon after birth in rugby , warwickshire .
i had a tough time but it 's positive - i know so much more because of it james morrison he contracted whooping cough and almost died because he was coughing so much .
" i went blue and stopped breathing and they had to resuscitate me four times , " he says .
given just a 30 % chance of survival , he has confounded doctors who said he would be severely brain damaged if he did pull through .
after that , the singer 's parents split up when he was four and he was unhappy at school , where he was teased for playing the guitar instead of football .
he did not gain confidence until moving to cornwall as a teenager , where he met people who were more enthusiastic about his music .
he is about to release his debut album undiscovered in the uk his big break came after being sacked from a van cleaning job in derby for crashing a couple of vehicles .
" i just thought it was a good way to learn to drive , " says the musician .
" but i made a wrong judgement and wrote off a new merc van and that was the end of that . "
the day after being fired , morrison met an old friend who invited him to record a couple of songs in his studio .
within a week , the resulting cd had found him a manager , and the singer-songwriter was invited to play for major labels one week later .
morrison says his troubled upbringing had a silver lining .
" the fact that it 's been bad is a positive , yeah definitely , " he says .
" i had a tough time but it 's positive .
i know so much more because of it and i 've been to that point where it 's so bad , it ca n't get any worse .
" everything after that is a bonus , so i 'm having the time of my life , " adds the singer .

the leicester-based company first sold its models in 1956 and said it was revamping its range for today 's market .
in recent years it has focused on the adult market , selling to collectors and model enthusiasts as many younger consumers turned to electronic games .
corgi said it now wanted to lure a younger generations of toy fans away from their games consoles .
while it may seem to be kids stuff , buying and selling corgi toys can be big business for many collectors .

attached to the virus is a poisoned presentation that , if opened , installs keylogging software on a computer .
users are being told to take care because it could be weeks before microsoft produces a patch that protects against the security loophole .
so far relatively few people are thought to have been caught out by the booby-trapped presentation .

security experts said the virus was aimed at companies in asia because chinese characters are used in the subject line of the e-mail the booby-trapped files are attached to and in name of the poisoned powerpoint presentation .
the presentation purports to be 18 humorous slides about love between men and women .
the powerpoint presentation is attached to an e-mail that arrives from a google gmail address .

it also opens up a backdoor into that machine that the creators of the virus are likely to exploit to gather the recorded keystrokes or to install other malicious programs .
the virus is known to be hitting windows users in asia once a machine has been compromised the virus installs a blank version of the poisoned presentation to hide evidence that a computer has been taken over .
in an advisory about the exploit microsoft said " limited " attacks were taking place using the bug and added : " in order for this attack to be carried out , a user must first open a malicious powerpoint document attached to an e-mail or otherwise provided to them by an attacker . "
the bug is known as a " zero-day " attack because it was exploited so soon after being discovered .
to protect themselves against hackers exploiting the bug , microsoft warned users not to open or save powerpoint files that turn up unexpectedly - even if they are from trusted sources .
powerpoint has become widely used in businesses for presentations .
the virus bearing the booby-trapped powerpoint files started circulating a day after microsoft issued a series of software patches as part of its regular security updates .
typically these updates are issued on the second tuesday of every month .
security firms said the timing was deliberate as it gave the virus the longest chance to rack up victims before microsoft gets round to closing the loophole .

that is the argument put forward by a group of eminent academics in this week 's edition of the journal nature .
they call for the establishment of an intergovernmental panel on biodiversity -lrb- ipb -rrb- to parallel the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
recent studies show continuing loss of biodiversity , with the hippo and polar bear just added to the danger list .
the 2006 red list of threatened species showed more than 16,000 plants and animals sliding towards their demise , including a third of amphibian species and a quarter of mammals .
" the international community is failing on its biodiversity targets , " said alfred oteng-yeboah from the council for scientific and industrial research -lrb- csir -rrb- , the ghanaian government 's science advisory body . "
it 'll need significant investment - we 're not sure exactly how much , but certainly more than anybody has given us " jeffrey mcneely , iucn species slide to extinction action needed on amphibians squeeze on earth 's species " and we see -lsb- the new body -rsb- as a process to actually move the actions forward , to ensure that people get engaged in all kinds of activity that will actually halt the loss of biodiversity , " he told the bbc news website from accra .
dr oteng-yeboah is one of the 19 signatories of the nature letter , who also include former ipcc head robert watson from the world bank , and the towering figure of peter raven , director of the missouri botanical garden .
slow progress the convention on biological diversity , spawned by the rio de janeiro earth summit in 1992 , commits governments to achieving at least a significant reduction in the rate of species and ecosystem loss by 2010 .
but year after year , with the publication of successive red lists and numerous other authoritative scientific reports , it becomes clear that progress is not fast enough to meet that goal .
equally clear is the knock-on impact on human livelihoods , particularly in developing nations .
as the nature letter puts it : " because biodiversity loss is essentially irreversible , it poses serious threats to sustainable development and the quality of life of future generations . "
the millennium ecosystem assessment , a vast four-year international research programme which began to report its findings last year , found that two-thirds of " ecosystem services " - the benefits which humans derive from the natural world - are being eroded .
even when these services could be protected , they often are not , sometimes because policymakers are not acting on the available science .
" one of the most dramatic examples is mangroves , " said jeffrey mcneely , chief scientist with the world conservation union -lrb- iucn -rrb- .
" scientists including economists have made it very clear that mangroves are incredibly valuable as mangroves , much more valuable than they are as shrimp farms , " he told the bbc news website .

human activities threaten 99 % of red list species habitat loss and degradation are the main threats , affecting more than 80 % of listed birds , mammals and amphibians climate change is increasingly recognised as a serious threat other issues relating to human activity include introduction of alien species , over-exploitation and pollution all involve a majority of the world 's governments , and iucn in particular is closely linked with conservation bodies in the academic and ngo spheres .

in the end , the success of any international attempt to stem biodiversity loss will have less to do with internal structures and acronyms than with the will of funding and regulating governments .
the parallel of climate change leads to thoughts of the kyoto protocol , which attempts , among other things , to sanction governments that miss targets on greenhouse gas emissions .

recent studies show continuing loss of biodiversity , with the hippo and polar bear just added to the danger list .

the millennium ecosystem assessment , a vast four-year international research programme which began to report its findings last year , found that two-thirds of " ecosystem services " - the benefits which humans derive from the natural world - are being eroded .

in 2004 , the city 's labour council became the first in england to offer free meals to all primary age children .
but the council , now lib dem run , says the £ 3m-a-year scheme is too expensive and wants to scrap it from may 2007 .
the decision angered mps , children 's charities and hull 's labour councillors who won a vote reaffirming support for the scheme at a meeting on thursday .
budget pressures deputy labour group leader darren hales said : " are they saying that money is more important than the health of children in this city ?
" there is the money in this city to fund this scheme .
it 's about funding our children 's health as well as funding other priorities . "
council leader carl minns said his administration was " totally committed " to providing healthy meals for pupils but budget pressures meant the scheme was " unaffordable " .
the child poverty action group wrote to all councillors in the city ahead of the vote to ask them not to pull the plug on the project before it is fully evaluated .
a parliamentary motion , tabled by hull north mp diana johnson and signed by 70 mps from all parties , has called for hull city council to reconsider its decision .
