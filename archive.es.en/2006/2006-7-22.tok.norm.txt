it said the disclosure threatens to anger arab governments and others because of the appearance that the us is actively aiding the israeli bombing campaign in a way that could be compared to iranian efforts to arm and resupply hezbollah . tehran denies that it arms hezbollah , saying it gives only moral support to the shiite movement . israel 's air war far from over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while a land offensive is prepared , bombs still rain down israel 's request for rush delivery of the satellite- and laser-guided bombs was described as unusual by some military officers , and an indication that israel still had a long list of targets to strike in lebanon , the paper said . israel said its aircraft had hit 150 targets inside lebanon in the 24 hours to saturday morning , including a dozen roads linking lebanon to neighboring syria as well as suspected hezbollah positions . lebanon has said its army is ready to go into battle if israel invades , which would sharply raise the stakes in a conflict that in just 10 days has killed close to 340 people , mostly civilians , in lebanon and displaced more than half a million . " the lebanese army will resist and defend the country and prove that it is an army worthy of respect , " said defense minister elias murr , whose forces have so far stood on the sidelines of the conflict . israel would invade " without a thought " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel prepares to take on hezbollah in lebanon israeli defense minister amir peretz had warned that israel would launch a full-scale ground invasion " without thinking twice " if necessary to crush hezbollah , which has long been a thorn in its side . but british foreign secretary margaret beckett , who has drawn arab criticism for failing to back un calls for a ceasefire , warned israel of the dangers of a full-scale invasion . she told the financial times the " very dangerous situation " could be at a turning point where " a miscalculation , a mistake could have dramatic effects and that i find deeply alarming . " but an israeli military spokesman said ground operations would be necessary to stop hezbollah rocket fire on israel , and that a major ground attack had not been ruled out . ground operations in lebanon were " indispensable because the air force can not always destroy underground bunkers dug by hezbollah , which has put in place an entire fortified network , " military spokesman captain yaacov dalal said . reservists called up ; tanks massing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redeployed troops arrive from the west bank and gaza some 3,000 reservists had already been called up to " clean up the border zone on the lebanese side by limited operations aiming to destroy hezbollah 's infrastructure , " he added . israeli police and army said " a number " of rockets landed in northern israel on saturday without causing casualties , despite a direct hit on a home in carmiel . the israeli military confirmed that ground forces had held positions in two villages in southern lebanon for several days but a un spokesman said it was " not a massive force " and that the israelis withdrew from one of the villages just before midday .

austria already has a successful wage subsidy program in place .
can it work in germany too ? a blend of dark and light wood , modern simplicity combined with high ornate ceilings - michl 's restaurant in downtown vienna is a chic location for any business lunch or evening out . eierschwammerl , wiener kartoffelsuppe and rindsbraten are just a few of the local specialties on offer at the one-year-old café .
but michl 's , named for vienna 's mayor michael häupl , is not just another eatery . as part of a new social gastronomy project , all of michl 's 35 employees have something in common : they were unemployed for a long time before joining the staff . " i was unemployed for a few years , and then i was afraid that i would n't be able to get back in to the whole thing , but i was surprised how quickly things worked out , " said a 53-year-old michl 's employee called fritz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a combined wage subsidy encourages the unemployed to accept a lower paying job already seeing progress he has good reason to be in high spirits .
within only a year of operation , 10 formerly unemployed michl 's employees have succeeded in finding positions on the open market . " i 've finally sent a few job applications , some companies have n't responded yet and i 've gotten a couple of rejections , " continued fritz , " but i know that something will work out . " the austrian government has recently gotten involved on the fringes of the job market .
for instance , limited subsidies are being offered to employers that hire older , handicapped - or long-term unemployed workers , like those at michl 's . statistics show that the initiatives seem to be working .
in comparison to last year , the number of long-term unemployed has dropped by 30 percent .
only some 8,000 people in austria have been looking for a job for more than one year . unemployment in austria , which eurostat gave as 4.9 percent for may 2006 , is significantly lower than in germany -lrb- 8.3 percent in may 2006 -rrb- . similarities to german proposals germany has a much greater problem to tackle , as far as unemployment is concerned , but , recently , a similar solution has been proposed . germany 's secretary of labor franz müntefering presented this week to parliament a combined wage proposal for job seekers over the age of 50 .
age can be a disadvantage in the job market , particularly for those looking for a way back into it . the new 50 plus initiative , meant to take effect on january 1 , 2007 , is designed to ease this transition back to the work force by encouraging older job seekers to accept lower paying positions .
those who qualify would receive 50 percent of the difference between their last paycheck and their new one for the first year , 30 percent of the difference in the second year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz münterfering -lrb- spd -rrb- has some convincing to do to push through the 50 plus initiative employer benefits encourage companies to hire 50-plus job seekers who 've been on welfare .
the labor secretary is confident that the employment subsidy initiative will create 100,000 new jobs . austria 's wage subsidies are not age-based .
one of the chefs at michl 's , for instance , is in his mid-20s and even completed an apprenticeship before enduring a three-year period of unemployment . possible extension of 50 plus to under 25 münterfering said this week in an interview with " handelsblatt " that he hopes to discuss a similar subsidy project for the unemployed and underemployed under the age of 25 . before that , he 'll have to convince critics - both within in own social democratic party and among the opposition - that the current 50-plus initiative will work .
it 's been labeled uncreative by the harsher critics . demographic differences prevent a one-to-one exchange between germany and austria .
nevertheless , perhaps germany can take a look at the recent success of its smaller eastern neighbor and gather a few tips . gerwald herter / dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de workers over 40 : " diamonds in the rough " in spite of high unemployment in germany , a cologne-based company is trying to help place the unemployed over 40 , arguing that their age gives them an advantage in knowledge and experience .

but researchers in aachen have now found an alternative use that will benefit the art world . jürgen kolz stares at his screen .
the engineer at the technical university in aachen is examining a fresco that has been sent in by new york 's metropolitan museum of modern art .
in front of him sits the world 's smallest , mobile magnetic resonance tomograph -lrb- mrt -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mrt is not much bigger than a laser printer it 's about as big as a conventional laser printer .
a sensor that 's not thicker than a finger moves towards the fresco and stops just milimeters in front of the fresco .
now the real work can begin . " we 're choosing a certain point in the fresco that we want to examine and measure the specimen in various depths , " kolz says .
" the signal then gives us information about the kind of colors that were used , the thickness of the different layers and the stage of the ageing process . " no more damage to art art experts and restorers find this information immensely valuable .
the big advantage of this kind of test is that a fresco does not have to be damaged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art experts will no longer have to remove probes and examine them under a microscope so far , microscopically small probes had to be removed to examine them - a process that does n't make art lovers happy .
the mrt in aachen does away with this .
while large museums already use scanning methods , kolz says that his method is superior as it can determine the age of the colors as well . the ability to determine the age of paint layers is a valuable tool for museums .
bernhard blümich , who heads the teams of researchers in aachen , soon realized that the method could also be used to distinguish between originals and forgeries . recreati n g lost pai n ti n gs but the new technique 's advantages go beyond catching forgers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's researchers could find out if something 's hidden behind her smile " we can examine the various layers of a painting or fresco , " said federico casanova , a member of the team of researchers .
" that way we can see if there are other paintings below the surface . " in the future , the researchers will be able to reconstruct these submerged paintings by " rebuilding " them on a computer and creating a perfect copy .
the art world has already expressed interest .
aachen researchers have already scanned several frescoes and paintings in the italian town of perugia .
they will also travel to london at the end of the month to convince art experts at the national gallery that they should employ their method as well . ingo wagner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's cultural legacy on ice how much damage a fire at weimar 's anna amalia library did to germany 's cultural legacy will only be clear after a team of bookbinders in leipzig get done with their work - and that could take years . -lrb- sept .

a sensor that 's not thicker than a finger moves towards the fresco and stops just milimeters in front of the fresco .
now the real work can begin . " we 're choosing a certain point in the fresco that we want to examine and measure the specimen in various depths , " kolz says .
" the signal then gives us information about the kind of colors that were used , the thickness of the different layers and the stage of the ageing process . " no more damage to art art experts and restorers find this information immensely valuable .
the big advantage of this kind of test is that a fresco does not have to be damaged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art experts will no longer have to remove probes and examine them under a microscope so far , microscopically small probes had to be removed to examine them - a process that does n't make art lovers happy .
the mrt in aachen does away with this .
while large museums already use scanning methods , kolz says that his method is superior as it can determine the age of the colors as well . the ability to determine the age of paint layers is a valuable tool for museums .
bernhard blümich , who heads the teams of researchers in aachen , soon realized that the method could also be used to distinguish between originals and forgeries . recreati n g lost pai n ti n gs but the new technique 's advantages go beyond catching forgers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's researchers could find out if something 's hidden behind her smile " we can examine the various layers of a painting or fresco , " said federico casanova , a member of the team of researchers .
" that way we can see if there are other paintings below the surface . " in the future , the researchers will be able to reconstruct these submerged paintings by " rebuilding " them on a computer and creating a perfect copy .
the art world has already expressed interest .
aachen researchers have already scanned several frescoes and paintings in the italian town of perugia .
they will also travel to london at the end of the month to convince art experts at the national gallery that they should employ their method as well . ingo wagner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's cultural legacy on ice how much damage a fire at weimar 's anna amalia library did to germany 's cultural legacy will only be clear after a team of bookbinders in leipzig get done with their work - and that could take years . -lrb- sept .

mastella should then in turn send it to his us counterpart . there was no comment from the milan court . the case threatens to further sour relations between italy and the united states after the decision by romano prodi 's left-wing government to withdraw italy 's troops from iraq . milan 's public prosecutor had already issued extradition requests for 22 of the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- agents , but they were blocked by the justice ministry of former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , a close ally of us president george w. bush . in february 2003 , the former imam , or prayer leader , osama mustafa hassan , an egyptian also known as abu omar and a terror suspect , was abducted in milan by cia agents and taken to egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu omar was allegedly kidnapped in milan by cia agents omar , who was living in asylum in italy at the time , was allegedly taken to a nearby us air base for interrogation and later transferred via germany to egypt , where he is still in prison . he claims to have been tortured in egypt . under italian law such abduction is illegal and anyone involved could face a jail sentence . scandal involves italian agents the case has rocked the italian military intelligence service -lrb- sismi -rrb- , which denied knowledge of the abduction .
an investigation has revealed that at least some members of sismi took part in the operation . the deputy head of sismi , marco mancini , and his predecessor gustavo pignero have been arrested and last week the intelligence chief general nicolo pollari was questioned by investigating magistrates in milan . la repubblica published extracts of a conversation that mancini recorded with pignero when he came under the judicial spotlight . " do you remember gustavo , do you remember that the abduction order came from the director ? "
mancini asks pignero who replies " yes " . " and do you remember that two days later i said that we could n't do that because we 're not in latin america ? "
mancini questions , to which pignero replies " yes , i remember .

mastella should then in turn send it to his us counterpart . there was no comment from the milan court . the case threatens to further sour relations between italy and the united states after the decision by romano prodi 's left-wing government to withdraw italy 's troops from iraq . milan 's public prosecutor had already issued extradition requests for 22 of the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- agents , but they were blocked by the justice ministry of former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , a close ally of us president george w. bush . in february 2003 , the former imam , or prayer leader , osama mustafa hassan , an egyptian also known as abu omar and a terror suspect , was abducted in milan by cia agents and taken to egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu omar was allegedly kidnapped in milan by cia agents omar , who was living in asylum in italy at the time , was allegedly taken to a nearby us air base for interrogation and later transferred via germany to egypt , where he is still in prison . he claims to have been tortured in egypt . under italian law such abduction is illegal and anyone involved could face a jail sentence . scandal involves italian agents the case has rocked the italian military intelligence service -lrb- sismi -rrb- , which denied knowledge of the abduction .
an investigation has revealed that at least some members of sismi took part in the operation . the deputy head of sismi , marco mancini , and his predecessor gustavo pignero have been arrested and last week the intelligence chief general nicolo pollari was questioned by investigating magistrates in milan . la repubblica published extracts of a conversation that mancini recorded with pignero when he came under the judicial spotlight . " do you remember gustavo , do you remember that the abduction order came from the director ? "
mancini asks pignero who replies " yes " . " and do you remember that two days later i said that we could n't do that because we 're not in latin america ? "
mancini questions , to which pignero replies " yes , i remember . " state secret law to be lifted pollari has repeatedly denied any knowledge of the abduction and he said he could not reveal state secrets during his questioning last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : d 'alema said he would open state secrets in the new probe foreign minister massimo d 'alema has stressed that the government would do everything possible to help the investigation without harming the fight against terrorism .

mastella should then in turn send it to his us counterpart . there was no comment from the milan court . the case threatens to further sour relations between italy and the united states after the decision by romano prodi 's left-wing government to withdraw italy 's troops from iraq . milan 's public prosecutor had already issued extradition requests for 22 of the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- agents , but they were blocked by the justice ministry of former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , a close ally of us president george w. bush . in february 2003 , the former imam , or prayer leader , osama mustafa hassan , an egyptian also known as abu omar and a terror suspect , was abducted in milan by cia agents and taken to egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu omar was allegedly kidnapped in milan by cia agents omar , who was living in asylum in italy at the time , was allegedly taken to a nearby us air base for interrogation and later transferred via germany to egypt , where he is still in prison . he claims to have been tortured in egypt . under italian law such abduction is illegal and anyone involved could face a jail sentence . scandal involves italian agents the case has rocked the italian military intelligence service -lrb- sismi -rrb- , which denied knowledge of the abduction .
an investigation has revealed that at least some members of sismi took part in the operation . the deputy head of sismi , marco mancini , and his predecessor gustavo pignero have been arrested and last week the intelligence chief general nicolo pollari was questioned by investigating magistrates in milan . la repubblica published extracts of a conversation that mancini recorded with pignero when he came under the judicial spotlight . " do you remember gustavo , do you remember that the abduction order came from the director ? "
mancini asks pignero who replies " yes " . " and do you remember that two days later i said that we could n't do that because we 're not in latin america ? "
mancini questions , to which pignero replies " yes , i remember . " state secret law to be lifted pollari has repeatedly denied any knowledge of the abduction and he said he could not reveal state secrets during his questioning last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : d 'alema said he would open state secrets in the new probe foreign minister massimo d 'alema has stressed that the government would do everything possible to help the investigation without harming the fight against terrorism .
he also said that he would lift the obligation to respect state secrets . in another twist in the long-running cia scandal in europe , a spanish judge on thursday accepted to head another inquiry into " extraordinary rendition " flights through spain . judge ismael moreno , of spain 's highest criminal court , agreed to lead the additional probe after the court requested on july 10 that more light be shed on the case . german national to give evidence in spain the court has called for people transported on the flights to be interviewed for the complementary investigation , notably german national khaled al-masri . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masri was transported through spain by the cia al-masri was seized by the cia in macedonia at the end of 2003 and mistakenly held as a terror suspect under grueling conditions in a jail in afghanistan for five months . the court has also demanded details on the personnel aboard the flights and background on flights at eight spanish airports , including those of madrid and barcelona . moreno is already investigating 10 cia flights that passed through the balearic islands between january 2004 and january 2005 . spain has " categorically " rejected allegations in a report by the council of europe that it was one of 14 european countries which colluded in or tolerated the secret transfer of terrorist suspects by the united states . council of europe on cia case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty 's investigation reveals " a spider 's web " drawn up by swiss parliamentarian dick marty , the report identified a " spider 's web " of landing points around the world used by the us authorities for the practice of " extraordinary rendition " - the undercover transfer of security suspects to third countries or us-run detention centers . eu rapporteur giovanni claudio fava alleged in a separate report released last month that the balearic islands in the mediterranean were " an important transit base . " fava said that out of 1,080 european movements of planes allegedly chartered by the cia between 2001 and the end of 2005 , 125 went through 10 spanish airports , mainly majorca and tenerife in the canary islands , although the spanish government had only recognized 27 of them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german testifies in probe into alleged cia abduction a parliamentary probe hears testimony from a german citizen , khaled al-masri , who alleged he was kidnapped by the cia and held for five months in an afghan jail .

she deserves respect and could soon find top-level sympathizers , says dw 's peter stützle . he was ashamed of belonging to a government that did nothing while civilians were suffering .
the man who felt this way was christian schwarz-schilling , germany 's minister for postal services , and he was talking about the suffering in bosnia herzegovina.then chancellor helmut kohl accepted the resignation of his minister , who went on to play a crucial role in stabilizing the war-torn country - until this day . just like the balkan war did at the time , the current middle east conflict unsettles the german public today .
just like then , a lone member of the federal government has put her finger where it hurts .
helmut kohl must have seen schwarz-schilling 's moral position as non-political .
after all , the german government had to consider the different interests and assessments of its allies .
current chancellor angela merkel has to do the same . pai n ful compromise the g8 declaration in st. petersburg from last weekend is a compromise that was painful to reach .
it calls for the release of the kidnapped israeli soldiers and an end to the bombardment of israel , followed by an end of israel 's military operations .
that 's what the chancellor is sticking to . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul on the other hand views the israeli reaction to hezbollah 's attacks as completely inappropriate - and demands an immediate end to the bombings .
she knows from opinion polls that at least three quarters of the german population agree with her .
the three opposition parties - the free-market liberal fdp , the greens and the left party - have also criticized the israeli action , albeit in different ways . growi n g support even within the governing coalition , things are beginning to brew .
wieczorek-zeul , a member of the social democratic party 's left wing , can rest assured that many of her party colleagues stand behind her .
even her predecessor , carl-dieter spranger from bavaria 's ultra-conservative christian social union , who co-signed wieczorek-zeul 's letter calling for an immediate ceasefire , is unlikely to be isolated within his party . it should be noted that it 's the minister for economic development and her predecessor , who published this appeal .
her ministry is responsible for far-reaching development aid projects in the entire middle east - especially in the palestinian territories .
if much of this will now be ruthlessly destroyed , it will provoke great resentment among german voters .
it will be hard to convince them to use their taxes to rebuild everything later on .
political capital is also destroyed this way . angela merkel is not unaware of this .
that 's why she has not distanced herself from her minister , just like wieczorek-zeul supports the g8 declaration .
should lebanese civilians continue to suffer , the chancellor is likely to move closer to wieczorek-zeul 's point of view .
unlike in the case of schwarz-schilling , the resignation of a minister is unlikely to happen . peter stützle -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe looks to mediate in raging middle east conflict along with other european nations , germany is attempting to de-escalate the raging middle east conflict amid fears the crisis could explode into a regional war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.07.2006 austria reaps success in wage subsidy program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michl ’ s café in vienna - a culinary experience with social benefits this week germany 's labor secretary franz müntefering introduced a wage subsidy proposal for job seekers over 50 .
austria already has a successful wage subsidy program in place .
can it work in germany too ? a blend of dark and light wood , modern simplicity combined with high ornate ceilings - michl 's restaurant in downtown vienna is a chic location for any business lunch or evening out . eierschwammerl , wiener kartoffelsuppe and rindsbraten are just a few of the local specialties on offer at the one-year-old café .
but michl 's , named for vienna 's mayor michael häupl , is not just another eatery . as part of a new social gastronomy project , all of michl 's 35 employees have something in common : they were unemployed for a long time before joining the staff . " i was unemployed for a few years , and then i was afraid that i would n't be able to get back in to the whole thing , but i was surprised how quickly things worked out , " said a 53-year-old michl 's employee called fritz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a combined wage subsidy encourages the unemployed to accept a lower paying job already seeing progress he has good reason to be in high spirits .
within only a year of operation , 10 formerly unemployed michl 's employees have succeeded in finding positions on the open market . " i 've finally sent a few job applications , some companies have n't responded yet and i 've gotten a couple of rejections , " continued fritz , " but i know that something will work out . " the austrian government has recently gotten involved on the fringes of the job market .
for instance , limited subsidies are being offered to employers that hire older , handicapped - or long-term unemployed workers , like those at michl 's . statistics show that the initiatives seem to be working .
in comparison to last year , the number of long-term unemployed has dropped by 30 percent .
only some 8,000 people in austria have been looking for a job for more than one year . unemployment in austria , which eurostat gave as 4.9 percent for may 2006 , is significantly lower than in germany -lrb- 8.3 percent in may 2006 -rrb- . similarities to german proposals germany has a much greater problem to tackle , as far as unemployment is concerned , but , recently , a similar solution has been proposed . germany 's secretary of labor franz müntefering presented this week to parliament a combined wage proposal for job seekers over the age of 50 .
age can be a disadvantage in the job market , particularly for those looking for a way back into it . the new 50 plus initiative , meant to take effect on january 1 , 2007 , is designed to ease this transition back to the work force by encouraging older job seekers to accept lower paying positions .
those who qualify would receive 50 percent of the difference between their last paycheck and their new one for the first year , 30 percent of the difference in the second year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz münterfering -lrb- spd -rrb- has some convincing to do to push through the 50 plus initiative employer benefits encourage companies to hire 50-plus job seekers who 've been on welfare .
the labor secretary is confident that the employment subsidy initiative will create 100,000 new jobs . austria 's wage subsidies are not age-based .
one of the chefs at michl 's , for instance , is in his mid-20s and even completed an apprenticeship before enduring a three-year period of unemployment . possible extension of 50 plus to under 25 münterfering said this week in an interview with " handelsblatt " that he hopes to discuss a similar subsidy project for the unemployed and underemployed under the age of 25 . before that , he 'll have to convince critics - both within in own social democratic party and among the opposition - that the current 50-plus initiative will work .
it 's been labeled uncreative by the harsher critics . demographic differences prevent a one-to-one exchange between germany and austria .
nevertheless , perhaps germany can take a look at the recent success of its smaller eastern neighbor and gather a few tips . gerwald herter / dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de workers over 40 : " diamonds in the rough " in spite of high unemployment in germany , a cologne-based company is trying to help place the unemployed over 40 , arguing that their age gives them an advantage in knowledge and experience .

austria already has a successful wage subsidy program in place .
can it work in germany too ? a blend of dark and light wood , modern simplicity combined with high ornate ceilings - michl 's restaurant in downtown vienna is a chic location for any business lunch or evening out . eierschwammerl , wiener kartoffelsuppe and rindsbraten are just a few of the local specialties on offer at the one-year-old café .
but michl 's , named for vienna 's mayor michael häupl , is not just another eatery . as part of a new social gastronomy project , all of michl 's 35 employees have something in common : they were unemployed for a long time before joining the staff . " i was unemployed for a few years , and then i was afraid that i would n't be able to get back in to the whole thing , but i was surprised how quickly things worked out , " said a 53-year-old michl 's employee called fritz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a combined wage subsidy encourages the unemployed to accept a lower paying job already seeing progress he has good reason to be in high spirits .
within only a year of operation , 10 formerly unemployed michl 's employees have succeeded in finding positions on the open market . " i 've finally sent a few job applications , some companies have n't responded yet and i 've gotten a couple of rejections , " continued fritz , " but i know that something will work out . " the austrian government has recently gotten involved on the fringes of the job market .
for instance , limited subsidies are being offered to employers that hire older , handicapped - or long-term unemployed workers , like those at michl 's . statistics show that the initiatives seem to be working .
in comparison to last year , the number of long-term unemployed has dropped by 30 percent .
only some 8,000 people in austria have been looking for a job for more than one year . unemployment in austria , which eurostat gave as 4.9 percent for may 2006 , is significantly lower than in germany -lrb- 8.3 percent in may 2006 -rrb- . similarities to german proposals germany has a much greater problem to tackle , as far as unemployment is concerned , but , recently , a similar solution has been proposed . germany 's secretary of labor franz müntefering presented this week to parliament a combined wage proposal for job seekers over the age of 50 .
age can be a disadvantage in the job market , particularly for those looking for a way back into it . the new 50 plus initiative , meant to take effect on january 1 , 2007 , is designed to ease this transition back to the work force by encouraging older job seekers to accept lower paying positions .
those who qualify would receive 50 percent of the difference between their last paycheck and their new one for the first year , 30 percent of the difference in the second year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz münterfering -lrb- spd -rrb- has some convincing to do to push through the 50 plus initiative employer benefits encourage companies to hire 50-plus job seekers who 've been on welfare .
the labor secretary is confident that the employment subsidy initiative will create 100,000 new jobs . austria 's wage subsidies are not age-based .
one of the chefs at michl 's , for instance , is in his mid-20s and even completed an apprenticeship before enduring a three-year period of unemployment . possible extension of 50 plus to under 25 münterfering said this week in an interview with " handelsblatt " that he hopes to discuss a similar subsidy project for the unemployed and underemployed under the age of 25 . before that , he 'll have to convince critics - both within in own social democratic party and among the opposition - that the current 50-plus initiative will work .
it 's been labeled uncreative by the harsher critics . demographic differences prevent a one-to-one exchange between germany and austria .
nevertheless , perhaps germany can take a look at the recent success of its smaller eastern neighbor and gather a few tips . gerwald herter / dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de workers over 40 : " diamonds in the rough " in spite of high unemployment in germany , a cologne-based company is trying to help place the unemployed over 40 , arguing that their age gives them an advantage in knowledge and experience .
-lrb- july 8 , 2006 -rrb- german economy gathers steam , institutes revise forecast german economic performance is predicted to grow by 1.8 percent in 2006 , the highest rate in six years , the country 's six leading economic institutes said .
but a wave of new jobs is not expected to accompany the upsurge .
-lrb- may 1 , 2006 -rrb- a win-win situation for american investors in east germany a central location , government subsidies , financial security and low wages make former east germany attractive to american investors .
us companies are bringing funds and much needed jobs to the former communist region .

only some 8,000 people in austria have been looking for a job for more than one year . unemployment in austria , which eurostat gave as 4.9 percent for may 2006 , is significantly lower than in germany -lrb- 8.3 percent in may 2006 -rrb- . similarities to german proposals germany has a much greater problem to tackle , as far as unemployment is concerned , but , recently , a similar solution has been proposed . germany 's secretary of labor franz müntefering presented this week to parliament a combined wage proposal for job seekers over the age of 50 .
age can be a disadvantage in the job market , particularly for those looking for a way back into it . the new 50 plus initiative , meant to take effect on january 1 , 2007 , is designed to ease this transition back to the work force by encouraging older job seekers to accept lower paying positions .

the labor secretary is confident that the employment subsidy initiative will create 100,000 new jobs . austria 's wage subsidies are not age-based .
one of the chefs at michl 's , for instance , is in his mid-20s and even completed an apprenticeship before enduring a three-year period of unemployment . possible extension of 50 plus to under 25 münterfering said this week in an interview with " handelsblatt " that he hopes to discuss a similar subsidy project for the unemployed and underemployed under the age of 25 . before that , he 'll have to convince critics - both within in own social democratic party and among the opposition - that the current 50-plus initiative will work .

austria already has a successful wage subsidy program in place .
can it work in germany too ? a blend of dark and light wood , modern simplicity combined with high ornate ceilings - michl 's restaurant in downtown vienna is a chic location for any business lunch or evening out . eierschwammerl , wiener kartoffelsuppe and rindsbraten are just a few of the local specialties on offer at the one-year-old café .
but michl 's , named for vienna 's mayor michael häupl , is not just another eatery . as part of a new social gastronomy project , all of michl 's 35 employees have something in common : they were unemployed for a long time before joining the staff . " i was unemployed for a few years , and then i was afraid that i would n't be able to get back in to the whole thing , but i was surprised how quickly things worked out , " said a 53-year-old michl 's employee called fritz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a combined wage subsidy encourages the unemployed to accept a lower paying job already seeing progress he has good reason to be in high spirits .
within only a year of operation , 10 formerly unemployed michl 's employees have succeeded in finding positions on the open market . " i 've finally sent a few job applications , some companies have n't responded yet and i 've gotten a couple of rejections , " continued fritz , " but i know that something will work out . " the austrian government has recently gotten involved on the fringes of the job market .
for instance , limited subsidies are being offered to employers that hire older , handicapped - or long-term unemployed workers , like those at michl 's . statistics show that the initiatives seem to be working .
in comparison to last year , the number of long-term unemployed has dropped by 30 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 22.07.2006 new german scan prevents surgery on art großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michelangelo 's " the creation " is most certainly an original , but could still benefit magnetic resonance tomographs are usually found in hospitals , where they are used to scan the human body for abnormalities .
but researchers in aachen have now found an alternative use that will benefit the art world . jürgen kolz stares at his screen .
the engineer at the technical university in aachen is examining a fresco that has been sent in by new york 's metropolitan museum of modern art .
in front of him sits the world 's smallest , mobile magnetic resonance tomograph -lrb- mrt -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mrt is not much bigger than a laser printer it 's about as big as a conventional laser printer .
a sensor that 's not thicker than a finger moves towards the fresco and stops just milimeters in front of the fresco .
now the real work can begin . " we 're choosing a certain point in the fresco that we want to examine and measure the specimen in various depths , " kolz says .
" the signal then gives us information about the kind of colors that were used , the thickness of the different layers and the stage of the ageing process . " no more damage to art art experts and restorers find this information immensely valuable .
the big advantage of this kind of test is that a fresco does not have to be damaged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art experts will no longer have to remove probes and examine them under a microscope so far , microscopically small probes had to be removed to examine them - a process that does n't make art lovers happy .
the mrt in aachen does away with this .
while large museums already use scanning methods , kolz says that his method is superior as it can determine the age of the colors as well . the ability to determine the age of paint layers is a valuable tool for museums .
bernhard blümich , who heads the teams of researchers in aachen , soon realized that the method could also be used to distinguish between originals and forgeries . recreati n g lost pai n ti n gs but the new technique 's advantages go beyond catching forgers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's researchers could find out if something 's hidden behind her smile " we can examine the various layers of a painting or fresco , " said federico casanova , a member of the team of researchers .
" that way we can see if there are other paintings below the surface . " in the future , the researchers will be able to reconstruct these submerged paintings by " rebuilding " them on a computer and creating a perfect copy .
the art world has already expressed interest .
aachen researchers have already scanned several frescoes and paintings in the italian town of perugia .
they will also travel to london at the end of the month to convince art experts at the national gallery that they should employ their method as well . ingo wagner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's cultural legacy on ice how much damage a fire at weimar 's anna amalia library did to germany 's cultural legacy will only be clear after a team of bookbinders in leipzig get done with their work - and that could take years . -lrb- sept .

but researchers in aachen have now found an alternative use that will benefit the art world . jürgen kolz stares at his screen .
the engineer at the technical university in aachen is examining a fresco that has been sent in by new york 's metropolitan museum of modern art .
in front of him sits the world 's smallest , mobile magnetic resonance tomograph -lrb- mrt -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mrt is not much bigger than a laser printer it 's about as big as a conventional laser printer .
a sensor that 's not thicker than a finger moves towards the fresco and stops just milimeters in front of the fresco .
now the real work can begin . " we 're choosing a certain point in the fresco that we want to examine and measure the specimen in various depths , " kolz says .
" the signal then gives us information about the kind of colors that were used , the thickness of the different layers and the stage of the ageing process . " no more damage to art art experts and restorers find this information immensely valuable .
the big advantage of this kind of test is that a fresco does not have to be damaged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art experts will no longer have to remove probes and examine them under a microscope so far , microscopically small probes had to be removed to examine them - a process that does n't make art lovers happy .
the mrt in aachen does away with this .
while large museums already use scanning methods , kolz says that his method is superior as it can determine the age of the colors as well . the ability to determine the age of paint layers is a valuable tool for museums .
bernhard blümich , who heads the teams of researchers in aachen , soon realized that the method could also be used to distinguish between originals and forgeries . recreati n g lost pai n ti n gs but the new technique 's advantages go beyond catching forgers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's researchers could find out if something 's hidden behind her smile " we can examine the various layers of a painting or fresco , " said federico casanova , a member of the team of researchers .
" that way we can see if there are other paintings below the surface . " in the future , the researchers will be able to reconstruct these submerged paintings by " rebuilding " them on a computer and creating a perfect copy .
the art world has already expressed interest .
aachen researchers have already scanned several frescoes and paintings in the italian town of perugia .
they will also travel to london at the end of the month to convince art experts at the national gallery that they should employ their method as well . ingo wagner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's cultural legacy on ice how much damage a fire at weimar 's anna amalia library did to germany 's cultural legacy will only be clear after a team of bookbinders in leipzig get done with their work - and that could take years . -lrb- sept .
8 , 2004 -rrb- mending modern masters while restoring old frescoes and paintings has become routine work , " healing " more recent art objects made of plastics and other modern substances is more tricky .
germans are among the leaders in the field .

mastella should then in turn send it to his us counterpart . there was no comment from the milan court . the case threatens to further sour relations between italy and the united states after the decision by romano prodi 's left-wing government to withdraw italy 's troops from iraq . milan 's public prosecutor had already issued extradition requests for 22 of the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- agents , but they were blocked by the justice ministry of former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , a close ally of us president george w. bush . in february 2003 , the former imam , or prayer leader , osama mustafa hassan , an egyptian also known as abu omar and a terror suspect , was abducted in milan by cia agents and taken to egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu omar was allegedly kidnapped in milan by cia agents omar , who was living in asylum in italy at the time , was allegedly taken to a nearby us air base for interrogation and later transferred via germany to egypt , where he is still in prison . he claims to have been tortured in egypt . under italian law such abduction is illegal and anyone involved could face a jail sentence . scandal involves italian agents the case has rocked the italian military intelligence service -lrb- sismi -rrb- , which denied knowledge of the abduction .
an investigation has revealed that at least some members of sismi took part in the operation . the deputy head of sismi , marco mancini , and his predecessor gustavo pignero have been arrested and last week the intelligence chief general nicolo pollari was questioned by investigating magistrates in milan . la repubblica published extracts of a conversation that mancini recorded with pignero when he came under the judicial spotlight . " do you remember gustavo , do you remember that the abduction order came from the director ? "
mancini asks pignero who replies " yes " . " and do you remember that two days later i said that we could n't do that because we 're not in latin america ? "
mancini questions , to which pignero replies " yes , i remember . " state secret law to be lifted pollari has repeatedly denied any knowledge of the abduction and he said he could not reveal state secrets during his questioning last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : d 'alema said he would open state secrets in the new probe foreign minister massimo d 'alema has stressed that the government would do everything possible to help the investigation without harming the fight against terrorism .
he also said that he would lift the obligation to respect state secrets . in another twist in the long-running cia scandal in europe , a spanish judge on thursday accepted to head another inquiry into " extraordinary rendition " flights through spain . judge ismael moreno , of spain 's highest criminal court , agreed to lead the additional probe after the court requested on july 10 that more light be shed on the case . german national to give evidence in spain the court has called for people transported on the flights to be interviewed for the complementary investigation , notably german national khaled al-masri . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masri was transported through spain by the cia al-masri was seized by the cia in macedonia at the end of 2003 and mistakenly held as a terror suspect under grueling conditions in a jail in afghanistan for five months . the court has also demanded details on the personnel aboard the flights and background on flights at eight spanish airports , including those of madrid and barcelona . moreno is already investigating 10 cia flights that passed through the balearic islands between january 2004 and january 2005 . spain has " categorically " rejected allegations in a report by the council of europe that it was one of 14 european countries which colluded in or tolerated the secret transfer of terrorist suspects by the united states . council of europe on cia case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty 's investigation reveals " a spider 's web " drawn up by swiss parliamentarian dick marty , the report identified a " spider 's web " of landing points around the world used by the us authorities for the practice of " extraordinary rendition " - the undercover transfer of security suspects to third countries or us-run detention centers . eu rapporteur giovanni claudio fava alleged in a separate report released last month that the balearic islands in the mediterranean were " an important transit base . " fava said that out of 1,080 european movements of planes allegedly chartered by the cia between 2001 and the end of 2005 , 125 went through 10 spanish airports , mainly majorca and tenerife in the canary islands , although the spanish government had only recognized 27 of them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german testifies in probe into alleged cia abduction a parliamentary probe hears testimony from a german citizen , khaled al-masri , who alleged he was kidnapped by the cia and held for five months in an afghan jail .

" the lebanese army will resist and defend the country and prove that it is an army worthy of respect , " said defense minister elias murr , whose forces have so far stood on the sidelines of the conflict . israel would invade " without a thought " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel prepares to take on hezbollah in lebanon israeli defense minister amir peretz had warned that israel would launch a full-scale ground invasion " without thinking twice " if necessary to crush hezbollah , which has long been a thorn in its side . but british foreign secretary margaret beckett , who has drawn arab criticism for failing to back un calls for a ceasefire , warned israel of the dangers of a full-scale invasion . she told the financial times the " very dangerous situation " could be at a turning point where " a miscalculation , a mistake could have dramatic effects and that i find deeply alarming . " but an israeli military spokesman said ground operations would be necessary to stop hezbollah rocket fire on israel , and that a major ground attack had not been ruled out . ground operations in lebanon were " indispensable because the air force can not always destroy underground bunkers dug by hezbollah , which has put in place an entire fortified network , " military spokesman captain yaacov dalal said . reservists called up ; tanks massing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redeployed troops arrive from the west bank and gaza some 3,000 reservists had already been called up to " clean up the border zone on the lebanese side by limited operations aiming to destroy hezbollah 's infrastructure , " he added . israeli police and army said " a number " of rockets landed in northern israel on saturday without causing casualties , despite a direct hit on a home in carmiel . the israeli military confirmed that ground forces had held positions in two villages in southern lebanon for several days but a un spokesman said it was " not a massive force " and that the israelis withdrew from one of the villages just before midday .

but researchers in aachen have now found an alternative use that will benefit the art world . jürgen kolz stares at his screen .
the engineer at the technical university in aachen is examining a fresco that has been sent in by new york 's metropolitan museum of modern art .
in front of him sits the world 's smallest , mobile magnetic resonance tomograph -lrb- mrt -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mrt is not much bigger than a laser printer it 's about as big as a conventional laser printer .
a sensor that 's not thicker than a finger moves towards the fresco and stops just milimeters in front of the fresco .
now the real work can begin . " we 're choosing a certain point in the fresco that we want to examine and measure the specimen in various depths , " kolz says .
" the signal then gives us information about the kind of colors that were used , the thickness of the different layers and the stage of the ageing process . " no more damage to art art experts and restorers find this information immensely valuable .
the big advantage of this kind of test is that a fresco does not have to be damaged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art experts will no longer have to remove probes and examine them under a microscope so far , microscopically small probes had to be removed to examine them - a process that does n't make art lovers happy .
the mrt in aachen does away with this .
while large museums already use scanning methods , kolz says that his method is superior as it can determine the age of the colors as well . the ability to determine the age of paint layers is a valuable tool for museums .
bernhard blümich , who heads the teams of researchers in aachen , soon realized that the method could also be used to distinguish between originals and forgeries . recreati n g lost pai n ti n gs but the new technique 's advantages go beyond catching forgers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's researchers could find out if something 's hidden behind her smile " we can examine the various layers of a painting or fresco , " said federico casanova , a member of the team of researchers .
" that way we can see if there are other paintings below the surface . " in the future , the researchers will be able to reconstruct these submerged paintings by " rebuilding " them on a computer and creating a perfect copy .
the art world has already expressed interest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.07.2006 opinion : a german minister 's popular dissent on lebanon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul also served as development minister under the previous government germany 's minister responsible for development aid has been a lone voice calling for an immediate ceasefire in lebanon .
she deserves respect and could soon find top-level sympathizers , says dw 's peter stützle . he was ashamed of belonging to a government that did nothing while civilians were suffering .
the man who felt this way was christian schwarz-schilling , germany 's minister for postal services , and he was talking about the suffering in bosnia herzegovina.then chancellor helmut kohl accepted the resignation of his minister , who went on to play a crucial role in stabilizing the war-torn country - until this day . just like the balkan war did at the time , the current middle east conflict unsettles the german public today .
just like then , a lone member of the federal government has put her finger where it hurts .
helmut kohl must have seen schwarz-schilling 's moral position as non-political .
after all , the german government had to consider the different interests and assessments of its allies .
current chancellor angela merkel has to do the same . pai n ful compromise the g8 declaration in st. petersburg from last weekend is a compromise that was painful to reach .
it calls for the release of the kidnapped israeli soldiers and an end to the bombardment of israel , followed by an end of israel 's military operations .
that 's what the chancellor is sticking to . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul on the other hand views the israeli reaction to hezbollah 's attacks as completely inappropriate - and demands an immediate end to the bombings .
she knows from opinion polls that at least three quarters of the german population agree with her .
the three opposition parties - the free-market liberal fdp , the greens and the left party - have also criticized the israeli action , albeit in different ways . growi n g support even within the governing coalition , things are beginning to brew .
wieczorek-zeul , a member of the social democratic party 's left wing , can rest assured that many of her party colleagues stand behind her .
even her predecessor , carl-dieter spranger from bavaria 's ultra-conservative christian social union , who co-signed wieczorek-zeul 's letter calling for an immediate ceasefire , is unlikely to be isolated within his party . it should be noted that it 's the minister for economic development and her predecessor , who published this appeal .
her ministry is responsible for far-reaching development aid projects in the entire middle east - especially in the palestinian territories .
if much of this will now be ruthlessly destroyed , it will provoke great resentment among german voters .
it will be hard to convince them to use their taxes to rebuild everything later on .
political capital is also destroyed this way . angela merkel is not unaware of this .
that 's why she has not distanced herself from her minister , just like wieczorek-zeul supports the g8 declaration .
should lebanese civilians continue to suffer , the chancellor is likely to move closer to wieczorek-zeul 's point of view .
unlike in the case of schwarz-schilling , the resignation of a minister is unlikely to happen . peter stützle -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe looks to mediate in raging middle east conflict along with other european nations , germany is attempting to de-escalate the raging middle east conflict amid fears the crisis could explode into a regional war .

but researchers in aachen have now found an alternative use that will benefit the art world . jürgen kolz stares at his screen .
the engineer at the technical university in aachen is examining a fresco that has been sent in by new york 's metropolitan museum of modern art .
in front of him sits the world 's smallest , mobile magnetic resonance tomograph -lrb- mrt -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mrt is not much bigger than a laser printer it 's about as big as a conventional laser printer .
a sensor that 's not thicker than a finger moves towards the fresco and stops just milimeters in front of the fresco .
now the real work can begin . " we 're choosing a certain point in the fresco that we want to examine and measure the specimen in various depths , " kolz says .
" the signal then gives us information about the kind of colors that were used , the thickness of the different layers and the stage of the ageing process . " no more damage to art art experts and restorers find this information immensely valuable .
the big advantage of this kind of test is that a fresco does not have to be damaged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art experts will no longer have to remove probes and examine them under a microscope so far , microscopically small probes had to be removed to examine them - a process that does n't make art lovers happy .
the mrt in aachen does away with this .
while large museums already use scanning methods , kolz says that his method is superior as it can determine the age of the colors as well . the ability to determine the age of paint layers is a valuable tool for museums .
bernhard blümich , who heads the teams of researchers in aachen , soon realized that the method could also be used to distinguish between originals and forgeries . recreati n g lost pai n ti n gs but the new technique 's advantages go beyond catching forgers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's researchers could find out if something 's hidden behind her smile " we can examine the various layers of a painting or fresco , " said federico casanova , a member of the team of researchers .
" that way we can see if there are other paintings below the surface . " in the future , the researchers will be able to reconstruct these submerged paintings by " rebuilding " them on a computer and creating a perfect copy .
the art world has already expressed interest .
aachen researchers have already scanned several frescoes and paintings in the italian town of perugia .
they will also travel to london at the end of the month to convince art experts at the national gallery that they should employ their method as well . ingo wagner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's cultural legacy on ice how much damage a fire at weimar 's anna amalia library did to germany 's cultural legacy will only be clear after a team of bookbinders in leipzig get done with their work - and that could take years . -lrb- sept .

but researchers in aachen have now found an alternative use that will benefit the art world . jürgen kolz stares at his screen .
the engineer at the technical university in aachen is examining a fresco that has been sent in by new york 's metropolitan museum of modern art .
in front of him sits the world 's smallest , mobile magnetic resonance tomograph -lrb- mrt -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mrt is not much bigger than a laser printer it 's about as big as a conventional laser printer .
a sensor that 's not thicker than a finger moves towards the fresco and stops just milimeters in front of the fresco .
now the real work can begin . " we 're choosing a certain point in the fresco that we want to examine and measure the specimen in various depths , " kolz says .
" the signal then gives us information about the kind of colors that were used , the thickness of the different layers and the stage of the ageing process . " no more damage to art art experts and restorers find this information immensely valuable .
the big advantage of this kind of test is that a fresco does not have to be damaged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art experts will no longer have to remove probes and examine them under a microscope so far , microscopically small probes had to be removed to examine them - a process that does n't make art lovers happy .
the mrt in aachen does away with this .
while large museums already use scanning methods , kolz says that his method is superior as it can determine the age of the colors as well . the ability to determine the age of paint layers is a valuable tool for museums .
bernhard blümich , who heads the teams of researchers in aachen , soon realized that the method could also be used to distinguish between originals and forgeries . recreati n g lost pai n ti n gs but the new technique 's advantages go beyond catching forgers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's researchers could find out if something 's hidden behind her smile " we can examine the various layers of a painting or fresco , " said federico casanova , a member of the team of researchers .
" that way we can see if there are other paintings below the surface . " in the future , the researchers will be able to reconstruct these submerged paintings by " rebuilding " them on a computer and creating a perfect copy .
the art world has already expressed interest .
aachen researchers have already scanned several frescoes and paintings in the italian town of perugia .
they will also travel to london at the end of the month to convince art experts at the national gallery that they should employ their method as well . ingo wagner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's cultural legacy on ice how much damage a fire at weimar 's anna amalia library did to germany 's cultural legacy will only be clear after a team of bookbinders in leipzig get done with their work - and that could take years . -lrb- sept .

mastella should then in turn send it to his us counterpart . there was no comment from the milan court . the case threatens to further sour relations between italy and the united states after the decision by romano prodi 's left-wing government to withdraw italy 's troops from iraq . milan 's public prosecutor had already issued extradition requests for 22 of the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- agents , but they were blocked by the justice ministry of former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , a close ally of us president george w. bush . in february 2003 , the former imam , or prayer leader , osama mustafa hassan , an egyptian also known as abu omar and a terror suspect , was abducted in milan by cia agents and taken to egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu omar was allegedly kidnapped in milan by cia agents omar , who was living in asylum in italy at the time , was allegedly taken to a nearby us air base for interrogation and later transferred via germany to egypt , where he is still in prison . he claims to have been tortured in egypt . under italian law such abduction is illegal and anyone involved could face a jail sentence . scandal involves italian agents the case has rocked the italian military intelligence service -lrb- sismi -rrb- , which denied knowledge of the abduction .
an investigation has revealed that at least some members of sismi took part in the operation . the deputy head of sismi , marco mancini , and his predecessor gustavo pignero have been arrested and last week the intelligence chief general nicolo pollari was questioned by investigating magistrates in milan . la repubblica published extracts of a conversation that mancini recorded with pignero when he came under the judicial spotlight . " do you remember gustavo , do you remember that the abduction order came from the director ? "
mancini asks pignero who replies " yes " . " and do you remember that two days later i said that we could n't do that because we 're not in latin america ? "
mancini questions , to which pignero replies " yes , i remember . " state secret law to be lifted pollari has repeatedly denied any knowledge of the abduction and he said he could not reveal state secrets during his questioning last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : d 'alema said he would open state secrets in the new probe foreign minister massimo d 'alema has stressed that the government would do everything possible to help the investigation without harming the fight against terrorism .
he also said that he would lift the obligation to respect state secrets . in another twist in the long-running cia scandal in europe , a spanish judge on thursday accepted to head another inquiry into " extraordinary rendition " flights through spain . judge ismael moreno , of spain 's highest criminal court , agreed to lead the additional probe after the court requested on july 10 that more light be shed on the case . german national to give evidence in spain the court has called for people transported on the flights to be interviewed for the complementary investigation , notably german national khaled al-masri . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masri was transported through spain by the cia al-masri was seized by the cia in macedonia at the end of 2003 and mistakenly held as a terror suspect under grueling conditions in a jail in afghanistan for five months . the court has also demanded details on the personnel aboard the flights and background on flights at eight spanish airports , including those of madrid and barcelona . moreno is already investigating 10 cia flights that passed through the balearic islands between january 2004 and january 2005 . spain has " categorically " rejected allegations in a report by the council of europe that it was one of 14 european countries which colluded in or tolerated the secret transfer of terrorist suspects by the united states . council of europe on cia case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty 's investigation reveals " a spider 's web " drawn up by swiss parliamentarian dick marty , the report identified a " spider 's web " of landing points around the world used by the us authorities for the practice of " extraordinary rendition " - the undercover transfer of security suspects to third countries or us-run detention centers . eu rapporteur giovanni claudio fava alleged in a separate report released last month that the balearic islands in the mediterranean were " an important transit base . " fava said that out of 1,080 european movements of planes allegedly chartered by the cia between 2001 and the end of 2005 , 125 went through 10 spanish airports , mainly majorca and tenerife in the canary islands , although the spanish government had only recognized 27 of them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german testifies in probe into alleged cia abduction a parliamentary probe hears testimony from a german citizen , khaled al-masri , who alleged he was kidnapped by the cia and held for five months in an afghan jail .

mastella should then in turn send it to his us counterpart . there was no comment from the milan court . the case threatens to further sour relations between italy and the united states after the decision by romano prodi 's left-wing government to withdraw italy 's troops from iraq . milan 's public prosecutor had already issued extradition requests for 22 of the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- agents , but they were blocked by the justice ministry of former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , a close ally of us president george w. bush . in february 2003 , the former imam , or prayer leader , osama mustafa hassan , an egyptian also known as abu omar and a terror suspect , was abducted in milan by cia agents and taken to egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu omar was allegedly kidnapped in milan by cia agents omar , who was living in asylum in italy at the time , was allegedly taken to a nearby us air base for interrogation and later transferred via germany to egypt , where he is still in prison . he claims to have been tortured in egypt . under italian law such abduction is illegal and anyone involved could face a jail sentence . scandal involves italian agents the case has rocked the italian military intelligence service -lrb- sismi -rrb- , which denied knowledge of the abduction .
an investigation has revealed that at least some members of sismi took part in the operation . the deputy head of sismi , marco mancini , and his predecessor gustavo pignero have been arrested and last week the intelligence chief general nicolo pollari was questioned by investigating magistrates in milan . la repubblica published extracts of a conversation that mancini recorded with pignero when he came under the judicial spotlight . " do you remember gustavo , do you remember that the abduction order came from the director ? "
mancini asks pignero who replies " yes " . " and do you remember that two days later i said that we could n't do that because we 're not in latin america ? "
mancini questions , to which pignero replies " yes , i remember . " state secret law to be lifted pollari has repeatedly denied any knowledge of the abduction and he said he could not reveal state secrets during his questioning last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : d 'alema said he would open state secrets in the new probe foreign minister massimo d 'alema has stressed that the government would do everything possible to help the investigation without harming the fight against terrorism .
he also said that he would lift the obligation to respect state secrets . in another twist in the long-running cia scandal in europe , a spanish judge on thursday accepted to head another inquiry into " extraordinary rendition " flights through spain . judge ismael moreno , of spain 's highest criminal court , agreed to lead the additional probe after the court requested on july 10 that more light be shed on the case . german national to give evidence in spain the court has called for people transported on the flights to be interviewed for the complementary investigation , notably german national khaled al-masri . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masri was transported through spain by the cia al-masri was seized by the cia in macedonia at the end of 2003 and mistakenly held as a terror suspect under grueling conditions in a jail in afghanistan for five months . the court has also demanded details on the personnel aboard the flights and background on flights at eight spanish airports , including those of madrid and barcelona . moreno is already investigating 10 cia flights that passed through the balearic islands between january 2004 and january 2005 . spain has " categorically " rejected allegations in a report by the council of europe that it was one of 14 european countries which colluded in or tolerated the secret transfer of terrorist suspects by the united states . council of europe on cia case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty 's investigation reveals " a spider 's web " drawn up by swiss parliamentarian dick marty , the report identified a " spider 's web " of landing points around the world used by the us authorities for the practice of " extraordinary rendition " - the undercover transfer of security suspects to third countries or us-run detention centers . eu rapporteur giovanni claudio fava alleged in a separate report released last month that the balearic islands in the mediterranean were " an important transit base . " fava said that out of 1,080 european movements of planes allegedly chartered by the cia between 2001 and the end of 2005 , 125 went through 10 spanish airports , mainly majorca and tenerife in the canary islands , although the spanish government had only recognized 27 of them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german testifies in probe into alleged cia abduction a parliamentary probe hears testimony from a german citizen , khaled al-masri , who alleged he was kidnapped by the cia and held for five months in an afghan jail .

she deserves respect and could soon find top-level sympathizers , says dw 's peter stützle . he was ashamed of belonging to a government that did nothing while civilians were suffering .
the man who felt this way was christian schwarz-schilling , germany 's minister for postal services , and he was talking about the suffering in bosnia herzegovina.then chancellor helmut kohl accepted the resignation of his minister , who went on to play a crucial role in stabilizing the war-torn country - until this day . just like the balkan war did at the time , the current middle east conflict unsettles the german public today .
just like then , a lone member of the federal government has put her finger where it hurts .
helmut kohl must have seen schwarz-schilling 's moral position as non-political .
after all , the german government had to consider the different interests and assessments of its allies .
current chancellor angela merkel has to do the same . pai n ful compromise the g8 declaration in st. petersburg from last weekend is a compromise that was painful to reach .
it calls for the release of the kidnapped israeli soldiers and an end to the bombardment of israel , followed by an end of israel 's military operations .
that 's what the chancellor is sticking to . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul on the other hand views the israeli reaction to hezbollah 's attacks as completely inappropriate - and demands an immediate end to the bombings .
she knows from opinion polls that at least three quarters of the german population agree with her .
the three opposition parties - the free-market liberal fdp , the greens and the left party - have also criticized the israeli action , albeit in different ways . growi n g support even within the governing coalition , things are beginning to brew .
wieczorek-zeul , a member of the social democratic party 's left wing , can rest assured that many of her party colleagues stand behind her .
even her predecessor , carl-dieter spranger from bavaria 's ultra-conservative christian social union , who co-signed wieczorek-zeul 's letter calling for an immediate ceasefire , is unlikely to be isolated within his party . it should be noted that it 's the minister for economic development and her predecessor , who published this appeal .
her ministry is responsible for far-reaching development aid projects in the entire middle east - especially in the palestinian territories .
if much of this will now be ruthlessly destroyed , it will provoke great resentment among german voters .
it will be hard to convince them to use their taxes to rebuild everything later on .
political capital is also destroyed this way . angela merkel is not unaware of this .
that 's why she has not distanced herself from her minister , just like wieczorek-zeul supports the g8 declaration .
should lebanese civilians continue to suffer , the chancellor is likely to move closer to wieczorek-zeul 's point of view .
unlike in the case of schwarz-schilling , the resignation of a minister is unlikely to happen . peter stützle -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe looks to mediate in raging middle east conflict along with other european nations , germany is attempting to de-escalate the raging middle east conflict amid fears the crisis could explode into a regional war .

she deserves respect and could soon find top-level sympathizers , says dw 's peter stützle . he was ashamed of belonging to a government that did nothing while civilians were suffering .
the man who felt this way was christian schwarz-schilling , germany 's minister for postal services , and he was talking about the suffering in bosnia herzegovina.then chancellor helmut kohl accepted the resignation of his minister , who went on to play a crucial role in stabilizing the war-torn country - until this day . just like the balkan war did at the time , the current middle east conflict unsettles the german public today .
just like then , a lone member of the federal government has put her finger where it hurts .
helmut kohl must have seen schwarz-schilling 's moral position as non-political .
after all , the german government had to consider the different interests and assessments of its allies .
current chancellor angela merkel has to do the same . pai n ful compromise the g8 declaration in st. petersburg from last weekend is a compromise that was painful to reach .
it calls for the release of the kidnapped israeli soldiers and an end to the bombardment of israel , followed by an end of israel 's military operations .
that 's what the chancellor is sticking to . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul on the other hand views the israeli reaction to hezbollah 's attacks as completely inappropriate - and demands an immediate end to the bombings .
she knows from opinion polls that at least three quarters of the german population agree with her .
the three opposition parties - the free-market liberal fdp , the greens and the left party - have also criticized the israeli action , albeit in different ways . growi n g support even within the governing coalition , things are beginning to brew .
wieczorek-zeul , a member of the social democratic party 's left wing , can rest assured that many of her party colleagues stand behind her .
even her predecessor , carl-dieter spranger from bavaria 's ultra-conservative christian social union , who co-signed wieczorek-zeul 's letter calling for an immediate ceasefire , is unlikely to be isolated within his party . it should be noted that it 's the minister for economic development and her predecessor , who published this appeal .

but researchers in aachen have now found an alternative use that will benefit the art world . jürgen kolz stares at his screen .
the engineer at the technical university in aachen is examining a fresco that has been sent in by new york 's metropolitan museum of modern art .
in front of him sits the world 's smallest , mobile magnetic resonance tomograph -lrb- mrt -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mrt is not much bigger than a laser printer it 's about as big as a conventional laser printer .
a sensor that 's not thicker than a finger moves towards the fresco and stops just milimeters in front of the fresco .
now the real work can begin . " we 're choosing a certain point in the fresco that we want to examine and measure the specimen in various depths , " kolz says .
" the signal then gives us information about the kind of colors that were used , the thickness of the different layers and the stage of the ageing process . " no more damage to art art experts and restorers find this information immensely valuable .
the big advantage of this kind of test is that a fresco does not have to be damaged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art experts will no longer have to remove probes and examine them under a microscope so far , microscopically small probes had to be removed to examine them - a process that does n't make art lovers happy .
the mrt in aachen does away with this .
while large museums already use scanning methods , kolz says that his method is superior as it can determine the age of the colors as well . the ability to determine the age of paint layers is a valuable tool for museums .
bernhard blümich , who heads the teams of researchers in aachen , soon realized that the method could also be used to distinguish between originals and forgeries . recreati n g lost pai n ti n gs but the new technique 's advantages go beyond catching forgers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's researchers could find out if something 's hidden behind her smile " we can examine the various layers of a painting or fresco , " said federico casanova , a member of the team of researchers .
" that way we can see if there are other paintings below the surface . " in the future , the researchers will be able to reconstruct these submerged paintings by " rebuilding " them on a computer and creating a perfect copy .
the art world has already expressed interest .
aachen researchers have already scanned several frescoes and paintings in the italian town of perugia .
they will also travel to london at the end of the month to convince art experts at the national gallery that they should employ their method as well . ingo wagner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's cultural legacy on ice how much damage a fire at weimar 's anna amalia library did to germany 's cultural legacy will only be clear after a team of bookbinders in leipzig get done with their work - and that could take years . -lrb- sept .

mastella should then in turn send it to his us counterpart . there was no comment from the milan court . the case threatens to further sour relations between italy and the united states after the decision by romano prodi 's left-wing government to withdraw italy 's troops from iraq . milan 's public prosecutor had already issued extradition requests for 22 of the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- agents , but they were blocked by the justice ministry of former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , a close ally of us president george w. bush . in february 2003 , the former imam , or prayer leader , osama mustafa hassan , an egyptian also known as abu omar and a terror suspect , was abducted in milan by cia agents and taken to egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu omar was allegedly kidnapped in milan by cia agents omar , who was living in asylum in italy at the time , was allegedly taken to a nearby us air base for interrogation and later transferred via germany to egypt , where he is still in prison . he claims to have been tortured in egypt . under italian law such abduction is illegal and anyone involved could face a jail sentence . scandal involves italian agents the case has rocked the italian military intelligence service -lrb- sismi -rrb- , which denied knowledge of the abduction .
an investigation has revealed that at least some members of sismi took part in the operation . the deputy head of sismi , marco mancini , and his predecessor gustavo pignero have been arrested and last week the intelligence chief general nicolo pollari was questioned by investigating magistrates in milan . la repubblica published extracts of a conversation that mancini recorded with pignero when he came under the judicial spotlight . " do you remember gustavo , do you remember that the abduction order came from the director ? "
mancini asks pignero who replies " yes " . " and do you remember that two days later i said that we could n't do that because we 're not in latin america ? "
mancini questions , to which pignero replies " yes , i remember . " state secret law to be lifted pollari has repeatedly denied any knowledge of the abduction and he said he could not reveal state secrets during his questioning last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : d 'alema said he would open state secrets in the new probe foreign minister massimo d 'alema has stressed that the government would do everything possible to help the investigation without harming the fight against terrorism .
he also said that he would lift the obligation to respect state secrets . in another twist in the long-running cia scandal in europe , a spanish judge on thursday accepted to head another inquiry into " extraordinary rendition " flights through spain . judge ismael moreno , of spain 's highest criminal court , agreed to lead the additional probe after the court requested on july 10 that more light be shed on the case . german national to give evidence in spain the court has called for people transported on the flights to be interviewed for the complementary investigation , notably german national khaled al-masri . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masri was transported through spain by the cia al-masri was seized by the cia in macedonia at the end of 2003 and mistakenly held as a terror suspect under grueling conditions in a jail in afghanistan for five months . the court has also demanded details on the personnel aboard the flights and background on flights at eight spanish airports , including those of madrid and barcelona . moreno is already investigating 10 cia flights that passed through the balearic islands between january 2004 and january 2005 . spain has " categorically " rejected allegations in a report by the council of europe that it was one of 14 european countries which colluded in or tolerated the secret transfer of terrorist suspects by the united states . council of europe on cia case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty 's investigation reveals " a spider 's web " drawn up by swiss parliamentarian dick marty , the report identified a " spider 's web " of landing points around the world used by the us authorities for the practice of " extraordinary rendition " - the undercover transfer of security suspects to third countries or us-run detention centers . eu rapporteur giovanni claudio fava alleged in a separate report released last month that the balearic islands in the mediterranean were " an important transit base . " fava said that out of 1,080 european movements of planes allegedly chartered by the cia between 2001 and the end of 2005 , 125 went through 10 spanish airports , mainly majorca and tenerife in the canary islands , although the spanish government had only recognized 27 of them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german testifies in probe into alleged cia abduction a parliamentary probe hears testimony from a german citizen , khaled al-masri , who alleged he was kidnapped by the cia and held for five months in an afghan jail .
german authorities have denied a role in the affair .

it said the disclosure threatens to anger arab governments and others because of the appearance that the us is actively aiding the israeli bombing campaign in a way that could be compared to iranian efforts to arm and resupply hezbollah . tehran denies that it arms hezbollah , saying it gives only moral support to the shiite movement . israel 's air war far from over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while a land offensive is prepared , bombs still rain down israel 's request for rush delivery of the satellite- and laser-guided bombs was described as unusual by some military officers , and an indication that israel still had a long list of targets to strike in lebanon , the paper said . israel said its aircraft had hit 150 targets inside lebanon in the 24 hours to saturday morning , including a dozen roads linking lebanon to neighboring syria as well as suspected hezbollah positions . lebanon has said its army is ready to go into battle if israel invades , which would sharply raise the stakes in a conflict that in just 10 days has killed close to 340 people , mostly civilians , in lebanon and displaced more than half a million . " the lebanese army will resist and defend the country and prove that it is an army worthy of respect , " said defense minister elias murr , whose forces have so far stood on the sidelines of the conflict . israel would invade " without a thought " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel prepares to take on hezbollah in lebanon israeli defense minister amir peretz had warned that israel would launch a full-scale ground invasion " without thinking twice " if necessary to crush hezbollah , which has long been a thorn in its side . but british foreign secretary margaret beckett , who has drawn arab criticism for failing to back un calls for a ceasefire , warned israel of the dangers of a full-scale invasion . she told the financial times the " very dangerous situation " could be at a turning point where " a miscalculation , a mistake could have dramatic effects and that i find deeply alarming . " but an israeli military spokesman said ground operations would be necessary to stop hezbollah rocket fire on israel , and that a major ground attack had not been ruled out . ground operations in lebanon were " indispensable because the air force can not always destroy underground bunkers dug by hezbollah , which has put in place an entire fortified network , " military spokesman captain yaacov dalal said . reservists called up ; tanks massing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redeployed troops arrive from the west bank and gaza some 3,000 reservists had already been called up to " clean up the border zone on the lebanese side by limited operations aiming to destroy hezbollah 's infrastructure , " he added . israeli police and army said " a number " of rockets landed in northern israel on saturday without causing casualties , despite a direct hit on a home in carmiel . the israeli military confirmed that ground forces had held positions in two villages in southern lebanon for several days but a un spokesman said it was " not a massive force " and that the israelis withdrew from one of the villages just before midday .

austria already has a successful wage subsidy program in place .
can it work in germany too ? a blend of dark and light wood , modern simplicity combined with high ornate ceilings - michl 's restaurant in downtown vienna is a chic location for any business lunch or evening out . eierschwammerl , wiener kartoffelsuppe and rindsbraten are just a few of the local specialties on offer at the one-year-old café .
but michl 's , named for vienna 's mayor michael häupl , is not just another eatery . as part of a new social gastronomy project , all of michl 's 35 employees have something in common : they were unemployed for a long time before joining the staff . " i was unemployed for a few years , and then i was afraid that i would n't be able to get back in to the whole thing , but i was surprised how quickly things worked out , " said a 53-year-old michl 's employee called fritz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a combined wage subsidy encourages the unemployed to accept a lower paying job already seeing progress he has good reason to be in high spirits .
within only a year of operation , 10 formerly unemployed michl 's employees have succeeded in finding positions on the open market . " i 've finally sent a few job applications , some companies have n't responded yet and i 've gotten a couple of rejections , " continued fritz , " but i know that something will work out . " the austrian government has recently gotten involved on the fringes of the job market .
for instance , limited subsidies are being offered to employers that hire older , handicapped - or long-term unemployed workers , like those at michl 's . statistics show that the initiatives seem to be working .
in comparison to last year , the number of long-term unemployed has dropped by 30 percent .
only some 8,000 people in austria have been looking for a job for more than one year . unemployment in austria , which eurostat gave as 4.9 percent for may 2006 , is significantly lower than in germany -lrb- 8.3 percent in may 2006 -rrb- . similarities to german proposals germany has a much greater problem to tackle , as far as unemployment is concerned , but , recently , a similar solution has been proposed . germany 's secretary of labor franz müntefering presented this week to parliament a combined wage proposal for job seekers over the age of 50 .
age can be a disadvantage in the job market , particularly for those looking for a way back into it . the new 50 plus initiative , meant to take effect on january 1 , 2007 , is designed to ease this transition back to the work force by encouraging older job seekers to accept lower paying positions .
those who qualify would receive 50 percent of the difference between their last paycheck and their new one for the first year , 30 percent of the difference in the second year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz münterfering -lrb- spd -rrb- has some convincing to do to push through the 50 plus initiative employer benefits encourage companies to hire 50-plus job seekers who 've been on welfare .
the labor secretary is confident that the employment subsidy initiative will create 100,000 new jobs . austria 's wage subsidies are not age-based .
one of the chefs at michl 's , for instance , is in his mid-20s and even completed an apprenticeship before enduring a three-year period of unemployment . possible extension of 50 plus to under 25 münterfering said this week in an interview with " handelsblatt " that he hopes to discuss a similar subsidy project for the unemployed and underemployed under the age of 25 . before that , he 'll have to convince critics - both within in own social democratic party and among the opposition - that the current 50-plus initiative will work .
it 's been labeled uncreative by the harsher critics . demographic differences prevent a one-to-one exchange between germany and austria .
nevertheless , perhaps germany can take a look at the recent success of its smaller eastern neighbor and gather a few tips . gerwald herter / dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de workers over 40 : " diamonds in the rough " in spite of high unemployment in germany , a cologne-based company is trying to help place the unemployed over 40 , arguing that their age gives them an advantage in knowledge and experience .

age can be a disadvantage in the job market , particularly for those looking for a way back into it . the new 50 plus initiative , meant to take effect on january 1 , 2007 , is designed to ease this transition back to the work force by encouraging older job seekers to accept lower paying positions .

the labor secretary is confident that the employment subsidy initiative will create 100,000 new jobs . austria 's wage subsidies are not age-based .
one of the chefs at michl 's , for instance , is in his mid-20s and even completed an apprenticeship before enduring a three-year period of unemployment . possible extension of 50 plus to under 25 münterfering said this week in an interview with " handelsblatt " that he hopes to discuss a similar subsidy project for the unemployed and underemployed under the age of 25 . before that , he 'll have to convince critics - both within in own social democratic party and among the opposition - that the current 50-plus initiative will work .

" the priority now is to evacuate those trapped in difficult conditions in the south .
we are greatly concerned about them , " ministry spokesman martin jaeger said . he said so far the government has managed to evacuate 600 people from the south , which bore the brunt of israel 's bombardment and would be the first region to encounter fighting if israel invaded . of these , 200 have arrived in cyprus by boat and about 130 more would leave for the mediterranean island on friday night . since thursday , 2,300 germans have been flown back home on chartered flights and military planes , jaeger said . about 780 others arrived back in germany on friday from the jordanian capital amman and from larnaca in cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans took buses to damascus before flying home jaeger said foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had asked israeli defense minister amir peretz to allow the safe evacuation of germany citizens from the south .

two planes carrying more than 200 russian evacuees also arrived in moscow from the syrian city of latakia . as thousands of weary but relieved evacuees huddled in makeshift transit centers , governments began warning nationals still in lebanon that now was the time to leave if they wanted to get out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ships have been arriving in cyprus day and night bbc world service radio broadcast warnings through the night to all remaining britons in lebanon who wanted to leave to gather at an assembly area in the capital on saturday for the last ship out being planned by the british government .

it is the last scheduled evacuation for british nationals wanting to leave , " said derek smith , spokesman for the british embassy in beirut . a sense of urgency a british diplomat in cyprus told afp the authorities were keen to instill a sense of urgency in those still wanting to leave after some evacuee ships had left beirut less than full in recent days .
" we made this warning because we need to get them out .
if they want to go time is running out , " the diplomat said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the evacuation separates loved ones it is estimated that some 3,500 of an estimated 5,000 britons who were in lebanon when the crisis erupted have now left . australia 's ambassador to lebanon , lyndall sachs , told afp that her country 's efforts to evacuate many of the 25,000 australians who had been in the country were also winding up at the weekend . the last scheduled ships were due to leave for cyprus and turkey on sunday , she said .

mastella should then in turn send it to his us counterpart . there was no comment from the milan court . the case threatens to further sour relations between italy and the united states after the decision by romano prodi 's left-wing government to withdraw italy 's troops from iraq . milan 's public prosecutor had already issued extradition requests for 22 of the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- agents , but they were blocked by the justice ministry of former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , a close ally of us president george w. bush . in february 2003 , the former imam , or prayer leader , osama mustafa hassan , an egyptian also known as abu omar and a terror suspect , was abducted in milan by cia agents and taken to egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu omar was allegedly kidnapped in milan by cia agents omar , who was living in asylum in italy at the time , was allegedly taken to a nearby us air base for interrogation and later transferred via germany to egypt , where he is still in prison . he claims to have been tortured in egypt . under italian law such abduction is illegal and anyone involved could face a jail sentence . scandal involves italian agents the case has rocked the italian military intelligence service -lrb- sismi -rrb- , which denied knowledge of the abduction .
an investigation has revealed that at least some members of sismi took part in the operation . the deputy head of sismi , marco mancini , and his predecessor gustavo pignero have been arrested and last week the intelligence chief general nicolo pollari was questioned by investigating magistrates in milan . la repubblica published extracts of a conversation that mancini recorded with pignero when he came under the judicial spotlight . " do you remember gustavo , do you remember that the abduction order came from the director ? "
mancini asks pignero who replies " yes " . " and do you remember that two days later i said that we could n't do that because we 're not in latin america ? "
mancini questions , to which pignero replies " yes , i remember . " state secret law to be lifted pollari has repeatedly denied any knowledge of the abduction and he said he could not reveal state secrets during his questioning last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : d 'alema said he would open state secrets in the new probe foreign minister massimo d 'alema has stressed that the government would do everything possible to help the investigation without harming the fight against terrorism .
he also said that he would lift the obligation to respect state secrets . in another twist in the long-running cia scandal in europe , a spanish judge on thursday accepted to head another inquiry into " extraordinary rendition " flights through spain . judge ismael moreno , of spain 's highest criminal court , agreed to lead the additional probe after the court requested on july 10 that more light be shed on the case . german national to give evidence in spain the court has called for people transported on the flights to be interviewed for the complementary investigation , notably german national khaled al-masri . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masri was transported through spain by the cia al-masri was seized by the cia in macedonia at the end of 2003 and mistakenly held as a terror suspect under grueling conditions in a jail in afghanistan for five months . the court has also demanded details on the personnel aboard the flights and background on flights at eight spanish airports , including those of madrid and barcelona . moreno is already investigating 10 cia flights that passed through the balearic islands between january 2004 and january 2005 . spain has " categorically " rejected allegations in a report by the council of europe that it was one of 14 european countries which colluded in or tolerated the secret transfer of terrorist suspects by the united states . council of europe on cia case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty 's investigation reveals " a spider 's web " drawn up by swiss parliamentarian dick marty , the report identified a " spider 's web " of landing points around the world used by the us authorities for the practice of " extraordinary rendition " - the undercover transfer of security suspects to third countries or us-run detention centers . eu rapporteur giovanni claudio fava alleged in a separate report released last month that the balearic islands in the mediterranean were " an important transit base . " fava said that out of 1,080 european movements of planes allegedly chartered by the cia between 2001 and the end of 2005 , 125 went through 10 spanish airports , mainly majorca and tenerife in the canary islands , although the spanish government had only recognized 27 of them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german testifies in probe into alleged cia abduction a parliamentary probe hears testimony from a german citizen , khaled al-masri , who alleged he was kidnapped by the cia and held for five months in an afghan jail .

she deserves respect and could soon find top-level sympathizers , says dw 's peter stützle . he was ashamed of belonging to a government that did nothing while civilians were suffering .
the man who felt this way was christian schwarz-schilling , germany 's minister for postal services , and he was talking about the suffering in bosnia herzegovina.then chancellor helmut kohl accepted the resignation of his minister , who went on to play a crucial role in stabilizing the war-torn country - until this day . just like the balkan war did at the time , the current middle east conflict unsettles the german public today .
just like then , a lone member of the federal government has put her finger where it hurts .
helmut kohl must have seen schwarz-schilling 's moral position as non-political .
after all , the german government had to consider the different interests and assessments of its allies .
current chancellor angela merkel has to do the same . pai n ful compromise the g8 declaration in st. petersburg from last weekend is a compromise that was painful to reach .
it calls for the release of the kidnapped israeli soldiers and an end to the bombardment of israel , followed by an end of israel 's military operations .
that 's what the chancellor is sticking to . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul on the other hand views the israeli reaction to hezbollah 's attacks as completely inappropriate - and demands an immediate end to the bombings .
she knows from opinion polls that at least three quarters of the german population agree with her .
the three opposition parties - the free-market liberal fdp , the greens and the left party - have also criticized the israeli action , albeit in different ways . growi n g support even within the governing coalition , things are beginning to brew .
wieczorek-zeul , a member of the social democratic party 's left wing , can rest assured that many of her party colleagues stand behind her .
even her predecessor , carl-dieter spranger from bavaria 's ultra-conservative christian social union , who co-signed wieczorek-zeul 's letter calling for an immediate ceasefire , is unlikely to be isolated within his party . it should be noted that it 's the minister for economic development and her predecessor , who published this appeal .
her ministry is responsible for far-reaching development aid projects in the entire middle east - especially in the palestinian territories .
if much of this will now be ruthlessly destroyed , it will provoke great resentment among german voters .
it will be hard to convince them to use their taxes to rebuild everything later on .
political capital is also destroyed this way . angela merkel is not unaware of this .
that 's why she has not distanced herself from her minister , just like wieczorek-zeul supports the g8 declaration .
should lebanese civilians continue to suffer , the chancellor is likely to move closer to wieczorek-zeul 's point of view .
unlike in the case of schwarz-schilling , the resignation of a minister is unlikely to happen . peter stützle -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe looks to mediate in raging middle east conflict along with other european nations , germany is attempting to de-escalate the raging middle east conflict amid fears the crisis could explode into a regional war .

it said the disclosure threatens to anger arab governments and others because of the appearance that the us is actively aiding the israeli bombing campaign in a way that could be compared to iranian efforts to arm and resupply hezbollah . tehran denies that it arms hezbollah , saying it gives only moral support to the shiite movement . israel 's air war far from over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while a land offensive is prepared , bombs still rain down israel 's request for rush delivery of the satellite- and laser-guided bombs was described as unusual by some military officers , and an indication that israel still had a long list of targets to strike in lebanon , the paper said . israel said its aircraft had hit 150 targets inside lebanon in the 24 hours to saturday morning , including a dozen roads linking lebanon to neighboring syria as well as suspected hezbollah positions . lebanon has said its army is ready to go into battle if israel invades , which would sharply raise the stakes in a conflict that in just 10 days has killed close to 340 people , mostly civilians , in lebanon and displaced more than half a million . " the lebanese army will resist and defend the country and prove that it is an army worthy of respect , " said defense minister elias murr , whose forces have so far stood on the sidelines of the conflict . israel would invade " without a thought " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel prepares to take on hezbollah in lebanon israeli defense minister amir peretz had warned that israel would launch a full-scale ground invasion " without thinking twice " if necessary to crush hezbollah , which has long been a thorn in its side . but british foreign secretary margaret beckett , who has drawn arab criticism for failing to back un calls for a ceasefire , warned israel of the dangers of a full-scale invasion . she told the financial times the " very dangerous situation " could be at a turning point where " a miscalculation , a mistake could have dramatic effects and that i find deeply alarming . " but an israeli military spokesman said ground operations would be necessary to stop hezbollah rocket fire on israel , and that a major ground attack had not been ruled out . ground operations in lebanon were " indispensable because the air force can not always destroy underground bunkers dug by hezbollah , which has put in place an entire fortified network , " military spokesman captain yaacov dalal said . reservists called up ; tanks massing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redeployed troops arrive from the west bank and gaza some 3,000 reservists had already been called up to " clean up the border zone on the lebanese side by limited operations aiming to destroy hezbollah 's infrastructure , " he added . israeli police and army said " a number " of rockets landed in northern israel on saturday without causing casualties , despite a direct hit on a home in carmiel . the israeli military confirmed that ground forces had held positions in two villages in southern lebanon for several days but a un spokesman said it was " not a massive force " and that the israelis withdrew from one of the villages just before midday .

" the lebanese army will resist and defend the country and prove that it is an army worthy of respect , " said defense minister elias murr , whose forces have so far stood on the sidelines of the conflict . israel would invade " without a thought " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel prepares to take on hezbollah in lebanon israeli defense minister amir peretz had warned that israel would launch a full-scale ground invasion " without thinking twice " if necessary to crush hezbollah , which has long been a thorn in its side . but british foreign secretary margaret beckett , who has drawn arab criticism for failing to back un calls for a ceasefire , warned israel of the dangers of a full-scale invasion . she told the financial times the " very dangerous situation " could be at a turning point where " a miscalculation , a mistake could have dramatic effects and that i find deeply alarming . " but an israeli military spokesman said ground operations would be necessary to stop hezbollah rocket fire on israel , and that a major ground attack had not been ruled out . ground operations in lebanon were " indispensable because the air force can not always destroy underground bunkers dug by hezbollah , which has put in place an entire fortified network , " military spokesman captain yaacov dalal said . reservists called up ; tanks massing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redeployed troops arrive from the west bank and gaza some 3,000 reservists had already been called up to " clean up the border zone on the lebanese side by limited operations aiming to destroy hezbollah 's infrastructure , " he added . israeli police and army said " a number " of rockets landed in northern israel on saturday without causing casualties , despite a direct hit on a home in carmiel . the israeli military confirmed that ground forces had held positions in two villages in southern lebanon for several days but a un spokesman said it was " not a massive force " and that the israelis withdrew from one of the villages just before midday .

mastella should then in turn send it to his us counterpart . there was no comment from the milan court . the case threatens to further sour relations between italy and the united states after the decision by romano prodi 's left-wing government to withdraw italy 's troops from iraq . milan 's public prosecutor had already issued extradition requests for 22 of the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- agents , but they were blocked by the justice ministry of former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , a close ally of us president george w. bush . in february 2003 , the former imam , or prayer leader , osama mustafa hassan , an egyptian also known as abu omar and a terror suspect , was abducted in milan by cia agents and taken to egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu omar was allegedly kidnapped in milan by cia agents omar , who was living in asylum in italy at the time , was allegedly taken to a nearby us air base for interrogation and later transferred via germany to egypt , where he is still in prison . he claims to have been tortured in egypt . under italian law such abduction is illegal and anyone involved could face a jail sentence . scandal involves italian agents the case has rocked the italian military intelligence service -lrb- sismi -rrb- , which denied knowledge of the abduction .
an investigation has revealed that at least some members of sismi took part in the operation . the deputy head of sismi , marco mancini , and his predecessor gustavo pignero have been arrested and last week the intelligence chief general nicolo pollari was questioned by investigating magistrates in milan . la repubblica published extracts of a conversation that mancini recorded with pignero when he came under the judicial spotlight . " do you remember gustavo , do you remember that the abduction order came from the director ? "
mancini asks pignero who replies " yes " . " and do you remember that two days later i said that we could n't do that because we 're not in latin america ? "
mancini questions , to which pignero replies " yes , i remember . " state secret law to be lifted pollari has repeatedly denied any knowledge of the abduction and he said he could not reveal state secrets during his questioning last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : d 'alema said he would open state secrets in the new probe foreign minister massimo d 'alema has stressed that the government would do everything possible to help the investigation without harming the fight against terrorism .
he also said that he would lift the obligation to respect state secrets . in another twist in the long-running cia scandal in europe , a spanish judge on thursday accepted to head another inquiry into " extraordinary rendition " flights through spain . judge ismael moreno , of spain 's highest criminal court , agreed to lead the additional probe after the court requested on july 10 that more light be shed on the case . german national to give evidence in spain the court has called for people transported on the flights to be interviewed for the complementary investigation , notably german national khaled al-masri . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masri was transported through spain by the cia al-masri was seized by the cia in macedonia at the end of 2003 and mistakenly held as a terror suspect under grueling conditions in a jail in afghanistan for five months . the court has also demanded details on the personnel aboard the flights and background on flights at eight spanish airports , including those of madrid and barcelona . moreno is already investigating 10 cia flights that passed through the balearic islands between january 2004 and january 2005 . spain has " categorically " rejected allegations in a report by the council of europe that it was one of 14 european countries which colluded in or tolerated the secret transfer of terrorist suspects by the united states . council of europe on cia case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty 's investigation reveals " a spider 's web " drawn up by swiss parliamentarian dick marty , the report identified a " spider 's web " of landing points around the world used by the us authorities for the practice of " extraordinary rendition " - the undercover transfer of security suspects to third countries or us-run detention centers . eu rapporteur giovanni claudio fava alleged in a separate report released last month that the balearic islands in the mediterranean were " an important transit base . " fava said that out of 1,080 european movements of planes allegedly chartered by the cia between 2001 and the end of 2005 , 125 went through 10 spanish airports , mainly majorca and tenerife in the canary islands , although the spanish government had only recognized 27 of them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german testifies in probe into alleged cia abduction a parliamentary probe hears testimony from a german citizen , khaled al-masri , who alleged he was kidnapped by the cia and held for five months in an afghan jail .

it said the disclosure threatens to anger arab governments and others because of the appearance that the us is actively aiding the israeli bombing campaign in a way that could be compared to iranian efforts to arm and resupply hezbollah . tehran denies that it arms hezbollah , saying it gives only moral support to the shiite movement . israel 's air war far from over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while a land offensive is prepared , bombs still rain down israel 's request for rush delivery of the satellite- and laser-guided bombs was described as unusual by some military officers , and an indication that israel still had a long list of targets to strike in lebanon , the paper said . israel said its aircraft had hit 150 targets inside lebanon in the 24 hours to saturday morning , including a dozen roads linking lebanon to neighboring syria as well as suspected hezbollah positions . lebanon has said its army is ready to go into battle if israel invades , which would sharply raise the stakes in a conflict that in just 10 days has killed close to 340 people , mostly civilians , in lebanon and displaced more than half a million . " the lebanese army will resist and defend the country and prove that it is an army worthy of respect , " said defense minister elias murr , whose forces have so far stood on the sidelines of the conflict . israel would invade " without a thought " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel prepares to take on hezbollah in lebanon israeli defense minister amir peretz had warned that israel would launch a full-scale ground invasion " without thinking twice " if necessary to crush hezbollah , which has long been a thorn in its side . but british foreign secretary margaret beckett , who has drawn arab criticism for failing to back un calls for a ceasefire , warned israel of the dangers of a full-scale invasion . she told the financial times the " very dangerous situation " could be at a turning point where " a miscalculation , a mistake could have dramatic effects and that i find deeply alarming . " but an israeli military spokesman said ground operations would be necessary to stop hezbollah rocket fire on israel , and that a major ground attack had not been ruled out . ground operations in lebanon were " indispensable because the air force can not always destroy underground bunkers dug by hezbollah , which has put in place an entire fortified network , " military spokesman captain yaacov dalal said . reservists called up ; tanks massing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redeployed troops arrive from the west bank and gaza some 3,000 reservists had already been called up to " clean up the border zone on the lebanese side by limited operations aiming to destroy hezbollah 's infrastructure , " he added . israeli police and army said " a number " of rockets landed in northern israel on saturday without causing casualties , despite a direct hit on a home in carmiel . the israeli military confirmed that ground forces had held positions in two villages in southern lebanon for several days but a un spokesman said it was " not a massive force " and that the israelis withdrew from one of the villages just before midday .

austria already has a successful wage subsidy program in place .
can it work in germany too ? a blend of dark and light wood , modern simplicity combined with high ornate ceilings - michl 's restaurant in downtown vienna is a chic location for any business lunch or evening out . eierschwammerl , wiener kartoffelsuppe and rindsbraten are just a few of the local specialties on offer at the one-year-old café .
but michl 's , named for vienna 's mayor michael häupl , is not just another eatery . as part of a new social gastronomy project , all of michl 's 35 employees have something in common : they were unemployed for a long time before joining the staff . " i was unemployed for a few years , and then i was afraid that i would n't be able to get back in to the whole thing , but i was surprised how quickly things worked out , " said a 53-year-old michl 's employee called fritz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a combined wage subsidy encourages the unemployed to accept a lower paying job already seeing progress he has good reason to be in high spirits .
within only a year of operation , 10 formerly unemployed michl 's employees have succeeded in finding positions on the open market . " i 've finally sent a few job applications , some companies have n't responded yet and i 've gotten a couple of rejections , " continued fritz , " but i know that something will work out . " the austrian government has recently gotten involved on the fringes of the job market .
for instance , limited subsidies are being offered to employers that hire older , handicapped - or long-term unemployed workers , like those at michl 's . statistics show that the initiatives seem to be working .
in comparison to last year , the number of long-term unemployed has dropped by 30 percent .
only some 8,000 people in austria have been looking for a job for more than one year . unemployment in austria , which eurostat gave as 4.9 percent for may 2006 , is significantly lower than in germany -lrb- 8.3 percent in may 2006 -rrb- . similarities to german proposals germany has a much greater problem to tackle , as far as unemployment is concerned , but , recently , a similar solution has been proposed . germany 's secretary of labor franz müntefering presented this week to parliament a combined wage proposal for job seekers over the age of 50 .
age can be a disadvantage in the job market , particularly for those looking for a way back into it . the new 50 plus initiative , meant to take effect on january 1 , 2007 , is designed to ease this transition back to the work force by encouraging older job seekers to accept lower paying positions .
those who qualify would receive 50 percent of the difference between their last paycheck and their new one for the first year , 30 percent of the difference in the second year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz münterfering -lrb- spd -rrb- has some convincing to do to push through the 50 plus initiative employer benefits encourage companies to hire 50-plus job seekers who 've been on welfare .
the labor secretary is confident that the employment subsidy initiative will create 100,000 new jobs . austria 's wage subsidies are not age-based .
one of the chefs at michl 's , for instance , is in his mid-20s and even completed an apprenticeship before enduring a three-year period of unemployment . possible extension of 50 plus to under 25 münterfering said this week in an interview with " handelsblatt " that he hopes to discuss a similar subsidy project for the unemployed and underemployed under the age of 25 . before that , he 'll have to convince critics - both within in own social democratic party and among the opposition - that the current 50-plus initiative will work .
it 's been labeled uncreative by the harsher critics . demographic differences prevent a one-to-one exchange between germany and austria .
nevertheless , perhaps germany can take a look at the recent success of its smaller eastern neighbor and gather a few tips . gerwald herter / dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de workers over 40 : " diamonds in the rough " in spite of high unemployment in germany , a cologne-based company is trying to help place the unemployed over 40 , arguing that their age gives them an advantage in knowledge and experience .

austria already has a successful wage subsidy program in place .
can it work in germany too ? a blend of dark and light wood , modern simplicity combined with high ornate ceilings - michl 's restaurant in downtown vienna is a chic location for any business lunch or evening out . eierschwammerl , wiener kartoffelsuppe and rindsbraten are just a few of the local specialties on offer at the one-year-old café .
but michl 's , named for vienna 's mayor michael häupl , is not just another eatery . as part of a new social gastronomy project , all of michl 's 35 employees have something in common : they were unemployed for a long time before joining the staff . " i was unemployed for a few years , and then i was afraid that i would n't be able to get back in to the whole thing , but i was surprised how quickly things worked out , " said a 53-year-old michl 's employee called fritz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a combined wage subsidy encourages the unemployed to accept a lower paying job already seeing progress he has good reason to be in high spirits .
within only a year of operation , 10 formerly unemployed michl 's employees have succeeded in finding positions on the open market . " i 've finally sent a few job applications , some companies have n't responded yet and i 've gotten a couple of rejections , " continued fritz , " but i know that something will work out . " the austrian government has recently gotten involved on the fringes of the job market .
for instance , limited subsidies are being offered to employers that hire older , handicapped - or long-term unemployed workers , like those at michl 's . statistics show that the initiatives seem to be working .
in comparison to last year , the number of long-term unemployed has dropped by 30 percent .
only some 8,000 people in austria have been looking for a job for more than one year . unemployment in austria , which eurostat gave as 4.9 percent for may 2006 , is significantly lower than in germany -lrb- 8.3 percent in may 2006 -rrb- . similarities to german proposals germany has a much greater problem to tackle , as far as unemployment is concerned , but , recently , a similar solution has been proposed . germany 's secretary of labor franz müntefering presented this week to parliament a combined wage proposal for job seekers over the age of 50 .
age can be a disadvantage in the job market , particularly for those looking for a way back into it . the new 50 plus initiative , meant to take effect on january 1 , 2007 , is designed to ease this transition back to the work force by encouraging older job seekers to accept lower paying positions .
those who qualify would receive 50 percent of the difference between their last paycheck and their new one for the first year , 30 percent of the difference in the second year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz münterfering -lrb- spd -rrb- has some convincing to do to push through the 50 plus initiative employer benefits encourage companies to hire 50-plus job seekers who 've been on welfare .
the labor secretary is confident that the employment subsidy initiative will create 100,000 new jobs . austria 's wage subsidies are not age-based .
one of the chefs at michl 's , for instance , is in his mid-20s and even completed an apprenticeship before enduring a three-year period of unemployment . possible extension of 50 plus to under 25 münterfering said this week in an interview with " handelsblatt " that he hopes to discuss a similar subsidy project for the unemployed and underemployed under the age of 25 . before that , he 'll have to convince critics - both within in own social democratic party and among the opposition - that the current 50-plus initiative will work .
it 's been labeled uncreative by the harsher critics . demographic differences prevent a one-to-one exchange between germany and austria .
nevertheless , perhaps germany can take a look at the recent success of its smaller eastern neighbor and gather a few tips . gerwald herter / dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de workers over 40 : " diamonds in the rough " in spite of high unemployment in germany , a cologne-based company is trying to help place the unemployed over 40 , arguing that their age gives them an advantage in knowledge and experience .

those who qualify would receive 50 percent of the difference between their last paycheck and their new one for the first year , 30 percent of the difference in the second year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz münterfering -lrb- spd -rrb- has some convincing to do to push through the 50 plus initiative employer benefits encourage companies to hire 50-plus job seekers who 've been on welfare .
the labor secretary is confident that the employment subsidy initiative will create 100,000 new jobs . austria 's wage subsidies are not age-based .
one of the chefs at michl 's , for instance , is in his mid-20s and even completed an apprenticeship before enduring a three-year period of unemployment . possible extension of 50 plus to under 25 münterfering said this week in an interview with " handelsblatt " that he hopes to discuss a similar subsidy project for the unemployed and underemployed under the age of 25 . before that , he 'll have to convince critics - both within in own social democratic party and among the opposition - that the current 50-plus initiative will work .

" the priority now is to evacuate those trapped in difficult conditions in the south .
we are greatly concerned about them , " ministry spokesman martin jaeger said . he said so far the government has managed to evacuate 600 people from the south , which bore the brunt of israel 's bombardment and would be the first region to encounter fighting if israel invaded . of these , 200 have arrived in cyprus by boat and about 130 more would leave for the mediterranean island on friday night . since thursday , 2,300 germans have been flown back home on chartered flights and military planes , jaeger said . about 780 others arrived back in germany on friday from the jordanian capital amman and from larnaca in cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans took buses to damascus before flying home jaeger said foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had asked israeli defense minister amir peretz to allow the safe evacuation of germany citizens from the south . " we are doing everything possible to allow those who want to leave lebanon to return home , " he said . thousands still fleeing by sea some 3,000 americans arrived in cyprus early on saturday aboard two us warships while france brought out around 1,500 evacuees on two vessels overnight . two boats carrying 339 australians and some 200 canadians docked in the turkish port of mersin , the foreign ministry said in ankara .
two planes carrying more than 200 russian evacuees also arrived in moscow from the syrian city of latakia . as thousands of weary but relieved evacuees huddled in makeshift transit centers , governments began warning nationals still in lebanon that now was the time to leave if they wanted to get out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ships have been arriving in cyprus day and night bbc world service radio broadcast warnings through the night to all remaining britons in lebanon who wanted to leave to gather at an assembly area in the capital on saturday for the last ship out being planned by the british government . " today is the last day .
it is the last scheduled evacuation for british nationals wanting to leave , " said derek smith , spokesman for the british embassy in beirut . a sense of urgency a british diplomat in cyprus told afp the authorities were keen to instill a sense of urgency in those still wanting to leave after some evacuee ships had left beirut less than full in recent days .
" we made this warning because we need to get them out .
if they want to go time is running out , " the diplomat said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the evacuation separates loved ones it is estimated that some 3,500 of an estimated 5,000 britons who were in lebanon when the crisis erupted have now left . australia 's ambassador to lebanon , lyndall sachs , told afp that her country 's efforts to evacuate many of the 25,000 australians who had been in the country were also winding up at the weekend . the last scheduled ships were due to leave for cyprus and turkey on sunday , she said .
" we 'll definitely have ships tomorrow .

mastella should then in turn send it to his us counterpart . there was no comment from the milan court . the case threatens to further sour relations between italy and the united states after the decision by romano prodi 's left-wing government to withdraw italy 's troops from iraq . milan 's public prosecutor had already issued extradition requests for 22 of the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- agents , but they were blocked by the justice ministry of former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , a close ally of us president george w. bush . in february 2003 , the former imam , or prayer leader , osama mustafa hassan , an egyptian also known as abu omar and a terror suspect , was abducted in milan by cia agents and taken to egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu omar was allegedly kidnapped in milan by cia agents omar , who was living in asylum in italy at the time , was allegedly taken to a nearby us air base for interrogation and later transferred via germany to egypt , where he is still in prison . he claims to have been tortured in egypt . under italian law such abduction is illegal and anyone involved could face a jail sentence . scandal involves italian agents the case has rocked the italian military intelligence service -lrb- sismi -rrb- , which denied knowledge of the abduction .
an investigation has revealed that at least some members of sismi took part in the operation . the deputy head of sismi , marco mancini , and his predecessor gustavo pignero have been arrested and last week the intelligence chief general nicolo pollari was questioned by investigating magistrates in milan . la repubblica published extracts of a conversation that mancini recorded with pignero when he came under the judicial spotlight . " do you remember gustavo , do you remember that the abduction order came from the director ? "

it said the disclosure threatens to anger arab governments and others because of the appearance that the us is actively aiding the israeli bombing campaign in a way that could be compared to iranian efforts to arm and resupply hezbollah . tehran denies that it arms hezbollah , saying it gives only moral support to the shiite movement . israel 's air war far from over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while a land offensive is prepared , bombs still rain down israel 's request for rush delivery of the satellite- and laser-guided bombs was described as unusual by some military officers , and an indication that israel still had a long list of targets to strike in lebanon , the paper said . israel said its aircraft had hit 150 targets inside lebanon in the 24 hours to saturday morning , including a dozen roads linking lebanon to neighboring syria as well as suspected hezbollah positions . lebanon has said its army is ready to go into battle if israel invades , which would sharply raise the stakes in a conflict that in just 10 days has killed close to 340 people , mostly civilians , in lebanon and displaced more than half a million . " the lebanese army will resist and defend the country and prove that it is an army worthy of respect , " said defense minister elias murr , whose forces have so far stood on the sidelines of the conflict . israel would invade " without a thought " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel prepares to take on hezbollah in lebanon israeli defense minister amir peretz had warned that israel would launch a full-scale ground invasion " without thinking twice " if necessary to crush hezbollah , which has long been a thorn in its side . but british foreign secretary margaret beckett , who has drawn arab criticism for failing to back un calls for a ceasefire , warned israel of the dangers of a full-scale invasion . she told the financial times the " very dangerous situation " could be at a turning point where " a miscalculation , a mistake could have dramatic effects and that i find deeply alarming . " but an israeli military spokesman said ground operations would be necessary to stop hezbollah rocket fire on israel , and that a major ground attack had not been ruled out . ground operations in lebanon were " indispensable because the air force can not always destroy underground bunkers dug by hezbollah , which has put in place an entire fortified network , " military spokesman captain yaacov dalal said . reservists called up ; tanks massing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redeployed troops arrive from the west bank and gaza some 3,000 reservists had already been called up to " clean up the border zone on the lebanese side by limited operations aiming to destroy hezbollah 's infrastructure , " he added . israeli police and army said " a number " of rockets landed in northern israel on saturday without causing casualties , despite a direct hit on a home in carmiel . the israeli military confirmed that ground forces had held positions in two villages in southern lebanon for several days but a un spokesman said it was " not a massive force " and that the israelis withdrew from one of the villages just before midday .

mastella should then in turn send it to his us counterpart . there was no comment from the milan court . the case threatens to further sour relations between italy and the united states after the decision by romano prodi 's left-wing government to withdraw italy 's troops from iraq . milan 's public prosecutor had already issued extradition requests for 22 of the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- agents , but they were blocked by the justice ministry of former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , a close ally of us president george w. bush . in february 2003 , the former imam , or prayer leader , osama mustafa hassan , an egyptian also known as abu omar and a terror suspect , was abducted in milan by cia agents and taken to egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu omar was allegedly kidnapped in milan by cia agents omar , who was living in asylum in italy at the time , was allegedly taken to a nearby us air base for interrogation and later transferred via germany to egypt , where he is still in prison . he claims to have been tortured in egypt . under italian law such abduction is illegal and anyone involved could face a jail sentence . scandal involves italian agents the case has rocked the italian military intelligence service -lrb- sismi -rrb- , which denied knowledge of the abduction .
an investigation has revealed that at least some members of sismi took part in the operation . the deputy head of sismi , marco mancini , and his predecessor gustavo pignero have been arrested and last week the intelligence chief general nicolo pollari was questioned by investigating magistrates in milan . la repubblica published extracts of a conversation that mancini recorded with pignero when he came under the judicial spotlight . " do you remember gustavo , do you remember that the abduction order came from the director ? "
mancini asks pignero who replies " yes " . " and do you remember that two days later i said that we could n't do that because we 're not in latin america ? "
mancini questions , to which pignero replies " yes , i remember . " state secret law to be lifted pollari has repeatedly denied any knowledge of the abduction and he said he could not reveal state secrets during his questioning last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : d 'alema said he would open state secrets in the new probe foreign minister massimo d 'alema has stressed that the government would do everything possible to help the investigation without harming the fight against terrorism .
he also said that he would lift the obligation to respect state secrets . in another twist in the long-running cia scandal in europe , a spanish judge on thursday accepted to head another inquiry into " extraordinary rendition " flights through spain . judge ismael moreno , of spain 's highest criminal court , agreed to lead the additional probe after the court requested on july 10 that more light be shed on the case . german national to give evidence in spain the court has called for people transported on the flights to be interviewed for the complementary investigation , notably german national khaled al-masri . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masri was transported through spain by the cia al-masri was seized by the cia in macedonia at the end of 2003 and mistakenly held as a terror suspect under grueling conditions in a jail in afghanistan for five months . the court has also demanded details on the personnel aboard the flights and background on flights at eight spanish airports , including those of madrid and barcelona . moreno is already investigating 10 cia flights that passed through the balearic islands between january 2004 and january 2005 . spain has " categorically " rejected allegations in a report by the council of europe that it was one of 14 european countries which colluded in or tolerated the secret transfer of terrorist suspects by the united states . council of europe on cia case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty 's investigation reveals " a spider 's web " drawn up by swiss parliamentarian dick marty , the report identified a " spider 's web " of landing points around the world used by the us authorities for the practice of " extraordinary rendition " - the undercover transfer of security suspects to third countries or us-run detention centers . eu rapporteur giovanni claudio fava alleged in a separate report released last month that the balearic islands in the mediterranean were " an important transit base . " fava said that out of 1,080 european movements of planes allegedly chartered by the cia between 2001 and the end of 2005 , 125 went through 10 spanish airports , mainly majorca and tenerife in the canary islands , although the spanish government had only recognized 27 of them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german testifies in probe into alleged cia abduction a parliamentary probe hears testimony from a german citizen , khaled al-masri , who alleged he was kidnapped by the cia and held for five months in an afghan jail .

mastella should then in turn send it to his us counterpart . there was no comment from the milan court . the case threatens to further sour relations between italy and the united states after the decision by romano prodi 's left-wing government to withdraw italy 's troops from iraq . milan 's public prosecutor had already issued extradition requests for 22 of the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- agents , but they were blocked by the justice ministry of former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , a close ally of us president george w. bush . in february 2003 , the former imam , or prayer leader , osama mustafa hassan , an egyptian also known as abu omar and a terror suspect , was abducted in milan by cia agents and taken to egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu omar was allegedly kidnapped in milan by cia agents omar , who was living in asylum in italy at the time , was allegedly taken to a nearby us air base for interrogation and later transferred via germany to egypt , where he is still in prison . he claims to have been tortured in egypt . under italian law such abduction is illegal and anyone involved could face a jail sentence . scandal involves italian agents the case has rocked the italian military intelligence service -lrb- sismi -rrb- , which denied knowledge of the abduction .
an investigation has revealed that at least some members of sismi took part in the operation . the deputy head of sismi , marco mancini , and his predecessor gustavo pignero have been arrested and last week the intelligence chief general nicolo pollari was questioned by investigating magistrates in milan . la repubblica published extracts of a conversation that mancini recorded with pignero when he came under the judicial spotlight . " do you remember gustavo , do you remember that the abduction order came from the director ? "
mancini asks pignero who replies " yes " . " and do you remember that two days later i said that we could n't do that because we 're not in latin america ? "
mancini questions , to which pignero replies " yes , i remember . " state secret law to be lifted pollari has repeatedly denied any knowledge of the abduction and he said he could not reveal state secrets during his questioning last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : d 'alema said he would open state secrets in the new probe foreign minister massimo d 'alema has stressed that the government would do everything possible to help the investigation without harming the fight against terrorism .
he also said that he would lift the obligation to respect state secrets . in another twist in the long-running cia scandal in europe , a spanish judge on thursday accepted to head another inquiry into " extraordinary rendition " flights through spain . judge ismael moreno , of spain 's highest criminal court , agreed to lead the additional probe after the court requested on july 10 that more light be shed on the case . german national to give evidence in spain the court has called for people transported on the flights to be interviewed for the complementary investigation , notably german national khaled al-masri . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masri was transported through spain by the cia al-masri was seized by the cia in macedonia at the end of 2003 and mistakenly held as a terror suspect under grueling conditions in a jail in afghanistan for five months . the court has also demanded details on the personnel aboard the flights and background on flights at eight spanish airports , including those of madrid and barcelona . moreno is already investigating 10 cia flights that passed through the balearic islands between january 2004 and january 2005 . spain has " categorically " rejected allegations in a report by the council of europe that it was one of 14 european countries which colluded in or tolerated the secret transfer of terrorist suspects by the united states . council of europe on cia case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty 's investigation reveals " a spider 's web " drawn up by swiss parliamentarian dick marty , the report identified a " spider 's web " of landing points around the world used by the us authorities for the practice of " extraordinary rendition " - the undercover transfer of security suspects to third countries or us-run detention centers . eu rapporteur giovanni claudio fava alleged in a separate report released last month that the balearic islands in the mediterranean were " an important transit base . " fava said that out of 1,080 european movements of planes allegedly chartered by the cia between 2001 and the end of 2005 , 125 went through 10 spanish airports , mainly majorca and tenerife in the canary islands , although the spanish government had only recognized 27 of them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german testifies in probe into alleged cia abduction a parliamentary probe hears testimony from a german citizen , khaled al-masri , who alleged he was kidnapped by the cia and held for five months in an afghan jail .

she deserves respect and could soon find top-level sympathizers , says dw 's peter stützle . he was ashamed of belonging to a government that did nothing while civilians were suffering .
the man who felt this way was christian schwarz-schilling , germany 's minister for postal services , and he was talking about the suffering in bosnia herzegovina.then chancellor helmut kohl accepted the resignation of his minister , who went on to play a crucial role in stabilizing the war-torn country - until this day . just like the balkan war did at the time , the current middle east conflict unsettles the german public today .
just like then , a lone member of the federal government has put her finger where it hurts .
helmut kohl must have seen schwarz-schilling 's moral position as non-political .
after all , the german government had to consider the different interests and assessments of its allies .
current chancellor angela merkel has to do the same . pai n ful compromise the g8 declaration in st. petersburg from last weekend is a compromise that was painful to reach .
it calls for the release of the kidnapped israeli soldiers and an end to the bombardment of israel , followed by an end of israel 's military operations .
that 's what the chancellor is sticking to . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul on the other hand views the israeli reaction to hezbollah 's attacks as completely inappropriate - and demands an immediate end to the bombings .
she knows from opinion polls that at least three quarters of the german population agree with her .
the three opposition parties - the free-market liberal fdp , the greens and the left party - have also criticized the israeli action , albeit in different ways . growi n g support even within the governing coalition , things are beginning to brew .
wieczorek-zeul , a member of the social democratic party 's left wing , can rest assured that many of her party colleagues stand behind her .
even her predecessor , carl-dieter spranger from bavaria 's ultra-conservative christian social union , who co-signed wieczorek-zeul 's letter calling for an immediate ceasefire , is unlikely to be isolated within his party . it should be noted that it 's the minister for economic development and her predecessor , who published this appeal .
her ministry is responsible for far-reaching development aid projects in the entire middle east - especially in the palestinian territories .
if much of this will now be ruthlessly destroyed , it will provoke great resentment among german voters .
it will be hard to convince them to use their taxes to rebuild everything later on .
political capital is also destroyed this way . angela merkel is not unaware of this .
that 's why she has not distanced herself from her minister , just like wieczorek-zeul supports the g8 declaration .
should lebanese civilians continue to suffer , the chancellor is likely to move closer to wieczorek-zeul 's point of view .

mastella should then in turn send it to his us counterpart . there was no comment from the milan court . the case threatens to further sour relations between italy and the united states after the decision by romano prodi 's left-wing government to withdraw italy 's troops from iraq . milan 's public prosecutor had already issued extradition requests for 22 of the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- agents , but they were blocked by the justice ministry of former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , a close ally of us president george w. bush . in february 2003 , the former imam , or prayer leader , osama mustafa hassan , an egyptian also known as abu omar and a terror suspect , was abducted in milan by cia agents and taken to egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu omar was allegedly kidnapped in milan by cia agents omar , who was living in asylum in italy at the time , was allegedly taken to a nearby us air base for interrogation and later transferred via germany to egypt , where he is still in prison . he claims to have been tortured in egypt . under italian law such abduction is illegal and anyone involved could face a jail sentence . scandal involves italian agents the case has rocked the italian military intelligence service -lrb- sismi -rrb- , which denied knowledge of the abduction .
an investigation has revealed that at least some members of sismi took part in the operation . the deputy head of sismi , marco mancini , and his predecessor gustavo pignero have been arrested and last week the intelligence chief general nicolo pollari was questioned by investigating magistrates in milan . la repubblica published extracts of a conversation that mancini recorded with pignero when he came under the judicial spotlight . " do you remember gustavo , do you remember that the abduction order came from the director ? "
mancini asks pignero who replies " yes " . " and do you remember that two days later i said that we could n't do that because we 're not in latin america ? "
mancini questions , to which pignero replies " yes , i remember . " state secret law to be lifted pollari has repeatedly denied any knowledge of the abduction and he said he could not reveal state secrets during his questioning last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : d 'alema said he would open state secrets in the new probe foreign minister massimo d 'alema has stressed that the government would do everything possible to help the investigation without harming the fight against terrorism .

she deserves respect and could soon find top-level sympathizers , says dw 's peter stützle . he was ashamed of belonging to a government that did nothing while civilians were suffering .

even her predecessor , carl-dieter spranger from bavaria 's ultra-conservative christian social union , who co-signed wieczorek-zeul 's letter calling for an immediate ceasefire , is unlikely to be isolated within his party . it should be noted that it 's the minister for economic development and her predecessor , who published this appeal .
her ministry is responsible for far-reaching development aid projects in the entire middle east - especially in the palestinian territories .
if much of this will now be ruthlessly destroyed , it will provoke great resentment among german voters .
it will be hard to convince them to use their taxes to rebuild everything later on .
political capital is also destroyed this way . angela merkel is not unaware of this .

but researchers in aachen have now found an alternative use that will benefit the art world . jürgen kolz stares at his screen .
the engineer at the technical university in aachen is examining a fresco that has been sent in by new york 's metropolitan museum of modern art .
in front of him sits the world 's smallest , mobile magnetic resonance tomograph -lrb- mrt -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mrt is not much bigger than a laser printer it 's about as big as a conventional laser printer .
a sensor that 's not thicker than a finger moves towards the fresco and stops just milimeters in front of the fresco .
now the real work can begin . " we 're choosing a certain point in the fresco that we want to examine and measure the specimen in various depths , " kolz says .
" the signal then gives us information about the kind of colors that were used , the thickness of the different layers and the stage of the ageing process . " no more damage to art art experts and restorers find this information immensely valuable .
the big advantage of this kind of test is that a fresco does not have to be damaged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art experts will no longer have to remove probes and examine them under a microscope so far , microscopically small probes had to be removed to examine them - a process that does n't make art lovers happy .
the mrt in aachen does away with this .
while large museums already use scanning methods , kolz says that his method is superior as it can determine the age of the colors as well . the ability to determine the age of paint layers is a valuable tool for museums .
bernhard blümich , who heads the teams of researchers in aachen , soon realized that the method could also be used to distinguish between originals and forgeries . recreati n g lost pai n ti n gs but the new technique 's advantages go beyond catching forgers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's researchers could find out if something 's hidden behind her smile " we can examine the various layers of a painting or fresco , " said federico casanova , a member of the team of researchers .
" that way we can see if there are other paintings below the surface . " in the future , the researchers will be able to reconstruct these submerged paintings by " rebuilding " them on a computer and creating a perfect copy .
the art world has already expressed interest .
aachen researchers have already scanned several frescoes and paintings in the italian town of perugia .
they will also travel to london at the end of the month to convince art experts at the national gallery that they should employ their method as well . ingo wagner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's cultural legacy on ice how much damage a fire at weimar 's anna amalia library did to germany 's cultural legacy will only be clear after a team of bookbinders in leipzig get done with their work - and that could take years . -lrb- sept .

but researchers in aachen have now found an alternative use that will benefit the art world . jürgen kolz stares at his screen .
the engineer at the technical university in aachen is examining a fresco that has been sent in by new york 's metropolitan museum of modern art .
in front of him sits the world 's smallest , mobile magnetic resonance tomograph -lrb- mrt -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mrt is not much bigger than a laser printer it 's about as big as a conventional laser printer .
a sensor that 's not thicker than a finger moves towards the fresco and stops just milimeters in front of the fresco .
now the real work can begin . " we 're choosing a certain point in the fresco that we want to examine and measure the specimen in various depths , " kolz says .
" the signal then gives us information about the kind of colors that were used , the thickness of the different layers and the stage of the ageing process . " no more damage to art art experts and restorers find this information immensely valuable .
the big advantage of this kind of test is that a fresco does not have to be damaged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art experts will no longer have to remove probes and examine them under a microscope so far , microscopically small probes had to be removed to examine them - a process that does n't make art lovers happy .
the mrt in aachen does away with this .
while large museums already use scanning methods , kolz says that his method is superior as it can determine the age of the colors as well . the ability to determine the age of paint layers is a valuable tool for museums .
bernhard blümich , who heads the teams of researchers in aachen , soon realized that the method could also be used to distinguish between originals and forgeries . recreati n g lost pai n ti n gs but the new technique 's advantages go beyond catching forgers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's researchers could find out if something 's hidden behind her smile " we can examine the various layers of a painting or fresco , " said federico casanova , a member of the team of researchers .
" that way we can see if there are other paintings below the surface . " in the future , the researchers will be able to reconstruct these submerged paintings by " rebuilding " them on a computer and creating a perfect copy .
the art world has already expressed interest .
aachen researchers have already scanned several frescoes and paintings in the italian town of perugia .
they will also travel to london at the end of the month to convince art experts at the national gallery that they should employ their method as well . ingo wagner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's cultural legacy on ice how much damage a fire at weimar 's anna amalia library did to germany 's cultural legacy will only be clear after a team of bookbinders in leipzig get done with their work - and that could take years . -lrb- sept .
8 , 2004 -rrb- mending modern masters while restoring old frescoes and paintings has become routine work , " healing " more recent art objects made of plastics and other modern substances is more tricky .
germans are among the leaders in the field .

for instance , limited subsidies are being offered to employers that hire older , handicapped - or long-term unemployed workers , like those at michl 's . statistics show that the initiatives seem to be working .
in comparison to last year , the number of long-term unemployed has dropped by 30 percent .
only some 8,000 people in austria have been looking for a job for more than one year . unemployment in austria , which eurostat gave as 4.9 percent for may 2006 , is significantly lower than in germany -lrb- 8.3 percent in may 2006 -rrb- . similarities to german proposals germany has a much greater problem to tackle , as far as unemployment is concerned , but , recently , a similar solution has been proposed . germany 's secretary of labor franz müntefering presented this week to parliament a combined wage proposal for job seekers over the age of 50 .
age can be a disadvantage in the job market , particularly for those looking for a way back into it . the new 50 plus initiative , meant to take effect on january 1 , 2007 , is designed to ease this transition back to the work force by encouraging older job seekers to accept lower paying positions .

one of the chefs at michl 's , for instance , is in his mid-20s and even completed an apprenticeship before enduring a three-year period of unemployment . possible extension of 50 plus to under 25 münterfering said this week in an interview with " handelsblatt " that he hopes to discuss a similar subsidy project for the unemployed and underemployed under the age of 25 . before that , he 'll have to convince critics - both within in own social democratic party and among the opposition - that the current 50-plus initiative will work .

austria already has a successful wage subsidy program in place .
can it work in germany too ? a blend of dark and light wood , modern simplicity combined with high ornate ceilings - michl 's restaurant in downtown vienna is a chic location for any business lunch or evening out . eierschwammerl , wiener kartoffelsuppe and rindsbraten are just a few of the local specialties on offer at the one-year-old café .
but michl 's , named for vienna 's mayor michael häupl , is not just another eatery . as part of a new social gastronomy project , all of michl 's 35 employees have something in common : they were unemployed for a long time before joining the staff . " i was unemployed for a few years , and then i was afraid that i would n't be able to get back in to the whole thing , but i was surprised how quickly things worked out , " said a 53-year-old michl 's employee called fritz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a combined wage subsidy encourages the unemployed to accept a lower paying job already seeing progress he has good reason to be in high spirits .
within only a year of operation , 10 formerly unemployed michl 's employees have succeeded in finding positions on the open market . " i 've finally sent a few job applications , some companies have n't responded yet and i 've gotten a couple of rejections , " continued fritz , " but i know that something will work out . " the austrian government has recently gotten involved on the fringes of the job market .
for instance , limited subsidies are being offered to employers that hire older , handicapped - or long-term unemployed workers , like those at michl 's . statistics show that the initiatives seem to be working .
in comparison to last year , the number of long-term unemployed has dropped by 30 percent .
only some 8,000 people in austria have been looking for a job for more than one year . unemployment in austria , which eurostat gave as 4.9 percent for may 2006 , is significantly lower than in germany -lrb- 8.3 percent in may 2006 -rrb- . similarities to german proposals germany has a much greater problem to tackle , as far as unemployment is concerned , but , recently , a similar solution has been proposed . germany 's secretary of labor franz müntefering presented this week to parliament a combined wage proposal for job seekers over the age of 50 .
age can be a disadvantage in the job market , particularly for those looking for a way back into it . the new 50 plus initiative , meant to take effect on january 1 , 2007 , is designed to ease this transition back to the work force by encouraging older job seekers to accept lower paying positions .
those who qualify would receive 50 percent of the difference between their last paycheck and their new one for the first year , 30 percent of the difference in the second year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz münterfering -lrb- spd -rrb- has some convincing to do to push through the 50 plus initiative employer benefits encourage companies to hire 50-plus job seekers who 've been on welfare .
the labor secretary is confident that the employment subsidy initiative will create 100,000 new jobs . austria 's wage subsidies are not age-based .
one of the chefs at michl 's , for instance , is in his mid-20s and even completed an apprenticeship before enduring a three-year period of unemployment . possible extension of 50 plus to under 25 münterfering said this week in an interview with " handelsblatt " that he hopes to discuss a similar subsidy project for the unemployed and underemployed under the age of 25 . before that , he 'll have to convince critics - both within in own social democratic party and among the opposition - that the current 50-plus initiative will work .
it 's been labeled uncreative by the harsher critics . demographic differences prevent a one-to-one exchange between germany and austria .
nevertheless , perhaps germany can take a look at the recent success of its smaller eastern neighbor and gather a few tips . gerwald herter / dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de workers over 40 : " diamonds in the rough " in spite of high unemployment in germany , a cologne-based company is trying to help place the unemployed over 40 , arguing that their age gives them an advantage in knowledge and experience .

it said the disclosure threatens to anger arab governments and others because of the appearance that the us is actively aiding the israeli bombing campaign in a way that could be compared to iranian efforts to arm and resupply hezbollah . tehran denies that it arms hezbollah , saying it gives only moral support to the shiite movement . israel 's air war far from over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while a land offensive is prepared , bombs still rain down israel 's request for rush delivery of the satellite- and laser-guided bombs was described as unusual by some military officers , and an indication that israel still had a long list of targets to strike in lebanon , the paper said . israel said its aircraft had hit 150 targets inside lebanon in the 24 hours to saturday morning , including a dozen roads linking lebanon to neighboring syria as well as suspected hezbollah positions . lebanon has said its army is ready to go into battle if israel invades , which would sharply raise the stakes in a conflict that in just 10 days has killed close to 340 people , mostly civilians , in lebanon and displaced more than half a million . " the lebanese army will resist and defend the country and prove that it is an army worthy of respect , " said defense minister elias murr , whose forces have so far stood on the sidelines of the conflict . israel would invade " without a thought " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel prepares to take on hezbollah in lebanon israeli defense minister amir peretz had warned that israel would launch a full-scale ground invasion " without thinking twice " if necessary to crush hezbollah , which has long been a thorn in its side . but british foreign secretary margaret beckett , who has drawn arab criticism for failing to back un calls for a ceasefire , warned israel of the dangers of a full-scale invasion . she told the financial times the " very dangerous situation " could be at a turning point where " a miscalculation , a mistake could have dramatic effects and that i find deeply alarming . " but an israeli military spokesman said ground operations would be necessary to stop hezbollah rocket fire on israel , and that a major ground attack had not been ruled out . ground operations in lebanon were " indispensable because the air force can not always destroy underground bunkers dug by hezbollah , which has put in place an entire fortified network , " military spokesman captain yaacov dalal said . reservists called up ; tanks massing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redeployed troops arrive from the west bank and gaza some 3,000 reservists had already been called up to " clean up the border zone on the lebanese side by limited operations aiming to destroy hezbollah 's infrastructure , " he added . israeli police and army said " a number " of rockets landed in northern israel on saturday without causing casualties , despite a direct hit on a home in carmiel . the israeli military confirmed that ground forces had held positions in two villages in southern lebanon for several days but a un spokesman said it was " not a massive force " and that the israelis withdrew from one of the villages just before midday .

mastella should then in turn send it to his us counterpart . there was no comment from the milan court . the case threatens to further sour relations between italy and the united states after the decision by romano prodi 's left-wing government to withdraw italy 's troops from iraq . milan 's public prosecutor had already issued extradition requests for 22 of the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- agents , but they were blocked by the justice ministry of former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , a close ally of us president george w. bush . in february 2003 , the former imam , or prayer leader , osama mustafa hassan , an egyptian also known as abu omar and a terror suspect , was abducted in milan by cia agents and taken to egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu omar was allegedly kidnapped in milan by cia agents omar , who was living in asylum in italy at the time , was allegedly taken to a nearby us air base for interrogation and later transferred via germany to egypt , where he is still in prison . he claims to have been tortured in egypt . under italian law such abduction is illegal and anyone involved could face a jail sentence . scandal involves italian agents the case has rocked the italian military intelligence service -lrb- sismi -rrb- , which denied knowledge of the abduction .
an investigation has revealed that at least some members of sismi took part in the operation . the deputy head of sismi , marco mancini , and his predecessor gustavo pignero have been arrested and last week the intelligence chief general nicolo pollari was questioned by investigating magistrates in milan . la repubblica published extracts of a conversation that mancini recorded with pignero when he came under the judicial spotlight . " do you remember gustavo , do you remember that the abduction order came from the director ? "
mancini asks pignero who replies " yes " . " and do you remember that two days later i said that we could n't do that because we 're not in latin america ? "
mancini questions , to which pignero replies " yes , i remember . " state secret law to be lifted pollari has repeatedly denied any knowledge of the abduction and he said he could not reveal state secrets during his questioning last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : d 'alema said he would open state secrets in the new probe foreign minister massimo d 'alema has stressed that the government would do everything possible to help the investigation without harming the fight against terrorism .
he also said that he would lift the obligation to respect state secrets . in another twist in the long-running cia scandal in europe , a spanish judge on thursday accepted to head another inquiry into " extraordinary rendition " flights through spain . judge ismael moreno , of spain 's highest criminal court , agreed to lead the additional probe after the court requested on july 10 that more light be shed on the case . german national to give evidence in spain the court has called for people transported on the flights to be interviewed for the complementary investigation , notably german national khaled al-masri . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masri was transported through spain by the cia al-masri was seized by the cia in macedonia at the end of 2003 and mistakenly held as a terror suspect under grueling conditions in a jail in afghanistan for five months . the court has also demanded details on the personnel aboard the flights and background on flights at eight spanish airports , including those of madrid and barcelona . moreno is already investigating 10 cia flights that passed through the balearic islands between january 2004 and january 2005 . spain has " categorically " rejected allegations in a report by the council of europe that it was one of 14 european countries which colluded in or tolerated the secret transfer of terrorist suspects by the united states . council of europe on cia case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty 's investigation reveals " a spider 's web " drawn up by swiss parliamentarian dick marty , the report identified a " spider 's web " of landing points around the world used by the us authorities for the practice of " extraordinary rendition " - the undercover transfer of security suspects to third countries or us-run detention centers . eu rapporteur giovanni claudio fava alleged in a separate report released last month that the balearic islands in the mediterranean were " an important transit base . " fava said that out of 1,080 european movements of planes allegedly chartered by the cia between 2001 and the end of 2005 , 125 went through 10 spanish airports , mainly majorca and tenerife in the canary islands , although the spanish government had only recognized 27 of them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german testifies in probe into alleged cia abduction a parliamentary probe hears testimony from a german citizen , khaled al-masri , who alleged he was kidnapped by the cia and held for five months in an afghan jail .

but researchers in aachen have now found an alternative use that will benefit the art world . jürgen kolz stares at his screen .
the engineer at the technical university in aachen is examining a fresco that has been sent in by new york 's metropolitan museum of modern art .
in front of him sits the world 's smallest , mobile magnetic resonance tomograph -lrb- mrt -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mrt is not much bigger than a laser printer it 's about as big as a conventional laser printer .
a sensor that 's not thicker than a finger moves towards the fresco and stops just milimeters in front of the fresco .
now the real work can begin . " we 're choosing a certain point in the fresco that we want to examine and measure the specimen in various depths , " kolz says .
" the signal then gives us information about the kind of colors that were used , the thickness of the different layers and the stage of the ageing process . " no more damage to art art experts and restorers find this information immensely valuable .
the big advantage of this kind of test is that a fresco does not have to be damaged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art experts will no longer have to remove probes and examine them under a microscope so far , microscopically small probes had to be removed to examine them - a process that does n't make art lovers happy .
the mrt in aachen does away with this .
while large museums already use scanning methods , kolz says that his method is superior as it can determine the age of the colors as well . the ability to determine the age of paint layers is a valuable tool for museums .
bernhard blümich , who heads the teams of researchers in aachen , soon realized that the method could also be used to distinguish between originals and forgeries . recreati n g lost pai n ti n gs but the new technique 's advantages go beyond catching forgers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's researchers could find out if something 's hidden behind her smile " we can examine the various layers of a painting or fresco , " said federico casanova , a member of the team of researchers .
" that way we can see if there are other paintings below the surface . " in the future , the researchers will be able to reconstruct these submerged paintings by " rebuilding " them on a computer and creating a perfect copy .
the art world has already expressed interest .
aachen researchers have already scanned several frescoes and paintings in the italian town of perugia .
they will also travel to london at the end of the month to convince art experts at the national gallery that they should employ their method as well . ingo wagner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's cultural legacy on ice how much damage a fire at weimar 's anna amalia library did to germany 's cultural legacy will only be clear after a team of bookbinders in leipzig get done with their work - and that could take years . -lrb- sept .

now the real work can begin . " we 're choosing a certain point in the fresco that we want to examine and measure the specimen in various depths , " kolz says .
" the signal then gives us information about the kind of colors that were used , the thickness of the different layers and the stage of the ageing process . " no more damage to art art experts and restorers find this information immensely valuable .
the big advantage of this kind of test is that a fresco does not have to be damaged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art experts will no longer have to remove probes and examine them under a microscope so far , microscopically small probes had to be removed to examine them - a process that does n't make art lovers happy .
the mrt in aachen does away with this .
while large museums already use scanning methods , kolz says that his method is superior as it can determine the age of the colors as well . the ability to determine the age of paint layers is a valuable tool for museums .
bernhard blümich , who heads the teams of researchers in aachen , soon realized that the method could also be used to distinguish between originals and forgeries . recreati n g lost pai n ti n gs but the new technique 's advantages go beyond catching forgers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's researchers could find out if something 's hidden behind her smile " we can examine the various layers of a painting or fresco , " said federico casanova , a member of the team of researchers .
" that way we can see if there are other paintings below the surface . " in the future , the researchers will be able to reconstruct these submerged paintings by " rebuilding " them on a computer and creating a perfect copy .
the art world has already expressed interest .
aachen researchers have already scanned several frescoes and paintings in the italian town of perugia .
they will also travel to london at the end of the month to convince art experts at the national gallery that they should employ their method as well . ingo wagner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's cultural legacy on ice how much damage a fire at weimar 's anna amalia library did to germany 's cultural legacy will only be clear after a team of bookbinders in leipzig get done with their work - and that could take years . -lrb- sept .

austria already has a successful wage subsidy program in place .
can it work in germany too ? a blend of dark and light wood , modern simplicity combined with high ornate ceilings - michl 's restaurant in downtown vienna is a chic location for any business lunch or evening out . eierschwammerl , wiener kartoffelsuppe and rindsbraten are just a few of the local specialties on offer at the one-year-old café .
but michl 's , named for vienna 's mayor michael häupl , is not just another eatery . as part of a new social gastronomy project , all of michl 's 35 employees have something in common : they were unemployed for a long time before joining the staff . " i was unemployed for a few years , and then i was afraid that i would n't be able to get back in to the whole thing , but i was surprised how quickly things worked out , " said a 53-year-old michl 's employee called fritz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a combined wage subsidy encourages the unemployed to accept a lower paying job already seeing progress he has good reason to be in high spirits .
within only a year of operation , 10 formerly unemployed michl 's employees have succeeded in finding positions on the open market . " i 've finally sent a few job applications , some companies have n't responded yet and i 've gotten a couple of rejections , " continued fritz , " but i know that something will work out . " the austrian government has recently gotten involved on the fringes of the job market .
for instance , limited subsidies are being offered to employers that hire older , handicapped - or long-term unemployed workers , like those at michl 's . statistics show that the initiatives seem to be working .
in comparison to last year , the number of long-term unemployed has dropped by 30 percent .
only some 8,000 people in austria have been looking for a job for more than one year . unemployment in austria , which eurostat gave as 4.9 percent for may 2006 , is significantly lower than in germany -lrb- 8.3 percent in may 2006 -rrb- . similarities to german proposals germany has a much greater problem to tackle , as far as unemployment is concerned , but , recently , a similar solution has been proposed . germany 's secretary of labor franz müntefering presented this week to parliament a combined wage proposal for job seekers over the age of 50 .
age can be a disadvantage in the job market , particularly for those looking for a way back into it . the new 50 plus initiative , meant to take effect on january 1 , 2007 , is designed to ease this transition back to the work force by encouraging older job seekers to accept lower paying positions .
those who qualify would receive 50 percent of the difference between their last paycheck and their new one for the first year , 30 percent of the difference in the second year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz münterfering -lrb- spd -rrb- has some convincing to do to push through the 50 plus initiative employer benefits encourage companies to hire 50-plus job seekers who 've been on welfare .
the labor secretary is confident that the employment subsidy initiative will create 100,000 new jobs . austria 's wage subsidies are not age-based .
one of the chefs at michl 's , for instance , is in his mid-20s and even completed an apprenticeship before enduring a three-year period of unemployment . possible extension of 50 plus to under 25 münterfering said this week in an interview with " handelsblatt " that he hopes to discuss a similar subsidy project for the unemployed and underemployed under the age of 25 . before that , he 'll have to convince critics - both within in own social democratic party and among the opposition - that the current 50-plus initiative will work .
it 's been labeled uncreative by the harsher critics . demographic differences prevent a one-to-one exchange between germany and austria .
nevertheless , perhaps germany can take a look at the recent success of its smaller eastern neighbor and gather a few tips . gerwald herter / dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de workers over 40 : " diamonds in the rough " in spite of high unemployment in germany , a cologne-based company is trying to help place the unemployed over 40 , arguing that their age gives them an advantage in knowledge and experience .

" up until now cyprus has been basically left alone and unassisted in its effort to help so many thousands of people , " cypriot government spokesman christodoulos pashardes told reporters . " this astonishingly large number is already challenging our acknowledged success so far and testing our infrastructure and the ability of cyprus to effectively respond to this serious humanitarian problem , " he added . cyprus has called for the immediate intervention of other countries , especially from the eu , to help it handle the thousands of people from poorer countries who need to be swiftly repatriated . its key request is to make more aircraft available , especially for third country nationals . holiday island in demand asian countries such as the philippines , sri lanka and india , which have thousands of expat workers who need evacuating , have all requested cyprus ' help in organizing the escape of their nationals from the bloodshed . " we are in a dilemma , " foreign minister george lillikas told state radio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of evacuees are arriving hourly " we either continue our humanitarian effort with the means we have or do what others do and not allow non-europeans to use cyprus ... we would rather that never happens , " he added . with an estimated 70,000 evacuees expected to pass through cyprus , any gridlock in the repatriation process would seriously strain the island 's limited resources . war coincides with peak tourist season violence in lebanon has coincided with the peak of the tourism season , meaning accommodation facilities and flights are scarce . nicosia 's call for help came on a day the island recorded the largest influx of evacuees , from 50 different countries , since the pounding of beirut began on july 12 . british , indian and us warships were among an international flotilla of cruise liners and ferries bringing more than 6,000 foreign nationals to the ports of larnaca and limassol before lunchtime friday . almost as many more are expected to reach cyprus shores before the next sunrise . cyprus seeking fast-track departures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus wants to move evacuees on as soon as possible cyprus has only provided its facilities as a transit point and is demanding more aircraft to enable fast-track departures so incoming evacuees stay no longer than eight hours if possible . among the fresh batch of weary evacuees to come ashore were 608 indian nationals on the destroyer ins mumbai , the only ship in india 's task force to be allowed access to beirut by the israeli military . two air india chartered 747 boeings were waiting on the tarmac at larnaca and flew them out later friday . cyprus welcomed thousands of lebanese seeking safe refuge during the civil war years of 1975-1990 . emergency accomodation needed both larnaca and limassol on the south coast are seeing a record number of ships and passengers dock at its ports while air traffic over larnaca is also breaking new records . britain and america are having to make contingency plans to temporarily house the thousands of evacuees sea-lifted to cyprus . more than 3,000 americans and around 2,500-odd britons have arrived on vessels ranging from a navy destroyer to top end luxury liners boasting creature comforts usually associated with caribbean cruises . a makeshift transit camp holding up to 1,000 us citizens has been established at the state fair ground in nicosia while british military bases are looking at contingency plans to erect tents for those who can not leave straight away . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a german minister 's popular dissent on lebanon germany 's minister responsible for development aid has been a lone voice calling for an immediate ceasefire in lebanon .

the man who felt this way was christian schwarz-schilling , germany 's minister for postal services , and he was talking about the suffering in bosnia herzegovina.then chancellor helmut kohl accepted the resignation of his minister , who went on to play a crucial role in stabilizing the war-torn country - until this day . just like the balkan war did at the time , the current middle east conflict unsettles the german public today .
just like then , a lone member of the federal government has put her finger where it hurts .
helmut kohl must have seen schwarz-schilling 's moral position as non-political .
after all , the german government had to consider the different interests and assessments of its allies .
current chancellor angela merkel has to do the same . pai n ful compromise the g8 declaration in st. petersburg from last weekend is a compromise that was painful to reach .
it calls for the release of the kidnapped israeli soldiers and an end to the bombardment of israel , followed by an end of israel 's military operations .
that 's what the chancellor is sticking to . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul on the other hand views the israeli reaction to hezbollah 's attacks as completely inappropriate - and demands an immediate end to the bombings .
she knows from opinion polls that at least three quarters of the german population agree with her .
the three opposition parties - the free-market liberal fdp , the greens and the left party - have also criticized the israeli action , albeit in different ways . growi n g support even within the governing coalition , things are beginning to brew .
wieczorek-zeul , a member of the social democratic party 's left wing , can rest assured that many of her party colleagues stand behind her .
even her predecessor , carl-dieter spranger from bavaria 's ultra-conservative christian social union , who co-signed wieczorek-zeul 's letter calling for an immediate ceasefire , is unlikely to be isolated within his party . it should be noted that it 's the minister for economic development and her predecessor , who published this appeal .
her ministry is responsible for far-reaching development aid projects in the entire middle east - especially in the palestinian territories .
if much of this will now be ruthlessly destroyed , it will provoke great resentment among german voters .
it will be hard to convince them to use their taxes to rebuild everything later on .
political capital is also destroyed this way . angela merkel is not unaware of this .
that 's why she has not distanced herself from her minister , just like wieczorek-zeul supports the g8 declaration .
should lebanese civilians continue to suffer , the chancellor is likely to move closer to wieczorek-zeul 's point of view .
unlike in the case of schwarz-schilling , the resignation of a minister is unlikely to happen . peter stützle -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe looks to mediate in raging middle east conflict along with other european nations , germany is attempting to de-escalate the raging middle east conflict amid fears the crisis could explode into a regional war .

but researchers in aachen have now found an alternative use that will benefit the art world . jürgen kolz stares at his screen .
the engineer at the technical university in aachen is examining a fresco that has been sent in by new york 's metropolitan museum of modern art .
in front of him sits the world 's smallest , mobile magnetic resonance tomograph -lrb- mrt -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mrt is not much bigger than a laser printer it 's about as big as a conventional laser printer .
a sensor that 's not thicker than a finger moves towards the fresco and stops just milimeters in front of the fresco .
now the real work can begin . " we 're choosing a certain point in the fresco that we want to examine and measure the specimen in various depths , " kolz says .
" the signal then gives us information about the kind of colors that were used , the thickness of the different layers and the stage of the ageing process . " no more damage to art art experts and restorers find this information immensely valuable .
the big advantage of this kind of test is that a fresco does not have to be damaged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art experts will no longer have to remove probes and examine them under a microscope so far , microscopically small probes had to be removed to examine them - a process that does n't make art lovers happy .
the mrt in aachen does away with this .
while large museums already use scanning methods , kolz says that his method is superior as it can determine the age of the colors as well . the ability to determine the age of paint layers is a valuable tool for museums .
bernhard blümich , who heads the teams of researchers in aachen , soon realized that the method could also be used to distinguish between originals and forgeries . recreati n g lost pai n ti n gs but the new technique 's advantages go beyond catching forgers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's researchers could find out if something 's hidden behind her smile " we can examine the various layers of a painting or fresco , " said federico casanova , a member of the team of researchers .
" that way we can see if there are other paintings below the surface . " in the future , the researchers will be able to reconstruct these submerged paintings by " rebuilding " them on a computer and creating a perfect copy .
the art world has already expressed interest .
aachen researchers have already scanned several frescoes and paintings in the italian town of perugia .
they will also travel to london at the end of the month to convince art experts at the national gallery that they should employ their method as well . ingo wagner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's cultural legacy on ice how much damage a fire at weimar 's anna amalia library did to germany 's cultural legacy will only be clear after a team of bookbinders in leipzig get done with their work - and that could take years . -lrb- sept .

but michl 's , named for vienna 's mayor michael häupl , is not just another eatery . as part of a new social gastronomy project , all of michl 's 35 employees have something in common : they were unemployed for a long time before joining the staff . " i was unemployed for a few years , and then i was afraid that i would n't be able to get back in to the whole thing , but i was surprised how quickly things worked out , " said a 53-year-old michl 's employee called fritz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a combined wage subsidy encourages the unemployed to accept a lower paying job already seeing progress he has good reason to be in high spirits .
within only a year of operation , 10 formerly unemployed michl 's employees have succeeded in finding positions on the open market . " i 've finally sent a few job applications , some companies have n't responded yet and i 've gotten a couple of rejections , " continued fritz , " but i know that something will work out . " the austrian government has recently gotten involved on the fringes of the job market .
for instance , limited subsidies are being offered to employers that hire older , handicapped - or long-term unemployed workers , like those at michl 's . statistics show that the initiatives seem to be working .
in comparison to last year , the number of long-term unemployed has dropped by 30 percent .
only some 8,000 people in austria have been looking for a job for more than one year . unemployment in austria , which eurostat gave as 4.9 percent for may 2006 , is significantly lower than in germany -lrb- 8.3 percent in may 2006 -rrb- . similarities to german proposals germany has a much greater problem to tackle , as far as unemployment is concerned , but , recently , a similar solution has been proposed . germany 's secretary of labor franz müntefering presented this week to parliament a combined wage proposal for job seekers over the age of 50 .
age can be a disadvantage in the job market , particularly for those looking for a way back into it . the new 50 plus initiative , meant to take effect on january 1 , 2007 , is designed to ease this transition back to the work force by encouraging older job seekers to accept lower paying positions .
those who qualify would receive 50 percent of the difference between their last paycheck and their new one for the first year , 30 percent of the difference in the second year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz münterfering -lrb- spd -rrb- has some convincing to do to push through the 50 plus initiative employer benefits encourage companies to hire 50-plus job seekers who 've been on welfare .
the labor secretary is confident that the employment subsidy initiative will create 100,000 new jobs . austria 's wage subsidies are not age-based .
one of the chefs at michl 's , for instance , is in his mid-20s and even completed an apprenticeship before enduring a three-year period of unemployment . possible extension of 50 plus to under 25 münterfering said this week in an interview with " handelsblatt " that he hopes to discuss a similar subsidy project for the unemployed and underemployed under the age of 25 . before that , he 'll have to convince critics - both within in own social democratic party and among the opposition - that the current 50-plus initiative will work .

mastella should then in turn send it to his us counterpart . there was no comment from the milan court . the case threatens to further sour relations between italy and the united states after the decision by romano prodi 's left-wing government to withdraw italy 's troops from iraq . milan 's public prosecutor had already issued extradition requests for 22 of the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- agents , but they were blocked by the justice ministry of former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , a close ally of us president george w. bush . in february 2003 , the former imam , or prayer leader , osama mustafa hassan , an egyptian also known as abu omar and a terror suspect , was abducted in milan by cia agents and taken to egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu omar was allegedly kidnapped in milan by cia agents omar , who was living in asylum in italy at the time , was allegedly taken to a nearby us air base for interrogation and later transferred via germany to egypt , where he is still in prison . he claims to have been tortured in egypt . under italian law such abduction is illegal and anyone involved could face a jail sentence . scandal involves italian agents the case has rocked the italian military intelligence service -lrb- sismi -rrb- , which denied knowledge of the abduction .
an investigation has revealed that at least some members of sismi took part in the operation . the deputy head of sismi , marco mancini , and his predecessor gustavo pignero have been arrested and last week the intelligence chief general nicolo pollari was questioned by investigating magistrates in milan . la repubblica published extracts of a conversation that mancini recorded with pignero when he came under the judicial spotlight . " do you remember gustavo , do you remember that the abduction order came from the director ? "
mancini asks pignero who replies " yes " . " and do you remember that two days later i said that we could n't do that because we 're not in latin america ? "
mancini questions , to which pignero replies " yes , i remember . " state secret law to be lifted pollari has repeatedly denied any knowledge of the abduction and he said he could not reveal state secrets during his questioning last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : d 'alema said he would open state secrets in the new probe foreign minister massimo d 'alema has stressed that the government would do everything possible to help the investigation without harming the fight against terrorism .
he also said that he would lift the obligation to respect state secrets . in another twist in the long-running cia scandal in europe , a spanish judge on thursday accepted to head another inquiry into " extraordinary rendition " flights through spain . judge ismael moreno , of spain 's highest criminal court , agreed to lead the additional probe after the court requested on july 10 that more light be shed on the case . german national to give evidence in spain the court has called for people transported on the flights to be interviewed for the complementary investigation , notably german national khaled al-masri . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masri was transported through spain by the cia al-masri was seized by the cia in macedonia at the end of 2003 and mistakenly held as a terror suspect under grueling conditions in a jail in afghanistan for five months . the court has also demanded details on the personnel aboard the flights and background on flights at eight spanish airports , including those of madrid and barcelona . moreno is already investigating 10 cia flights that passed through the balearic islands between january 2004 and january 2005 . spain has " categorically " rejected allegations in a report by the council of europe that it was one of 14 european countries which colluded in or tolerated the secret transfer of terrorist suspects by the united states . council of europe on cia case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty 's investigation reveals " a spider 's web " drawn up by swiss parliamentarian dick marty , the report identified a " spider 's web " of landing points around the world used by the us authorities for the practice of " extraordinary rendition " - the undercover transfer of security suspects to third countries or us-run detention centers . eu rapporteur giovanni claudio fava alleged in a separate report released last month that the balearic islands in the mediterranean were " an important transit base . " fava said that out of 1,080 european movements of planes allegedly chartered by the cia between 2001 and the end of 2005 , 125 went through 10 spanish airports , mainly majorca and tenerife in the canary islands , although the spanish government had only recognized 27 of them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german testifies in probe into alleged cia abduction a parliamentary probe hears testimony from a german citizen , khaled al-masri , who alleged he was kidnapped by the cia and held for five months in an afghan jail .

mastella should then in turn send it to his us counterpart . there was no comment from the milan court . the case threatens to further sour relations between italy and the united states after the decision by romano prodi 's left-wing government to withdraw italy 's troops from iraq . milan 's public prosecutor had already issued extradition requests for 22 of the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- agents , but they were blocked by the justice ministry of former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , a close ally of us president george w. bush . in february 2003 , the former imam , or prayer leader , osama mustafa hassan , an egyptian also known as abu omar and a terror suspect , was abducted in milan by cia agents and taken to egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu omar was allegedly kidnapped in milan by cia agents omar , who was living in asylum in italy at the time , was allegedly taken to a nearby us air base for interrogation and later transferred via germany to egypt , where he is still in prison . he claims to have been tortured in egypt . under italian law such abduction is illegal and anyone involved could face a jail sentence . scandal involves italian agents the case has rocked the italian military intelligence service -lrb- sismi -rrb- , which denied knowledge of the abduction .

she deserves respect and could soon find top-level sympathizers , says dw 's peter stützle . he was ashamed of belonging to a government that did nothing while civilians were suffering .
the man who felt this way was christian schwarz-schilling , germany 's minister for postal services , and he was talking about the suffering in bosnia herzegovina.then chancellor helmut kohl accepted the resignation of his minister , who went on to play a crucial role in stabilizing the war-torn country - until this day . just like the balkan war did at the time , the current middle east conflict unsettles the german public today .
just like then , a lone member of the federal government has put her finger where it hurts .
helmut kohl must have seen schwarz-schilling 's moral position as non-political .
after all , the german government had to consider the different interests and assessments of its allies .
current chancellor angela merkel has to do the same . pai n ful compromise the g8 declaration in st. petersburg from last weekend is a compromise that was painful to reach .
it calls for the release of the kidnapped israeli soldiers and an end to the bombardment of israel , followed by an end of israel 's military operations .
that 's what the chancellor is sticking to . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul on the other hand views the israeli reaction to hezbollah 's attacks as completely inappropriate - and demands an immediate end to the bombings .
she knows from opinion polls that at least three quarters of the german population agree with her .
the three opposition parties - the free-market liberal fdp , the greens and the left party - have also criticized the israeli action , albeit in different ways . growi n g support even within the governing coalition , things are beginning to brew .
wieczorek-zeul , a member of the social democratic party 's left wing , can rest assured that many of her party colleagues stand behind her .
even her predecessor , carl-dieter spranger from bavaria 's ultra-conservative christian social union , who co-signed wieczorek-zeul 's letter calling for an immediate ceasefire , is unlikely to be isolated within his party . it should be noted that it 's the minister for economic development and her predecessor , who published this appeal .
her ministry is responsible for far-reaching development aid projects in the entire middle east - especially in the palestinian territories .
if much of this will now be ruthlessly destroyed , it will provoke great resentment among german voters .
it will be hard to convince them to use their taxes to rebuild everything later on .
political capital is also destroyed this way . angela merkel is not unaware of this .
that 's why she has not distanced herself from her minister , just like wieczorek-zeul supports the g8 declaration .
should lebanese civilians continue to suffer , the chancellor is likely to move closer to wieczorek-zeul 's point of view .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 22.07.2006 new german scan prevents surgery on art großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michelangelo 's " the creation " is most certainly an original , but could still benefit magnetic resonance tomographs are usually found in hospitals , where they are used to scan the human body for abnormalities .
but researchers in aachen have now found an alternative use that will benefit the art world . jürgen kolz stares at his screen .
the engineer at the technical university in aachen is examining a fresco that has been sent in by new york 's metropolitan museum of modern art .
in front of him sits the world 's smallest , mobile magnetic resonance tomograph -lrb- mrt -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mrt is not much bigger than a laser printer it 's about as big as a conventional laser printer .
a sensor that 's not thicker than a finger moves towards the fresco and stops just milimeters in front of the fresco .
now the real work can begin . " we 're choosing a certain point in the fresco that we want to examine and measure the specimen in various depths , " kolz says .
" the signal then gives us information about the kind of colors that were used , the thickness of the different layers and the stage of the ageing process . " no more damage to art art experts and restorers find this information immensely valuable .
the big advantage of this kind of test is that a fresco does not have to be damaged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art experts will no longer have to remove probes and examine them under a microscope so far , microscopically small probes had to be removed to examine them - a process that does n't make art lovers happy .
the mrt in aachen does away with this .
while large museums already use scanning methods , kolz says that his method is superior as it can determine the age of the colors as well . the ability to determine the age of paint layers is a valuable tool for museums .
bernhard blümich , who heads the teams of researchers in aachen , soon realized that the method could also be used to distinguish between originals and forgeries . recreati n g lost pai n ti n gs but the new technique 's advantages go beyond catching forgers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's researchers could find out if something 's hidden behind her smile " we can examine the various layers of a painting or fresco , " said federico casanova , a member of the team of researchers .
" that way we can see if there are other paintings below the surface . " in the future , the researchers will be able to reconstruct these submerged paintings by " rebuilding " them on a computer and creating a perfect copy .
the art world has already expressed interest .
aachen researchers have already scanned several frescoes and paintings in the italian town of perugia .
they will also travel to london at the end of the month to convince art experts at the national gallery that they should employ their method as well . ingo wagner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's cultural legacy on ice how much damage a fire at weimar 's anna amalia library did to germany 's cultural legacy will only be clear after a team of bookbinders in leipzig get done with their work - and that could take years . -lrb- sept .
8 , 2004 -rrb- mending modern masters while restoring old frescoes and paintings has become routine work , " healing " more recent art objects made of plastics and other modern substances is more tricky .
germans are among the leaders in the field .

mastella should then in turn send it to his us counterpart . there was no comment from the milan court . the case threatens to further sour relations between italy and the united states after the decision by romano prodi 's left-wing government to withdraw italy 's troops from iraq . milan 's public prosecutor had already issued extradition requests for 22 of the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- agents , but they were blocked by the justice ministry of former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , a close ally of us president george w. bush . in february 2003 , the former imam , or prayer leader , osama mustafa hassan , an egyptian also known as abu omar and a terror suspect , was abducted in milan by cia agents and taken to egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu omar was allegedly kidnapped in milan by cia agents omar , who was living in asylum in italy at the time , was allegedly taken to a nearby us air base for interrogation and later transferred via germany to egypt , where he is still in prison . he claims to have been tortured in egypt . under italian law such abduction is illegal and anyone involved could face a jail sentence . scandal involves italian agents the case has rocked the italian military intelligence service -lrb- sismi -rrb- , which denied knowledge of the abduction .
an investigation has revealed that at least some members of sismi took part in the operation . the deputy head of sismi , marco mancini , and his predecessor gustavo pignero have been arrested and last week the intelligence chief general nicolo pollari was questioned by investigating magistrates in milan . la repubblica published extracts of a conversation that mancini recorded with pignero when he came under the judicial spotlight . " do you remember gustavo , do you remember that the abduction order came from the director ? "
mancini asks pignero who replies " yes " . " and do you remember that two days later i said that we could n't do that because we 're not in latin america ? "
mancini questions , to which pignero replies " yes , i remember .

mastella should then in turn send it to his us counterpart . there was no comment from the milan court . the case threatens to further sour relations between italy and the united states after the decision by romano prodi 's left-wing government to withdraw italy 's troops from iraq . milan 's public prosecutor had already issued extradition requests for 22 of the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- agents , but they were blocked by the justice ministry of former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , a close ally of us president george w. bush . in february 2003 , the former imam , or prayer leader , osama mustafa hassan , an egyptian also known as abu omar and a terror suspect , was abducted in milan by cia agents and taken to egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu omar was allegedly kidnapped in milan by cia agents omar , who was living in asylum in italy at the time , was allegedly taken to a nearby us air base for interrogation and later transferred via germany to egypt , where he is still in prison . he claims to have been tortured in egypt . under italian law such abduction is illegal and anyone involved could face a jail sentence . scandal involves italian agents the case has rocked the italian military intelligence service -lrb- sismi -rrb- , which denied knowledge of the abduction .
an investigation has revealed that at least some members of sismi took part in the operation . the deputy head of sismi , marco mancini , and his predecessor gustavo pignero have been arrested and last week the intelligence chief general nicolo pollari was questioned by investigating magistrates in milan . la repubblica published extracts of a conversation that mancini recorded with pignero when he came under the judicial spotlight . " do you remember gustavo , do you remember that the abduction order came from the director ? "
mancini asks pignero who replies " yes " . " and do you remember that two days later i said that we could n't do that because we 're not in latin america ? "
mancini questions , to which pignero replies " yes , i remember . " state secret law to be lifted pollari has repeatedly denied any knowledge of the abduction and he said he could not reveal state secrets during his questioning last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : d 'alema said he would open state secrets in the new probe foreign minister massimo d 'alema has stressed that the government would do everything possible to help the investigation without harming the fight against terrorism .

the former lead singer of the indie band catatonia said it was " the right time to come back and play some shows " .
matthews , who grew up in swansea and pembrokeshire , went off to nashville where she met husband seth riddle , after her catatonia split in 2001 .
her three-month uk tour , which takes in the llangollen fringe on saturday , is now under way .
in an interview with bbc radio wales , the mother-of-two said her next solo album never said goodbye , to be released in august , was the " joining up of my old life ... with my present life " .
asked about why she had run off to america just when catatonia - of road rage and mulder and scully fame - were at the top , matthews said she " needed to really just take a step back from what had been going on " .
' pinch myself ' " from the age of nine i really , really wanted to make records .
and then we got the chance to do that and then the records got successful ... all of a sudden it was like ' what happens now ? '
" you get busy doing things that 's not particularly involved with music . "
matthews , 37 , opted to move to the country music capital of nashville in the us and develop her solo music .
she also met her music producer husband and they now have two children , glenys pearl y-felin and johnny tupelo jones she said the time in nashville was " almost like it was a huge dream " .
" i used to pinch myself because i was just living in a shack with no electricity , no water ... and just playing this music with all these people who were so talented , like johnny cash 's bass player and mark knopfler 's guitar player .
" they 'd just come and hang out on the porch .
it was kindda weird - like i 'd gone to heaven or something . "
even though she " ran off " four years ago , matthews and her husband still have a strong connection with wales , where they married .
" i do live in nashville but we also spend an awful lot of time in wales ... we 're here for the foreseeable future really . "
matthew started her tour in portsmouth on friday night before playing back in wales at the llangollen fringe on saturday .
it also includes gigs at the point in cardiff on monday , and also at the city 's big weekend next month .
her band was " big , loud and rude and bottom end " , matthews said .
she said it had been difficult trying to reproduce the new album live because " it 's so intimate in some respects and then so rude in other respects " .
asked if she would be playing any old catatonia hits , matthews said she had not ruled it out .
" i 'm waiting for the time they feel right .
" i 'm juggling them around , we 've been rehearsing a couple - we 'll see what happens . "

her three-month uk tour , which takes in the llangollen fringe on saturday , is now under way .
in an interview with bbc radio wales , the mother-of-two said her next solo album never said goodbye , to be released in august , was the " joining up of my old life ... with my present life " .
asked about why she had run off to america just when catatonia - of road rage and mulder and scully fame - were at the top , matthews said she " needed to really just take a step back from what had been going on " .
' pinch myself ' " from the age of nine i really , really wanted to make records .
and then we got the chance to do that and then the records got successful ... all of a sudden it was like ' what happens now ? '
" you get busy doing things that 's not particularly involved with music . "
matthews , 37 , opted to move to the country music capital of nashville in the us and develop her solo music .
she also met her music producer husband and they now have two children , glenys pearl y-felin and johnny tupelo jones she said the time in nashville was " almost like it was a huge dream " .

organisers of belladrum tartan heart festival wanted to find a green solution after 40 tonnes of rubbish ended in a landfill last year .
the green dream machine project will be launched at this summer 's event on 12 august near beauly , inverness-shire .
festival-goers will be encouraged to recycle , while some waste will be used to create a piece of art .
the effort will involve environmental groups such as friends of the earth .
' beautiful setting ' joe gibbs , of tartan heart , said the project also aimed to increase awareness about the impact of festivals on the environment .
he said : " we have perhaps the most beautiful setting in the world for a festival and it is important that we do everything we can to ensure that it stays that way . "
environmental artist john ross added : " education through art is not a new concept but it is one that works .
" this type of project in a festival setting is a great opportunity for literally thousands of people to have a hand in the creation of a piece of art . "
acts performing at belladrum include echo and the bunnymen , embrace and the automatic .
the event is expected to draw a crowd of 10,000 people .

they were demonstrating over savings at nine hospitals and hundreds of job losses , as gloucestershire hospitals nhs trust tries to save £ 40m .
after the march they assembled in montpelier gardens and heard speeches from local mps and union leaders .
the route was changed at short notice to cope with the expected crowd .
' traffic restrictions ' police warned motorists several roads in the town would be closed and parking restrictions would be put in place for the duration of the protest .
chief inspector steve radcliffe said all the necessary preparations were in place to ensure the protest passed-off peacefully with the minimum of disruption to residents and visitors to the town .
" the route has been chosen to minimise inconvenience but for about an hour some areas will be inaccessible and we 're asking people to plan any journeys to or from the town centre carefully and be patient while the event takes place . "
some disruption to bus services is also expected .

william williams-wynne 's family have occupied the peniarth estate at tywyn , north wales since henry v 's time .
but he says he will be homeless after judges dismissed his bid to appeal over his ex-wife veronica 's settlement .
after the hearing , the baronet , 59 , said : " they 've bust me .
i 'm the 20th generation of my family on the estate but this is the end of the road sadly . "
" the estate is held in a family trust and they 've increased my rent by 300 % and i just ca n't afford it .
" i 'm moving out and i 'm going to be homeless .
it 's absolutely unbelievable " he can not eat it , he ca n't go on holiday with it , he ca n't fill his car with petrol with it and he can not spend it " " william williams-wynne 's barrister the baronet added : " we are the oldest family in wales .
the estate dates back to 1412 and we were just coming up to our 600th anniversary .
we just have n't quite made it . "
the appeal court in london was told by mr williams-wynne that the divorce settlement handed to his ex-wife of 30 years by a high court judge in march was " fundamentally unfair " .
his barrister jeremy posnansky qc said before their divorce the baronet was worth about £ 1.4m.
but he was ordered to pay £ 500,000 to his ex-wife and another £ 158,000 to buy her out of the family farming partnership .
mrs williams-wynne was also awarded another £ 250,000 from her husband 's family trust , the barrister said .
light aircraft all the baronet was left with was the estate , but mr posnansky said : " he can not eat it , he ca n't go on holiday with it , he ca n't fill his car with petrol with it and he can not spend it " .
even if he sold his assets - including his microlight , motorbike , light aircraft and art collection - he would be left with an annual income of about £ 50,000 .
mrs williams-wynne , meanwhile , had emerged with " free capital " of around £ 1.5m , providing an index-linked income of £ 60,000 a year for life , the court was told . "
this is the end of everything i 've fought for all my life . "
william williams-wynne but lord justice thorpe said the baronet had at least kept " the huge benefit of his occupation of the family estate " .
mr justice bennett , who dealt with the case in march , had taken the " realistic view " that , in order to retain a reasonable lifestyle " in proportion to the advantages enjoyed by her husband " , mrs williams-wynne needed an income of £ 60,000-a-year .
lord justice thorpe said the baronet had suffered " two great misfortunes " - heavy losses on the lloyds insurance market and the contested divorce .
thr court granted mr williams-wynne permission to appeal against the high court judge 's order to pay £ 125,000 towards his ex-wife £ 350,000 legal costs .
the judges said they hoped the couple would now compromise on that issue and avoid " another disaster " in fighting their case in court .
outside court , the baronet said ; " the whole thing sucks .
i simply can not understand it .
" this is the end of everything i 've fought for all my life . "

even if he sold his assets - including his microlight , motorbike , light aircraft and art collection - he would be left with an annual income of about £ 50,000 .

william williams-wynne but lord justice thorpe said the baronet had at least kept " the huge benefit of his occupation of the family estate " .
mr justice bennett , who dealt with the case in march , had taken the " realistic view " that , in order to retain a reasonable lifestyle " in proportion to the advantages enjoyed by her husband " , mrs williams-wynne needed an income of £ 60,000-a-year .
lord justice thorpe said the baronet had suffered " two great misfortunes " - heavy losses on the lloyds insurance market and the contested divorce .
thr court granted mr williams-wynne permission to appeal against the high court judge 's order to pay £ 125,000 towards his ex-wife £ 350,000 legal costs .
the judges said they hoped the couple would now compromise on that issue and avoid " another disaster " in fighting their case in court .
outside court , the baronet said ; " the whole thing sucks .
i simply can not understand it .

william williams-wynne 's family have occupied the peniarth estate at tywyn , north wales since henry v 's time .
but he says he will be homeless after judges dismissed his bid to appeal over his ex-wife veronica 's settlement .
after the hearing , the baronet , 59 , said : " they 've bust me .
i 'm the 20th generation of my family on the estate but this is the end of the road sadly . "
" the estate is held in a family trust and they 've increased my rent by 300 % and i just ca n't afford it .
" i 'm moving out and i 'm going to be homeless .
it 's absolutely unbelievable he can not eat it , he ca n't go on holiday with it , he ca n't fill his car with petrol with it and he can not spend it " william williams-wynne 's barrister the baronet added : " we are the oldest family in wales .
the estate dates back to 1412 and we were just coming up to our 600th anniversary .
we just have n't quite made it . "
the appeal court in london was told by mr williams-wynne that the divorce settlement handed to his ex-wife of 30 years by a high court judge in march was " fundamentally unfair " .
his barrister jeremy posnansky qc said before their divorce the baronet was worth about £ 1.4m.
but he was ordered to pay £ 500,000 to his ex-wife and another £ 158,000 to buy her out of the family farming partnership .
mrs williams-wynne was also awarded another £ 250,000 from her husband 's family trust , the barrister said .

the photo shoot will take place behind closed doors .
the project emulates the work of spencer tunick , who has photographed hundreds of naked people in cities around the world .
it 's amazing how many people are up for doing this in the name of art claire morrison event spokeswoman mr devine said he was looking for nudes of every shape and size for a project " celebrating the eclectic , bohemian and artistic spirit of glasgow 's west end " .
spokeswoman claire morrison told bbc scotland 's news website : " just over 30 people are taking part , aged 21-66 , from all walks of life and include a firefighter and stonemason .
" the reaction to the appeal for volunteers was overwhelming .
it 's amazing how many people are up for doing this in the name of art .
" its a bit of a shame that more people could n't take part but maybe we 'll do something similar in future . "

but the israeli military onslaught around the southern city of tyre is so fierce , the trip is too daunting for many inhabitants .
bridges on the main road north to sidon have been rocketed by the israeli air force , forcing traffic to make detours up into the hills .
laser-guided 450kg -lrb- 1,000lb -rrb- bombs have also dug huge craters across half the highway , funnelling the chaotic melee of taxis and private cars into one painfully slow lane .
i want to get my children out of here .
but they are too scared of the bombing and i can only take them out when it is quiet lebanese father in tyre and this gives no chance for south-bound drivers heading towards tyre , many of whom say they are on humanitarian missions for people trapped in their homes by the bombing .
tempers are frayed as people wait for hours under the scorching sun , each one desperate to reach a friend or relative in need of rescue .
family fears near one of these choke points , at a sand and gravel dyke , 8km -lrb- 5miles -rrb- north-west of tyre , dozens of cars were waiting to cross the litani river - a natural obstacle between tyre and sidon in addition to the israeli-made ones now also on the way .
the journey out of southern lebanon is slow and fraught as the traffic churned through the dust and sludge , the rumble of two israeli warplanes overhead turned into a terrific snarl , as they swooped down to fire their missiles at an unseen target in the next valley .
moments later , thick grey smoke rose over the horizon and a new sense of urgency gripped the cars packed with men , women and children crossing the river to escape .
" you are british ? " one driver leaned over to ask me , as i continued to photograph his wife and seven children in his beat-up mercedes .
" tell tony blair to stop this ! " he said with feeling and his veiled teenage daughters , the eldest holding the large family koran open in her lap , nodded in agreement .
jammed highways as the plume of smoke cleared , the cars queuing up pressed on towards the north , and the next nerve-jangling choke point a few kilometres up the road .
parents are trying to take their children to safety how quickly the traffic in southern lebanon under israeli bombardment has come to resemble that in the west bank -lrb- and gaza , until last year -rrb- under israeli occupation .
the difference is that these disrupted journeys are being made to escape a terrifying air bombardment .
israel says it is doing everything to avoid civilian casualties , but will continue and indeed escalate its attacks unless the hezbollah militant group frees two soldiers it captured inside israel 11 days ago and stops its rocket attacks .
with little chance of that in present circumstances , thousands of people have been jamming the highways and mountain roads heading north .
but after saturday 's early afternoon missile strike so close to their escape route , the flow of internally-displaced lebanese dried up almost completely .
" i want to get my children out of here , " said a man who had fled from qana and is now sheltering at an emergency gathering point in tyre .
" but they are too scared of the bombing and i can only take them out when it is quiet . "
