not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the pope needs an advisor who knows the opinion , the temperature , on the streets !
has he not witnessed the uproar over the psychological operation known as the danish cartoons ?
would he dare to balance his remarks with criticism of american fundamentalist christian holy warriors ?
why not ?
how about critique of the notorious passages in the talmud ?
meanwhile the text and thrust of his very interesting and thoughtful speech has been lost due to ignorance of the tensions and motives which lurk under the landscape . - klaatu as a devoted muslim and an indonesian by birth , i strongly believe that the pontiff 's comment on islam was misunderstood by my fellow muslims .
i am always tolerant towards every religion no matter the difference of its worshipping towards the creator . - endoeng sasmito i do not expect the present pope to accomplish much in his period of papacy .
he has already started on the wrong foot and might ignite more hatred between muslims and christians . - abdul ataa no amount of intellectual sophistication can hide that in his core , ratzinger has remained a catholic bavarian village yokel . - diet simon the pope 's remarks have been taken out of context .
he actually was promoting interfaith dialogue .
the actual paragraph in question was not his words - he was quoting .
he also said he found the sentiment expressed therein a bit strong .
it is disappointing to see how muslim clerics have chosen to take the whole thing out of context , thereby using it for their own motives .
those demonstrating on the streets have likely never read the speech and have most probably been told that these were the actual words of the pope .
there are too many people out there ready to hate - sadly particularly muslims - a faith which is supposed to be tolerant and peaceful .
the pope should never apologize . - dia n a bishop , fra n ce i expect the pope to create further division between christianity and islam .
the pope 's very unfortunate remarks are going to spark a worldwide controversy that will further the hatred already seen in so many different conflicts throughout the world .
perhaps the pope is a bit delusional in his thinking .
he should apologize , and resign .
this will help build back the vote of confidence that the catholic church so desperately will need in the very near future . - christia n fiech i concur with those who believe that the present pope was referring to islam in an historical context .
these remarks have been taken out of context .
hopefully , the islamic population worldwide will carefully analyze the whole discourse and appreciate what the underlying message is . - mauree n t. couch , australia i have read the whole speech , which is very long and very complex .
the real pity is that the media only quoted one sentence .
the most interesting part of the speech was , and this is like a " fingerprint " of this pope , criticism of the " modern times " and criticism of the western " way of life . "
very interesting was the part on the " dialogue of cultures , " which can not take place if the western world excludes god from its life .
it seems to me as if the pope wanted to begin a public discussion on the legitimizing of violence on the one side , and on the role of faith and sense in our western world . - ludwig meyerhoff , germa n y it was stupid for him to quote a 14th century byzantine emperor .
open mouth , insert foot .
of course , the muslims will react badly to a denigration of their prophet and their religion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 20.09.2006 ailing music industry casts around for solutions at berlin fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's show time again : the popkomm music fair gets into the act artists and representatives of the global music industry will gather in berlin at the popkomm music fair that opens wednesday to discuss innovative ways to combat piracy and illegal downloads . more than 15,000 visitors are expected to throng the 800 exhibition booths at berlin 's international congress center for the 18th popkomm international business platform for music and entertainment .
the fair runs until sept 23 . this year 's combination trade show , conference and festival is overshadowed by plunging cd sales worldwide amidst turmoil in the music industry over new web-based music sources .
more than 2,000 musicians are converging on berlin for the event in hopes of signing lucrative contracts with major labels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popkomm brainstorms on saving the future of the music industry like every year , executives and industry experts will be huddling to come up with strategies for saving the industry .
" viral marketing " is one of those strategies , involving word-of-mouth marketing via web logs , internet forums , chat rooms and such wide-open cyber-venues as myspace and youtube .
marketing strategists cite the band arctic monkeys as an example of how to break the mould on traditional marketing .
learning from the arctic monkeys the four young brits defied conventional industry wisdom by side-stepping time-honored marketing procedures and making their music available free of charge via the world wide web .
the resulting word-of-mouth buzz propelled them to the top of the charts . the arctic monkeys thus made obsolete the traditional procedure of pressing a demo and hawking it to label executives and radio station program playlist managers .
the group cut out the middleman by starting their own homepage on the internet and offering their demo singles as free downloads .
they burned their own cds and distributed them free of charge at live gigs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british band arctic monkeys revolutionized how music is marketed unbothered by the fact that fans copied their cds and distributed them to friends , the british band seemed to accept it as a necessary step towards fame and - eventually - to fortune .
and it worked .
by the time the arctic monkeys released their debut album last january on domino records , they were so well known that british sales soared to 118,000 within days . not surprisingly , a panel discussion at this year 's popkomm in berlin is entitled " arctic monkeys business style and the future of the music industry . " until now , the conventional wisdom within the industry was that downloading music from the internet was in fact stealing from the artists .
the arctic monkeys turned that argument on its head . and as far as artists are concerned , the industry has been stealing from them all along .
artists tend to receive $ 0.25 -lrb- 19 euro cents -rrb- in royalties on a cd that costs $ 0.50 to produce and which retails for $ 15 - meaning the middlemen get most of the money . against that backdrop , executives have been discussing ways to save the " physical product , " by which they mean the cd , as opposed to web-based products , which are beyond their control . fighting piracy and illegal downloads another issue that will take center stage at the music fair is the problem of illegal downloads and piracy . german recording industry figures for the first half of 2006 will be released during popkomm and are expected to show yet another decline in sales , this time by about 3.4 per cent .
industry analysts put the first-half figure at 54.6 million albums , which , though bad , is better than they had feared a year ago . " it 's a good sign , " said michael haentjes , a german industry spokesman .
" sales are still very soft but are not off as much as they could have been .
the problem of course is the nagging problems of widespread downloads and piracy . " the bright spot in a gloomy industry landscape is the online market .
in the first half of 2005 , 7.5 million music titles were bought online in germany via itunes , musicload and others .
by contrast , online sales for the first half of 2006 are expected to top 12 million . even so , those figures are not as high as the german music industry had hoped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piracy has eaten into cd sales worldwide " piracy is insidious and is putting the brake on online sell-through , ' said haentjes .
" coming up with ways to curtail piracy is the major topic we 'll be discussing . " berlin is a high-profile venue for these deliberations because the german government is in the processing of drafting a new law that would stiffen penalties for copyright violations , extending them to include internet downloads . popkomm has invited german lawmakers to panel discussions to ensure that the industry 's concerns are covered by the wording of the new law . as the panels hold their deliberations , music-lovers will be treated to a marathon festival of live concerts offering more than 600 hours of performances by 400 acts over four nights . the fair will conclude saturday night with a gala club night featuring artists from 26 countries .

the fair runs until sept 23 . this year 's combination trade show , conference and festival is overshadowed by plunging cd sales worldwide amidst turmoil in the music industry over new web-based music sources .
more than 2,000 musicians are converging on berlin for the event in hopes of signing lucrative contracts with major labels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popkomm brainstorms on saving the future of the music industry like every year , executives and industry experts will be huddling to come up with strategies for saving the industry .
" viral marketing " is one of those strategies , involving word-of-mouth marketing via web logs , internet forums , chat rooms and such wide-open cyber-venues as myspace and youtube .
marketing strategists cite the band arctic monkeys as an example of how to break the mould on traditional marketing .
learning from the arctic monkeys the four young brits defied conventional industry wisdom by side-stepping time-honored marketing procedures and making their music available free of charge via the world wide web .
the resulting word-of-mouth buzz propelled them to the top of the charts . the arctic monkeys thus made obsolete the traditional procedure of pressing a demo and hawking it to label executives and radio station program playlist managers .
the group cut out the middleman by starting their own homepage on the internet and offering their demo singles as free downloads .
they burned their own cds and distributed them free of charge at live gigs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british band arctic monkeys revolutionized how music is marketed unbothered by the fact that fans copied their cds and distributed them to friends , the british band seemed to accept it as a necessary step towards fame and - eventually - to fortune .
and it worked .
by the time the arctic monkeys released their debut album last january on domino records , they were so well known that british sales soared to 118,000 within days . not surprisingly , a panel discussion at this year 's popkomm in berlin is entitled " arctic monkeys business style and the future of the music industry . " until now , the conventional wisdom within the industry was that downloading music from the internet was in fact stealing from the artists .
the arctic monkeys turned that argument on its head . and as far as artists are concerned , the industry has been stealing from them all along .

" a first contingent of 1,000 soldiers will leave for the middle east on thursday , breaking a postwar taboo for germany .
due to its nazi past , sending german troops to the region near israel is particularly sensitive . " there is perhaps no other area of the world where germany 's unique responsibility , the unique responsibility of every german government to heed the lessons of our past is so clear than it is here , " merkel said in a speech to the bundestag . the german chancellor also promised bundestag members she would press washington to take a more active role in the region , drawing a link between the lebanon and israeli-palestinian conflicts . other europea n n atio n s i n volved two frigates , four fast patrol boats , two supply ships and two helicopters will be deployed by germany in cooperation with naval forces being sent by the netherlands , sweden , norway and denmark . bildunterschrift : spanish marines are also part of the un peacekeeping force in lebanon german naval vessels are expected to arrive off the lebanese coast by early october , given that it takes about 10 days for ships to travel from the north sea to the eastern mediterranean . the mission 's mandate will initially be limited until aug .

" we should be no under illusions just because this is a navy mission and not a ground mission , " westerwelle said . government ministers insisted the mission would bring stability to the region and increase europe 's role as an architect of peace in the middle east . the un is deploying a 15,000-member peacekeeping force in southern lebanon under a ceasefire agreement which last month ended fighting between israel and hezbollah . co n ditio n s met meanwhile , a un spokesman said the number of un peacekeepers in southern lebanon has risen to 5,000 , meeting a condition laid down by israel for withdrawing from its northern neighbor . " we have reached the 5,000 troops , " said alexander ivanko , spokesman for the un interim force in lebanon .
" the first phase of the unifil deployment is now completed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian un soldieres guard a lebanese beach ivanko said that the initial number of about 2,000 unifil troops had been boosted to 5,000 by three new battalions from france , italy and spain . israeli forces have remained in southern lebanon for more than a month after the aug .

" the ultra-sound shows the fetus has a congenital abnormality " are the last words a pregnant woman wants to hear from her doctor .
when it does happen , she faces a difficult choice - raise a child that might require life-long care and medical treatment , or have a late abortion . technically , this is one that takes place after the 23rd week .
the most common reason is that doctors have identified anomalies and advise what 's known as a " therapeutic termination . " but with germany 's federal statistics office reporting that late abortions are on the rise , the government plans to take measures to curb the trend . the governing coalition 's parliamentary leaders , christian democrat volker kauder and social democrat peter struck , met with the heads of the protestant and catholic churches in germany , bishop wolfgang huber and cardinal karl lehmann , on tuesday .
struck said his party saw no need to change the laws regarding abortion .
the two governing parties , however , had agreed to review the legislation in their coalition agreement . disability alone no reason for abortion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abortion after 23 weeks is permitted if the baby endangers a woman 's mental or physical health before having an abortion even within the standard 12 weeks permitted in germany , a woman must first visit a counseling center - although she is not required to explain why she does n't want to carry the fetus to full term . conservatives are now calling for the introduction of the same obligatory counseling session for women considering a late termination , as well as the three-day consideration period . " a suspected disability alone does not justify a termination , " said johannes singhammer of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . the cdu has the backing of the german chamber of physicians , which supports the three-day consideration period and also proposes limiting women 's autonomy of choice . financial reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to reduce the number of abortions carried out more than 120,000 abortions are carried out in germany every year , around 80 percent of which are paid by health insurance funds or - if there are valid medical or social reasons - through social welfare schemes . further reforms to abortion legislation up for discussion are financially motivated .
a woman having an abortion does n't have to pay for the procedure .
conservatives are now proposing that women should take on at least part of the cost . " i think that the women also have to assume a share of the responsibility .
and if they are able to assume a share of the financial costs , then we need to make that possible , " said helma orosz , a christian democrat and social affairs minister in the state of saxony . but family counseling associations , like pro familia , say that plans to bill patients depending on their incomes would cause a lot of problems . " if your income is very low already , and if the amount you have to pay increases - meaning that women would have to come up with the 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- that an abortion costs on the average - then it would put many of them in a difficult situation , " said pro familia doctor christina schneider .
" i do n't believe that 's an appropriate way to reduce the number of abortions , if that 's what politicians who support this are thinking . " further factors some lawmakers say the issue is n't just about money , but also about protecting the lives of the unborn .
pro familia says experiences at its centers show that finances do not always play a key role when it comes to abortion - and that women who want an abortion will get one . doctors also fear that forcing women to bear the costs of the procedure would bring a host of other problems . " in some circumstances , women might try to save money by going to colleagues who were willing to do it on the cheap , " said matthias david from berlin 's charité clinic .
" maybe they would n't go to doctors at all , and would try to find the means for non-medical abortions .
maybe they would begin going abroad again , as they did for awhile , when women went to the netherlands because it did n't cost as much for the procedure .
from a medical viewpoint , that would not be a practice we would welcome . " boosting the birth-rate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birth rates in germany are worryingly low it is n't clear how much money the government would save if these rules go into effect .
but some ministers already know how they would spend it - trying to boost the birth rate in germany . " the money we would save could be used to provide more support for those who - for whatever reason - are trying to have a child using in-vitro fertilization , " said orosz .
" these techniques require a lot more commitment on the part of those involved , some of whom are needy , and to be fair they should also benefit from taxpayer contributions .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the pope needs an advisor who knows the opinion , the temperature , on the streets !
has he not witnessed the uproar over the psychological operation known as the danish cartoons ?
would he dare to balance his remarks with criticism of american fundamentalist christian holy warriors ?
why not ?
how about critique of the notorious passages in the talmud ?
meanwhile the text and thrust of his very interesting and thoughtful speech has been lost due to ignorance of the tensions and motives which lurk under the landscape . - klaatu as a devoted muslim and an indonesian by birth , i strongly believe that the pontiff 's comment on islam was misunderstood by my fellow muslims .
i am always tolerant towards every religion no matter the difference of its worshipping towards the creator . - endoeng sasmito i do not expect the present pope to accomplish much in his period of papacy .
he has already started on the wrong foot and might ignite more hatred between muslims and christians . - abdul ataa no amount of intellectual sophistication can hide that in his core , ratzinger has remained a catholic bavarian village yokel . - diet simon the pope 's remarks have been taken out of context .
he actually was promoting interfaith dialogue .
the actual paragraph in question was not his words - he was quoting .
he also said he found the sentiment expressed therein a bit strong .
it is disappointing to see how muslim clerics have chosen to take the whole thing out of context , thereby using it for their own motives .
those demonstrating on the streets have likely never read the speech and have most probably been told that these were the actual words of the pope .
there are too many people out there ready to hate - sadly particularly muslims - a faith which is supposed to be tolerant and peaceful .
the pope should never apologize . - dia n a bishop , fra n ce i expect the pope to create further division between christianity and islam .
the pope 's very unfortunate remarks are going to spark a worldwide controversy that will further the hatred already seen in so many different conflicts throughout the world .
perhaps the pope is a bit delusional in his thinking .
he should apologize , and resign .
this will help build back the vote of confidence that the catholic church so desperately will need in the very near future . - christia n fiech i concur with those who believe that the present pope was referring to islam in an historical context .
these remarks have been taken out of context .
hopefully , the islamic population worldwide will carefully analyze the whole discourse and appreciate what the underlying message is . - mauree n t. couch , australia i have read the whole speech , which is very long and very complex .
the real pity is that the media only quoted one sentence .
the most interesting part of the speech was , and this is like a " fingerprint " of this pope , criticism of the " modern times " and criticism of the western " way of life . "
very interesting was the part on the " dialogue of cultures , " which can not take place if the western world excludes god from its life .
it seems to me as if the pope wanted to begin a public discussion on the legitimizing of violence on the one side , and on the role of faith and sense in our western world . - ludwig meyerhoff , germa n y it was stupid for him to quote a 14th century byzantine emperor .
open mouth , insert foot .
of course , the muslims will react badly to a denigration of their prophet and their religion .
how much better to comment on the positive and loving side of islam and refer to the violent side of christianity , particularly in bosnia and between the serbs and croats , saying hostility has no place in any religion . - patty rola n d compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's apology fails to stem anger of muslim hardliners pope benedict xvi 's personal apology for hurting the feelings of muslims with a controversial speech failed to stem the anger of hardliners despite calls for calm from islamic and western leaders .

" a first contingent of 1,000 soldiers will leave for the middle east on thursday , breaking a postwar taboo for germany .
due to its nazi past , sending german troops to the region near israel is particularly sensitive . " there is perhaps no other area of the world where germany 's unique responsibility , the unique responsibility of every german government to heed the lessons of our past is so clear than it is here , " merkel said in a speech to the bundestag . the german chancellor also promised bundestag members she would press washington to take a more active role in the region , drawing a link between the lebanon and israeli-palestinian conflicts . other europea n n atio n s i n volved two frigates , four fast patrol boats , two supply ships and two helicopters will be deployed by germany in cooperation with naval forces being sent by the netherlands , sweden , norway and denmark . bildunterschrift : spanish marines are also part of the un peacekeeping force in lebanon german naval vessels are expected to arrive off the lebanese coast by early october , given that it takes about 10 days for ships to travel from the north sea to the eastern mediterranean . the mission 's mandate will initially be limited until aug .

" we should be no under illusions just because this is a navy mission and not a ground mission , " westerwelle said . government ministers insisted the mission would bring stability to the region and increase europe 's role as an architect of peace in the middle east . the un is deploying a 15,000-member peacekeeping force in southern lebanon under a ceasefire agreement which last month ended fighting between israel and hezbollah . co n ditio n s met meanwhile , a un spokesman said the number of un peacekeepers in southern lebanon has risen to 5,000 , meeting a condition laid down by israel for withdrawing from its northern neighbor . " we have reached the 5,000 troops , " said alexander ivanko , spokesman for the un interim force in lebanon .

" the minister made her comments to the stuttgarter zeitu n g , at the beginning of the 66th annual meeting of the association of german law professionals in stuttgart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries would like to give legal weight to living wills zypries wants to codify living wills , in which patients determine their own guidelines on resuscitation and the right to die , in civil law .
this will give doctors clearer guidelines for treatment , she said . legal repercussio n s should living wills be granted legal status , " if a patient is clearly opposed to a certain treatment measure , then the doctor will have to refrain from doing it . "
otherwise the physician could be indicted for assault and battery , zypris told the neue os n abrücker zeitu n g newspaper . however , zypries said demands to make people who passively assist suicide exempt from legal penalties were unnecessary . hospice group i n favor the german hospice association welcomed zypries ' position . " an explicit standardization of allowed forms of assisted-suicide has no place in criminal law , " association head eugen brysch told reporters . to do so could be mistakenly seen as a step toward the " increasing acceptance of actively assisted suicide , " he added . he agreed it made sense to make living wills an aspect of german statute law , which are already recognized in case law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much should patients decide over their own treatment ?
" the parliament has a clear duty to give living wills a legal basis , by passing it into law , " brysch said , adding that germany needs to finally allow its citizens self-determination , and allow them to right to protect their integrity through a living will . on wednesday at the stuttgart meeting , bonn-based criminal lawyer torsten verrel plans to clarify his demands to expressly decriminalize passive assisted-suicide and the shutting down of life-support systems .

" the minister made her comments to the stuttgarter zeitu n g , at the beginning of the 66th annual meeting of the association of german law professionals in stuttgart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries would like to give legal weight to living wills zypries wants to codify living wills , in which patients determine their own guidelines on resuscitation and the right to die , in civil law .
this will give doctors clearer guidelines for treatment , she said . legal repercussio n s should living wills be granted legal status , " if a patient is clearly opposed to a certain treatment measure , then the doctor will have to refrain from doing it . "
otherwise the physician could be indicted for assault and battery , zypris told the neue os n abrücker zeitu n g newspaper . however , zypries said demands to make people who passively assist suicide exempt from legal penalties were unnecessary . hospice group i n favor the german hospice association welcomed zypries ' position . " an explicit standardization of allowed forms of assisted-suicide has no place in criminal law , " association head eugen brysch told reporters . to do so could be mistakenly seen as a step toward the " increasing acceptance of actively assisted suicide , " he added . he agreed it made sense to make living wills an aspect of german statute law , which are already recognized in case law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much should patients decide over their own treatment ?
" the parliament has a clear duty to give living wills a legal basis , by passing it into law , " brysch said , adding that germany needs to finally allow its citizens self-determination , and allow them to right to protect their integrity through a living will . on wednesday at the stuttgart meeting , bonn-based criminal lawyer torsten verrel plans to clarify his demands to expressly decriminalize passive assisted-suicide and the shutting down of life-support systems .
without this , doctors ' fears of lawsuits lead to " extensive exculpatory medicine , " and an " inadequate reduction in suffering , " he told the afp news agency . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing physician-assisted death around seven million germans have written a living will .

" the ultra-sound shows the fetus has a congenital abnormality " are the last words a pregnant woman wants to hear from her doctor .
when it does happen , she faces a difficult choice - raise a child that might require life-long care and medical treatment , or have a late abortion . technically , this is one that takes place after the 23rd week .
the most common reason is that doctors have identified anomalies and advise what 's known as a " therapeutic termination . " but with germany 's federal statistics office reporting that late abortions are on the rise , the government plans to take measures to curb the trend . the governing coalition 's parliamentary leaders , christian democrat volker kauder and social democrat peter struck , met with the heads of the protestant and catholic churches in germany , bishop wolfgang huber and cardinal karl lehmann , on tuesday .
struck said his party saw no need to change the laws regarding abortion .
the two governing parties , however , had agreed to review the legislation in their coalition agreement . disability alone no reason for abortion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abortion after 23 weeks is permitted if the baby endangers a woman 's mental or physical health before having an abortion even within the standard 12 weeks permitted in germany , a woman must first visit a counseling center - although she is not required to explain why she does n't want to carry the fetus to full term . conservatives are now calling for the introduction of the same obligatory counseling session for women considering a late termination , as well as the three-day consideration period . " a suspected disability alone does not justify a termination , " said johannes singhammer of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . the cdu has the backing of the german chamber of physicians , which supports the three-day consideration period and also proposes limiting women 's autonomy of choice . financial reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to reduce the number of abortions carried out more than 120,000 abortions are carried out in germany every year , around 80 percent of which are paid by health insurance funds or - if there are valid medical or social reasons - through social welfare schemes . further reforms to abortion legislation up for discussion are financially motivated .
a woman having an abortion does n't have to pay for the procedure .
conservatives are now proposing that women should take on at least part of the cost . " i think that the women also have to assume a share of the responsibility .
and if they are able to assume a share of the financial costs , then we need to make that possible , " said helma orosz , a christian democrat and social affairs minister in the state of saxony . but family counseling associations , like pro familia , say that plans to bill patients depending on their incomes would cause a lot of problems . " if your income is very low already , and if the amount you have to pay increases - meaning that women would have to come up with the 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- that an abortion costs on the average - then it would put many of them in a difficult situation , " said pro familia doctor christina schneider .
" i do n't believe that 's an appropriate way to reduce the number of abortions , if that 's what politicians who support this are thinking . " further factors some lawmakers say the issue is n't just about money , but also about protecting the lives of the unborn .
pro familia says experiences at its centers show that finances do not always play a key role when it comes to abortion - and that women who want an abortion will get one . doctors also fear that forcing women to bear the costs of the procedure would bring a host of other problems . " in some circumstances , women might try to save money by going to colleagues who were willing to do it on the cheap , " said matthias david from berlin 's charité clinic .
" maybe they would n't go to doctors at all , and would try to find the means for non-medical abortions .

" a suspected disability alone does not justify a termination , " said johannes singhammer of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . the cdu has the backing of the german chamber of physicians , which supports the three-day consideration period and also proposes limiting women 's autonomy of choice . financial reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to reduce the number of abortions carried out more than 120,000 abortions are carried out in germany every year , around 80 percent of which are paid by health insurance funds or - if there are valid medical or social reasons - through social welfare schemes . further reforms to abortion legislation up for discussion are financially motivated .
a woman having an abortion does n't have to pay for the procedure .
conservatives are now proposing that women should take on at least part of the cost . " i think that the women also have to assume a share of the responsibility .
and if they are able to assume a share of the financial costs , then we need to make that possible , " said helma orosz , a christian democrat and social affairs minister in the state of saxony . but family counseling associations , like pro familia , say that plans to bill patients depending on their incomes would cause a lot of problems . " if your income is very low already , and if the amount you have to pay increases - meaning that women would have to come up with the 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- that an abortion costs on the average - then it would put many of them in a difficult situation , " said pro familia doctor christina schneider .
" i do n't believe that 's an appropriate way to reduce the number of abortions , if that 's what politicians who support this are thinking . " further factors some lawmakers say the issue is n't just about money , but also about protecting the lives of the unborn .
pro familia says experiences at its centers show that finances do not always play a key role when it comes to abortion - and that women who want an abortion will get one . doctors also fear that forcing women to bear the costs of the procedure would bring a host of other problems . " in some circumstances , women might try to save money by going to colleagues who were willing to do it on the cheap , " said matthias david from berlin 's charité clinic .
" maybe they would n't go to doctors at all , and would try to find the means for non-medical abortions .
maybe they would begin going abroad again , as they did for awhile , when women went to the netherlands because it did n't cost as much for the procedure .
from a medical viewpoint , that would not be a practice we would welcome . " boosting the birth-rate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birth rates in germany are worryingly low it is n't clear how much money the government would save if these rules go into effect .
but some ministers already know how they would spend it - trying to boost the birth rate in germany . " the money we would save could be used to provide more support for those who - for whatever reason - are trying to have a child using in-vitro fertilization , " said orosz .
" these techniques require a lot more commitment on the part of those involved , some of whom are needy , and to be fair they should also benefit from taxpayer contributions .

" the minister made her comments to the stuttgarter zeitu n g , at the beginning of the 66th annual meeting of the association of german law professionals in stuttgart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries would like to give legal weight to living wills zypries wants to codify living wills , in which patients determine their own guidelines on resuscitation and the right to die , in civil law .
this will give doctors clearer guidelines for treatment , she said . legal repercussio n s should living wills be granted legal status , " if a patient is clearly opposed to a certain treatment measure , then the doctor will have to refrain from doing it . "
otherwise the physician could be indicted for assault and battery , zypris told the neue os n abrücker zeitu n g newspaper . however , zypries said demands to make people who passively assist suicide exempt from legal penalties were unnecessary . hospice group i n favor the german hospice association welcomed zypries ' position . " an explicit standardization of allowed forms of assisted-suicide has no place in criminal law , " association head eugen brysch told reporters . to do so could be mistakenly seen as a step toward the " increasing acceptance of actively assisted suicide , " he added . he agreed it made sense to make living wills an aspect of german statute law , which are already recognized in case law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much should patients decide over their own treatment ?
" the parliament has a clear duty to give living wills a legal basis , by passing it into law , " brysch said , adding that germany needs to finally allow its citizens self-determination , and allow them to right to protect their integrity through a living will . on wednesday at the stuttgart meeting , bonn-based criminal lawyer torsten verrel plans to clarify his demands to expressly decriminalize passive assisted-suicide and the shutting down of life-support systems .
without this , doctors ' fears of lawsuits lead to " extensive exculpatory medicine , " and an " inadequate reduction in suffering , " he told the afp news agency . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing physician-assisted death around seven million germans have written a living will .

" a first contingent of 1,000 soldiers will leave for the middle east on thursday , breaking a postwar taboo for germany .
due to its nazi past , sending german troops to the region near israel is particularly sensitive . " there is perhaps no other area of the world where germany 's unique responsibility , the unique responsibility of every german government to heed the lessons of our past is so clear than it is here , " merkel said in a speech to the bundestag . the german chancellor also promised bundestag members she would press washington to take a more active role in the region , drawing a link between the lebanon and israeli-palestinian conflicts . other europea n n atio n s i n volved two frigates , four fast patrol boats , two supply ships and two helicopters will be deployed by germany in cooperation with naval forces being sent by the netherlands , sweden , norway and denmark . bildunterschrift : spanish marines are also part of the un peacekeeping force in lebanon german naval vessels are expected to arrive off the lebanese coast by early october , given that it takes about 10 days for ships to travel from the north sea to the eastern mediterranean . the mission 's mandate will initially be limited until aug .

" we should be no under illusions just because this is a navy mission and not a ground mission , " westerwelle said . government ministers insisted the mission would bring stability to the region and increase europe 's role as an architect of peace in the middle east . the un is deploying a 15,000-member peacekeeping force in southern lebanon under a ceasefire agreement which last month ended fighting between israel and hezbollah . co n ditio n s met meanwhile , a un spokesman said the number of un peacekeepers in southern lebanon has risen to 5,000 , meeting a condition laid down by israel for withdrawing from its northern neighbor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 20.09.2006 government discusses reducing late abortions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many , a late termination is a last resort parliamentary leaders met with church representatives tuesday to talk about reforming legislation on late abortions , as conservatives push for more stringent controls on terminations and a re-think of who foots the bill . " the ultra-sound shows the fetus has a congenital abnormality " are the last words a pregnant woman wants to hear from her doctor .
when it does happen , she faces a difficult choice - raise a child that might require life-long care and medical treatment , or have a late abortion . technically , this is one that takes place after the 23rd week .
the most common reason is that doctors have identified anomalies and advise what 's known as a " therapeutic termination . " but with germany 's federal statistics office reporting that late abortions are on the rise , the government plans to take measures to curb the trend . the governing coalition 's parliamentary leaders , christian democrat volker kauder and social democrat peter struck , met with the heads of the protestant and catholic churches in germany , bishop wolfgang huber and cardinal karl lehmann , on tuesday .
struck said his party saw no need to change the laws regarding abortion .
the two governing parties , however , had agreed to review the legislation in their coalition agreement . disability alone no reason for abortion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abortion after 23 weeks is permitted if the baby endangers a woman 's mental or physical health before having an abortion even within the standard 12 weeks permitted in germany , a woman must first visit a counseling center - although she is not required to explain why she does n't want to carry the fetus to full term . conservatives are now calling for the introduction of the same obligatory counseling session for women considering a late termination , as well as the three-day consideration period . " a suspected disability alone does not justify a termination , " said johannes singhammer of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . the cdu has the backing of the german chamber of physicians , which supports the three-day consideration period and also proposes limiting women 's autonomy of choice . financial reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to reduce the number of abortions carried out more than 120,000 abortions are carried out in germany every year , around 80 percent of which are paid by health insurance funds or - if there are valid medical or social reasons - through social welfare schemes . further reforms to abortion legislation up for discussion are financially motivated .
a woman having an abortion does n't have to pay for the procedure .
conservatives are now proposing that women should take on at least part of the cost . " i think that the women also have to assume a share of the responsibility .
and if they are able to assume a share of the financial costs , then we need to make that possible , " said helma orosz , a christian democrat and social affairs minister in the state of saxony . but family counseling associations , like pro familia , say that plans to bill patients depending on their incomes would cause a lot of problems . " if your income is very low already , and if the amount you have to pay increases - meaning that women would have to come up with the 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- that an abortion costs on the average - then it would put many of them in a difficult situation , " said pro familia doctor christina schneider .
" i do n't believe that 's an appropriate way to reduce the number of abortions , if that 's what politicians who support this are thinking . " further factors some lawmakers say the issue is n't just about money , but also about protecting the lives of the unborn .
pro familia says experiences at its centers show that finances do not always play a key role when it comes to abortion - and that women who want an abortion will get one . doctors also fear that forcing women to bear the costs of the procedure would bring a host of other problems . " in some circumstances , women might try to save money by going to colleagues who were willing to do it on the cheap , " said matthias david from berlin 's charité clinic .
" maybe they would n't go to doctors at all , and would try to find the means for non-medical abortions .
maybe they would begin going abroad again , as they did for awhile , when women went to the netherlands because it did n't cost as much for the procedure .
from a medical viewpoint , that would not be a practice we would welcome . " boosting the birth-rate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birth rates in germany are worryingly low it is n't clear how much money the government would save if these rules go into effect .
but some ministers already know how they would spend it - trying to boost the birth rate in germany . " the money we would save could be used to provide more support for those who - for whatever reason - are trying to have a child using in-vitro fertilization , " said orosz .
" these techniques require a lot more commitment on the part of those involved , some of whom are needy , and to be fair they should also benefit from taxpayer contributions . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives plan to abolish late-term abortion the christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its christian socialist union -lrb- csu -rrb- sister party have announced plans to change current abortion laws , outlawing the practice for women more than 23 weeks into their pregnancy .

" but with germany 's federal statistics office reporting that late abortions are on the rise , the government plans to take measures to curb the trend . the governing coalition 's parliamentary leaders , christian democrat volker kauder and social democrat peter struck , met with the heads of the protestant and catholic churches in germany , bishop wolfgang huber and cardinal karl lehmann , on tuesday .
struck said his party saw no need to change the laws regarding abortion .
the two governing parties , however , had agreed to review the legislation in their coalition agreement . disability alone no reason for abortion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abortion after 23 weeks is permitted if the baby endangers a woman 's mental or physical health before having an abortion even within the standard 12 weeks permitted in germany , a woman must first visit a counseling center - although she is not required to explain why she does n't want to carry the fetus to full term . conservatives are now calling for the introduction of the same obligatory counseling session for women considering a late termination , as well as the three-day consideration period . " a suspected disability alone does not justify a termination , " said johannes singhammer of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . the cdu has the backing of the german chamber of physicians , which supports the three-day consideration period and also proposes limiting women 's autonomy of choice . financial reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to reduce the number of abortions carried out more than 120,000 abortions are carried out in germany every year , around 80 percent of which are paid by health insurance funds or - if there are valid medical or social reasons - through social welfare schemes . further reforms to abortion legislation up for discussion are financially motivated .
a woman having an abortion does n't have to pay for the procedure .
conservatives are now proposing that women should take on at least part of the cost . " i think that the women also have to assume a share of the responsibility .
and if they are able to assume a share of the financial costs , then we need to make that possible , " said helma orosz , a christian democrat and social affairs minister in the state of saxony . but family counseling associations , like pro familia , say that plans to bill patients depending on their incomes would cause a lot of problems . " if your income is very low already , and if the amount you have to pay increases - meaning that women would have to come up with the 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- that an abortion costs on the average - then it would put many of them in a difficult situation , " said pro familia doctor christina schneider .
" i do n't believe that 's an appropriate way to reduce the number of abortions , if that 's what politicians who support this are thinking . " further factors some lawmakers say the issue is n't just about money , but also about protecting the lives of the unborn .
pro familia says experiences at its centers show that finances do not always play a key role when it comes to abortion - and that women who want an abortion will get one . doctors also fear that forcing women to bear the costs of the procedure would bring a host of other problems . " in some circumstances , women might try to save money by going to colleagues who were willing to do it on the cheap , " said matthias david from berlin 's charité clinic .
" maybe they would n't go to doctors at all , and would try to find the means for non-medical abortions .
maybe they would begin going abroad again , as they did for awhile , when women went to the netherlands because it did n't cost as much for the procedure .
from a medical viewpoint , that would not be a practice we would welcome . " boosting the birth-rate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birth rates in germany are worryingly low it is n't clear how much money the government would save if these rules go into effect .
but some ministers already know how they would spend it - trying to boost the birth rate in germany . " the money we would save could be used to provide more support for those who - for whatever reason - are trying to have a child using in-vitro fertilization , " said orosz .
" these techniques require a lot more commitment on the part of those involved , some of whom are needy , and to be fair they should also benefit from taxpayer contributions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 20.09.2006 ailing music industry casts around for solutions at berlin fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's show time again : the popkomm music fair gets into the act artists and representatives of the global music industry will gather in berlin at the popkomm music fair that opens wednesday to discuss innovative ways to combat piracy and illegal downloads . more than 15,000 visitors are expected to throng the 800 exhibition booths at berlin 's international congress center for the 18th popkomm international business platform for music and entertainment .
the fair runs until sept 23 . this year 's combination trade show , conference and festival is overshadowed by plunging cd sales worldwide amidst turmoil in the music industry over new web-based music sources .
more than 2,000 musicians are converging on berlin for the event in hopes of signing lucrative contracts with major labels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popkomm brainstorms on saving the future of the music industry like every year , executives and industry experts will be huddling to come up with strategies for saving the industry .
" viral marketing " is one of those strategies , involving word-of-mouth marketing via web logs , internet forums , chat rooms and such wide-open cyber-venues as myspace and youtube .
marketing strategists cite the band arctic monkeys as an example of how to break the mould on traditional marketing .
learning from the arctic monkeys the four young brits defied conventional industry wisdom by side-stepping time-honored marketing procedures and making their music available free of charge via the world wide web .
the resulting word-of-mouth buzz propelled them to the top of the charts . the arctic monkeys thus made obsolete the traditional procedure of pressing a demo and hawking it to label executives and radio station program playlist managers .
the group cut out the middleman by starting their own homepage on the internet and offering their demo singles as free downloads .
they burned their own cds and distributed them free of charge at live gigs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british band arctic monkeys revolutionized how music is marketed unbothered by the fact that fans copied their cds and distributed them to friends , the british band seemed to accept it as a necessary step towards fame and - eventually - to fortune .
and it worked .
by the time the arctic monkeys released their debut album last january on domino records , they were so well known that british sales soared to 118,000 within days . not surprisingly , a panel discussion at this year 's popkomm in berlin is entitled " arctic monkeys business style and the future of the music industry . " until now , the conventional wisdom within the industry was that downloading music from the internet was in fact stealing from the artists .
the arctic monkeys turned that argument on its head . and as far as artists are concerned , the industry has been stealing from them all along .
artists tend to receive $ 0.25 -lrb- 19 euro cents -rrb- in royalties on a cd that costs $ 0.50 to produce and which retails for $ 15 - meaning the middlemen get most of the money . against that backdrop , executives have been discussing ways to save the " physical product , " by which they mean the cd , as opposed to web-based products , which are beyond their control . fighting piracy and illegal downloads another issue that will take center stage at the music fair is the problem of illegal downloads and piracy . german recording industry figures for the first half of 2006 will be released during popkomm and are expected to show yet another decline in sales , this time by about 3.4 per cent .
industry analysts put the first-half figure at 54.6 million albums , which , though bad , is better than they had feared a year ago . " it 's a good sign , " said michael haentjes , a german industry spokesman .
" sales are still very soft but are not off as much as they could have been .
the problem of course is the nagging problems of widespread downloads and piracy . " the bright spot in a gloomy industry landscape is the online market .
in the first half of 2005 , 7.5 million music titles were bought online in germany via itunes , musicload and others .
by contrast , online sales for the first half of 2006 are expected to top 12 million . even so , those figures are not as high as the german music industry had hoped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piracy has eaten into cd sales worldwide " piracy is insidious and is putting the brake on online sell-through , ' said haentjes .
" coming up with ways to curtail piracy is the major topic we 'll be discussing . " berlin is a high-profile venue for these deliberations because the german government is in the processing of drafting a new law that would stiffen penalties for copyright violations , extending them to include internet downloads . popkomm has invited german lawmakers to panel discussions to ensure that the industry 's concerns are covered by the wording of the new law . as the panels hold their deliberations , music-lovers will be treated to a marathon festival of live concerts offering more than 600 hours of performances by 400 acts over four nights . the fair will conclude saturday night with a gala club night featuring artists from 26 countries .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the pope needs an advisor who knows the opinion , the temperature , on the streets !
has he not witnessed the uproar over the psychological operation known as the danish cartoons ?
would he dare to balance his remarks with criticism of american fundamentalist christian holy warriors ?
why not ?
how about critique of the notorious passages in the talmud ?
meanwhile the text and thrust of his very interesting and thoughtful speech has been lost due to ignorance of the tensions and motives which lurk under the landscape . - klaatu as a devoted muslim and an indonesian by birth , i strongly believe that the pontiff 's comment on islam was misunderstood by my fellow muslims .
i am always tolerant towards every religion no matter the difference of its worshipping towards the creator . - endoeng sasmito i do not expect the present pope to accomplish much in his period of papacy .
he has already started on the wrong foot and might ignite more hatred between muslims and christians . - abdul ataa no amount of intellectual sophistication can hide that in his core , ratzinger has remained a catholic bavarian village yokel . - diet simon the pope 's remarks have been taken out of context .
he actually was promoting interfaith dialogue .
the actual paragraph in question was not his words - he was quoting .
he also said he found the sentiment expressed therein a bit strong .
it is disappointing to see how muslim clerics have chosen to take the whole thing out of context , thereby using it for their own motives .
those demonstrating on the streets have likely never read the speech and have most probably been told that these were the actual words of the pope .
there are too many people out there ready to hate - sadly particularly muslims - a faith which is supposed to be tolerant and peaceful .
the pope should never apologize . - dia n a bishop , fra n ce i expect the pope to create further division between christianity and islam .
the pope 's very unfortunate remarks are going to spark a worldwide controversy that will further the hatred already seen in so many different conflicts throughout the world .
perhaps the pope is a bit delusional in his thinking .
he should apologize , and resign .
this will help build back the vote of confidence that the catholic church so desperately will need in the very near future . - christia n fiech i concur with those who believe that the present pope was referring to islam in an historical context .
these remarks have been taken out of context .
hopefully , the islamic population worldwide will carefully analyze the whole discourse and appreciate what the underlying message is . - mauree n t. couch , australia i have read the whole speech , which is very long and very complex .
the real pity is that the media only quoted one sentence .
the most interesting part of the speech was , and this is like a " fingerprint " of this pope , criticism of the " modern times " and criticism of the western " way of life . "
very interesting was the part on the " dialogue of cultures , " which can not take place if the western world excludes god from its life .
it seems to me as if the pope wanted to begin a public discussion on the legitimizing of violence on the one side , and on the role of faith and sense in our western world . - ludwig meyerhoff , germa n y it was stupid for him to quote a 14th century byzantine emperor .
open mouth , insert foot .
of course , the muslims will react badly to a denigration of their prophet and their religion .
how much better to comment on the positive and loving side of islam and refer to the violent side of christianity , particularly in bosnia and between the serbs and croats , saying hostility has no place in any religion . - patty rola n d compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's apology fails to stem anger of muslim hardliners pope benedict xvi 's personal apology for hurting the feelings of muslims with a controversial speech failed to stem the anger of hardliners despite calls for calm from islamic and western leaders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 20.09.2006 government discusses reducing late abortions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many , a late termination is a last resort parliamentary leaders met with church representatives tuesday to talk about reforming legislation on late abortions , as conservatives push for more stringent controls on terminations and a re-think of who foots the bill . " the ultra-sound shows the fetus has a congenital abnormality " are the last words a pregnant woman wants to hear from her doctor .
when it does happen , she faces a difficult choice - raise a child that might require life-long care and medical treatment , or have a late abortion . technically , this is one that takes place after the 23rd week .
the most common reason is that doctors have identified anomalies and advise what 's known as a " therapeutic termination . " but with germany 's federal statistics office reporting that late abortions are on the rise , the government plans to take measures to curb the trend . the governing coalition 's parliamentary leaders , christian democrat volker kauder and social democrat peter struck , met with the heads of the protestant and catholic churches in germany , bishop wolfgang huber and cardinal karl lehmann , on tuesday .
struck said his party saw no need to change the laws regarding abortion .
the two governing parties , however , had agreed to review the legislation in their coalition agreement . disability alone no reason for abortion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abortion after 23 weeks is permitted if the baby endangers a woman 's mental or physical health before having an abortion even within the standard 12 weeks permitted in germany , a woman must first visit a counseling center - although she is not required to explain why she does n't want to carry the fetus to full term . conservatives are now calling for the introduction of the same obligatory counseling session for women considering a late termination , as well as the three-day consideration period . " a suspected disability alone does not justify a termination , " said johannes singhammer of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . the cdu has the backing of the german chamber of physicians , which supports the three-day consideration period and also proposes limiting women 's autonomy of choice . financial reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to reduce the number of abortions carried out more than 120,000 abortions are carried out in germany every year , around 80 percent of which are paid by health insurance funds or - if there are valid medical or social reasons - through social welfare schemes . further reforms to abortion legislation up for discussion are financially motivated .
a woman having an abortion does n't have to pay for the procedure .
conservatives are now proposing that women should take on at least part of the cost . " i think that the women also have to assume a share of the responsibility .
and if they are able to assume a share of the financial costs , then we need to make that possible , " said helma orosz , a christian democrat and social affairs minister in the state of saxony . but family counseling associations , like pro familia , say that plans to bill patients depending on their incomes would cause a lot of problems . " if your income is very low already , and if the amount you have to pay increases - meaning that women would have to come up with the 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- that an abortion costs on the average - then it would put many of them in a difficult situation , " said pro familia doctor christina schneider .
" i do n't believe that 's an appropriate way to reduce the number of abortions , if that 's what politicians who support this are thinking . " further factors some lawmakers say the issue is n't just about money , but also about protecting the lives of the unborn .
pro familia says experiences at its centers show that finances do not always play a key role when it comes to abortion - and that women who want an abortion will get one . doctors also fear that forcing women to bear the costs of the procedure would bring a host of other problems . " in some circumstances , women might try to save money by going to colleagues who were willing to do it on the cheap , " said matthias david from berlin 's charité clinic .
" maybe they would n't go to doctors at all , and would try to find the means for non-medical abortions .
maybe they would begin going abroad again , as they did for awhile , when women went to the netherlands because it did n't cost as much for the procedure .
from a medical viewpoint , that would not be a practice we would welcome . " boosting the birth-rate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birth rates in germany are worryingly low it is n't clear how much money the government would save if these rules go into effect .
but some ministers already know how they would spend it - trying to boost the birth rate in germany . " the money we would save could be used to provide more support for those who - for whatever reason - are trying to have a child using in-vitro fertilization , " said orosz .
" these techniques require a lot more commitment on the part of those involved , some of whom are needy , and to be fair they should also benefit from taxpayer contributions .

" the ultra-sound shows the fetus has a congenital abnormality " are the last words a pregnant woman wants to hear from her doctor .
when it does happen , she faces a difficult choice - raise a child that might require life-long care and medical treatment , or have a late abortion . technically , this is one that takes place after the 23rd week .
the most common reason is that doctors have identified anomalies and advise what 's known as a " therapeutic termination . " but with germany 's federal statistics office reporting that late abortions are on the rise , the government plans to take measures to curb the trend . the governing coalition 's parliamentary leaders , christian democrat volker kauder and social democrat peter struck , met with the heads of the protestant and catholic churches in germany , bishop wolfgang huber and cardinal karl lehmann , on tuesday .
struck said his party saw no need to change the laws regarding abortion .
the two governing parties , however , had agreed to review the legislation in their coalition agreement . disability alone no reason for abortion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abortion after 23 weeks is permitted if the baby endangers a woman 's mental or physical health before having an abortion even within the standard 12 weeks permitted in germany , a woman must first visit a counseling center - although she is not required to explain why she does n't want to carry the fetus to full term . conservatives are now calling for the introduction of the same obligatory counseling session for women considering a late termination , as well as the three-day consideration period . " a suspected disability alone does not justify a termination , " said johannes singhammer of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . the cdu has the backing of the german chamber of physicians , which supports the three-day consideration period and also proposes limiting women 's autonomy of choice . financial reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to reduce the number of abortions carried out more than 120,000 abortions are carried out in germany every year , around 80 percent of which are paid by health insurance funds or - if there are valid medical or social reasons - through social welfare schemes . further reforms to abortion legislation up for discussion are financially motivated .
a woman having an abortion does n't have to pay for the procedure .
conservatives are now proposing that women should take on at least part of the cost . " i think that the women also have to assume a share of the responsibility .
and if they are able to assume a share of the financial costs , then we need to make that possible , " said helma orosz , a christian democrat and social affairs minister in the state of saxony . but family counseling associations , like pro familia , say that plans to bill patients depending on their incomes would cause a lot of problems . " if your income is very low already , and if the amount you have to pay increases - meaning that women would have to come up with the 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- that an abortion costs on the average - then it would put many of them in a difficult situation , " said pro familia doctor christina schneider .
" i do n't believe that 's an appropriate way to reduce the number of abortions , if that 's what politicians who support this are thinking . " further factors some lawmakers say the issue is n't just about money , but also about protecting the lives of the unborn .
pro familia says experiences at its centers show that finances do not always play a key role when it comes to abortion - and that women who want an abortion will get one . doctors also fear that forcing women to bear the costs of the procedure would bring a host of other problems . " in some circumstances , women might try to save money by going to colleagues who were willing to do it on the cheap , " said matthias david from berlin 's charité clinic .
" maybe they would n't go to doctors at all , and would try to find the means for non-medical abortions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 20.09.2006 ailing music industry casts around for solutions at berlin fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's show time again : the popkomm music fair gets into the act artists and representatives of the global music industry will gather in berlin at the popkomm music fair that opens wednesday to discuss innovative ways to combat piracy and illegal downloads . more than 15,000 visitors are expected to throng the 800 exhibition booths at berlin 's international congress center for the 18th popkomm international business platform for music and entertainment .
the fair runs until sept 23 . this year 's combination trade show , conference and festival is overshadowed by plunging cd sales worldwide amidst turmoil in the music industry over new web-based music sources .
more than 2,000 musicians are converging on berlin for the event in hopes of signing lucrative contracts with major labels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popkomm brainstorms on saving the future of the music industry like every year , executives and industry experts will be huddling to come up with strategies for saving the industry .
" viral marketing " is one of those strategies , involving word-of-mouth marketing via web logs , internet forums , chat rooms and such wide-open cyber-venues as myspace and youtube .
marketing strategists cite the band arctic monkeys as an example of how to break the mould on traditional marketing .
learning from the arctic monkeys the four young brits defied conventional industry wisdom by side-stepping time-honored marketing procedures and making their music available free of charge via the world wide web .
the resulting word-of-mouth buzz propelled them to the top of the charts . the arctic monkeys thus made obsolete the traditional procedure of pressing a demo and hawking it to label executives and radio station program playlist managers .
the group cut out the middleman by starting their own homepage on the internet and offering their demo singles as free downloads .
they burned their own cds and distributed them free of charge at live gigs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british band arctic monkeys revolutionized how music is marketed unbothered by the fact that fans copied their cds and distributed them to friends , the british band seemed to accept it as a necessary step towards fame and - eventually - to fortune .
and it worked .
by the time the arctic monkeys released their debut album last january on domino records , they were so well known that british sales soared to 118,000 within days . not surprisingly , a panel discussion at this year 's popkomm in berlin is entitled " arctic monkeys business style and the future of the music industry . " until now , the conventional wisdom within the industry was that downloading music from the internet was in fact stealing from the artists .
the arctic monkeys turned that argument on its head . and as far as artists are concerned , the industry has been stealing from them all along .
artists tend to receive $ 0.25 -lrb- 19 euro cents -rrb- in royalties on a cd that costs $ 0.50 to produce and which retails for $ 15 - meaning the middlemen get most of the money . against that backdrop , executives have been discussing ways to save the " physical product , " by which they mean the cd , as opposed to web-based products , which are beyond their control . fighting piracy and illegal downloads another issue that will take center stage at the music fair is the problem of illegal downloads and piracy . german recording industry figures for the first half of 2006 will be released during popkomm and are expected to show yet another decline in sales , this time by about 3.4 per cent .
industry analysts put the first-half figure at 54.6 million albums , which , though bad , is better than they had feared a year ago . " it 's a good sign , " said michael haentjes , a german industry spokesman .
" sales are still very soft but are not off as much as they could have been .
the problem of course is the nagging problems of widespread downloads and piracy . " the bright spot in a gloomy industry landscape is the online market .
in the first half of 2005 , 7.5 million music titles were bought online in germany via itunes , musicload and others .
by contrast , online sales for the first half of 2006 are expected to top 12 million . even so , those figures are not as high as the german music industry had hoped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piracy has eaten into cd sales worldwide " piracy is insidious and is putting the brake on online sell-through , ' said haentjes .
" coming up with ways to curtail piracy is the major topic we 'll be discussing . " berlin is a high-profile venue for these deliberations because the german government is in the processing of drafting a new law that would stiffen penalties for copyright violations , extending them to include internet downloads . popkomm has invited german lawmakers to panel discussions to ensure that the industry 's concerns are covered by the wording of the new law . as the panels hold their deliberations , music-lovers will be treated to a marathon festival of live concerts offering more than 600 hours of performances by 400 acts over four nights . the fair will conclude saturday night with a gala club night featuring artists from 26 countries .

" the minister made her comments to the stuttgarter zeitu n g , at the beginning of the 66th annual meeting of the association of german law professionals in stuttgart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries would like to give legal weight to living wills zypries wants to codify living wills , in which patients determine their own guidelines on resuscitation and the right to die , in civil law .

learning from the arctic monkeys the four young brits defied conventional industry wisdom by side-stepping time-honored marketing procedures and making their music available free of charge via the world wide web .
the resulting word-of-mouth buzz propelled them to the top of the charts . the arctic monkeys thus made obsolete the traditional procedure of pressing a demo and hawking it to label executives and radio station program playlist managers .
the group cut out the middleman by starting their own homepage on the internet and offering their demo singles as free downloads .
they burned their own cds and distributed them free of charge at live gigs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british band arctic monkeys revolutionized how music is marketed unbothered by the fact that fans copied their cds and distributed them to friends , the british band seemed to accept it as a necessary step towards fame and - eventually - to fortune .
and it worked .
by the time the arctic monkeys released their debut album last january on domino records , they were so well known that british sales soared to 118,000 within days . not surprisingly , a panel discussion at this year 's popkomm in berlin is entitled " arctic monkeys business style and the future of the music industry . " until now , the conventional wisdom within the industry was that downloading music from the internet was in fact stealing from the artists .
the arctic monkeys turned that argument on its head . and as far as artists are concerned , the industry has been stealing from them all along .
artists tend to receive $ 0.25 -lrb- 19 euro cents -rrb- in royalties on a cd that costs $ 0.50 to produce and which retails for $ 15 - meaning the middlemen get most of the money . against that backdrop , executives have been discussing ways to save the " physical product , " by which they mean the cd , as opposed to web-based products , which are beyond their control . fighting piracy and illegal downloads another issue that will take center stage at the music fair is the problem of illegal downloads and piracy . german recording industry figures for the first half of 2006 will be released during popkomm and are expected to show yet another decline in sales , this time by about 3.4 per cent .
industry analysts put the first-half figure at 54.6 million albums , which , though bad , is better than they had feared a year ago . " it 's a good sign , " said michael haentjes , a german industry spokesman .
" sales are still very soft but are not off as much as they could have been .
the problem of course is the nagging problems of widespread downloads and piracy . " the bright spot in a gloomy industry landscape is the online market .
in the first half of 2005 , 7.5 million music titles were bought online in germany via itunes , musicload and others .
by contrast , online sales for the first half of 2006 are expected to top 12 million . even so , those figures are not as high as the german music industry had hoped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piracy has eaten into cd sales worldwide " piracy is insidious and is putting the brake on online sell-through , ' said haentjes .
" coming up with ways to curtail piracy is the major topic we 'll be discussing . " berlin is a high-profile venue for these deliberations because the german government is in the processing of drafting a new law that would stiffen penalties for copyright violations , extending them to include internet downloads . popkomm has invited german lawmakers to panel discussions to ensure that the industry 's concerns are covered by the wording of the new law . as the panels hold their deliberations , music-lovers will be treated to a marathon festival of live concerts offering more than 600 hours of performances by 400 acts over four nights . the fair will conclude saturday night with a gala club night featuring artists from 26 countries .

the fair runs until sept 23 . this year 's combination trade show , conference and festival is overshadowed by plunging cd sales worldwide amidst turmoil in the music industry over new web-based music sources .
more than 2,000 musicians are converging on berlin for the event in hopes of signing lucrative contracts with major labels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popkomm brainstorms on saving the future of the music industry like every year , executives and industry experts will be huddling to come up with strategies for saving the industry .
" viral marketing " is one of those strategies , involving word-of-mouth marketing via web logs , internet forums , chat rooms and such wide-open cyber-venues as myspace and youtube .
marketing strategists cite the band arctic monkeys as an example of how to break the mould on traditional marketing .

" sales are still very soft but are not off as much as they could have been .

a european parliament delegation was in berlin to find out to what extent the german government and secret services turned a blind eye to us practices to deport detainees to other continents via european territory . the deportation of terror suspects by the cia and the involvement of european countries in such deportation cases were at the center of investigations carried out by a special inquiry panel of the european parliament in berlin on tuesday . us president george w. bush recently admitted the use of secret prisons outside us jurisdiction .
the question that europe has to clarify is to what extent governments and intelligence agencies helped the cia detain and deport terror suspects . a delegation from the european parliament 's inquiry panel looking into the issue spent tuesday talking to german parliamentarians and ngos to try to find out more about the activities of the german government and secret services regarding such deportations . germany 's european parliamentarian and panel member cem özdemir said the body wanted to " build a coalition " between national and european parliamentarians . " we believe that the members of parliaments have to work closely together in order to force our governments to cooperate , because otherwise we can not achieve our goals , " özdemir said .
lots of issues to be discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz was held in guantanamo for over four years " of course , we have some questions here in germany , " özdemir said .
" just think of the el masri case . "
german national khaled el masri was arrested in macedonia at the end of 2003 and said he was handed over to the cia , who flew him to afghanistan and wrongly held him until his release in late may 2004 . özdemir also named the case of murat kurnaz , a turkish citizen born in germany who was recently allowed to return to germany after more than four years of detention in guantanamo bay .

the question that europe has to clarify is to what extent governments and intelligence agencies helped the cia detain and deport terror suspects . a delegation from the european parliament 's inquiry panel looking into the issue spent tuesday talking to german parliamentarians and ngos to try to find out more about the activities of the german government and secret services regarding such deportations . germany 's european parliamentarian and panel member cem özdemir said the body wanted to " build a coalition " between national and european parliamentarians .

20 .
by letting 2.5 million of its kids live in poverty , germany is letting its greatest resource slip through its fingers , writes dw 's helle jeppesen . forget the conventions on children 's rights .
in germany , the fate of children is dependent on parents and the state , not on their needs or potential . kids who grow up in socially disadvantaged families often have difficulties breaking the vicious circle later in life .
a career as a welfare recipient can be pre-programmed for generations . everywhere in the world , poverty endangers people 's health and work .

20 .
by letting 2.5 million of its kids live in poverty , germany is letting its greatest resource slip through its fingers , writes dw 's helle jeppesen . forget the conventions on children 's rights .
in germany , the fate of children is dependent on parents and the state , not on their needs or potential . kids who grow up in socially disadvantaged families often have difficulties breaking the vicious circle later in life .
a career as a welfare recipient can be pre-programmed for generations . everywhere in the world , poverty endangers people 's health and work .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the pope needs an advisor who knows the opinion , the temperature , on the streets !
has he not witnessed the uproar over the psychological operation known as the danish cartoons ?
would he dare to balance his remarks with criticism of american fundamentalist christian holy warriors ?
why not ?
how about critique of the notorious passages in the talmud ?
meanwhile the text and thrust of his very interesting and thoughtful speech has been lost due to ignorance of the tensions and motives which lurk under the landscape . - klaatu as a devoted muslim and an indonesian by birth , i strongly believe that the pontiff 's comment on islam was misunderstood by my fellow muslims .
i am always tolerant towards every religion no matter the difference of its worshipping towards the creator . - endoeng sasmito i do not expect the present pope to accomplish much in his period of papacy .
he has already started on the wrong foot and might ignite more hatred between muslims and christians . - abdul ataa no amount of intellectual sophistication can hide that in his core , ratzinger has remained a catholic bavarian village yokel . - diet simon the pope 's remarks have been taken out of context .
he actually was promoting interfaith dialogue .
the actual paragraph in question was not his words - he was quoting .
he also said he found the sentiment expressed therein a bit strong .
it is disappointing to see how muslim clerics have chosen to take the whole thing out of context , thereby using it for their own motives .
those demonstrating on the streets have likely never read the speech and have most probably been told that these were the actual words of the pope .
there are too many people out there ready to hate - sadly particularly muslims - a faith which is supposed to be tolerant and peaceful .
the pope should never apologize . - dia n a bishop , fra n ce i expect the pope to create further division between christianity and islam .
the pope 's very unfortunate remarks are going to spark a worldwide controversy that will further the hatred already seen in so many different conflicts throughout the world .
perhaps the pope is a bit delusional in his thinking .
he should apologize , and resign .
this will help build back the vote of confidence that the catholic church so desperately will need in the very near future . - christia n fiech i concur with those who believe that the present pope was referring to islam in an historical context .
these remarks have been taken out of context .
hopefully , the islamic population worldwide will carefully analyze the whole discourse and appreciate what the underlying message is . - mauree n t. couch , australia i have read the whole speech , which is very long and very complex .
the real pity is that the media only quoted one sentence .
the most interesting part of the speech was , and this is like a " fingerprint " of this pope , criticism of the " modern times " and criticism of the western " way of life . "
very interesting was the part on the " dialogue of cultures , " which can not take place if the western world excludes god from its life .
it seems to me as if the pope wanted to begin a public discussion on the legitimizing of violence on the one side , and on the role of faith and sense in our western world . - ludwig meyerhoff , germa n y it was stupid for him to quote a 14th century byzantine emperor .
open mouth , insert foot .
of course , the muslims will react badly to a denigration of their prophet and their religion .
how much better to comment on the positive and loving side of islam and refer to the violent side of christianity , particularly in bosnia and between the serbs and croats , saying hostility has no place in any religion . - patty rola n d compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's apology fails to stem anger of muslim hardliners pope benedict xvi 's personal apology for hurting the feelings of muslims with a controversial speech failed to stem the anger of hardliners despite calls for calm from islamic and western leaders .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the pope needs an advisor who knows the opinion , the temperature , on the streets !
has he not witnessed the uproar over the psychological operation known as the danish cartoons ?
would he dare to balance his remarks with criticism of american fundamentalist christian holy warriors ?
why not ?
how about critique of the notorious passages in the talmud ?
meanwhile the text and thrust of his very interesting and thoughtful speech has been lost due to ignorance of the tensions and motives which lurk under the landscape . - klaatu as a devoted muslim and an indonesian by birth , i strongly believe that the pontiff 's comment on islam was misunderstood by my fellow muslims .
i am always tolerant towards every religion no matter the difference of its worshipping towards the creator . - endoeng sasmito i do not expect the present pope to accomplish much in his period of papacy .
he has already started on the wrong foot and might ignite more hatred between muslims and christians . - abdul ataa no amount of intellectual sophistication can hide that in his core , ratzinger has remained a catholic bavarian village yokel . - diet simon the pope 's remarks have been taken out of context .
he actually was promoting interfaith dialogue .
the actual paragraph in question was not his words - he was quoting .
he also said he found the sentiment expressed therein a bit strong .
it is disappointing to see how muslim clerics have chosen to take the whole thing out of context , thereby using it for their own motives .
those demonstrating on the streets have likely never read the speech and have most probably been told that these were the actual words of the pope .
there are too many people out there ready to hate - sadly particularly muslims - a faith which is supposed to be tolerant and peaceful .
the pope should never apologize . - dia n a bishop , fra n ce i expect the pope to create further division between christianity and islam .
the pope 's very unfortunate remarks are going to spark a worldwide controversy that will further the hatred already seen in so many different conflicts throughout the world .
perhaps the pope is a bit delusional in his thinking .
he should apologize , and resign .

" the ultra-sound shows the fetus has a congenital abnormality " are the last words a pregnant woman wants to hear from her doctor .
when it does happen , she faces a difficult choice - raise a child that might require life-long care and medical treatment , or have a late abortion . technically , this is one that takes place after the 23rd week .
the most common reason is that doctors have identified anomalies and advise what 's known as a " therapeutic termination . " but with germany 's federal statistics office reporting that late abortions are on the rise , the government plans to take measures to curb the trend . the governing coalition 's parliamentary leaders , christian democrat volker kauder and social democrat peter struck , met with the heads of the protestant and catholic churches in germany , bishop wolfgang huber and cardinal karl lehmann , on tuesday .
struck said his party saw no need to change the laws regarding abortion .
the two governing parties , however , had agreed to review the legislation in their coalition agreement . disability alone no reason for abortion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abortion after 23 weeks is permitted if the baby endangers a woman 's mental or physical health before having an abortion even within the standard 12 weeks permitted in germany , a woman must first visit a counseling center - although she is not required to explain why she does n't want to carry the fetus to full term . conservatives are now calling for the introduction of the same obligatory counseling session for women considering a late termination , as well as the three-day consideration period . " a suspected disability alone does not justify a termination , " said johannes singhammer of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . the cdu has the backing of the german chamber of physicians , which supports the three-day consideration period and also proposes limiting women 's autonomy of choice . financial reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to reduce the number of abortions carried out more than 120,000 abortions are carried out in germany every year , around 80 percent of which are paid by health insurance funds or - if there are valid medical or social reasons - through social welfare schemes . further reforms to abortion legislation up for discussion are financially motivated .
a woman having an abortion does n't have to pay for the procedure .
conservatives are now proposing that women should take on at least part of the cost . " i think that the women also have to assume a share of the responsibility .
and if they are able to assume a share of the financial costs , then we need to make that possible , " said helma orosz , a christian democrat and social affairs minister in the state of saxony . but family counseling associations , like pro familia , say that plans to bill patients depending on their incomes would cause a lot of problems . " if your income is very low already , and if the amount you have to pay increases - meaning that women would have to come up with the 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- that an abortion costs on the average - then it would put many of them in a difficult situation , " said pro familia doctor christina schneider .
" i do n't believe that 's an appropriate way to reduce the number of abortions , if that 's what politicians who support this are thinking . " further factors some lawmakers say the issue is n't just about money , but also about protecting the lives of the unborn .
pro familia says experiences at its centers show that finances do not always play a key role when it comes to abortion - and that women who want an abortion will get one . doctors also fear that forcing women to bear the costs of the procedure would bring a host of other problems . " in some circumstances , women might try to save money by going to colleagues who were willing to do it on the cheap , " said matthias david from berlin 's charité clinic .
" maybe they would n't go to doctors at all , and would try to find the means for non-medical abortions .
maybe they would begin going abroad again , as they did for awhile , when women went to the netherlands because it did n't cost as much for the procedure .
from a medical viewpoint , that would not be a practice we would welcome . " boosting the birth-rate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birth rates in germany are worryingly low it is n't clear how much money the government would save if these rules go into effect .
but some ministers already know how they would spend it - trying to boost the birth rate in germany . " the money we would save could be used to provide more support for those who - for whatever reason - are trying to have a child using in-vitro fertilization , " said orosz .
" these techniques require a lot more commitment on the part of those involved , some of whom are needy , and to be fair they should also benefit from taxpayer contributions .

the question that europe has to clarify is to what extent governments and intelligence agencies helped the cia detain and deport terror suspects . a delegation from the european parliament 's inquiry panel looking into the issue spent tuesday talking to german parliamentarians and ngos to try to find out more about the activities of the german government and secret services regarding such deportations . germany 's european parliamentarian and panel member cem özdemir said the body wanted to " build a coalition " between national and european parliamentarians .

" a first contingent of 1,000 soldiers will leave for the middle east on thursday , breaking a postwar taboo for germany .
due to its nazi past , sending german troops to the region near israel is particularly sensitive . " there is perhaps no other area of the world where germany 's unique responsibility , the unique responsibility of every german government to heed the lessons of our past is so clear than it is here , " merkel said in a speech to the bundestag . the german chancellor also promised bundestag members she would press washington to take a more active role in the region , drawing a link between the lebanon and israeli-palestinian conflicts . other europea n n atio n s i n volved two frigates , four fast patrol boats , two supply ships and two helicopters will be deployed by germany in cooperation with naval forces being sent by the netherlands , sweden , norway and denmark . bildunterschrift : spanish marines are also part of the un peacekeeping force in lebanon german naval vessels are expected to arrive off the lebanese coast by early october , given that it takes about 10 days for ships to travel from the north sea to the eastern mediterranean . the mission 's mandate will initially be limited until aug .

" we should be no under illusions just because this is a navy mission and not a ground mission , " westerwelle said . government ministers insisted the mission would bring stability to the region and increase europe 's role as an architect of peace in the middle east . the un is deploying a 15,000-member peacekeeping force in southern lebanon under a ceasefire agreement which last month ended fighting between israel and hezbollah . co n ditio n s met meanwhile , a un spokesman said the number of un peacekeepers in southern lebanon has risen to 5,000 , meeting a condition laid down by israel for withdrawing from its northern neighbor . " we have reached the 5,000 troops , " said alexander ivanko , spokesman for the un interim force in lebanon .
" the first phase of the unifil deployment is now completed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian un soldieres guard a lebanese beach ivanko said that the initial number of about 2,000 unifil troops had been boosted to 5,000 by three new battalions from france , italy and spain . israeli forces have remained in southern lebanon for more than a month after the aug .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the pope needs an advisor who knows the opinion , the temperature , on the streets !
has he not witnessed the uproar over the psychological operation known as the danish cartoons ?
would he dare to balance his remarks with criticism of american fundamentalist christian holy warriors ?
why not ?
how about critique of the notorious passages in the talmud ?
meanwhile the text and thrust of his very interesting and thoughtful speech has been lost due to ignorance of the tensions and motives which lurk under the landscape . - klaatu as a devoted muslim and an indonesian by birth , i strongly believe that the pontiff 's comment on islam was misunderstood by my fellow muslims .
i am always tolerant towards every religion no matter the difference of its worshipping towards the creator . - endoeng sasmito i do not expect the present pope to accomplish much in his period of papacy .
he has already started on the wrong foot and might ignite more hatred between muslims and christians . - abdul ataa no amount of intellectual sophistication can hide that in his core , ratzinger has remained a catholic bavarian village yokel . - diet simon the pope 's remarks have been taken out of context .
he actually was promoting interfaith dialogue .
the actual paragraph in question was not his words - he was quoting .
he also said he found the sentiment expressed therein a bit strong .
it is disappointing to see how muslim clerics have chosen to take the whole thing out of context , thereby using it for their own motives .
those demonstrating on the streets have likely never read the speech and have most probably been told that these were the actual words of the pope .
there are too many people out there ready to hate - sadly particularly muslims - a faith which is supposed to be tolerant and peaceful .
the pope should never apologize . - dia n a bishop , fra n ce i expect the pope to create further division between christianity and islam .
the pope 's very unfortunate remarks are going to spark a worldwide controversy that will further the hatred already seen in so many different conflicts throughout the world .
perhaps the pope is a bit delusional in his thinking .
he should apologize , and resign .
this will help build back the vote of confidence that the catholic church so desperately will need in the very near future . - christia n fiech i concur with those who believe that the present pope was referring to islam in an historical context .
these remarks have been taken out of context .
hopefully , the islamic population worldwide will carefully analyze the whole discourse and appreciate what the underlying message is . - mauree n t. couch , australia i have read the whole speech , which is very long and very complex .
the real pity is that the media only quoted one sentence .
the most interesting part of the speech was , and this is like a " fingerprint " of this pope , criticism of the " modern times " and criticism of the western " way of life . "
very interesting was the part on the " dialogue of cultures , " which can not take place if the western world excludes god from its life .
it seems to me as if the pope wanted to begin a public discussion on the legitimizing of violence on the one side , and on the role of faith and sense in our western world . - ludwig meyerhoff , germa n y it was stupid for him to quote a 14th century byzantine emperor .
open mouth , insert foot .
of course , the muslims will react badly to a denigration of their prophet and their religion .
how much better to comment on the positive and loving side of islam and refer to the violent side of christianity , particularly in bosnia and between the serbs and croats , saying hostility has no place in any religion . - patty rola n d compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's apology fails to stem anger of muslim hardliners pope benedict xvi 's personal apology for hurting the feelings of muslims with a controversial speech failed to stem the anger of hardliners despite calls for calm from islamic and western leaders .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the pope needs an advisor who knows the opinion , the temperature , on the streets !
has he not witnessed the uproar over the psychological operation known as the danish cartoons ?
would he dare to balance his remarks with criticism of american fundamentalist christian holy warriors ?
why not ?
how about critique of the notorious passages in the talmud ?
meanwhile the text and thrust of his very interesting and thoughtful speech has been lost due to ignorance of the tensions and motives which lurk under the landscape . - klaatu as a devoted muslim and an indonesian by birth , i strongly believe that the pontiff 's comment on islam was misunderstood by my fellow muslims .
i am always tolerant towards every religion no matter the difference of its worshipping towards the creator . - endoeng sasmito i do not expect the present pope to accomplish much in his period of papacy .
he has already started on the wrong foot and might ignite more hatred between muslims and christians . - abdul ataa no amount of intellectual sophistication can hide that in his core , ratzinger has remained a catholic bavarian village yokel . - diet simon the pope 's remarks have been taken out of context .
he actually was promoting interfaith dialogue .
the actual paragraph in question was not his words - he was quoting .
he also said he found the sentiment expressed therein a bit strong .
it is disappointing to see how muslim clerics have chosen to take the whole thing out of context , thereby using it for their own motives .
those demonstrating on the streets have likely never read the speech and have most probably been told that these were the actual words of the pope .
there are too many people out there ready to hate - sadly particularly muslims - a faith which is supposed to be tolerant and peaceful .
the pope should never apologize . - dia n a bishop , fra n ce i expect the pope to create further division between christianity and islam .
the pope 's very unfortunate remarks are going to spark a worldwide controversy that will further the hatred already seen in so many different conflicts throughout the world .
perhaps the pope is a bit delusional in his thinking .
he should apologize , and resign .
this will help build back the vote of confidence that the catholic church so desperately will need in the very near future . - christia n fiech i concur with those who believe that the present pope was referring to islam in an historical context .
these remarks have been taken out of context .
hopefully , the islamic population worldwide will carefully analyze the whole discourse and appreciate what the underlying message is . - mauree n t. couch , australia i have read the whole speech , which is very long and very complex .
the real pity is that the media only quoted one sentence .
the most interesting part of the speech was , and this is like a " fingerprint " of this pope , criticism of the " modern times " and criticism of the western " way of life . "
very interesting was the part on the " dialogue of cultures , " which can not take place if the western world excludes god from its life .
it seems to me as if the pope wanted to begin a public discussion on the legitimizing of violence on the one side , and on the role of faith and sense in our western world . - ludwig meyerhoff , germa n y it was stupid for him to quote a 14th century byzantine emperor .
open mouth , insert foot .
of course , the muslims will react badly to a denigration of their prophet and their religion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.09.2006 european meps look into german role in cia deportations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was the german government aware of illegal flights via the us air base in ramstein ?
a european parliament delegation was in berlin to find out to what extent the german government and secret services turned a blind eye to us practices to deport detainees to other continents via european territory . the deportation of terror suspects by the cia and the involvement of european countries in such deportation cases were at the center of investigations carried out by a special inquiry panel of the european parliament in berlin on tuesday . us president george w. bush recently admitted the use of secret prisons outside us jurisdiction .
the question that europe has to clarify is to what extent governments and intelligence agencies helped the cia detain and deport terror suspects . a delegation from the european parliament 's inquiry panel looking into the issue spent tuesday talking to german parliamentarians and ngos to try to find out more about the activities of the german government and secret services regarding such deportations . germany 's european parliamentarian and panel member cem özdemir said the body wanted to " build a coalition " between national and european parliamentarians . " we believe that the members of parliaments have to work closely together in order to force our governments to cooperate , because otherwise we can not achieve our goals , " özdemir said .
lots of issues to be discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz was held in guantanamo for over four years " of course , we have some questions here in germany , " özdemir said .
" just think of the el masri case . "
german national khaled el masri was arrested in macedonia at the end of 2003 and said he was handed over to the cia , who flew him to afghanistan and wrongly held him until his release in late may 2004 . özdemir also named the case of murat kurnaz , a turkish citizen born in germany who was recently allowed to return to germany after more than four years of detention in guantanamo bay . " all those things we have to discuss , " özdemir said . huma n rights of detai n ees are a top priority ferdinand muggenthaler from the german branch of amnesty international accused the government of double standards .
on the one hand , he said , german chancellor angela merkel and her cabinet members have openly criticized the existence of the secret prisons . on the other hand , there are strong indications that the government has turned a blind eye when the intelligence agencies helped the cia deport terror suspects to such camps . german intelligence officers are said also to have themselves interrogated suspects in such camps . " the most important point for the future is that the government makes it clear that the secret service also has to protect the human rights of detainees , " muggenthaler said .
" i think that 's the better way in the long run to fight terrorism and to ensure security . " getti n g to the bottom of the matter will take time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir wants european and national bodies to work closely together özdemir said that just one day of investigations in germany was n't enough to get to the heart of the matter .
he said more meetings will follow . " this is not the last time that we will talk to our german colleagues , " özdemir said .
" do n't forget that we work closely together and it 's clear that we also need the help and support of the media , we need the help and support of ngos .
otherwise , we can not achieve our work .

" viral marketing " is one of those strategies , involving word-of-mouth marketing via web logs , internet forums , chat rooms and such wide-open cyber-venues as myspace and youtube .
marketing strategists cite the band arctic monkeys as an example of how to break the mould on traditional marketing .
learning from the arctic monkeys the four young brits defied conventional industry wisdom by side-stepping time-honored marketing procedures and making their music available free of charge via the world wide web .
the resulting word-of-mouth buzz propelled them to the top of the charts . the arctic monkeys thus made obsolete the traditional procedure of pressing a demo and hawking it to label executives and radio station program playlist managers .

" until now , the conventional wisdom within the industry was that downloading music from the internet was in fact stealing from the artists .
the arctic monkeys turned that argument on its head . and as far as artists are concerned , the industry has been stealing from them all along .

industry analysts put the first-half figure at 54.6 million albums , which , though bad , is better than they had feared a year ago . " it 's a good sign , " said michael haentjes , a german industry spokesman .
" sales are still very soft but are not off as much as they could have been .
the problem of course is the nagging problems of widespread downloads and piracy . " the bright spot in a gloomy industry landscape is the online market .
in the first half of 2005 , 7.5 million music titles were bought online in germany via itunes , musicload and others .
by contrast , online sales for the first half of 2006 are expected to top 12 million . even so , those figures are not as high as the german music industry had hoped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piracy has eaten into cd sales worldwide " piracy is insidious and is putting the brake on online sell-through , ' said haentjes .

even in germany , more children suffer than many people realize . bellem tried to hold on to the moon-shaped pumpkin slices , but they kept slipping out of her hand . " this is the only place i can cook because my mother never lets me , " she said .
" i ask her almost every day , ' can i cook with you ? ' but she says , ' no , i do n't feel like it . " ' bellem 's cooking club for seven- to 12-year-olds is sponsored by a child protection group in cologne .
the idea is to offer parents some relief so that they do n't feel too burdened to take proper care of their children . 10 percent neglect rate in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicef aims to cut the child mortality rate among under-five-year-olds by two-thirds one in 10 children in germany is severely neglected , according to some statistics .
that might mean they do n't get enough to eat or are n't taken care of when they 're sick .
or perhaps they freeze in the winter because their parents do n't dress them warmly enough . " often these parents were neglected as children themselves , " said renate blum-maurice from the cologne child protection group .
ultimately , many factors can play a role , she added - the marriage gets rocky , the baby is born handicapped , or dad loses his job . the united nations initiated international children 's day in 1954 to draw attention to the dangers children face , including neglect .
it is now celebrated annually in more than 145 countries , in german-speaking countries primarily on sept .
20 . child poverty rising disproportionately in developing countries , where millions of children face extreme poverty , malnutrition and war , the situation is even more drastic .
but even in germany , more than 50 years after international children 's day was founded , some 2.5 million children and youths live off of social welfare , according to the federal child protection agency . unicef , which spearheads the annual day of recognition , estimates that poverty among children in germany has increased disproportionately to the rest of the population over the past decade . bellem and her cooking partners do n't live in dire need .
they are not among the world 's 2.1 billion children and youths suffering through a life of extreme poverty .
and the child protection group in cologne is doing what it can to keep it that way . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de end in sight to global problem of child labor some 218 million children worldwide are forced to work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 20.09.2006 ailing music industry casts around for solutions at berlin fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's show time again : the popkomm music fair gets into the act artists and representatives of the global music industry will gather in berlin at the popkomm music fair that opens wednesday to discuss innovative ways to combat piracy and illegal downloads . more than 15,000 visitors are expected to throng the 800 exhibition booths at berlin 's international congress center for the 18th popkomm international business platform for music and entertainment .
the fair runs until sept 23 . this year 's combination trade show , conference and festival is overshadowed by plunging cd sales worldwide amidst turmoil in the music industry over new web-based music sources .
more than 2,000 musicians are converging on berlin for the event in hopes of signing lucrative contracts with major labels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popkomm brainstorms on saving the future of the music industry like every year , executives and industry experts will be huddling to come up with strategies for saving the industry .
" viral marketing " is one of those strategies , involving word-of-mouth marketing via web logs , internet forums , chat rooms and such wide-open cyber-venues as myspace and youtube .
marketing strategists cite the band arctic monkeys as an example of how to break the mould on traditional marketing .
learning from the arctic monkeys the four young brits defied conventional industry wisdom by side-stepping time-honored marketing procedures and making their music available free of charge via the world wide web .
the resulting word-of-mouth buzz propelled them to the top of the charts . the arctic monkeys thus made obsolete the traditional procedure of pressing a demo and hawking it to label executives and radio station program playlist managers .
the group cut out the middleman by starting their own homepage on the internet and offering their demo singles as free downloads .
they burned their own cds and distributed them free of charge at live gigs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british band arctic monkeys revolutionized how music is marketed unbothered by the fact that fans copied their cds and distributed them to friends , the british band seemed to accept it as a necessary step towards fame and - eventually - to fortune .
and it worked .
by the time the arctic monkeys released their debut album last january on domino records , they were so well known that british sales soared to 118,000 within days . not surprisingly , a panel discussion at this year 's popkomm in berlin is entitled " arctic monkeys business style and the future of the music industry . " until now , the conventional wisdom within the industry was that downloading music from the internet was in fact stealing from the artists .
the arctic monkeys turned that argument on its head . and as far as artists are concerned , the industry has been stealing from them all along .
artists tend to receive $ 0.25 -lrb- 19 euro cents -rrb- in royalties on a cd that costs $ 0.50 to produce and which retails for $ 15 - meaning the middlemen get most of the money . against that backdrop , executives have been discussing ways to save the " physical product , " by which they mean the cd , as opposed to web-based products , which are beyond their control . fighting piracy and illegal downloads another issue that will take center stage at the music fair is the problem of illegal downloads and piracy . german recording industry figures for the first half of 2006 will be released during popkomm and are expected to show yet another decline in sales , this time by about 3.4 per cent .
industry analysts put the first-half figure at 54.6 million albums , which , though bad , is better than they had feared a year ago . " it 's a good sign , " said michael haentjes , a german industry spokesman .
" sales are still very soft but are not off as much as they could have been .
the problem of course is the nagging problems of widespread downloads and piracy . " the bright spot in a gloomy industry landscape is the online market .
in the first half of 2005 , 7.5 million music titles were bought online in germany via itunes , musicload and others .
by contrast , online sales for the first half of 2006 are expected to top 12 million . even so , those figures are not as high as the german music industry had hoped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piracy has eaten into cd sales worldwide " piracy is insidious and is putting the brake on online sell-through , ' said haentjes .
" coming up with ways to curtail piracy is the major topic we 'll be discussing . " berlin is a high-profile venue for these deliberations because the german government is in the processing of drafting a new law that would stiffen penalties for copyright violations , extending them to include internet downloads . popkomm has invited german lawmakers to panel discussions to ensure that the industry 's concerns are covered by the wording of the new law . as the panels hold their deliberations , music-lovers will be treated to a marathon festival of live concerts offering more than 600 hours of performances by 400 acts over four nights . the fair will conclude saturday night with a gala club night featuring artists from 26 countries .

" the ultra-sound shows the fetus has a congenital abnormality " are the last words a pregnant woman wants to hear from her doctor .
when it does happen , she faces a difficult choice - raise a child that might require life-long care and medical treatment , or have a late abortion . technically , this is one that takes place after the 23rd week .
the most common reason is that doctors have identified anomalies and advise what 's known as a " therapeutic termination . " but with germany 's federal statistics office reporting that late abortions are on the rise , the government plans to take measures to curb the trend . the governing coalition 's parliamentary leaders , christian democrat volker kauder and social democrat peter struck , met with the heads of the protestant and catholic churches in germany , bishop wolfgang huber and cardinal karl lehmann , on tuesday .
struck said his party saw no need to change the laws regarding abortion .
the two governing parties , however , had agreed to review the legislation in their coalition agreement . disability alone no reason for abortion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abortion after 23 weeks is permitted if the baby endangers a woman 's mental or physical health before having an abortion even within the standard 12 weeks permitted in germany , a woman must first visit a counseling center - although she is not required to explain why she does n't want to carry the fetus to full term . conservatives are now calling for the introduction of the same obligatory counseling session for women considering a late termination , as well as the three-day consideration period . " a suspected disability alone does not justify a termination , " said johannes singhammer of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . the cdu has the backing of the german chamber of physicians , which supports the three-day consideration period and also proposes limiting women 's autonomy of choice . financial reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to reduce the number of abortions carried out more than 120,000 abortions are carried out in germany every year , around 80 percent of which are paid by health insurance funds or - if there are valid medical or social reasons - through social welfare schemes . further reforms to abortion legislation up for discussion are financially motivated .
a woman having an abortion does n't have to pay for the procedure .
conservatives are now proposing that women should take on at least part of the cost . " i think that the women also have to assume a share of the responsibility .
and if they are able to assume a share of the financial costs , then we need to make that possible , " said helma orosz , a christian democrat and social affairs minister in the state of saxony . but family counseling associations , like pro familia , say that plans to bill patients depending on their incomes would cause a lot of problems . " if your income is very low already , and if the amount you have to pay increases - meaning that women would have to come up with the 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- that an abortion costs on the average - then it would put many of them in a difficult situation , " said pro familia doctor christina schneider .
" i do n't believe that 's an appropriate way to reduce the number of abortions , if that 's what politicians who support this are thinking . " further factors some lawmakers say the issue is n't just about money , but also about protecting the lives of the unborn .
pro familia says experiences at its centers show that finances do not always play a key role when it comes to abortion - and that women who want an abortion will get one . doctors also fear that forcing women to bear the costs of the procedure would bring a host of other problems . " in some circumstances , women might try to save money by going to colleagues who were willing to do it on the cheap , " said matthias david from berlin 's charité clinic .
" maybe they would n't go to doctors at all , and would try to find the means for non-medical abortions .

" the ultra-sound shows the fetus has a congenital abnormality " are the last words a pregnant woman wants to hear from her doctor .
when it does happen , she faces a difficult choice - raise a child that might require life-long care and medical treatment , or have a late abortion . technically , this is one that takes place after the 23rd week .
the most common reason is that doctors have identified anomalies and advise what 's known as a " therapeutic termination . " but with germany 's federal statistics office reporting that late abortions are on the rise , the government plans to take measures to curb the trend . the governing coalition 's parliamentary leaders , christian democrat volker kauder and social democrat peter struck , met with the heads of the protestant and catholic churches in germany , bishop wolfgang huber and cardinal karl lehmann , on tuesday .
struck said his party saw no need to change the laws regarding abortion .
the two governing parties , however , had agreed to review the legislation in their coalition agreement . disability alone no reason for abortion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abortion after 23 weeks is permitted if the baby endangers a woman 's mental or physical health before having an abortion even within the standard 12 weeks permitted in germany , a woman must first visit a counseling center - although she is not required to explain why she does n't want to carry the fetus to full term . conservatives are now calling for the introduction of the same obligatory counseling session for women considering a late termination , as well as the three-day consideration period . " a suspected disability alone does not justify a termination , " said johannes singhammer of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . the cdu has the backing of the german chamber of physicians , which supports the three-day consideration period and also proposes limiting women 's autonomy of choice . financial reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to reduce the number of abortions carried out more than 120,000 abortions are carried out in germany every year , around 80 percent of which are paid by health insurance funds or - if there are valid medical or social reasons - through social welfare schemes . further reforms to abortion legislation up for discussion are financially motivated .
a woman having an abortion does n't have to pay for the procedure .
conservatives are now proposing that women should take on at least part of the cost . " i think that the women also have to assume a share of the responsibility .
and if they are able to assume a share of the financial costs , then we need to make that possible , " said helma orosz , a christian democrat and social affairs minister in the state of saxony . but family counseling associations , like pro familia , say that plans to bill patients depending on their incomes would cause a lot of problems . " if your income is very low already , and if the amount you have to pay increases - meaning that women would have to come up with the 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- that an abortion costs on the average - then it would put many of them in a difficult situation , " said pro familia doctor christina schneider .
" i do n't believe that 's an appropriate way to reduce the number of abortions , if that 's what politicians who support this are thinking . " further factors some lawmakers say the issue is n't just about money , but also about protecting the lives of the unborn .
pro familia says experiences at its centers show that finances do not always play a key role when it comes to abortion - and that women who want an abortion will get one . doctors also fear that forcing women to bear the costs of the procedure would bring a host of other problems . " in some circumstances , women might try to save money by going to colleagues who were willing to do it on the cheap , " said matthias david from berlin 's charité clinic .
" maybe they would n't go to doctors at all , and would try to find the means for non-medical abortions .
maybe they would begin going abroad again , as they did for awhile , when women went to the netherlands because it did n't cost as much for the procedure .
from a medical viewpoint , that would not be a practice we would welcome . " boosting the birth-rate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birth rates in germany are worryingly low it is n't clear how much money the government would save if these rules go into effect .
but some ministers already know how they would spend it - trying to boost the birth rate in germany . " the money we would save could be used to provide more support for those who - for whatever reason - are trying to have a child using in-vitro fertilization , " said orosz .

" the parliament has a clear duty to give living wills a legal basis , by passing it into law , " brysch said , adding that germany needs to finally allow its citizens self-determination , and allow them to right to protect their integrity through a living will . on wednesday at the stuttgart meeting , bonn-based criminal lawyer torsten verrel plans to clarify his demands to expressly decriminalize passive assisted-suicide and the shutting down of life-support systems .

a european parliament delegation was in berlin to find out to what extent the german government and secret services turned a blind eye to us practices to deport detainees to other continents via european territory . the deportation of terror suspects by the cia and the involvement of european countries in such deportation cases were at the center of investigations carried out by a special inquiry panel of the european parliament in berlin on tuesday . us president george w. bush recently admitted the use of secret prisons outside us jurisdiction .
the question that europe has to clarify is to what extent governments and intelligence agencies helped the cia detain and deport terror suspects . a delegation from the european parliament 's inquiry panel looking into the issue spent tuesday talking to german parliamentarians and ngos to try to find out more about the activities of the german government and secret services regarding such deportations . germany 's european parliamentarian and panel member cem özdemir said the body wanted to " build a coalition " between national and european parliamentarians . " we believe that the members of parliaments have to work closely together in order to force our governments to cooperate , because otherwise we can not achieve our goals , " özdemir said .
lots of issues to be discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz was held in guantanamo for over four years " of course , we have some questions here in germany , " özdemir said .
" just think of the el masri case . "
german national khaled el masri was arrested in macedonia at the end of 2003 and said he was handed over to the cia , who flew him to afghanistan and wrongly held him until his release in late may 2004 . özdemir also named the case of murat kurnaz , a turkish citizen born in germany who was recently allowed to return to germany after more than four years of detention in guantanamo bay . " all those things we have to discuss , " özdemir said . huma n rights of detai n ees are a top priority ferdinand muggenthaler from the german branch of amnesty international accused the government of double standards .
on the one hand , he said , german chancellor angela merkel and her cabinet members have openly criticized the existence of the secret prisons . on the other hand , there are strong indications that the government has turned a blind eye when the intelligence agencies helped the cia deport terror suspects to such camps . german intelligence officers are said also to have themselves interrogated suspects in such camps . " the most important point for the future is that the government makes it clear that the secret service also has to protect the human rights of detainees , " muggenthaler said .
" i think that 's the better way in the long run to fight terrorism and to ensure security . " getti n g to the bottom of the matter will take time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir wants european and national bodies to work closely together özdemir said that just one day of investigations in germany was n't enough to get to the heart of the matter .
he said more meetings will follow . " this is not the last time that we will talk to our german colleagues , " özdemir said .
" do n't forget that we work closely together and it 's clear that we also need the help and support of the media , we need the help and support of ngos .
otherwise , we can not achieve our work . " a final report by the panel is expected by the end of this year . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in the hot-seat at eu 's cia probe serious claims of german complicity have been raised within the special european parliament committee investigating the cia 's secret camps in europe .

the fair runs until sept 23 . this year 's combination trade show , conference and festival is overshadowed by plunging cd sales worldwide amidst turmoil in the music industry over new web-based music sources .
more than 2,000 musicians are converging on berlin for the event in hopes of signing lucrative contracts with major labels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popkomm brainstorms on saving the future of the music industry like every year , executives and industry experts will be huddling to come up with strategies for saving the industry .
" viral marketing " is one of those strategies , involving word-of-mouth marketing via web logs , internet forums , chat rooms and such wide-open cyber-venues as myspace and youtube .
marketing strategists cite the band arctic monkeys as an example of how to break the mould on traditional marketing .
learning from the arctic monkeys the four young brits defied conventional industry wisdom by side-stepping time-honored marketing procedures and making their music available free of charge via the world wide web .
the resulting word-of-mouth buzz propelled them to the top of the charts . the arctic monkeys thus made obsolete the traditional procedure of pressing a demo and hawking it to label executives and radio station program playlist managers .
the group cut out the middleman by starting their own homepage on the internet and offering their demo singles as free downloads .
they burned their own cds and distributed them free of charge at live gigs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british band arctic monkeys revolutionized how music is marketed unbothered by the fact that fans copied their cds and distributed them to friends , the british band seemed to accept it as a necessary step towards fame and - eventually - to fortune .
and it worked .
by the time the arctic monkeys released their debut album last january on domino records , they were so well known that british sales soared to 118,000 within days . not surprisingly , a panel discussion at this year 's popkomm in berlin is entitled " arctic monkeys business style and the future of the music industry . " until now , the conventional wisdom within the industry was that downloading music from the internet was in fact stealing from the artists .
the arctic monkeys turned that argument on its head . and as far as artists are concerned , the industry has been stealing from them all along .
artists tend to receive $ 0.25 -lrb- 19 euro cents -rrb- in royalties on a cd that costs $ 0.50 to produce and which retails for $ 15 - meaning the middlemen get most of the money . against that backdrop , executives have been discussing ways to save the " physical product , " by which they mean the cd , as opposed to web-based products , which are beyond their control . fighting piracy and illegal downloads another issue that will take center stage at the music fair is the problem of illegal downloads and piracy . german recording industry figures for the first half of 2006 will be released during popkomm and are expected to show yet another decline in sales , this time by about 3.4 per cent .
industry analysts put the first-half figure at 54.6 million albums , which , though bad , is better than they had feared a year ago . " it 's a good sign , " said michael haentjes , a german industry spokesman .
" sales are still very soft but are not off as much as they could have been .
the problem of course is the nagging problems of widespread downloads and piracy . " the bright spot in a gloomy industry landscape is the online market .
in the first half of 2005 , 7.5 million music titles were bought online in germany via itunes , musicload and others .
by contrast , online sales for the first half of 2006 are expected to top 12 million . even so , those figures are not as high as the german music industry had hoped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piracy has eaten into cd sales worldwide " piracy is insidious and is putting the brake on online sell-through , ' said haentjes .
" coming up with ways to curtail piracy is the major topic we 'll be discussing . " berlin is a high-profile venue for these deliberations because the german government is in the processing of drafting a new law that would stiffen penalties for copyright violations , extending them to include internet downloads . popkomm has invited german lawmakers to panel discussions to ensure that the industry 's concerns are covered by the wording of the new law . as the panels hold their deliberations , music-lovers will be treated to a marathon festival of live concerts offering more than 600 hours of performances by 400 acts over four nights . the fair will conclude saturday night with a gala club night featuring artists from 26 countries .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the pope needs an advisor who knows the opinion , the temperature , on the streets !
has he not witnessed the uproar over the psychological operation known as the danish cartoons ?
would he dare to balance his remarks with criticism of american fundamentalist christian holy warriors ?
why not ?
how about critique of the notorious passages in the talmud ?
meanwhile the text and thrust of his very interesting and thoughtful speech has been lost due to ignorance of the tensions and motives which lurk under the landscape . - klaatu as a devoted muslim and an indonesian by birth , i strongly believe that the pontiff 's comment on islam was misunderstood by my fellow muslims .
i am always tolerant towards every religion no matter the difference of its worshipping towards the creator . - endoeng sasmito i do not expect the present pope to accomplish much in his period of papacy .
he has already started on the wrong foot and might ignite more hatred between muslims and christians . - abdul ataa no amount of intellectual sophistication can hide that in his core , ratzinger has remained a catholic bavarian village yokel . - diet simon the pope 's remarks have been taken out of context .
he actually was promoting interfaith dialogue .
the actual paragraph in question was not his words - he was quoting .
he also said he found the sentiment expressed therein a bit strong .
it is disappointing to see how muslim clerics have chosen to take the whole thing out of context , thereby using it for their own motives .
those demonstrating on the streets have likely never read the speech and have most probably been told that these were the actual words of the pope .
there are too many people out there ready to hate - sadly particularly muslims - a faith which is supposed to be tolerant and peaceful .
the pope should never apologize . - dia n a bishop , fra n ce i expect the pope to create further division between christianity and islam .
the pope 's very unfortunate remarks are going to spark a worldwide controversy that will further the hatred already seen in so many different conflicts throughout the world .
perhaps the pope is a bit delusional in his thinking .
he should apologize , and resign .
this will help build back the vote of confidence that the catholic church so desperately will need in the very near future . - christia n fiech i concur with those who believe that the present pope was referring to islam in an historical context .
these remarks have been taken out of context .
hopefully , the islamic population worldwide will carefully analyze the whole discourse and appreciate what the underlying message is . - mauree n t. couch , australia i have read the whole speech , which is very long and very complex .
the real pity is that the media only quoted one sentence .
the most interesting part of the speech was , and this is like a " fingerprint " of this pope , criticism of the " modern times " and criticism of the western " way of life . "
very interesting was the part on the " dialogue of cultures , " which can not take place if the western world excludes god from its life .
it seems to me as if the pope wanted to begin a public discussion on the legitimizing of violence on the one side , and on the role of faith and sense in our western world . - ludwig meyerhoff , germa n y it was stupid for him to quote a 14th century byzantine emperor .
open mouth , insert foot .
of course , the muslims will react badly to a denigration of their prophet and their religion .
how much better to comment on the positive and loving side of islam and refer to the violent side of christianity , particularly in bosnia and between the serbs and croats , saying hostility has no place in any religion . - patty rola n d compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's apology fails to stem anger of muslim hardliners pope benedict xvi 's personal apology for hurting the feelings of muslims with a controversial speech failed to stem the anger of hardliners despite calls for calm from islamic and western leaders .

learning from the arctic monkeys the four young brits defied conventional industry wisdom by side-stepping time-honored marketing procedures and making their music available free of charge via the world wide web .

by the time the arctic monkeys released their debut album last january on domino records , they were so well known that british sales soared to 118,000 within days . not surprisingly , a panel discussion at this year 's popkomm in berlin is entitled " arctic monkeys business style and the future of the music industry .

in the first half of 2005 , 7.5 million music titles were bought online in germany via itunes , musicload and others .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 20.09.2006 government discusses reducing late abortions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many , a late termination is a last resort parliamentary leaders met with church representatives tuesday to talk about reforming legislation on late abortions , as conservatives push for more stringent controls on terminations and a re-think of who foots the bill . " the ultra-sound shows the fetus has a congenital abnormality " are the last words a pregnant woman wants to hear from her doctor .
when it does happen , she faces a difficult choice - raise a child that might require life-long care and medical treatment , or have a late abortion . technically , this is one that takes place after the 23rd week .
the most common reason is that doctors have identified anomalies and advise what 's known as a " therapeutic termination . " but with germany 's federal statistics office reporting that late abortions are on the rise , the government plans to take measures to curb the trend . the governing coalition 's parliamentary leaders , christian democrat volker kauder and social democrat peter struck , met with the heads of the protestant and catholic churches in germany , bishop wolfgang huber and cardinal karl lehmann , on tuesday .
struck said his party saw no need to change the laws regarding abortion .
the two governing parties , however , had agreed to review the legislation in their coalition agreement . disability alone no reason for abortion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abortion after 23 weeks is permitted if the baby endangers a woman 's mental or physical health before having an abortion even within the standard 12 weeks permitted in germany , a woman must first visit a counseling center - although she is not required to explain why she does n't want to carry the fetus to full term . conservatives are now calling for the introduction of the same obligatory counseling session for women considering a late termination , as well as the three-day consideration period . " a suspected disability alone does not justify a termination , " said johannes singhammer of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . the cdu has the backing of the german chamber of physicians , which supports the three-day consideration period and also proposes limiting women 's autonomy of choice . financial reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to reduce the number of abortions carried out more than 120,000 abortions are carried out in germany every year , around 80 percent of which are paid by health insurance funds or - if there are valid medical or social reasons - through social welfare schemes . further reforms to abortion legislation up for discussion are financially motivated .
a woman having an abortion does n't have to pay for the procedure .
conservatives are now proposing that women should take on at least part of the cost . " i think that the women also have to assume a share of the responsibility .
and if they are able to assume a share of the financial costs , then we need to make that possible , " said helma orosz , a christian democrat and social affairs minister in the state of saxony . but family counseling associations , like pro familia , say that plans to bill patients depending on their incomes would cause a lot of problems . " if your income is very low already , and if the amount you have to pay increases - meaning that women would have to come up with the 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- that an abortion costs on the average - then it would put many of them in a difficult situation , " said pro familia doctor christina schneider .
" i do n't believe that 's an appropriate way to reduce the number of abortions , if that 's what politicians who support this are thinking . " further factors some lawmakers say the issue is n't just about money , but also about protecting the lives of the unborn .
pro familia says experiences at its centers show that finances do not always play a key role when it comes to abortion - and that women who want an abortion will get one . doctors also fear that forcing women to bear the costs of the procedure would bring a host of other problems . " in some circumstances , women might try to save money by going to colleagues who were willing to do it on the cheap , " said matthias david from berlin 's charité clinic .
" maybe they would n't go to doctors at all , and would try to find the means for non-medical abortions .
maybe they would begin going abroad again , as they did for awhile , when women went to the netherlands because it did n't cost as much for the procedure .
from a medical viewpoint , that would not be a practice we would welcome . " boosting the birth-rate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birth rates in germany are worryingly low it is n't clear how much money the government would save if these rules go into effect .
but some ministers already know how they would spend it - trying to boost the birth rate in germany . " the money we would save could be used to provide more support for those who - for whatever reason - are trying to have a child using in-vitro fertilization , " said orosz .
" these techniques require a lot more commitment on the part of those involved , some of whom are needy , and to be fair they should also benefit from taxpayer contributions .

even in germany , more children suffer than many people realize . bellem tried to hold on to the moon-shaped pumpkin slices , but they kept slipping out of her hand . " this is the only place i can cook because my mother never lets me , " she said .
" i ask her almost every day , ' can i cook with you ? ' but she says , ' no , i do n't feel like it . " ' bellem 's cooking club for seven- to 12-year-olds is sponsored by a child protection group in cologne .
the idea is to offer parents some relief so that they do n't feel too burdened to take proper care of their children . 10 percent neglect rate in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicef aims to cut the child mortality rate among under-five-year-olds by two-thirds one in 10 children in germany is severely neglected , according to some statistics .
that might mean they do n't get enough to eat or are n't taken care of when they 're sick .
or perhaps they freeze in the winter because their parents do n't dress them warmly enough . " often these parents were neglected as children themselves , " said renate blum-maurice from the cologne child protection group .
ultimately , many factors can play a role , she added - the marriage gets rocky , the baby is born handicapped , or dad loses his job . the united nations initiated international children 's day in 1954 to draw attention to the dangers children face , including neglect .
it is now celebrated annually in more than 145 countries , in german-speaking countries primarily on sept .
20 . child poverty rising disproportionately in developing countries , where millions of children face extreme poverty , malnutrition and war , the situation is even more drastic .
but even in germany , more than 50 years after international children 's day was founded , some 2.5 million children and youths live off of social welfare , according to the federal child protection agency . unicef , which spearheads the annual day of recognition , estimates that poverty among children in germany has increased disproportionately to the rest of the population over the past decade . bellem and her cooking partners do n't live in dire need .
they are not among the world 's 2.1 billion children and youths suffering through a life of extreme poverty .
and the child protection group in cologne is doing what it can to keep it that way . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de end in sight to global problem of child labor some 218 million children worldwide are forced to work .

a european parliament delegation was in berlin to find out to what extent the german government and secret services turned a blind eye to us practices to deport detainees to other continents via european territory . the deportation of terror suspects by the cia and the involvement of european countries in such deportation cases were at the center of investigations carried out by a special inquiry panel of the european parliament in berlin on tuesday . us president george w. bush recently admitted the use of secret prisons outside us jurisdiction .
the question that europe has to clarify is to what extent governments and intelligence agencies helped the cia detain and deport terror suspects . a delegation from the european parliament 's inquiry panel looking into the issue spent tuesday talking to german parliamentarians and ngos to try to find out more about the activities of the german government and secret services regarding such deportations . germany 's european parliamentarian and panel member cem özdemir said the body wanted to " build a coalition " between national and european parliamentarians . " we believe that the members of parliaments have to work closely together in order to force our governments to cooperate , because otherwise we can not achieve our goals , " özdemir said .

when it does happen , she faces a difficult choice - raise a child that might require life-long care and medical treatment , or have a late abortion . technically , this is one that takes place after the 23rd week .
the most common reason is that doctors have identified anomalies and advise what 's known as a " therapeutic termination . " but with germany 's federal statistics office reporting that late abortions are on the rise , the government plans to take measures to curb the trend . the governing coalition 's parliamentary leaders , christian democrat volker kauder and social democrat peter struck , met with the heads of the protestant and catholic churches in germany , bishop wolfgang huber and cardinal karl lehmann , on tuesday .

" a suspected disability alone does not justify a termination , " said johannes singhammer of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . the cdu has the backing of the german chamber of physicians , which supports the three-day consideration period and also proposes limiting women 's autonomy of choice . financial reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to reduce the number of abortions carried out more than 120,000 abortions are carried out in germany every year , around 80 percent of which are paid by health insurance funds or - if there are valid medical or social reasons - through social welfare schemes . further reforms to abortion legislation up for discussion are financially motivated .
a woman having an abortion does n't have to pay for the procedure .
conservatives are now proposing that women should take on at least part of the cost . " i think that the women also have to assume a share of the responsibility .
and if they are able to assume a share of the financial costs , then we need to make that possible , " said helma orosz , a christian democrat and social affairs minister in the state of saxony . but family counseling associations , like pro familia , say that plans to bill patients depending on their incomes would cause a lot of problems . " if your income is very low already , and if the amount you have to pay increases - meaning that women would have to come up with the 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- that an abortion costs on the average - then it would put many of them in a difficult situation , " said pro familia doctor christina schneider .
" i do n't believe that 's an appropriate way to reduce the number of abortions , if that 's what politicians who support this are thinking . " further factors some lawmakers say the issue is n't just about money , but also about protecting the lives of the unborn .
pro familia says experiences at its centers show that finances do not always play a key role when it comes to abortion - and that women who want an abortion will get one . doctors also fear that forcing women to bear the costs of the procedure would bring a host of other problems . " in some circumstances , women might try to save money by going to colleagues who were willing to do it on the cheap , " said matthias david from berlin 's charité clinic .
" maybe they would n't go to doctors at all , and would try to find the means for non-medical abortions .
maybe they would begin going abroad again , as they did for awhile , when women went to the netherlands because it did n't cost as much for the procedure .
from a medical viewpoint , that would not be a practice we would welcome .

but some ministers already know how they would spend it - trying to boost the birth rate in germany . " the money we would save could be used to provide more support for those who - for whatever reason - are trying to have a child using in-vitro fertilization , " said orosz .

the fair runs until sept 23 . this year 's combination trade show , conference and festival is overshadowed by plunging cd sales worldwide amidst turmoil in the music industry over new web-based music sources .
more than 2,000 musicians are converging on berlin for the event in hopes of signing lucrative contracts with major labels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popkomm brainstorms on saving the future of the music industry like every year , executives and industry experts will be huddling to come up with strategies for saving the industry .
" viral marketing " is one of those strategies , involving word-of-mouth marketing via web logs , internet forums , chat rooms and such wide-open cyber-venues as myspace and youtube .
marketing strategists cite the band arctic monkeys as an example of how to break the mould on traditional marketing .
learning from the arctic monkeys the four young brits defied conventional industry wisdom by side-stepping time-honored marketing procedures and making their music available free of charge via the world wide web .
the resulting word-of-mouth buzz propelled them to the top of the charts . the arctic monkeys thus made obsolete the traditional procedure of pressing a demo and hawking it to label executives and radio station program playlist managers .
the group cut out the middleman by starting their own homepage on the internet and offering their demo singles as free downloads .
they burned their own cds and distributed them free of charge at live gigs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british band arctic monkeys revolutionized how music is marketed unbothered by the fact that fans copied their cds and distributed them to friends , the british band seemed to accept it as a necessary step towards fame and - eventually - to fortune .
and it worked .
by the time the arctic monkeys released their debut album last january on domino records , they were so well known that british sales soared to 118,000 within days . not surprisingly , a panel discussion at this year 's popkomm in berlin is entitled " arctic monkeys business style and the future of the music industry . " until now , the conventional wisdom within the industry was that downloading music from the internet was in fact stealing from the artists .
the arctic monkeys turned that argument on its head . and as far as artists are concerned , the industry has been stealing from them all along .
artists tend to receive $ 0.25 -lrb- 19 euro cents -rrb- in royalties on a cd that costs $ 0.50 to produce and which retails for $ 15 - meaning the middlemen get most of the money . against that backdrop , executives have been discussing ways to save the " physical product , " by which they mean the cd , as opposed to web-based products , which are beyond their control . fighting piracy and illegal downloads another issue that will take center stage at the music fair is the problem of illegal downloads and piracy . german recording industry figures for the first half of 2006 will be released during popkomm and are expected to show yet another decline in sales , this time by about 3.4 per cent .
industry analysts put the first-half figure at 54.6 million albums , which , though bad , is better than they had feared a year ago . " it 's a good sign , " said michael haentjes , a german industry spokesman .
" sales are still very soft but are not off as much as they could have been .
the problem of course is the nagging problems of widespread downloads and piracy . " the bright spot in a gloomy industry landscape is the online market .
in the first half of 2005 , 7.5 million music titles were bought online in germany via itunes , musicload and others .
by contrast , online sales for the first half of 2006 are expected to top 12 million . even so , those figures are not as high as the german music industry had hoped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piracy has eaten into cd sales worldwide " piracy is insidious and is putting the brake on online sell-through , ' said haentjes .
" coming up with ways to curtail piracy is the major topic we 'll be discussing . " berlin is a high-profile venue for these deliberations because the german government is in the processing of drafting a new law that would stiffen penalties for copyright violations , extending them to include internet downloads . popkomm has invited german lawmakers to panel discussions to ensure that the industry 's concerns are covered by the wording of the new law . as the panels hold their deliberations , music-lovers will be treated to a marathon festival of live concerts offering more than 600 hours of performances by 400 acts over four nights . the fair will conclude saturday night with a gala club night featuring artists from 26 countries .

" the ultra-sound shows the fetus has a congenital abnormality " are the last words a pregnant woman wants to hear from her doctor .
when it does happen , she faces a difficult choice - raise a child that might require life-long care and medical treatment , or have a late abortion . technically , this is one that takes place after the 23rd week .
the most common reason is that doctors have identified anomalies and advise what 's known as a " therapeutic termination . " but with germany 's federal statistics office reporting that late abortions are on the rise , the government plans to take measures to curb the trend . the governing coalition 's parliamentary leaders , christian democrat volker kauder and social democrat peter struck , met with the heads of the protestant and catholic churches in germany , bishop wolfgang huber and cardinal karl lehmann , on tuesday .
struck said his party saw no need to change the laws regarding abortion .
the two governing parties , however , had agreed to review the legislation in their coalition agreement . disability alone no reason for abortion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abortion after 23 weeks is permitted if the baby endangers a woman 's mental or physical health before having an abortion even within the standard 12 weeks permitted in germany , a woman must first visit a counseling center - although she is not required to explain why she does n't want to carry the fetus to full term . conservatives are now calling for the introduction of the same obligatory counseling session for women considering a late termination , as well as the three-day consideration period . " a suspected disability alone does not justify a termination , " said johannes singhammer of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . the cdu has the backing of the german chamber of physicians , which supports the three-day consideration period and also proposes limiting women 's autonomy of choice . financial reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to reduce the number of abortions carried out more than 120,000 abortions are carried out in germany every year , around 80 percent of which are paid by health insurance funds or - if there are valid medical or social reasons - through social welfare schemes . further reforms to abortion legislation up for discussion are financially motivated .
a woman having an abortion does n't have to pay for the procedure .
conservatives are now proposing that women should take on at least part of the cost . " i think that the women also have to assume a share of the responsibility .
and if they are able to assume a share of the financial costs , then we need to make that possible , " said helma orosz , a christian democrat and social affairs minister in the state of saxony . but family counseling associations , like pro familia , say that plans to bill patients depending on their incomes would cause a lot of problems . " if your income is very low already , and if the amount you have to pay increases - meaning that women would have to come up with the 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- that an abortion costs on the average - then it would put many of them in a difficult situation , " said pro familia doctor christina schneider .

by letting 2.5 million of its kids live in poverty , germany is letting its greatest resource slip through its fingers , writes dw 's helle jeppesen . forget the conventions on children 's rights .
in germany , the fate of children is dependent on parents and the state , not on their needs or potential . kids who grow up in socially disadvantaged families often have difficulties breaking the vicious circle later in life .
a career as a welfare recipient can be pre-programmed for generations . everywhere in the world , poverty endangers people 's health and work .
in germany , one of the richest countries in the world , there are plenty of warnings that child poverty also endangers the future of society as a whole . wasti n g huma n capital according to the pisa study , children in socially disadvantaged families have very little chance of receiving education . unesco has warned that support for underprivileged children is scarce .
and just last week an oecd study was released that indicated germany is letting its only notable resource lie idle - human capital . there are n't many countries in europe where so few children and young people graduate from high school or college as in germany .
yet those in the german economy complain about the shortage of skilled employees , which can only be alleviated by importing labor from countries that desperately need qualified workers of their own . educatio n gaps lead to u n employme n t thus , germany 's educational catastrophe takes on an international dimension .
a country that could have afforded to train employees has managed to create an army of mainly unqualified job-seekers . one of the wealthiest countries in the world has also reaped 2.5 million children living in poverty , knowing that they are excluded from the german education system . according to the united nations ' convention on the rights of the child , which germany has also signed , every child has the right to education .
germany actively supports this right in its development policy abroad , though it is not practiced at home . import-export of labor will co n ti n ue when many children in germany do n't complete a high school degree because of social reasons , when children from underprivileged families or families with immigrant backgrounds have practically no chance of getting job training , then the state has failed ruefully . the resource that the whole world is dependent on , the human resource , will continue to flow from the poorer countries to the wealthy ones , just like metal and other raw materials during colonial times . helle jeppesen -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neglected children in the spotlight on international kids ' day international children 's day is an opportunity to consider the hardships - hunger , neglect , sickness , war - faced by millions of children .

even in germany , more children suffer than many people realize . bellem tried to hold on to the moon-shaped pumpkin slices , but they kept slipping out of her hand . " this is the only place i can cook because my mother never lets me , " she said .
" i ask her almost every day , ' can i cook with you ? ' but she says , ' no , i do n't feel like it . " ' bellem 's cooking club for seven- to 12-year-olds is sponsored by a child protection group in cologne .
the idea is to offer parents some relief so that they do n't feel too burdened to take proper care of their children . 10 percent neglect rate in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicef aims to cut the child mortality rate among under-five-year-olds by two-thirds one in 10 children in germany is severely neglected , according to some statistics .
that might mean they do n't get enough to eat or are n't taken care of when they 're sick .
or perhaps they freeze in the winter because their parents do n't dress them warmly enough . " often these parents were neglected as children themselves , " said renate blum-maurice from the cologne child protection group .
ultimately , many factors can play a role , she added - the marriage gets rocky , the baby is born handicapped , or dad loses his job . the united nations initiated international children 's day in 1954 to draw attention to the dangers children face , including neglect .
it is now celebrated annually in more than 145 countries , in german-speaking countries primarily on sept .
20 . child poverty rising disproportionately in developing countries , where millions of children face extreme poverty , malnutrition and war , the situation is even more drastic .
but even in germany , more than 50 years after international children 's day was founded , some 2.5 million children and youths live off of social welfare , according to the federal child protection agency . unicef , which spearheads the annual day of recognition , estimates that poverty among children in germany has increased disproportionately to the rest of the population over the past decade . bellem and her cooking partners do n't live in dire need .
they are not among the world 's 2.1 billion children and youths suffering through a life of extreme poverty .
and the child protection group in cologne is doing what it can to keep it that way . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de end in sight to global problem of child labor some 218 million children worldwide are forced to work .

the fair runs until sept 23 . this year 's combination trade show , conference and festival is overshadowed by plunging cd sales worldwide amidst turmoil in the music industry over new web-based music sources .
more than 2,000 musicians are converging on berlin for the event in hopes of signing lucrative contracts with major labels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popkomm brainstorms on saving the future of the music industry like every year , executives and industry experts will be huddling to come up with strategies for saving the industry .
" viral marketing " is one of those strategies , involving word-of-mouth marketing via web logs , internet forums , chat rooms and such wide-open cyber-venues as myspace and youtube .
marketing strategists cite the band arctic monkeys as an example of how to break the mould on traditional marketing .
learning from the arctic monkeys the four young brits defied conventional industry wisdom by side-stepping time-honored marketing procedures and making their music available free of charge via the world wide web .
the resulting word-of-mouth buzz propelled them to the top of the charts . the arctic monkeys thus made obsolete the traditional procedure of pressing a demo and hawking it to label executives and radio station program playlist managers .
the group cut out the middleman by starting their own homepage on the internet and offering their demo singles as free downloads .
they burned their own cds and distributed them free of charge at live gigs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british band arctic monkeys revolutionized how music is marketed unbothered by the fact that fans copied their cds and distributed them to friends , the british band seemed to accept it as a necessary step towards fame and - eventually - to fortune .
and it worked .
by the time the arctic monkeys released their debut album last january on domino records , they were so well known that british sales soared to 118,000 within days . not surprisingly , a panel discussion at this year 's popkomm in berlin is entitled " arctic monkeys business style and the future of the music industry . " until now , the conventional wisdom within the industry was that downloading music from the internet was in fact stealing from the artists .
the arctic monkeys turned that argument on its head . and as far as artists are concerned , the industry has been stealing from them all along .
artists tend to receive $ 0.25 -lrb- 19 euro cents -rrb- in royalties on a cd that costs $ 0.50 to produce and which retails for $ 15 - meaning the middlemen get most of the money . against that backdrop , executives have been discussing ways to save the " physical product , " by which they mean the cd , as opposed to web-based products , which are beyond their control . fighting piracy and illegal downloads another issue that will take center stage at the music fair is the problem of illegal downloads and piracy . german recording industry figures for the first half of 2006 will be released during popkomm and are expected to show yet another decline in sales , this time by about 3.4 per cent .
industry analysts put the first-half figure at 54.6 million albums , which , though bad , is better than they had feared a year ago . " it 's a good sign , " said michael haentjes , a german industry spokesman .
" sales are still very soft but are not off as much as they could have been .
the problem of course is the nagging problems of widespread downloads and piracy . " the bright spot in a gloomy industry landscape is the online market .
in the first half of 2005 , 7.5 million music titles were bought online in germany via itunes , musicload and others .
by contrast , online sales for the first half of 2006 are expected to top 12 million . even so , those figures are not as high as the german music industry had hoped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piracy has eaten into cd sales worldwide " piracy is insidious and is putting the brake on online sell-through , ' said haentjes .
" coming up with ways to curtail piracy is the major topic we 'll be discussing . " berlin is a high-profile venue for these deliberations because the german government is in the processing of drafting a new law that would stiffen penalties for copyright violations , extending them to include internet downloads . popkomm has invited german lawmakers to panel discussions to ensure that the industry 's concerns are covered by the wording of the new law . as the panels hold their deliberations , music-lovers will be treated to a marathon festival of live concerts offering more than 600 hours of performances by 400 acts over four nights . the fair will conclude saturday night with a gala club night featuring artists from 26 countries .

even in germany , more children suffer than many people realize . bellem tried to hold on to the moon-shaped pumpkin slices , but they kept slipping out of her hand . " this is the only place i can cook because my mother never lets me , " she said .
" i ask her almost every day , ' can i cook with you ? ' but she says , ' no , i do n't feel like it . " ' bellem 's cooking club for seven- to 12-year-olds is sponsored by a child protection group in cologne .
the idea is to offer parents some relief so that they do n't feel too burdened to take proper care of their children . 10 percent neglect rate in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicef aims to cut the child mortality rate among under-five-year-olds by two-thirds one in 10 children in germany is severely neglected , according to some statistics .
that might mean they do n't get enough to eat or are n't taken care of when they 're sick .
or perhaps they freeze in the winter because their parents do n't dress them warmly enough . " often these parents were neglected as children themselves , " said renate blum-maurice from the cologne child protection group .
ultimately , many factors can play a role , she added - the marriage gets rocky , the baby is born handicapped , or dad loses his job . the united nations initiated international children 's day in 1954 to draw attention to the dangers children face , including neglect .
it is now celebrated annually in more than 145 countries , in german-speaking countries primarily on sept .
20 . child poverty rising disproportionately in developing countries , where millions of children face extreme poverty , malnutrition and war , the situation is even more drastic .
but even in germany , more than 50 years after international children 's day was founded , some 2.5 million children and youths live off of social welfare , according to the federal child protection agency . unicef , which spearheads the annual day of recognition , estimates that poverty among children in germany has increased disproportionately to the rest of the population over the past decade . bellem and her cooking partners do n't live in dire need .
they are not among the world 's 2.1 billion children and youths suffering through a life of extreme poverty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 20.09.2006 government discusses reducing late abortions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many , a late termination is a last resort parliamentary leaders met with church representatives tuesday to talk about reforming legislation on late abortions , as conservatives push for more stringent controls on terminations and a re-think of who foots the bill . " the ultra-sound shows the fetus has a congenital abnormality " are the last words a pregnant woman wants to hear from her doctor .
when it does happen , she faces a difficult choice - raise a child that might require life-long care and medical treatment , or have a late abortion . technically , this is one that takes place after the 23rd week .
the most common reason is that doctors have identified anomalies and advise what 's known as a " therapeutic termination . " but with germany 's federal statistics office reporting that late abortions are on the rise , the government plans to take measures to curb the trend . the governing coalition 's parliamentary leaders , christian democrat volker kauder and social democrat peter struck , met with the heads of the protestant and catholic churches in germany , bishop wolfgang huber and cardinal karl lehmann , on tuesday .
struck said his party saw no need to change the laws regarding abortion .
the two governing parties , however , had agreed to review the legislation in their coalition agreement . disability alone no reason for abortion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abortion after 23 weeks is permitted if the baby endangers a woman 's mental or physical health before having an abortion even within the standard 12 weeks permitted in germany , a woman must first visit a counseling center - although she is not required to explain why she does n't want to carry the fetus to full term . conservatives are now calling for the introduction of the same obligatory counseling session for women considering a late termination , as well as the three-day consideration period .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 20.09.2006 ailing music industry casts around for solutions at berlin fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's show time again : the popkomm music fair gets into the act artists and representatives of the global music industry will gather in berlin at the popkomm music fair that opens wednesday to discuss innovative ways to combat piracy and illegal downloads . more than 15,000 visitors are expected to throng the 800 exhibition booths at berlin 's international congress center for the 18th popkomm international business platform for music and entertainment .
the fair runs until sept 23 . this year 's combination trade show , conference and festival is overshadowed by plunging cd sales worldwide amidst turmoil in the music industry over new web-based music sources .
more than 2,000 musicians are converging on berlin for the event in hopes of signing lucrative contracts with major labels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popkomm brainstorms on saving the future of the music industry like every year , executives and industry experts will be huddling to come up with strategies for saving the industry .
" viral marketing " is one of those strategies , involving word-of-mouth marketing via web logs , internet forums , chat rooms and such wide-open cyber-venues as myspace and youtube .
marketing strategists cite the band arctic monkeys as an example of how to break the mould on traditional marketing .
learning from the arctic monkeys the four young brits defied conventional industry wisdom by side-stepping time-honored marketing procedures and making their music available free of charge via the world wide web .
the resulting word-of-mouth buzz propelled them to the top of the charts . the arctic monkeys thus made obsolete the traditional procedure of pressing a demo and hawking it to label executives and radio station program playlist managers .
the group cut out the middleman by starting their own homepage on the internet and offering their demo singles as free downloads .
they burned their own cds and distributed them free of charge at live gigs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british band arctic monkeys revolutionized how music is marketed unbothered by the fact that fans copied their cds and distributed them to friends , the british band seemed to accept it as a necessary step towards fame and - eventually - to fortune .
and it worked .
by the time the arctic monkeys released their debut album last january on domino records , they were so well known that british sales soared to 118,000 within days . not surprisingly , a panel discussion at this year 's popkomm in berlin is entitled " arctic monkeys business style and the future of the music industry . " until now , the conventional wisdom within the industry was that downloading music from the internet was in fact stealing from the artists .
the arctic monkeys turned that argument on its head . and as far as artists are concerned , the industry has been stealing from them all along .
artists tend to receive $ 0.25 -lrb- 19 euro cents -rrb- in royalties on a cd that costs $ 0.50 to produce and which retails for $ 15 - meaning the middlemen get most of the money . against that backdrop , executives have been discussing ways to save the " physical product , " by which they mean the cd , as opposed to web-based products , which are beyond their control . fighting piracy and illegal downloads another issue that will take center stage at the music fair is the problem of illegal downloads and piracy . german recording industry figures for the first half of 2006 will be released during popkomm and are expected to show yet another decline in sales , this time by about 3.4 per cent .
industry analysts put the first-half figure at 54.6 million albums , which , though bad , is better than they had feared a year ago . " it 's a good sign , " said michael haentjes , a german industry spokesman .
" sales are still very soft but are not off as much as they could have been .
the problem of course is the nagging problems of widespread downloads and piracy . " the bright spot in a gloomy industry landscape is the online market .
in the first half of 2005 , 7.5 million music titles were bought online in germany via itunes , musicload and others .
by contrast , online sales for the first half of 2006 are expected to top 12 million . even so , those figures are not as high as the german music industry had hoped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piracy has eaten into cd sales worldwide " piracy is insidious and is putting the brake on online sell-through , ' said haentjes .
" coming up with ways to curtail piracy is the major topic we 'll be discussing . " berlin is a high-profile venue for these deliberations because the german government is in the processing of drafting a new law that would stiffen penalties for copyright violations , extending them to include internet downloads . popkomm has invited german lawmakers to panel discussions to ensure that the industry 's concerns are covered by the wording of the new law . as the panels hold their deliberations , music-lovers will be treated to a marathon festival of live concerts offering more than 600 hours of performances by 400 acts over four nights . the fair will conclude saturday night with a gala club night featuring artists from 26 countries .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the pope needs an advisor who knows the opinion , the temperature , on the streets !
has he not witnessed the uproar over the psychological operation known as the danish cartoons ?
would he dare to balance his remarks with criticism of american fundamentalist christian holy warriors ?
why not ?
how about critique of the notorious passages in the talmud ?
meanwhile the text and thrust of his very interesting and thoughtful speech has been lost due to ignorance of the tensions and motives which lurk under the landscape . - klaatu as a devoted muslim and an indonesian by birth , i strongly believe that the pontiff 's comment on islam was misunderstood by my fellow muslims .
i am always tolerant towards every religion no matter the difference of its worshipping towards the creator . - endoeng sasmito i do not expect the present pope to accomplish much in his period of papacy .
he has already started on the wrong foot and might ignite more hatred between muslims and christians . - abdul ataa no amount of intellectual sophistication can hide that in his core , ratzinger has remained a catholic bavarian village yokel . - diet simon the pope 's remarks have been taken out of context .
he actually was promoting interfaith dialogue .
the actual paragraph in question was not his words - he was quoting .
he also said he found the sentiment expressed therein a bit strong .
it is disappointing to see how muslim clerics have chosen to take the whole thing out of context , thereby using it for their own motives .
those demonstrating on the streets have likely never read the speech and have most probably been told that these were the actual words of the pope .
there are too many people out there ready to hate - sadly particularly muslims - a faith which is supposed to be tolerant and peaceful .
the pope should never apologize . - dia n a bishop , fra n ce i expect the pope to create further division between christianity and islam .
the pope 's very unfortunate remarks are going to spark a worldwide controversy that will further the hatred already seen in so many different conflicts throughout the world .
perhaps the pope is a bit delusional in his thinking .
he should apologize , and resign .
this will help build back the vote of confidence that the catholic church so desperately will need in the very near future . - christia n fiech i concur with those who believe that the present pope was referring to islam in an historical context .
these remarks have been taken out of context .
hopefully , the islamic population worldwide will carefully analyze the whole discourse and appreciate what the underlying message is . - mauree n t. couch , australia i have read the whole speech , which is very long and very complex .
the real pity is that the media only quoted one sentence .
the most interesting part of the speech was , and this is like a " fingerprint " of this pope , criticism of the " modern times " and criticism of the western " way of life . "
very interesting was the part on the " dialogue of cultures , " which can not take place if the western world excludes god from its life .
it seems to me as if the pope wanted to begin a public discussion on the legitimizing of violence on the one side , and on the role of faith and sense in our western world . - ludwig meyerhoff , germa n y it was stupid for him to quote a 14th century byzantine emperor .
open mouth , insert foot .
of course , the muslims will react badly to a denigration of their prophet and their religion .
how much better to comment on the positive and loving side of islam and refer to the violent side of christianity , particularly in bosnia and between the serbs and croats , saying hostility has no place in any religion . - patty rola n d compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's apology fails to stem anger of muslim hardliners pope benedict xvi 's personal apology for hurting the feelings of muslims with a controversial speech failed to stem the anger of hardliners despite calls for calm from islamic and western leaders .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the pope needs an advisor who knows the opinion , the temperature , on the streets !
has he not witnessed the uproar over the psychological operation known as the danish cartoons ?
would he dare to balance his remarks with criticism of american fundamentalist christian holy warriors ?
why not ?
how about critique of the notorious passages in the talmud ?
meanwhile the text and thrust of his very interesting and thoughtful speech has been lost due to ignorance of the tensions and motives which lurk under the landscape . - klaatu as a devoted muslim and an indonesian by birth , i strongly believe that the pontiff 's comment on islam was misunderstood by my fellow muslims .
i am always tolerant towards every religion no matter the difference of its worshipping towards the creator . - endoeng sasmito i do not expect the present pope to accomplish much in his period of papacy .
he has already started on the wrong foot and might ignite more hatred between muslims and christians . - abdul ataa no amount of intellectual sophistication can hide that in his core , ratzinger has remained a catholic bavarian village yokel . - diet simon the pope 's remarks have been taken out of context .
he actually was promoting interfaith dialogue .
the actual paragraph in question was not his words - he was quoting .
he also said he found the sentiment expressed therein a bit strong .
it is disappointing to see how muslim clerics have chosen to take the whole thing out of context , thereby using it for their own motives .
those demonstrating on the streets have likely never read the speech and have most probably been told that these were the actual words of the pope .
there are too many people out there ready to hate - sadly particularly muslims - a faith which is supposed to be tolerant and peaceful .
the pope should never apologize . - dia n a bishop , fra n ce i expect the pope to create further division between christianity and islam .
the pope 's very unfortunate remarks are going to spark a worldwide controversy that will further the hatred already seen in so many different conflicts throughout the world .
perhaps the pope is a bit delusional in his thinking .
he should apologize , and resign .
this will help build back the vote of confidence that the catholic church so desperately will need in the very near future . - christia n fiech i concur with those who believe that the present pope was referring to islam in an historical context .
these remarks have been taken out of context .
hopefully , the islamic population worldwide will carefully analyze the whole discourse and appreciate what the underlying message is . - mauree n t. couch , australia i have read the whole speech , which is very long and very complex .
the real pity is that the media only quoted one sentence .
the most interesting part of the speech was , and this is like a " fingerprint " of this pope , criticism of the " modern times " and criticism of the western " way of life . "
very interesting was the part on the " dialogue of cultures , " which can not take place if the western world excludes god from its life .
it seems to me as if the pope wanted to begin a public discussion on the legitimizing of violence on the one side , and on the role of faith and sense in our western world . - ludwig meyerhoff , germa n y it was stupid for him to quote a 14th century byzantine emperor .
open mouth , insert foot .
of course , the muslims will react badly to a denigration of their prophet and their religion .

" the minister made her comments to the stuttgarter zeitu n g , at the beginning of the 66th annual meeting of the association of german law professionals in stuttgart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries would like to give legal weight to living wills zypries wants to codify living wills , in which patients determine their own guidelines on resuscitation and the right to die , in civil law .
this will give doctors clearer guidelines for treatment , she said . legal repercussio n s should living wills be granted legal status , " if a patient is clearly opposed to a certain treatment measure , then the doctor will have to refrain from doing it . "
otherwise the physician could be indicted for assault and battery , zypris told the neue os n abrücker zeitu n g newspaper . however , zypries said demands to make people who passively assist suicide exempt from legal penalties were unnecessary . hospice group i n favor the german hospice association welcomed zypries ' position . " an explicit standardization of allowed forms of assisted-suicide has no place in criminal law , " association head eugen brysch told reporters . to do so could be mistakenly seen as a step toward the " increasing acceptance of actively assisted suicide , " he added . he agreed it made sense to make living wills an aspect of german statute law , which are already recognized in case law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much should patients decide over their own treatment ?
" the parliament has a clear duty to give living wills a legal basis , by passing it into law , " brysch said , adding that germany needs to finally allow its citizens self-determination , and allow them to right to protect their integrity through a living will . on wednesday at the stuttgart meeting , bonn-based criminal lawyer torsten verrel plans to clarify his demands to expressly decriminalize passive assisted-suicide and the shutting down of life-support systems .
without this , doctors ' fears of lawsuits lead to " extensive exculpatory medicine , " and an " inadequate reduction in suffering , " he told the afp news agency . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing physician-assisted death around seven million germans have written a living will .

20 .
by letting 2.5 million of its kids live in poverty , germany is letting its greatest resource slip through its fingers , writes dw 's helle jeppesen . forget the conventions on children 's rights .
in germany , the fate of children is dependent on parents and the state , not on their needs or potential . kids who grow up in socially disadvantaged families often have difficulties breaking the vicious circle later in life .
a career as a welfare recipient can be pre-programmed for generations . everywhere in the world , poverty endangers people 's health and work .
in germany , one of the richest countries in the world , there are plenty of warnings that child poverty also endangers the future of society as a whole . wasti n g huma n capital according to the pisa study , children in socially disadvantaged families have very little chance of receiving education . unesco has warned that support for underprivileged children is scarce .
and just last week an oecd study was released that indicated germany is letting its only notable resource lie idle - human capital . there are n't many countries in europe where so few children and young people graduate from high school or college as in germany .
yet those in the german economy complain about the shortage of skilled employees , which can only be alleviated by importing labor from countries that desperately need qualified workers of their own . educatio n gaps lead to u n employme n t thus , germany 's educational catastrophe takes on an international dimension .
a country that could have afforded to train employees has managed to create an army of mainly unqualified job-seekers . one of the wealthiest countries in the world has also reaped 2.5 million children living in poverty , knowing that they are excluded from the german education system . according to the united nations ' convention on the rights of the child , which germany has also signed , every child has the right to education .
germany actively supports this right in its development policy abroad , though it is not practiced at home . import-export of labor will co n ti n ue when many children in germany do n't complete a high school degree because of social reasons , when children from underprivileged families or families with immigrant backgrounds have practically no chance of getting job training , then the state has failed ruefully . the resource that the whole world is dependent on , the human resource , will continue to flow from the poorer countries to the wealthy ones , just like metal and other raw materials during colonial times . helle jeppesen -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neglected children in the spotlight on international kids ' day international children 's day is an opportunity to consider the hardships - hunger , neglect , sickness , war - faced by millions of children .
even in germany , more children suffer than many people realize .
-lrb- 20.09.2006 -rrb- german schools trail significantly in immigrant education a newly published pisa study reveals that children of immigrants have fewer chances to succeed in german schools than they do in almost any other industrial state .
-lrb- 16.05.2006 -rrb- germany performs poorly in oecd latest education study a new international study shows germany 's education system has dropped behind those of other industrialized nations .
in response , the german teachers ' union called for a new education strategy .
-lrb- 13.09.2006 -rrb- feedback how should germany approach its education policy , particularly in light of the 2.5 million german children living in poverty ?

even in germany , more children suffer than many people realize . bellem tried to hold on to the moon-shaped pumpkin slices , but they kept slipping out of her hand . " this is the only place i can cook because my mother never lets me , " she said .
" i ask her almost every day , ' can i cook with you ? ' but she says , ' no , i do n't feel like it . " ' bellem 's cooking club for seven- to 12-year-olds is sponsored by a child protection group in cologne .
the idea is to offer parents some relief so that they do n't feel too burdened to take proper care of their children . 10 percent neglect rate in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicef aims to cut the child mortality rate among under-five-year-olds by two-thirds one in 10 children in germany is severely neglected , according to some statistics .
that might mean they do n't get enough to eat or are n't taken care of when they 're sick .
or perhaps they freeze in the winter because their parents do n't dress them warmly enough . " often these parents were neglected as children themselves , " said renate blum-maurice from the cologne child protection group .
ultimately , many factors can play a role , she added - the marriage gets rocky , the baby is born handicapped , or dad loses his job . the united nations initiated international children 's day in 1954 to draw attention to the dangers children face , including neglect .
it is now celebrated annually in more than 145 countries , in german-speaking countries primarily on sept .
20 . child poverty rising disproportionately in developing countries , where millions of children face extreme poverty , malnutrition and war , the situation is even more drastic .
but even in germany , more than 50 years after international children 's day was founded , some 2.5 million children and youths live off of social welfare , according to the federal child protection agency . unicef , which spearheads the annual day of recognition , estimates that poverty among children in germany has increased disproportionately to the rest of the population over the past decade . bellem and her cooking partners do n't live in dire need .
they are not among the world 's 2.1 billion children and youths suffering through a life of extreme poverty .

the fair runs until sept 23 . this year 's combination trade show , conference and festival is overshadowed by plunging cd sales worldwide amidst turmoil in the music industry over new web-based music sources .

" viral marketing " is one of those strategies , involving word-of-mouth marketing via web logs , internet forums , chat rooms and such wide-open cyber-venues as myspace and youtube .
marketing strategists cite the band arctic monkeys as an example of how to break the mould on traditional marketing .
learning from the arctic monkeys the four young brits defied conventional industry wisdom by side-stepping time-honored marketing procedures and making their music available free of charge via the world wide web .
the resulting word-of-mouth buzz propelled them to the top of the charts . the arctic monkeys thus made obsolete the traditional procedure of pressing a demo and hawking it to label executives and radio station program playlist managers .
the group cut out the middleman by starting their own homepage on the internet and offering their demo singles as free downloads .
they burned their own cds and distributed them free of charge at live gigs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british band arctic monkeys revolutionized how music is marketed unbothered by the fact that fans copied their cds and distributed them to friends , the british band seemed to accept it as a necessary step towards fame and - eventually - to fortune .
and it worked .
by the time the arctic monkeys released their debut album last january on domino records , they were so well known that british sales soared to 118,000 within days . not surprisingly , a panel discussion at this year 's popkomm in berlin is entitled " arctic monkeys business style and the future of the music industry . " until now , the conventional wisdom within the industry was that downloading music from the internet was in fact stealing from the artists .
the arctic monkeys turned that argument on its head . and as far as artists are concerned , the industry has been stealing from them all along .
artists tend to receive $ 0.25 -lrb- 19 euro cents -rrb- in royalties on a cd that costs $ 0.50 to produce and which retails for $ 15 - meaning the middlemen get most of the money . against that backdrop , executives have been discussing ways to save the " physical product , " by which they mean the cd , as opposed to web-based products , which are beyond their control . fighting piracy and illegal downloads another issue that will take center stage at the music fair is the problem of illegal downloads and piracy . german recording industry figures for the first half of 2006 will be released during popkomm and are expected to show yet another decline in sales , this time by about 3.4 per cent .
industry analysts put the first-half figure at 54.6 million albums , which , though bad , is better than they had feared a year ago . " it 's a good sign , " said michael haentjes , a german industry spokesman .
" sales are still very soft but are not off as much as they could have been .
the problem of course is the nagging problems of widespread downloads and piracy . " the bright spot in a gloomy industry landscape is the online market .
in the first half of 2005 , 7.5 million music titles were bought online in germany via itunes , musicload and others .
by contrast , online sales for the first half of 2006 are expected to top 12 million . even so , those figures are not as high as the german music industry had hoped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piracy has eaten into cd sales worldwide " piracy is insidious and is putting the brake on online sell-through , ' said haentjes .
" coming up with ways to curtail piracy is the major topic we 'll be discussing . " berlin is a high-profile venue for these deliberations because the german government is in the processing of drafting a new law that would stiffen penalties for copyright violations , extending them to include internet downloads . popkomm has invited german lawmakers to panel discussions to ensure that the industry 's concerns are covered by the wording of the new law . as the panels hold their deliberations , music-lovers will be treated to a marathon festival of live concerts offering more than 600 hours of performances by 400 acts over four nights . the fair will conclude saturday night with a gala club night featuring artists from 26 countries .

by the time the arctic monkeys released their debut album last january on domino records , they were so well known that british sales soared to 118,000 within days . not surprisingly , a panel discussion at this year 's popkomm in berlin is entitled " arctic monkeys business style and the future of the music industry . " until now , the conventional wisdom within the industry was that downloading music from the internet was in fact stealing from the artists .
the arctic monkeys turned that argument on its head . and as far as artists are concerned , the industry has been stealing from them all along .
artists tend to receive $ 0.25 -lrb- 19 euro cents -rrb- in royalties on a cd that costs $ 0.50 to produce and which retails for $ 15 - meaning the middlemen get most of the money . against that backdrop , executives have been discussing ways to save the " physical product , " by which they mean the cd , as opposed to web-based products , which are beyond their control . fighting piracy and illegal downloads another issue that will take center stage at the music fair is the problem of illegal downloads and piracy . german recording industry figures for the first half of 2006 will be released during popkomm and are expected to show yet another decline in sales , this time by about 3.4 per cent .
industry analysts put the first-half figure at 54.6 million albums , which , though bad , is better than they had feared a year ago . " it 's a good sign , " said michael haentjes , a german industry spokesman .
" sales are still very soft but are not off as much as they could have been .
the problem of course is the nagging problems of widespread downloads and piracy . " the bright spot in a gloomy industry landscape is the online market .
in the first half of 2005 , 7.5 million music titles were bought online in germany via itunes , musicload and others .
by contrast , online sales for the first half of 2006 are expected to top 12 million . even so , those figures are not as high as the german music industry had hoped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piracy has eaten into cd sales worldwide " piracy is insidious and is putting the brake on online sell-through , ' said haentjes .

the fair runs until sept 23 . this year 's combination trade show , conference and festival is overshadowed by plunging cd sales worldwide amidst turmoil in the music industry over new web-based music sources .
more than 2,000 musicians are converging on berlin for the event in hopes of signing lucrative contracts with major labels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popkomm brainstorms on saving the future of the music industry like every year , executives and industry experts will be huddling to come up with strategies for saving the industry .
" viral marketing " is one of those strategies , involving word-of-mouth marketing via web logs , internet forums , chat rooms and such wide-open cyber-venues as myspace and youtube .
marketing strategists cite the band arctic monkeys as an example of how to break the mould on traditional marketing .
learning from the arctic monkeys the four young brits defied conventional industry wisdom by side-stepping time-honored marketing procedures and making their music available free of charge via the world wide web .
the resulting word-of-mouth buzz propelled them to the top of the charts . the arctic monkeys thus made obsolete the traditional procedure of pressing a demo and hawking it to label executives and radio station program playlist managers .
the group cut out the middleman by starting their own homepage on the internet and offering their demo singles as free downloads .
they burned their own cds and distributed them free of charge at live gigs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british band arctic monkeys revolutionized how music is marketed unbothered by the fact that fans copied their cds and distributed them to friends , the british band seemed to accept it as a necessary step towards fame and - eventually - to fortune .

" a first contingent of 1,000 soldiers will leave for the middle east on thursday , breaking a postwar taboo for germany .
due to its nazi past , sending german troops to the region near israel is particularly sensitive . " there is perhaps no other area of the world where germany 's unique responsibility , the unique responsibility of every german government to heed the lessons of our past is so clear than it is here , " merkel said in a speech to the bundestag . the german chancellor also promised bundestag members she would press washington to take a more active role in the region , drawing a link between the lebanon and israeli-palestinian conflicts . other europea n n atio n s i n volved two frigates , four fast patrol boats , two supply ships and two helicopters will be deployed by germany in cooperation with naval forces being sent by the netherlands , sweden , norway and denmark . bildunterschrift : spanish marines are also part of the un peacekeeping force in lebanon german naval vessels are expected to arrive off the lebanese coast by early october , given that it takes about 10 days for ships to travel from the north sea to the eastern mediterranean . the mission 's mandate will initially be limited until aug .

" we should be no under illusions just because this is a navy mission and not a ground mission , " westerwelle said . government ministers insisted the mission would bring stability to the region and increase europe 's role as an architect of peace in the middle east . the un is deploying a 15,000-member peacekeeping force in southern lebanon under a ceasefire agreement which last month ended fighting between israel and hezbollah . co n ditio n s met meanwhile , a un spokesman said the number of un peacekeepers in southern lebanon has risen to 5,000 , meeting a condition laid down by israel for withdrawing from its northern neighbor . " we have reached the 5,000 troops , " said alexander ivanko , spokesman for the un interim force in lebanon .
" the first phase of the unifil deployment is now completed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian un soldieres guard a lebanese beach ivanko said that the initial number of about 2,000 unifil troops had been boosted to 5,000 by three new battalions from france , italy and spain . israeli forces have remained in southern lebanon for more than a month after the aug .

" the minister made her comments to the stuttgarter zeitu n g , at the beginning of the 66th annual meeting of the association of german law professionals in stuttgart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries would like to give legal weight to living wills zypries wants to codify living wills , in which patients determine their own guidelines on resuscitation and the right to die , in civil law .
this will give doctors clearer guidelines for treatment , she said . legal repercussio n s should living wills be granted legal status , " if a patient is clearly opposed to a certain treatment measure , then the doctor will have to refrain from doing it . "
otherwise the physician could be indicted for assault and battery , zypris told the neue os n abrücker zeitu n g newspaper . however , zypries said demands to make people who passively assist suicide exempt from legal penalties were unnecessary . hospice group i n favor the german hospice association welcomed zypries ' position . " an explicit standardization of allowed forms of assisted-suicide has no place in criminal law , " association head eugen brysch told reporters . to do so could be mistakenly seen as a step toward the " increasing acceptance of actively assisted suicide , " he added . he agreed it made sense to make living wills an aspect of german statute law , which are already recognized in case law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much should patients decide over their own treatment ?
" the parliament has a clear duty to give living wills a legal basis , by passing it into law , " brysch said , adding that germany needs to finally allow its citizens self-determination , and allow them to right to protect their integrity through a living will . on wednesday at the stuttgart meeting , bonn-based criminal lawyer torsten verrel plans to clarify his demands to expressly decriminalize passive assisted-suicide and the shutting down of life-support systems .
without this , doctors ' fears of lawsuits lead to " extensive exculpatory medicine , " and an " inadequate reduction in suffering , " he told the afp news agency . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing physician-assisted death around seven million germans have written a living will .

" the ultra-sound shows the fetus has a congenital abnormality " are the last words a pregnant woman wants to hear from her doctor .
when it does happen , she faces a difficult choice - raise a child that might require life-long care and medical treatment , or have a late abortion . technically , this is one that takes place after the 23rd week .
the most common reason is that doctors have identified anomalies and advise what 's known as a " therapeutic termination . " but with germany 's federal statistics office reporting that late abortions are on the rise , the government plans to take measures to curb the trend . the governing coalition 's parliamentary leaders , christian democrat volker kauder and social democrat peter struck , met with the heads of the protestant and catholic churches in germany , bishop wolfgang huber and cardinal karl lehmann , on tuesday .
struck said his party saw no need to change the laws regarding abortion .
the two governing parties , however , had agreed to review the legislation in their coalition agreement . disability alone no reason for abortion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abortion after 23 weeks is permitted if the baby endangers a woman 's mental or physical health before having an abortion even within the standard 12 weeks permitted in germany , a woman must first visit a counseling center - although she is not required to explain why she does n't want to carry the fetus to full term . conservatives are now calling for the introduction of the same obligatory counseling session for women considering a late termination , as well as the three-day consideration period . " a suspected disability alone does not justify a termination , " said johannes singhammer of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . the cdu has the backing of the german chamber of physicians , which supports the three-day consideration period and also proposes limiting women 's autonomy of choice . financial reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to reduce the number of abortions carried out more than 120,000 abortions are carried out in germany every year , around 80 percent of which are paid by health insurance funds or - if there are valid medical or social reasons - through social welfare schemes . further reforms to abortion legislation up for discussion are financially motivated .
a woman having an abortion does n't have to pay for the procedure .
conservatives are now proposing that women should take on at least part of the cost . " i think that the women also have to assume a share of the responsibility .
and if they are able to assume a share of the financial costs , then we need to make that possible , " said helma orosz , a christian democrat and social affairs minister in the state of saxony . but family counseling associations , like pro familia , say that plans to bill patients depending on their incomes would cause a lot of problems . " if your income is very low already , and if the amount you have to pay increases - meaning that women would have to come up with the 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- that an abortion costs on the average - then it would put many of them in a difficult situation , " said pro familia doctor christina schneider .
" i do n't believe that 's an appropriate way to reduce the number of abortions , if that 's what politicians who support this are thinking . " further factors some lawmakers say the issue is n't just about money , but also about protecting the lives of the unborn .
pro familia says experiences at its centers show that finances do not always play a key role when it comes to abortion - and that women who want an abortion will get one . doctors also fear that forcing women to bear the costs of the procedure would bring a host of other problems . " in some circumstances , women might try to save money by going to colleagues who were willing to do it on the cheap , " said matthias david from berlin 's charité clinic .
" maybe they would n't go to doctors at all , and would try to find the means for non-medical abortions .
maybe they would begin going abroad again , as they did for awhile , when women went to the netherlands because it did n't cost as much for the procedure .
from a medical viewpoint , that would not be a practice we would welcome . " boosting the birth-rate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birth rates in germany are worryingly low it is n't clear how much money the government would save if these rules go into effect .
but some ministers already know how they would spend it - trying to boost the birth rate in germany . " the money we would save could be used to provide more support for those who - for whatever reason - are trying to have a child using in-vitro fertilization , " said orosz .
" these techniques require a lot more commitment on the part of those involved , some of whom are needy , and to be fair they should also benefit from taxpayer contributions .

the fair runs until sept 23 . this year 's combination trade show , conference and festival is overshadowed by plunging cd sales worldwide amidst turmoil in the music industry over new web-based music sources .
more than 2,000 musicians are converging on berlin for the event in hopes of signing lucrative contracts with major labels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popkomm brainstorms on saving the future of the music industry like every year , executives and industry experts will be huddling to come up with strategies for saving the industry .
" viral marketing " is one of those strategies , involving word-of-mouth marketing via web logs , internet forums , chat rooms and such wide-open cyber-venues as myspace and youtube .
marketing strategists cite the band arctic monkeys as an example of how to break the mould on traditional marketing .
learning from the arctic monkeys the four young brits defied conventional industry wisdom by side-stepping time-honored marketing procedures and making their music available free of charge via the world wide web .
the resulting word-of-mouth buzz propelled them to the top of the charts . the arctic monkeys thus made obsolete the traditional procedure of pressing a demo and hawking it to label executives and radio station program playlist managers .
the group cut out the middleman by starting their own homepage on the internet and offering their demo singles as free downloads .
they burned their own cds and distributed them free of charge at live gigs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british band arctic monkeys revolutionized how music is marketed unbothered by the fact that fans copied their cds and distributed them to friends , the british band seemed to accept it as a necessary step towards fame and - eventually - to fortune .
and it worked .
by the time the arctic monkeys released their debut album last january on domino records , they were so well known that british sales soared to 118,000 within days . not surprisingly , a panel discussion at this year 's popkomm in berlin is entitled " arctic monkeys business style and the future of the music industry . " until now , the conventional wisdom within the industry was that downloading music from the internet was in fact stealing from the artists .
the arctic monkeys turned that argument on its head . and as far as artists are concerned , the industry has been stealing from them all along .
artists tend to receive $ 0.25 -lrb- 19 euro cents -rrb- in royalties on a cd that costs $ 0.50 to produce and which retails for $ 15 - meaning the middlemen get most of the money . against that backdrop , executives have been discussing ways to save the " physical product , " by which they mean the cd , as opposed to web-based products , which are beyond their control . fighting piracy and illegal downloads another issue that will take center stage at the music fair is the problem of illegal downloads and piracy . german recording industry figures for the first half of 2006 will be released during popkomm and are expected to show yet another decline in sales , this time by about 3.4 per cent .
industry analysts put the first-half figure at 54.6 million albums , which , though bad , is better than they had feared a year ago . " it 's a good sign , " said michael haentjes , a german industry spokesman .
" sales are still very soft but are not off as much as they could have been .
the problem of course is the nagging problems of widespread downloads and piracy . " the bright spot in a gloomy industry landscape is the online market .
in the first half of 2005 , 7.5 million music titles were bought online in germany via itunes , musicload and others .
by contrast , online sales for the first half of 2006 are expected to top 12 million . even so , those figures are not as high as the german music industry had hoped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piracy has eaten into cd sales worldwide " piracy is insidious and is putting the brake on online sell-through , ' said haentjes .
" coming up with ways to curtail piracy is the major topic we 'll be discussing . " berlin is a high-profile venue for these deliberations because the german government is in the processing of drafting a new law that would stiffen penalties for copyright violations , extending them to include internet downloads . popkomm has invited german lawmakers to panel discussions to ensure that the industry 's concerns are covered by the wording of the new law . as the panels hold their deliberations , music-lovers will be treated to a marathon festival of live concerts offering more than 600 hours of performances by 400 acts over four nights . the fair will conclude saturday night with a gala club night featuring artists from 26 countries .

the fair runs until sept 23 . this year 's combination trade show , conference and festival is overshadowed by plunging cd sales worldwide amidst turmoil in the music industry over new web-based music sources .
more than 2,000 musicians are converging on berlin for the event in hopes of signing lucrative contracts with major labels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popkomm brainstorms on saving the future of the music industry like every year , executives and industry experts will be huddling to come up with strategies for saving the industry .
" viral marketing " is one of those strategies , involving word-of-mouth marketing via web logs , internet forums , chat rooms and such wide-open cyber-venues as myspace and youtube .
marketing strategists cite the band arctic monkeys as an example of how to break the mould on traditional marketing .
learning from the arctic monkeys the four young brits defied conventional industry wisdom by side-stepping time-honored marketing procedures and making their music available free of charge via the world wide web .
the resulting word-of-mouth buzz propelled them to the top of the charts . the arctic monkeys thus made obsolete the traditional procedure of pressing a demo and hawking it to label executives and radio station program playlist managers .
the group cut out the middleman by starting their own homepage on the internet and offering their demo singles as free downloads .
they burned their own cds and distributed them free of charge at live gigs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british band arctic monkeys revolutionized how music is marketed unbothered by the fact that fans copied their cds and distributed them to friends , the british band seemed to accept it as a necessary step towards fame and - eventually - to fortune .
and it worked .
by the time the arctic monkeys released their debut album last january on domino records , they were so well known that british sales soared to 118,000 within days . not surprisingly , a panel discussion at this year 's popkomm in berlin is entitled " arctic monkeys business style and the future of the music industry . " until now , the conventional wisdom within the industry was that downloading music from the internet was in fact stealing from the artists .
the arctic monkeys turned that argument on its head . and as far as artists are concerned , the industry has been stealing from them all along .
artists tend to receive $ 0.25 -lrb- 19 euro cents -rrb- in royalties on a cd that costs $ 0.50 to produce and which retails for $ 15 - meaning the middlemen get most of the money . against that backdrop , executives have been discussing ways to save the " physical product , " by which they mean the cd , as opposed to web-based products , which are beyond their control . fighting piracy and illegal downloads another issue that will take center stage at the music fair is the problem of illegal downloads and piracy . german recording industry figures for the first half of 2006 will be released during popkomm and are expected to show yet another decline in sales , this time by about 3.4 per cent .
industry analysts put the first-half figure at 54.6 million albums , which , though bad , is better than they had feared a year ago . " it 's a good sign , " said michael haentjes , a german industry spokesman .
" sales are still very soft but are not off as much as they could have been .
the problem of course is the nagging problems of widespread downloads and piracy . " the bright spot in a gloomy industry landscape is the online market .
in the first half of 2005 , 7.5 million music titles were bought online in germany via itunes , musicload and others .
by contrast , online sales for the first half of 2006 are expected to top 12 million . even so , those figures are not as high as the german music industry had hoped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piracy has eaten into cd sales worldwide " piracy is insidious and is putting the brake on online sell-through , ' said haentjes .
" coming up with ways to curtail piracy is the major topic we 'll be discussing . " berlin is a high-profile venue for these deliberations because the german government is in the processing of drafting a new law that would stiffen penalties for copyright violations , extending them to include internet downloads . popkomm has invited german lawmakers to panel discussions to ensure that the industry 's concerns are covered by the wording of the new law . as the panels hold their deliberations , music-lovers will be treated to a marathon festival of live concerts offering more than 600 hours of performances by 400 acts over four nights . the fair will conclude saturday night with a gala club night featuring artists from 26 countries .

" the ultra-sound shows the fetus has a congenital abnormality " are the last words a pregnant woman wants to hear from her doctor .
when it does happen , she faces a difficult choice - raise a child that might require life-long care and medical treatment , or have a late abortion . technically , this is one that takes place after the 23rd week .
the most common reason is that doctors have identified anomalies and advise what 's known as a " therapeutic termination . " but with germany 's federal statistics office reporting that late abortions are on the rise , the government plans to take measures to curb the trend . the governing coalition 's parliamentary leaders , christian democrat volker kauder and social democrat peter struck , met with the heads of the protestant and catholic churches in germany , bishop wolfgang huber and cardinal karl lehmann , on tuesday .
struck said his party saw no need to change the laws regarding abortion .
the two governing parties , however , had agreed to review the legislation in their coalition agreement . disability alone no reason for abortion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abortion after 23 weeks is permitted if the baby endangers a woman 's mental or physical health before having an abortion even within the standard 12 weeks permitted in germany , a woman must first visit a counseling center - although she is not required to explain why she does n't want to carry the fetus to full term . conservatives are now calling for the introduction of the same obligatory counseling session for women considering a late termination , as well as the three-day consideration period . " a suspected disability alone does not justify a termination , " said johannes singhammer of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . the cdu has the backing of the german chamber of physicians , which supports the three-day consideration period and also proposes limiting women 's autonomy of choice . financial reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to reduce the number of abortions carried out more than 120,000 abortions are carried out in germany every year , around 80 percent of which are paid by health insurance funds or - if there are valid medical or social reasons - through social welfare schemes . further reforms to abortion legislation up for discussion are financially motivated .
a woman having an abortion does n't have to pay for the procedure .
conservatives are now proposing that women should take on at least part of the cost . " i think that the women also have to assume a share of the responsibility .
and if they are able to assume a share of the financial costs , then we need to make that possible , " said helma orosz , a christian democrat and social affairs minister in the state of saxony . but family counseling associations , like pro familia , say that plans to bill patients depending on their incomes would cause a lot of problems . " if your income is very low already , and if the amount you have to pay increases - meaning that women would have to come up with the 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- that an abortion costs on the average - then it would put many of them in a difficult situation , " said pro familia doctor christina schneider .
" i do n't believe that 's an appropriate way to reduce the number of abortions , if that 's what politicians who support this are thinking . " further factors some lawmakers say the issue is n't just about money , but also about protecting the lives of the unborn .
pro familia says experiences at its centers show that finances do not always play a key role when it comes to abortion - and that women who want an abortion will get one . doctors also fear that forcing women to bear the costs of the procedure would bring a host of other problems . " in some circumstances , women might try to save money by going to colleagues who were willing to do it on the cheap , " said matthias david from berlin 's charité clinic .

by letting 2.5 million of its kids live in poverty , germany is letting its greatest resource slip through its fingers , writes dw 's helle jeppesen . forget the conventions on children 's rights .
in germany , the fate of children is dependent on parents and the state , not on their needs or potential . kids who grow up in socially disadvantaged families often have difficulties breaking the vicious circle later in life .
a career as a welfare recipient can be pre-programmed for generations . everywhere in the world , poverty endangers people 's health and work .
in germany , one of the richest countries in the world , there are plenty of warnings that child poverty also endangers the future of society as a whole . wasti n g huma n capital according to the pisa study , children in socially disadvantaged families have very little chance of receiving education . unesco has warned that support for underprivileged children is scarce .
and just last week an oecd study was released that indicated germany is letting its only notable resource lie idle - human capital . there are n't many countries in europe where so few children and young people graduate from high school or college as in germany .
yet those in the german economy complain about the shortage of skilled employees , which can only be alleviated by importing labor from countries that desperately need qualified workers of their own . educatio n gaps lead to u n employme n t thus , germany 's educational catastrophe takes on an international dimension .
a country that could have afforded to train employees has managed to create an army of mainly unqualified job-seekers . one of the wealthiest countries in the world has also reaped 2.5 million children living in poverty , knowing that they are excluded from the german education system . according to the united nations ' convention on the rights of the child , which germany has also signed , every child has the right to education .
germany actively supports this right in its development policy abroad , though it is not practiced at home . import-export of labor will co n ti n ue when many children in germany do n't complete a high school degree because of social reasons , when children from underprivileged families or families with immigrant backgrounds have practically no chance of getting job training , then the state has failed ruefully . the resource that the whole world is dependent on , the human resource , will continue to flow from the poorer countries to the wealthy ones , just like metal and other raw materials during colonial times . helle jeppesen -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neglected children in the spotlight on international kids ' day international children 's day is an opportunity to consider the hardships - hunger , neglect , sickness , war - faced by millions of children .
even in germany , more children suffer than many people realize .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the pope needs an advisor who knows the opinion , the temperature , on the streets !
has he not witnessed the uproar over the psychological operation known as the danish cartoons ?
would he dare to balance his remarks with criticism of american fundamentalist christian holy warriors ?
why not ?
how about critique of the notorious passages in the talmud ?
meanwhile the text and thrust of his very interesting and thoughtful speech has been lost due to ignorance of the tensions and motives which lurk under the landscape . - klaatu as a devoted muslim and an indonesian by birth , i strongly believe that the pontiff 's comment on islam was misunderstood by my fellow muslims .
i am always tolerant towards every religion no matter the difference of its worshipping towards the creator . - endoeng sasmito i do not expect the present pope to accomplish much in his period of papacy .
he has already started on the wrong foot and might ignite more hatred between muslims and christians . - abdul ataa no amount of intellectual sophistication can hide that in his core , ratzinger has remained a catholic bavarian village yokel . - diet simon the pope 's remarks have been taken out of context .
he actually was promoting interfaith dialogue .
the actual paragraph in question was not his words - he was quoting .
he also said he found the sentiment expressed therein a bit strong .
it is disappointing to see how muslim clerics have chosen to take the whole thing out of context , thereby using it for their own motives .
those demonstrating on the streets have likely never read the speech and have most probably been told that these were the actual words of the pope .
there are too many people out there ready to hate - sadly particularly muslims - a faith which is supposed to be tolerant and peaceful .
the pope should never apologize . - dia n a bishop , fra n ce i expect the pope to create further division between christianity and islam .
the pope 's very unfortunate remarks are going to spark a worldwide controversy that will further the hatred already seen in so many different conflicts throughout the world .
perhaps the pope is a bit delusional in his thinking .
he should apologize , and resign .
this will help build back the vote of confidence that the catholic church so desperately will need in the very near future . - christia n fiech i concur with those who believe that the present pope was referring to islam in an historical context .
these remarks have been taken out of context .
hopefully , the islamic population worldwide will carefully analyze the whole discourse and appreciate what the underlying message is . - mauree n t. couch , australia i have read the whole speech , which is very long and very complex .
the real pity is that the media only quoted one sentence .
the most interesting part of the speech was , and this is like a " fingerprint " of this pope , criticism of the " modern times " and criticism of the western " way of life . "
very interesting was the part on the " dialogue of cultures , " which can not take place if the western world excludes god from its life .
it seems to me as if the pope wanted to begin a public discussion on the legitimizing of violence on the one side , and on the role of faith and sense in our western world . - ludwig meyerhoff , germa n y it was stupid for him to quote a 14th century byzantine emperor .
open mouth , insert foot .
of course , the muslims will react badly to a denigration of their prophet and their religion .
how much better to comment on the positive and loving side of islam and refer to the violent side of christianity , particularly in bosnia and between the serbs and croats , saying hostility has no place in any religion . - patty rola n d compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's apology fails to stem anger of muslim hardliners pope benedict xvi 's personal apology for hurting the feelings of muslims with a controversial speech failed to stem the anger of hardliners despite calls for calm from islamic and western leaders .

those demonstrating on the streets have likely never read the speech and have most probably been told that these were the actual words of the pope .
there are too many people out there ready to hate - sadly particularly muslims - a faith which is supposed to be tolerant and peaceful .
the pope should never apologize . - dia n a bishop , fra n ce i expect the pope to create further division between christianity and islam .
the pope 's very unfortunate remarks are going to spark a worldwide controversy that will further the hatred already seen in so many different conflicts throughout the world .
perhaps the pope is a bit delusional in his thinking .
he should apologize , and resign .
this will help build back the vote of confidence that the catholic church so desperately will need in the very near future . - christia n fiech i concur with those who believe that the present pope was referring to islam in an historical context .
these remarks have been taken out of context .
hopefully , the islamic population worldwide will carefully analyze the whole discourse and appreciate what the underlying message is . - mauree n t. couch , australia i have read the whole speech , which is very long and very complex .
the real pity is that the media only quoted one sentence .
the most interesting part of the speech was , and this is like a " fingerprint " of this pope , criticism of the " modern times " and criticism of the western " way of life . "
very interesting was the part on the " dialogue of cultures , " which can not take place if the western world excludes god from its life .
it seems to me as if the pope wanted to begin a public discussion on the legitimizing of violence on the one side , and on the role of faith and sense in our western world . - ludwig meyerhoff , germa n y it was stupid for him to quote a 14th century byzantine emperor .
open mouth , insert foot .
of course , the muslims will react badly to a denigration of their prophet and their religion .
how much better to comment on the positive and loving side of islam and refer to the violent side of christianity , particularly in bosnia and between the serbs and croats , saying hostility has no place in any religion . - patty rola n d compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's apology fails to stem anger of muslim hardliners pope benedict xvi 's personal apology for hurting the feelings of muslims with a controversial speech failed to stem the anger of hardliners despite calls for calm from islamic and western leaders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.09.2006 neglected children in the spotlight on international kids ' day großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2.5 million children in germany are on welfare international children 's day is an opportunity to consider the hardships - hunger , neglect , sickness , war - faced by millions of children .
even in germany , more children suffer than many people realize . bellem tried to hold on to the moon-shaped pumpkin slices , but they kept slipping out of her hand . " this is the only place i can cook because my mother never lets me , " she said .
" i ask her almost every day , ' can i cook with you ? ' but she says , ' no , i do n't feel like it . " ' bellem 's cooking club for seven- to 12-year-olds is sponsored by a child protection group in cologne .
the idea is to offer parents some relief so that they do n't feel too burdened to take proper care of their children . 10 percent neglect rate in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicef aims to cut the child mortality rate among under-five-year-olds by two-thirds one in 10 children in germany is severely neglected , according to some statistics .
that might mean they do n't get enough to eat or are n't taken care of when they 're sick .
or perhaps they freeze in the winter because their parents do n't dress them warmly enough . " often these parents were neglected as children themselves , " said renate blum-maurice from the cologne child protection group .
ultimately , many factors can play a role , she added - the marriage gets rocky , the baby is born handicapped , or dad loses his job . the united nations initiated international children 's day in 1954 to draw attention to the dangers children face , including neglect .
it is now celebrated annually in more than 145 countries , in german-speaking countries primarily on sept .
20 . child poverty rising disproportionately in developing countries , where millions of children face extreme poverty , malnutrition and war , the situation is even more drastic .
but even in germany , more than 50 years after international children 's day was founded , some 2.5 million children and youths live off of social welfare , according to the federal child protection agency . unicef , which spearheads the annual day of recognition , estimates that poverty among children in germany has increased disproportionately to the rest of the population over the past decade . bellem and her cooking partners do n't live in dire need .
they are not among the world 's 2.1 billion children and youths suffering through a life of extreme poverty .

" a first contingent of 1,000 soldiers will leave for the middle east on thursday , breaking a postwar taboo for germany .
due to its nazi past , sending german troops to the region near israel is particularly sensitive . " there is perhaps no other area of the world where germany 's unique responsibility , the unique responsibility of every german government to heed the lessons of our past is so clear than it is here , " merkel said in a speech to the bundestag . the german chancellor also promised bundestag members she would press washington to take a more active role in the region , drawing a link between the lebanon and israeli-palestinian conflicts . other europea n n atio n s i n volved two frigates , four fast patrol boats , two supply ships and two helicopters will be deployed by germany in cooperation with naval forces being sent by the netherlands , sweden , norway and denmark . bildunterschrift : spanish marines are also part of the un peacekeeping force in lebanon german naval vessels are expected to arrive off the lebanese coast by early october , given that it takes about 10 days for ships to travel from the north sea to the eastern mediterranean . the mission 's mandate will initially be limited until aug .

" we should be no under illusions just because this is a navy mission and not a ground mission , " westerwelle said . government ministers insisted the mission would bring stability to the region and increase europe 's role as an architect of peace in the middle east . the un is deploying a 15,000-member peacekeeping force in southern lebanon under a ceasefire agreement which last month ended fighting between israel and hezbollah . co n ditio n s met meanwhile , a un spokesman said the number of un peacekeepers in southern lebanon has risen to 5,000 , meeting a condition laid down by israel for withdrawing from its northern neighbor . " we have reached the 5,000 troops , " said alexander ivanko , spokesman for the un interim force in lebanon .
" the first phase of the unifil deployment is now completed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian un soldieres guard a lebanese beach ivanko said that the initial number of about 2,000 unifil troops had been boosted to 5,000 by three new battalions from france , italy and spain . israeli forces have remained in southern lebanon for more than a month after the aug .

a european parliament delegation was in berlin to find out to what extent the german government and secret services turned a blind eye to us practices to deport detainees to other continents via european territory . the deportation of terror suspects by the cia and the involvement of european countries in such deportation cases were at the center of investigations carried out by a special inquiry panel of the european parliament in berlin on tuesday . us president george w. bush recently admitted the use of secret prisons outside us jurisdiction .
the question that europe has to clarify is to what extent governments and intelligence agencies helped the cia detain and deport terror suspects . a delegation from the european parliament 's inquiry panel looking into the issue spent tuesday talking to german parliamentarians and ngos to try to find out more about the activities of the german government and secret services regarding such deportations . germany 's european parliamentarian and panel member cem özdemir said the body wanted to " build a coalition " between national and european parliamentarians . " we believe that the members of parliaments have to work closely together in order to force our governments to cooperate , because otherwise we can not achieve our goals , " özdemir said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 20.09.2006 ailing music industry casts around for solutions at berlin fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's show time again : the popkomm music fair gets into the act artists and representatives of the global music industry will gather in berlin at the popkomm music fair that opens wednesday to discuss innovative ways to combat piracy and illegal downloads . more than 15,000 visitors are expected to throng the 800 exhibition booths at berlin 's international congress center for the 18th popkomm international business platform for music and entertainment .
the fair runs until sept 23 . this year 's combination trade show , conference and festival is overshadowed by plunging cd sales worldwide amidst turmoil in the music industry over new web-based music sources .
more than 2,000 musicians are converging on berlin for the event in hopes of signing lucrative contracts with major labels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popkomm brainstorms on saving the future of the music industry like every year , executives and industry experts will be huddling to come up with strategies for saving the industry .
" viral marketing " is one of those strategies , involving word-of-mouth marketing via web logs , internet forums , chat rooms and such wide-open cyber-venues as myspace and youtube .
marketing strategists cite the band arctic monkeys as an example of how to break the mould on traditional marketing .
learning from the arctic monkeys the four young brits defied conventional industry wisdom by side-stepping time-honored marketing procedures and making their music available free of charge via the world wide web .
the resulting word-of-mouth buzz propelled them to the top of the charts . the arctic monkeys thus made obsolete the traditional procedure of pressing a demo and hawking it to label executives and radio station program playlist managers .
the group cut out the middleman by starting their own homepage on the internet and offering their demo singles as free downloads .
they burned their own cds and distributed them free of charge at live gigs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british band arctic monkeys revolutionized how music is marketed unbothered by the fact that fans copied their cds and distributed them to friends , the british band seemed to accept it as a necessary step towards fame and - eventually - to fortune .
and it worked .
by the time the arctic monkeys released their debut album last january on domino records , they were so well known that british sales soared to 118,000 within days . not surprisingly , a panel discussion at this year 's popkomm in berlin is entitled " arctic monkeys business style and the future of the music industry . " until now , the conventional wisdom within the industry was that downloading music from the internet was in fact stealing from the artists .
the arctic monkeys turned that argument on its head . and as far as artists are concerned , the industry has been stealing from them all along .
artists tend to receive $ 0.25 -lrb- 19 euro cents -rrb- in royalties on a cd that costs $ 0.50 to produce and which retails for $ 15 - meaning the middlemen get most of the money . against that backdrop , executives have been discussing ways to save the " physical product , " by which they mean the cd , as opposed to web-based products , which are beyond their control . fighting piracy and illegal downloads another issue that will take center stage at the music fair is the problem of illegal downloads and piracy . german recording industry figures for the first half of 2006 will be released during popkomm and are expected to show yet another decline in sales , this time by about 3.4 per cent .
industry analysts put the first-half figure at 54.6 million albums , which , though bad , is better than they had feared a year ago . " it 's a good sign , " said michael haentjes , a german industry spokesman .
" sales are still very soft but are not off as much as they could have been .
the problem of course is the nagging problems of widespread downloads and piracy . " the bright spot in a gloomy industry landscape is the online market .
in the first half of 2005 , 7.5 million music titles were bought online in germany via itunes , musicload and others .
by contrast , online sales for the first half of 2006 are expected to top 12 million . even so , those figures are not as high as the german music industry had hoped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piracy has eaten into cd sales worldwide " piracy is insidious and is putting the brake on online sell-through , ' said haentjes .
" coming up with ways to curtail piracy is the major topic we 'll be discussing . " berlin is a high-profile venue for these deliberations because the german government is in the processing of drafting a new law that would stiffen penalties for copyright violations , extending them to include internet downloads . popkomm has invited german lawmakers to panel discussions to ensure that the industry 's concerns are covered by the wording of the new law . as the panels hold their deliberations , music-lovers will be treated to a marathon festival of live concerts offering more than 600 hours of performances by 400 acts over four nights . the fair will conclude saturday night with a gala club night featuring artists from 26 countries .

a european parliament delegation was in berlin to find out to what extent the german government and secret services turned a blind eye to us practices to deport detainees to other continents via european territory . the deportation of terror suspects by the cia and the involvement of european countries in such deportation cases were at the center of investigations carried out by a special inquiry panel of the european parliament in berlin on tuesday . us president george w. bush recently admitted the use of secret prisons outside us jurisdiction .
the question that europe has to clarify is to what extent governments and intelligence agencies helped the cia detain and deport terror suspects . a delegation from the european parliament 's inquiry panel looking into the issue spent tuesday talking to german parliamentarians and ngos to try to find out more about the activities of the german government and secret services regarding such deportations . germany 's european parliamentarian and panel member cem özdemir said the body wanted to " build a coalition " between national and european parliamentarians . " we believe that the members of parliaments have to work closely together in order to force our governments to cooperate , because otherwise we can not achieve our goals , " özdemir said .
lots of issues to be discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz was held in guantanamo for over four years " of course , we have some questions here in germany , " özdemir said .
" just think of the el masri case . "
german national khaled el masri was arrested in macedonia at the end of 2003 and said he was handed over to the cia , who flew him to afghanistan and wrongly held him until his release in late may 2004 . özdemir also named the case of murat kurnaz , a turkish citizen born in germany who was recently allowed to return to germany after more than four years of detention in guantanamo bay . " all those things we have to discuss , " özdemir said . huma n rights of detai n ees are a top priority ferdinand muggenthaler from the german branch of amnesty international accused the government of double standards .
on the one hand , he said , german chancellor angela merkel and her cabinet members have openly criticized the existence of the secret prisons . on the other hand , there are strong indications that the government has turned a blind eye when the intelligence agencies helped the cia deport terror suspects to such camps . german intelligence officers are said also to have themselves interrogated suspects in such camps . " the most important point for the future is that the government makes it clear that the secret service also has to protect the human rights of detainees , " muggenthaler said .
" i think that 's the better way in the long run to fight terrorism and to ensure security . " getti n g to the bottom of the matter will take time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir wants european and national bodies to work closely together özdemir said that just one day of investigations in germany was n't enough to get to the heart of the matter .
he said more meetings will follow . " this is not the last time that we will talk to our german colleagues , " özdemir said .
" do n't forget that we work closely together and it 's clear that we also need the help and support of the media , we need the help and support of ngos .
otherwise , we can not achieve our work .

" the minister made her comments to the stuttgarter zeitu n g , at the beginning of the 66th annual meeting of the association of german law professionals in stuttgart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries would like to give legal weight to living wills zypries wants to codify living wills , in which patients determine their own guidelines on resuscitation and the right to die , in civil law .
this will give doctors clearer guidelines for treatment , she said . legal repercussio n s should living wills be granted legal status , " if a patient is clearly opposed to a certain treatment measure , then the doctor will have to refrain from doing it . "
otherwise the physician could be indicted for assault and battery , zypris told the neue os n abrücker zeitu n g newspaper . however , zypries said demands to make people who passively assist suicide exempt from legal penalties were unnecessary . hospice group i n favor the german hospice association welcomed zypries ' position . " an explicit standardization of allowed forms of assisted-suicide has no place in criminal law , " association head eugen brysch told reporters . to do so could be mistakenly seen as a step toward the " increasing acceptance of actively assisted suicide , " he added . he agreed it made sense to make living wills an aspect of german statute law , which are already recognized in case law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much should patients decide over their own treatment ?
" the parliament has a clear duty to give living wills a legal basis , by passing it into law , " brysch said , adding that germany needs to finally allow its citizens self-determination , and allow them to right to protect their integrity through a living will . on wednesday at the stuttgart meeting , bonn-based criminal lawyer torsten verrel plans to clarify his demands to expressly decriminalize passive assisted-suicide and the shutting down of life-support systems .
without this , doctors ' fears of lawsuits lead to " extensive exculpatory medicine , " and an " inadequate reduction in suffering , " he told the afp news agency . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing physician-assisted death around seven million germans have written a living will .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 20.09.2006 government discusses reducing late abortions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many , a late termination is a last resort parliamentary leaders met with church representatives tuesday to talk about reforming legislation on late abortions , as conservatives push for more stringent controls on terminations and a re-think of who foots the bill . " the ultra-sound shows the fetus has a congenital abnormality " are the last words a pregnant woman wants to hear from her doctor .
when it does happen , she faces a difficult choice - raise a child that might require life-long care and medical treatment , or have a late abortion . technically , this is one that takes place after the 23rd week .
the most common reason is that doctors have identified anomalies and advise what 's known as a " therapeutic termination . " but with germany 's federal statistics office reporting that late abortions are on the rise , the government plans to take measures to curb the trend . the governing coalition 's parliamentary leaders , christian democrat volker kauder and social democrat peter struck , met with the heads of the protestant and catholic churches in germany , bishop wolfgang huber and cardinal karl lehmann , on tuesday .
struck said his party saw no need to change the laws regarding abortion .
the two governing parties , however , had agreed to review the legislation in their coalition agreement . disability alone no reason for abortion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abortion after 23 weeks is permitted if the baby endangers a woman 's mental or physical health before having an abortion even within the standard 12 weeks permitted in germany , a woman must first visit a counseling center - although she is not required to explain why she does n't want to carry the fetus to full term . conservatives are now calling for the introduction of the same obligatory counseling session for women considering a late termination , as well as the three-day consideration period . " a suspected disability alone does not justify a termination , " said johannes singhammer of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . the cdu has the backing of the german chamber of physicians , which supports the three-day consideration period and also proposes limiting women 's autonomy of choice . financial reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to reduce the number of abortions carried out more than 120,000 abortions are carried out in germany every year , around 80 percent of which are paid by health insurance funds or - if there are valid medical or social reasons - through social welfare schemes . further reforms to abortion legislation up for discussion are financially motivated .
a woman having an abortion does n't have to pay for the procedure .
conservatives are now proposing that women should take on at least part of the cost . " i think that the women also have to assume a share of the responsibility .
and if they are able to assume a share of the financial costs , then we need to make that possible , " said helma orosz , a christian democrat and social affairs minister in the state of saxony . but family counseling associations , like pro familia , say that plans to bill patients depending on their incomes would cause a lot of problems . " if your income is very low already , and if the amount you have to pay increases - meaning that women would have to come up with the 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- that an abortion costs on the average - then it would put many of them in a difficult situation , " said pro familia doctor christina schneider .
" i do n't believe that 's an appropriate way to reduce the number of abortions , if that 's what politicians who support this are thinking . " further factors some lawmakers say the issue is n't just about money , but also about protecting the lives of the unborn .
pro familia says experiences at its centers show that finances do not always play a key role when it comes to abortion - and that women who want an abortion will get one . doctors also fear that forcing women to bear the costs of the procedure would bring a host of other problems . " in some circumstances , women might try to save money by going to colleagues who were willing to do it on the cheap , " said matthias david from berlin 's charité clinic .
" maybe they would n't go to doctors at all , and would try to find the means for non-medical abortions .
maybe they would begin going abroad again , as they did for awhile , when women went to the netherlands because it did n't cost as much for the procedure .
from a medical viewpoint , that would not be a practice we would welcome . " boosting the birth-rate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birth rates in germany are worryingly low it is n't clear how much money the government would save if these rules go into effect .
but some ministers already know how they would spend it - trying to boost the birth rate in germany . " the money we would save could be used to provide more support for those who - for whatever reason - are trying to have a child using in-vitro fertilization , " said orosz .
" these techniques require a lot more commitment on the part of those involved , some of whom are needy , and to be fair they should also benefit from taxpayer contributions .

we already knew that politicians lie , commented many papers , so what 's the big deal ? " it may surprise electorates in western europe than hungarians should riot because their prime minister has confessed lying to them ; this , after all , is what we expect of our politicians , " wrote britain 's daily telegraph .
" it is understandable that these recently leaked remarks should have caused offense . -lrb- … -rrb- yet mr. gyurcsany has done hungary and the rest of post-communist europe a favor by drawing attention to the arrant misuse of power by their elites . "
he may lose his job , continued the paper , " but his frankness should serve as an incentive to politicians to be straight with voters as they confront previously shirked economic reforms . -lrb- … -rrb- whatever his previous record , mr. gyurcsany deserves a pat on the back for his belated candor . " " hungarians are old-fashioned people , " commented germany 's daily die welt .
" they actually believe that the government is obligated to impart the truth to the people and made noise when they realized that they were wrong about this expectation . "
german voters have come a bit further , continued the paper , recalling that people like former labor minister norbert blüm taught germany not to believe statements like " social security is secure . "
" only a fraction of what was needed and received in the past will be available in the future , " wrote the paper .
" the chancellor says there 's no alternative to this policy of hers , which may be true .
but then why is she surprised that germans do n't want to put their trust in politics and the future ? " " the pictures of burning cars and violent rioters smashing the budapest television studio to pieces do n't convey a realistic image of the protests in the last few days .
known hooligans are using the opportunity to let it all out .
it does n't have much to do with prime minister ferenc gyurcsany 's speech , " wrote die tageszeitu n g from berlin .
it 's a credibility crisis that affects the opposition as well , continued the paper , adding that all former soviet states are having difficulty finding a guiding concept to save the socialized state in today 's world .
as for the hungarian prime minister 's speech , " history shows that this kind of honesty is later rewarded .
for hungary , that would be something new . " " most shocking are the common terms in which the socialist leader expressed himself during a party meeting behind closed doors , " commented the paris daily le figaro .
" this is a new example of the how the old apparatchiks shaped by the soviet school tried to hide their contempt for the electorate and remove themselves from their political cynicism .
the situation in hungary is not an isolated one . "
the paper wrote that poland 's government is more preoccupied with fighting a war of ideas that with running the economy , the czech republic is paralyzed after june elections did n't bring a clear victor , and slovakia and lithuania are suffering under erratic coalitions .
" the crisis in hungary and the disappointed situation of its neighbors are not encouraging for the next enlargement process " of the european union , concluded the commentary . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : eu warns of " painful " times ahead for hungary hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany rejected opposition calls to quit on tuesday even as the european commission warned that measures required to bring hungary 's ailing economy under control would be " painful .

tidy ni say broken bottles left by teenagers in parks are putting young children at risk of serious injury .
spokesman ian cole blamed " the adults who provided teenagers with alcohol in glass bottles in the first place " .

currently , there is no effective treatment for the chronic progressive phase of ms , when serious disability is most likely to appear .
researchers cut the risk of nerve degeneration in mice with ms-type symptoms by giving them a form of vitamin b3 called nicotinamide .
the children 's hospital boston study appears in the journal of neuroscience .
ms , which affects about 85,000 people in the uk , is a disease of the central nervous system .
it causes the break down of the myelin sheath , a fatty protein , which coats nerve fibres , disrupting the ability to conduct electrical impulses to and from the brain .
many patients develop a form of the disease called relapsing-remitting ms , in which bouts of illness are followed by complete or partial recovery .
in this early phase anti-inflammatory drugs can help .
but eventually patients can enter the chronic progressive phase , for which there is no good treatment .
women are twice as likely to be affected by ms as men the boston team worked on mice with an ms-like disease called experimental autoimmune encephalitis -lrb- eae -rrb- .
they found that daily nicotinamide shots protected the animals ' nerve cells from myelin loss , and stabilised the condition of those cells that had already been affected .
the greater the dose of nicotinamide , the greater the protective effect .
rating disability on a scale of one to five , mice receiving the highest doses of nicotinamide scored between one and two , while animals who received no shots at all scored between three and four .
key chemical the researchers found that nicotinamide boosted levels of a crucial chemical called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide -lrb- nad -rrb- in the animals ' nervous systems .
nicotinamide also significantly reduced neurological deficits even when treatment was delayed until 10 days after the induction of eae - raising hope that it will also be effective in the later stages of ms. lead researcher dr shinjiro kaneko said : " the earlier therapy was started , the better the effect , but we hope nicotinamide can help patients who are already in the chronic stage . "
the researchers said nicotinamide was cheap , and thought to have few side effects .
however , they said further work was needed to test its effect on humans .
simon gillespie , chief executive of the ms society , said : " any potential treatment for reducing the chronic progression of disability in ms deserves pursuing .
" this is interesting early research which we should like to see developed , adding our usual caution that what works in mice does not always work in men . "
a spokesperson for the ms trust said : " these are interesting results , but studies in mice with the experimental equivalent of ms may not necessarily translate into a successful treatment for people with ms. "

currently , there is no effective treatment for the chronic progressive phase of ms , when serious disability is most likely to appear .
researchers cut the risk of nerve degeneration in mice with ms-type symptoms by giving them a form of vitamin b3 called nicotinamide .
the children 's hospital boston study appears in the journal of neuroscience .
ms , which affects about 85,000 people in the uk , is a disease of the central nervous system .
it causes the break down of the myelin sheath , a fatty protein , which coats nerve fibres , disrupting the ability to conduct electrical impulses to and from the brain .
many patients develop a form of the disease called relapsing-remitting ms , in which bouts of illness are followed by complete or partial recovery .
in this early phase anti-inflammatory drugs can help .
but eventually patients can enter the chronic progressive phase , for which there is no good treatment .
women are twice as likely to be affected by ms as men the boston team worked on mice with an ms-like disease called experimental autoimmune encephalitis -lrb- eae -rrb- .
they found that daily nicotinamide shots protected the animals ' nerve cells from myelin loss , and stabilised the condition of those cells that had already been affected .
the greater the dose of nicotinamide , the greater the protective effect .
rating disability on a scale of one to five , mice receiving the highest doses of nicotinamide scored between one and two , while animals who received no shots at all scored between three and four .
key chemical the researchers found that nicotinamide boosted levels of a crucial chemical called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide -lrb- nad -rrb- in the animals ' nervous systems .
nicotinamide also significantly reduced neurological deficits even when treatment was delayed until 10 days after the induction of eae - raising hope that it will also be effective in the later stages of ms. lead researcher dr shinjiro kaneko said : " the earlier therapy was started , the better the effect , but we hope nicotinamide can help patients who are already in the chronic stage . "
the researchers said nicotinamide was cheap , and thought to have few side effects .
however , they said further work was needed to test its effect on humans .
simon gillespie , chief executive of the ms society , said : " any potential treatment for reducing the chronic progression of disability in ms deserves pursuing .
" this is interesting early research which we should like to see developed , adding our usual caution that what works in mice does not always work in men . "
a spokesperson for the ms trust said : " these are interesting results , but studies in mice with the experimental equivalent of ms may not necessarily translate into a successful treatment for people with ms. "

like-for-like sales , which ignore the effect of new stores , fell 8.3 % in the six months to 29 july .
losses widened to £ 64.9m from £ 20.2m a year ago .
woolworths said it expected trade to pick up in the second half of the year after making " significant " changes .
the firm has revamped stores and plans to become the uk 's leading children 's toys and clothing retailer .
the group has also unveiled plans to concentrate on its online operations and hopes to place internet access points in its stores .
new focus by relying on the " catalogue model " woolworths hopes to encourage more customers to come into their stores to pick up their goods . "
the recent rate rise on top of increasing household bills will hold back consumer confidence " woolworths q & a : worries at woolies despite the slide in sales , the 97-year-old group remains the uk 's eighth largest retailer and is the country 's number one seller of sweets and chocolates .
woolworths also hopes to capitalise on this by becoming the leading " celebrations " retailer in the uk , promoting sales of easter , christmas and other key holiday goods .
independent retail consultant theresa wickham told the bbc the group was " very much caught in a squeeze " , battling stiff competition from supermarkets which are increasingly targeting the non-food market , as well as online retailers like amazon which are encroaching on its entertainment division .
" the woolworths brand is very popular , but it is being caught in three areas - it 's very strong in toys , entertainment and confectionary , " she said .
" its margins are so low as it 's being squeezed in those three areas by supermarkets . "
entertainment lift although competition is stiff , woolworths still managed to post a significant rise in sales at its 2entertain audio and visual publishing division and its home entertainment distributor unit euk - buoyed by the release of the second series of dr who and the latest little britain dvd .
elsewhere , the group also said the summer heatwave had resulted in record sales of outdoor goods .
however , these gains were offset by a decline in sales of indoor toys and a drop in customer numbers during the world cup .
woolworths also said the hot weather had had a negative impact on chocolate sales .
looking ahead , the group said it was " particularly difficult " to forecast how it would perform over the key christmas period .
" the recent rate rise on top of increasing household bills will hold back consumer confidence , " the group said .
with up to 80 % of its profits expected to come from its christmas sales , this festive season will be " absolutely vital " , analyst teresa wickham added .

like-for-like sales , which ignore the effect of new stores , fell 8.3 % in the six months to 29 july .
losses widened to £ 64.9m from £ 20.2m a year ago .
woolworths said it expected trade to pick up in the second half of the year after making " significant " changes .
the firm has revamped stores and plans to become the uk 's leading children 's toys and clothing retailer .
the group has also unveiled plans to concentrate on its online operations and hopes to place internet access points in its stores .
new focus by relying on the " catalogue model " woolworths hopes to encourage more customers to come into their stores to pick up their goods .
the recent rate rise on top of increasing household bills will hold back consumer confidence woolworths q & a : worries at woolies check woolworths ' shares despite the slide in sales , the 97-year-old group remains the uk 's eighth largest retailer and is the country 's number one seller of sweets and chocolates .
woolworths also hopes to capitalise on this by becoming the leading " celebrations " retailer in the uk , promoting sales of easter , christmas and other key holiday goods .
independent retail consultant theresa wickham told the bbc the group was " very much caught in a squeeze " , battling stiff competition from supermarkets which are increasingly targeting the non-food market , as well as online retailers like amazon which are encroaching on its entertainment division .
" the woolworths brand is very popular , but it is being caught in three areas - it 's very strong in toys , entertainment and confectionary , " she said .
" its margins are so low as it 's being squeezed in those three areas by supermarkets . "
entertainment lift although competition is stiff , woolworths still managed to post a significant rise in sales at its 2entertain audio and visual publishing division and its home entertainment distributor unit euk - buoyed by the release of the second series of dr who and the latest little britain dvd .
elsewhere , the group also said the summer heatwave had resulted in record sales of outdoor goods .
however , these gains were offset by a decline in sales of indoor toys and a drop in customer numbers during the world cup .
woolworths also said the hot weather had had a negative impact on chocolate sales .
looking ahead , the group said it was " particularly difficult " to forecast how it would perform over the key christmas period .
" the recent rate rise on top of increasing household bills will hold back consumer confidence , " the group said .
with up to 80 % of its profits expected to come from its christmas sales , this festive season will be " absolutely vital " , analyst teresa wickham added .

payouts from private policies have roughly halved in the past ten years , financial data firm moneyfacts said .
the main reasons for the decline have been falling investment returns and lower inflation , the report said .
the position of private pension savers has been made even worse because at the same time the annual income from their pension savings has dropped by 40 % .
richard eagling of moneyfacts said that the declines in private pension payouts and annual incomes have come despite a pick up in the stock market over the past three years .
" the fact remains that today 's pensioners are facing a longer retirement with pension pots half the size of those fortunate enough to have retired a decade ago , " mr eagling said .
" the figures show that an individual with a personal pension retiring today could be more than 50 % worse off than someone who made the same premium contributions but reached retirement ten years ago , " he explained .
falling returns according to moneyfacts , a 65 year old man who retired in july 1996 , after 20 years of paying in £ 500 a year to his with-profits pension plan , would have received a payout of £ 61,592 on retirement .
but an identical man retiring in july this year , after making the same payments over the same period of time , would have received only £ 26,168 - a cut in his payout of 58 % .
a 25-year with-profits pension policy would have seen its payout value drop by 53 % from £ 120,239 ten years ago to £ 55,992 today , the company said .
at the same time annuity rates - the rate at which insurance companies will convert your accumulated pension pot into an annual income - have also fallen sharply .
as a result of falling inflation and lower interest rates these are now 40 % lower than in 1996 .
today , an accumulated pension pot of £ 100,000 will produce an income of just £ 6,860 a year for a 65-year-old man , compared with £ 11,390 back in 1996 , moneyfacts said .

payouts from private policies have roughly halved in the past ten years , financial data firm moneyfacts said .
the main reasons for the decline have been falling investment returns and lower inflation , the report said .
the position of private pension savers has been made even worse because at the same time the annual income from their pension savings has dropped by 40 % .
richard eagling of moneyfacts said that the declines in private pension payouts and annual incomes have come despite a pick up in the stock market over the past three years .
" the fact remains that today 's pensioners are facing a longer retirement with pension pots half the size of those fortunate enough to have retired a decade ago , " mr eagling said .
" the figures show that an individual with a personal pension retiring today could be more than 50 % worse off than someone who made the same premium contributions but reached retirement ten years ago , " he explained .
falling returns according to moneyfacts , a 65 year old man who retired in july 1996 , after 20 years of paying in £ 500 a year to his with-profits pension plan , would have received a payout of £ 61,592 on retirement .
but an identical man retiring in july this year , after making the same payments over the same period of time , would have received only £ 26,168 - a cut in his payout of 58 % .
a 25-year with-profits pension policy would have seen its payout value drop by 53 % from £ 120,239 ten years ago to £ 55,992 today , the company said .
at the same time annuity rates - the rate at which insurance companies will convert your accumulated pension pot into an annual income - have also fallen sharply .
as a result of falling inflation and lower interest rates these are now 40 % lower than in 1996 .
today , an accumulated pension pot of £ 100,000 will produce an income of just £ 6,860 a year for a 65-year-old man , compared with £ 11,390 back in 1996 , moneyfacts said .

in a speech to the institute of welsh politics conference in cardiff , mr morgan said the country was blighted by outmoded , negative perceptions .
he told bbc wales : " we have n't somehow developed the self-confidence about ourselves that goes with the facts " .
but plaid cymru said the public would not believe mr morgan 's " rhetoric " that things were getting better .
the speech was the first of six mr morgan will make between now and the run-up to the assembly elections .
mr morgan wants to dispel the perception that wales is a country that does not get things done , and used the wales millennium centre , the millennium stadium and the senedd building to make his case .
he told bbc wales that , when outside wales , he heard constant praise of wales ' achievement in constructing the landmark buildings in cardiff .
he said construction executives marvelled at how this had been achieved for " less than the cost-over run " of the new wembley stadium , which unlike the millennium stadium will not have a roof .
have your say to be born welsh is privilege enough - a welshman can do anything .
just believe !
paul phillips , horsham west sussex read your views he said : " i think we just have n't realised , as a country , just how much people outside wales are re-rating us as a can-do country , and turning to us , because they can see we can solve problems , that others have n't .
" and the only people who have n't really appreciated that are us in wales , ourselves . "
he added a typical false perception people in wales might have about their country was that the number of jobs had fallen since the welsh assembly was created in 1999 .
he said 126,000 new jobs had been created since that time , a rate of increase of 10 % , which was even higher in west wales and the south wales valleys .
he said : " i 'm only asking people to look at the facts and look at the evidence - not to talk wales up but to stop talking wales down .
" i think the evidence and the facts do show that wales is developing a can-do culture , and a can-do culture reputation outside wales .
" it 's just that we have n't somehow developed the self-confidence about ourselves that goes with the facts . "
another subject mr morgan is expected to say that it is a myth that the welsh language is a language of the past and is in decline .
he is also set to focus on the government of wales act 2006 , claiming it offers new opportunities , and that the best days are still to come .
' experiences ' bbc wales ' political correspondent guto thomas said the speech was an attempt to set out an agenda ahead of the assembly elections .
but mr morgan 's comments were attacked by ieuan wyn jones , leader of plaid cymru in the assembly .
he said : " the stock of politicians amongst the welsh public is pretty low and they are not going to listen to people like rhodri morgan telling them that things are getting better .
" the reality is that the experiences that they have day-to-day , in their own homes , in the schools , and the hospitals and in the workplace just does n't match up to that rhetoric . "
nick bourne , conservative assembly leader , said : " you will never get me knocking wales - i will knock rhodri morgan as long as i have life and breath .
i think he has done immense damage to wales . "
welsh liberal democrats assembly leader mike german added : " labour 's theme tune used to be things can only get better .
now it seems that rhodri morgan 's theme tune for next year will be always look on the bright side of life .
" his government has run out of energy and ideas , and no amount of whistling a happy tune will convince the people of wales that we live in the best of times . "

coelophysis , a carnivore that lived more than 200 million years ago , has often been presented in books and museum exhibits as a cannibal .
the view is based on coelophysis fossils that have preserved stomach contents interpreted as being the chewed up remains of its own kind .
but now a re-examination has suggested those contents may be crocodile , a royal society journal reports .
indeed , one purported meal could even be an accident of geology - one coelophysis simply dying on top of another , giving the impression the underlying animal 's remains were inside the top creature 's gut .
" ideas always need testing ; they 've been around for a while and we 've got to take a close look at how we think these animals really lived , " said sterling nesbitt from the american museum of natural history -lrb- amnh -rrb- , new york ; and columbia university .
nesbitt and colleagues report their findings of a re-examination of coelophysis fossils in biology letters .
give-away bones the creature 's cannibalistic reputation stems from the classic find in 1947 of literally hundreds of skeletons of the species coelophysis bauri at a site near ghost ranch in north-central new mexico , us .
a whole group of animals had died en masse in some catastrophe .
two of the more complete specimens when examined revealed collections of bones inside their body cavities . "
it 's not completely outrageous to say these guys were cannibals , it 's just the evidence to say that they were , is no longer there now " sterling nesbitt , amnh the clear inference was that these bones represented last meals - and the gruesome assessment at the time was that this dino diet consisted of other coelophysis .
but mr nesbitt 's speciality is early crocodile-like animals , and he says one of the specimens contains tell-tale bones that puncture the cannibal legend .
" there are a few bones in there which we call diagnostic .
one is a femur .
it 's what fits into the hip socket ; and in dinosaurs and crocodiles , it does it in completely different ways .
" then there 's part of the pelvis .
all dinosaurs have what we call an open-hip socket and this specimen has a closed-hip socket , just like a crocodilian-hipped animal . "
the second specimen , nesbitt 's team contends , does not even show gut contents .
the researchers say their new analysis demonstrates the way two animals have been fossilised , one on top of the other , gives the illusion that one ate the other .
motor mouth mr nesbitt believes his team 's findings put a big question mark against the popular image of coelophysis - all the books , tv programmes and museum displays may have to change their content .
" it 's not completely outrageous to say these guys were cannibals , it 's just the evidence to say that they were , is no longer there now .
" the coelophysis skeletons were the major piece of evidence we have that dinosaurs were cannibalistic .
there are examples of animals that have bite marks on them from the same species but you can never be sure if that was cannibalism or just scavenging . "
this type of reassessment is nothing new in palaeontology .
as new finds are made and old specimens looked at again , ideas have to be updated .
the most famous dino of them all , t. rex , is itself the centre of a robust debate about its lifestyle .
many scientists believe its terrifying reputation has also been overstated ; it may have been more of a scavenger than a predator , these researchers argue .
an animatronic coelophysis - complete with dino dinner hanging from its mouth - can be seen at london 's natural history museum , in its dino jaws exhibition .
the special presentation runs until april next year .

at the uk 's third party 's annual conference , he criticised israel for using cluster bombs in lebanon .
mr moore said the bombs were " turning large swathes of lebanon into killing fields and no-go areas " .
he also said he wanted to stop the transfer of weapons to hezbollah , telling delegates : " the sponsors of that deadly trade must be confronted . "
' disproportionate ' the conference voted for arms sales to israel to be reviewed and for " firm measures " to be taken to prevent weapons going to hezbollah .
it condemned the kidnapping of israeli soldiers and shelling of civilians by hezbollah fighters .
but it said israel 's response in the recent conflict had been " disproportionate " .
the motion reiterated the party 's stance in favour of a two-state solution " based on the principles contained in the road map " .
kerry hutchinson , a lib dem activist from the vale of york , said he had recently visited the west bank and jerusalem and been appalled by a security wall separating a palestinian primary school from its playground .
but geoff seeff , from chingford and woodford green , called the motion " breathtakingly , touchingly naive " .
he asked where hezbollah in lebanon got its weapons and said : " all roads lead to those models of liberal democracy and human rights , iran and syria . "
wounding continues the un has urged israel to say exactly where it fired cluster bombs during its recent bombardment of south lebanon .
humanitarian co-ordinator david shearer says israel 's failure to provide the co-ordinates has hampered a clear-up effort that could take many months .
an average of three people are killed or wounded a day by cluster munitions since the fighting ended on 14 august .
thousands of cluster bomblets landed in farms and villages , some 30-40 % of which failed to explode at the time .
israel denies using the munitions illegally against civilian targets during the conflict .
but mr shearer said israel has yet to explain why 90 % of its cluster munitions were fired in the last days of the conflict , as un members were finalising a ceasefire resolution .

he also said he wanted to stop the transfer of weapons to hezbollah , telling delegates : " the sponsors of that deadly trade must be confronted . "
' disproportionate ' the conference voted for arms sales to israel to be reviewed and for " firm measures " to be taken to prevent weapons going to hezbollah .
it condemned the kidnapping of israeli soldiers and shelling of civilians by hezbollah fighters .
but it said israel 's response in the recent conflict had been " disproportionate " .
the motion reiterated the party 's stance in favour of a two-state solution " based on the principles contained in the road map " .
kerry hutchinson , a lib dem activist from the vale of york , said he had recently visited the west bank and jerusalem and been appalled by a security wall separating a palestinian primary school from its playground .
but geoff seeff , from chingford and woodford green , called the motion " breathtakingly , touchingly naive " .
he asked where hezbollah in lebanon got its weapons and said : " all roads lead to those models of liberal democracy and human rights , iran and syria . "
wounding continues the un has urged israel to say exactly where it fired cluster bombs during its recent bombardment of south lebanon .
humanitarian co-ordinator david shearer says israel 's failure to provide the co-ordinates has hampered a clear-up effort that could take many months .
an average of three people are killed or wounded a day by cluster munitions since the fighting ended on 14 august .
thousands of cluster bomblets landed in farms and villages , some 30-40 % of which failed to explode at the time .
israel denies using the munitions illegally against civilian targets during the conflict .
but mr shearer said israel has yet to explain why 90 % of its cluster munitions were fired in the last days of the conflict , as un members were finalising a ceasefire resolution .

renfrewshire council hopes the move will encourage as many tenants as possible to cast their vote .
residents will decide if 14,300 homes and services will transfer to the not-for-profit housing association .
the local authority said it will unlock investment of £ 1bn over 30 years .
mr chisholm said : " housing transfer to rha would pave the way to an unprecedented £ 1bn package of home improvements over 30 years and faster repairs for renfrewshire tenants , as well as a five-year binding guarantee restricting rent rises to the inflation rate .
" renfrewshire council 's £ 154m housing debt currently costs tenants 36p in the pound in rent .
" if the transfer goes ahead that money can be spent on investment and keeping rents down . "

david murray , a conservation scientist who studies britain 's native ponies , said the fell herds were facing extinction as more breeders retire .
there are only about 400 fell pony mares in britain , and mr murray said it would only take the demise of two herds to put the breed in jeopardy .
he said more breeders were needed to recognise the value of the ponies .
he said : " basically we have around 400 or so fell breeding females registered in and around cumbria and one or two other parts of britain .
maintain biodiversity " due to the gradual erosion of blood lines these ponies are now regarded as rare and vulnerable .
" it is really important we find a way of protecting these herds in the next century or so .
" they have been around for 2,000 years plus before the romans , yet we could see their gradual demise . "
fell ponies are usually 13 to 14 hands high , with a stocky build , a full mane and tail and feathering on the legs .
the ponies are predominantly black , but can also be bay , brown and grey .
mr murray added : " they are good for grazing , they do n't eat wild flowers or heather and are a bit more selective in what they eat .
" they are often preferred to sheep as grazers on the fells , yet many people do not recognise their worth for helping to maintain biodiversity . "
