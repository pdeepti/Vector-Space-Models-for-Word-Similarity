but personal changes and plain old bad luck have left coach jürgen klopp searching for answers and mainz bottom of the table . " this defeat just feels wretched and dirty , " said klopp immediately after his team lost to 2-1 at home to wolfsburg on tuesday .
the game summed up the likeable western german club 's whole season .
mainz had the majority of possession , but it was their opponents who made more of their opportunities . when mainz were promoted in 2004 , most experts predicted they would go straight back down to the second division .
klopp defied the odds , keeping the underdogs in the first division with an aggressive brand of attacking soccer that was both entertaining and successful . klopp himself , who is as excitable as any fan on the sidelines , is arguably the league 's most popular coach .
but ten winless games on the trot have left mainz in the relegation zone and given klopp more reason to tear at his hair than to pump his fists . " at the moment it 's a very difficult test , " klopp said after the disappointment against wolfsburg .
" but we 'll get through it .
i take heart from the fact that we kept trying for 90 minutes .
the ball just did n't want to go in . " anemic attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ever-passionate jürgen klopp has vowed to fight on that , in a nutshell , is mainz 's problem .
the team has scored only 10 goals this season , exactly half of its tally at this point in the 2004 campaign , mainz 's first in the top flight . this shortcoming is understandable considering that mainz lost all three of its top strikers last year in the off-season .
andreas thurk and benjamin auer signed with frankfurt and bochum respectively , and mohamed zidan , who was on loan from bremen , was recalled to the current league leaders . that trio scored 30 goals for klopp last season - a total their replacements have n't even begun to match .
strikers mimoun azaouagh and imre szabics have only two goals apiece , far too few for a team whose approach to the game is predicated on its forwards . bremen salvation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team management hopes to see mohamed zidan in a mainz uniform again mainz management has made little secret of the fact they 'd like to bring back zidan , who has seen little playing time at bremen .
but thus far , werder has refused to let the striker go . mainz fans can take comfort in the fact that klopp saved the club in a tooth-and-nails relegation battle last season .
whether he can repeat that feat this time around may depend on decisions made not in mainz , but in bremen . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no changes at the top of the table werder bremen maintain their overall lead with an away win against nuremberg , while stuttgart keep pace by beating hamburg at home .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 09.11.2006 germany to push for more debate , less quarrelling in the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel knows that germany will face serious challanges during its eu presidency german chancellor angela merkel said that reforms in turkey , negotiations on kosovo 's future status and relations with russia will be among the most important foreign policy concerns during the german eu presidency . " speaking with one voice is what makes europe strong , " merkel said in a speech addressing the german council on foreign relations in berlin on wednesday . the german chancellor said she would like to see more constructive debates and less quarreling during the six-month german eu presidency , starting on jan .
1 , 2007 . this will be a challenge both with inner-european issues such as the question of constitutional reforms , and in the realm of foreign policy . merkel said that turkey would face consequences if ankara failed to open its ports to ships and planes from cyprus as part of a bid to join the european union . " turkey must fulfill its obligations by the end of the year , " merkel said .
" otherwise the eu will draw the appropriate conclusions . " the german leader underlined that a continuation of ankara 's present ban on ships and aircraft from eu member state cyprus was out of the question . the remarks came as the european union on wednesday gave turkey a mid-december deadline to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels , saying this was a key condition for keeping ankara 's eu entry bid on track . kosovo : a sensitive topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence is a current international topic merkel stressed that negotiations about the future status of kosovo will be of central importance for the eu . " what should happen by no means is that we stabilize one part , but for the price of destabilizing other parts , " merkel said . " the relationship to serbia is complex and it can effect macedonia and bosnia and herzegovina .
that is why we need to approach this with utmost sensitivity without bringing the process to a halt , " she said . the serbian parliament officially adopted the country 's new constitution on wednesday reiterating serbia 's claim over kosovo , offering wide autonomy but ruling out possible independence for the province largely populated by ethnic albanians . keeping the gas flowing another important aspect of the eu foreign policy will be the relationship to russia , one of europe 's most important trade partners and energy suppliers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is an important energy supplier for the eu merkel said that a new cooperation and partnership agreement with russia should have its energy chapter " formulated with clear basic rules . " " russia is at the moment not ready to ratify the transit protocol of the energy charter treaty , " merkel said .

above all , his iraq policies are to blame , commentators said . the leipziger volkszeitung said no one can dismiss iraq as the main reason republicans lost the election .
" a war president has found himself on the defensive , even in his own country : george bush will himself admit that he is the chief reason for the defeat of his republican party in the congressional elections .
the recent corruption and sex scandals meant a loss of moral ground .
but nothing influenced the results as much as the inability of the us government to pacify the situation in iraq . " according to the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung , democrats were able to frame the election as a vote for or against bush 's iraq policy .
yet republicans will still have a chance in the next election , if bush can show some type of victory in iraq and if democrats lean too far left .
in the us , " patriotism remains more important than pacifism and america remains a religious country .
the war in iraq will remain , in retrospect legitimate , as long as it ends with a victory . " le figaro of paris noted president bush is now a " lame duck . "
" he has wasted his political capital and does n't have many options left .
it is , one might say , an optimal chance for him to radically change his approach .
he must rescue what he can from his grandiose plan to democratize the middle east , which up to now , has only had one concrete result : the trial against saddam hussein . " the dutch newspaper volkskrant said voters punished the republican congress for not intervening to correct the mistaken policies of president bush .
" the election results must be seen as a republican defeat rather than as a win for the democrats .
the voters have punished president bush for his failed iraq politics -lrb- and for his dreadful appearance after hurricane katrina . -rrb- " in the uk , the independent reflected most opinions with its front-page headline : " it 's the war , stupid . " the financial times said bush could salvage the remainder of his presidency by showing humility and cooperating with the democrats .
" americans have at last started to hold to account the republican leadership and the administration of george w. bush for their incompetence and disdain for the law , and for the way they have dragged america 's reputation through the mud and muddle of the middle east . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de waiting for the us foreign policy sea change foreign opponents of the war in iraq on cheered the prospect of a democratic-controlled us congress , while allies of president george w. bush pondered the possibility of a major shift in us foreign policy .
-lrb- 09.11.2006 -rrb- us elections mark new beginning for transatlantic ties the democratic party 's victory in us midterm elections has been welcomed across the atlantic .
german experts expect this political change to improve bilateral relations , both politically and in terms of public opinion .

above all , his iraq policies are to blame , commentators said . the leipziger volkszeitung said no one can dismiss iraq as the main reason republicans lost the election .
" a war president has found himself on the defensive , even in his own country : george bush will himself admit that he is the chief reason for the defeat of his republican party in the congressional elections .

" it is not working this way .
something needs to change . " bayern 's dutch striker mark van bommel said : " now we need a good run . " hanover 's coach , dieter hecking , who saw his side achieve only their second season victory , said he was very happy .
" we showed another hanover in the game .
an excellent team effort was rewarded . " his bayern counterpart , felix magath , said his team did too little in the first half .
" we made a major mistake in the first half and that cost us .
in the second half we played better , but could not create the chances we needed .
we struggle against well-structured defences . " winning results for schalke and stuttgart troubled schalke , where infighting has again grabbed most of the recent headlines , put all of that aside with a convincing 2-0 victory at borussia mönchengladbach .

" japan 's support for iraq will not change , " japanese prime minister shinzo abe told reporters . " the international community has worked to rebuild iraq .
japan will continue to do what we can , " said abe , who took office in september .
his predecessor , junichiro koizumi , had taken the landmark step of deploying japanese troops to iraq . japanese opposition leaders saw the election result as a major slap in the face for bush and warned abe against pursuing what they described as koizumi 's slavish support for the us president . bush has been severely judged " president bush , who was an ally of former prime minister koizumi , has been severely judged by his people , " said mizuho fukushima , head of the social democratic party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi suggests that iraq was a deciding factor italian prime minister romano prodi , who had labeled the iraq war a " grave mistake " following his election earlier this year , said the conflict was chiefly responsible for the heavy losses suffered by bush 's republican party . " there were also a few problems in domestic politics , but these also came from the war in iraq , " prodi was quoted as saying by the ansa news agency . senate loss would lead to negotiations if the republicans lose control of the senate as well as the house of representatives , bush " will certainly be a president who will have to negotiate everything with the opposition , " prodi added . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , one of washington 's staunchest allies , acknowledged that the iraqi issue had a " dominant influence " in the election result , and called on bush and the new congress to work together on key foreign policy issues . " the world needs a determined and energetic united states , " rasmussen said , adding that he hoped " the president and congress , under these new conditions , reach a common line on iraq and afghanistan . " germany magnanimous over midterms in germany , a government spokesman rejected suggestions that the republican defeat would cripple bush 's foreign policy for the remaining two years of the president 's term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt expects closer ties in the future " regardless of the outcome of the elections , the german government will continue to work with the us government and the us president , " spokesman ulrich wilhelm told a press conference .
" we do not see the us government 's capacity to act on foreign policy affected by the outcome of the elections , " he added . but karsten voigt , a key advisor to chancellor angela merkel on transatlantic issues , predicted that washington would now be seen to lean more heavily on europe for help with its foreign policy challenges . " the democrats have criticized president bush for not listening enough to the europeans , to the allies , " voigt said .
" the president has already moved in this direction , especially towards the europeans , but the democrats will demand that he goes further . " eu socialists hail " beginning of the nightmare 's end " the second-largest bloc in the european parliament , the socialist group sent a congratulatory message to the democrats , hailing their victory as " the beginning of the end of a six-year nightmare for the world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz and his socialists welcomed the results " your victory will allow europe and the united states to resume their partnership , " socialist group president martin schulz said in the message . global finance markets wobbled on fears that the democrat success could prompt less market-friendly policies in the world 's biggest economy . european indices eased off fresh five-year highs struck the previous day , while japanese shares tumbled by more than one percent , as investors also feared that a split in power in washington would create legislative gridlock . mixed reactions in iraq in iraq itself , there was mixed public mixed reaction to the election result . qais abu ahmed , a middle-aged sunni employee in the housing ministry , said he preferred the republicans to stay in power because the iraqi army itself was still too weak to ensure security in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us troop withdrawl would provoke mixed feelings " any withdrawal of the american army would be a big disaster .
there would be at the very least a civil war , if not a major massacre the next day , " he said . some iraqis , however , saw in the democrat victory the hope of an early us pullout .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 09.11.2006 ten-game winless streak leaves mainz reeling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 6-1 drubbing by bremen has been just one of mainz 's low points tiny mainz won legions of fans as they avoided relegation the past two seasons .
but personal changes and plain old bad luck have left coach jürgen klopp searching for answers and mainz bottom of the table . " this defeat just feels wretched and dirty , " said klopp immediately after his team lost to 2-1 at home to wolfsburg on tuesday .
the game summed up the likeable western german club 's whole season .
mainz had the majority of possession , but it was their opponents who made more of their opportunities . when mainz were promoted in 2004 , most experts predicted they would go straight back down to the second division .
klopp defied the odds , keeping the underdogs in the first division with an aggressive brand of attacking soccer that was both entertaining and successful . klopp himself , who is as excitable as any fan on the sidelines , is arguably the league 's most popular coach .
but ten winless games on the trot have left mainz in the relegation zone and given klopp more reason to tear at his hair than to pump his fists . " at the moment it 's a very difficult test , " klopp said after the disappointment against wolfsburg .
" but we 'll get through it .
i take heart from the fact that we kept trying for 90 minutes .
the ball just did n't want to go in . " anemic attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ever-passionate jürgen klopp has vowed to fight on that , in a nutshell , is mainz 's problem .
the team has scored only 10 goals this season , exactly half of its tally at this point in the 2004 campaign , mainz 's first in the top flight . this shortcoming is understandable considering that mainz lost all three of its top strikers last year in the off-season .
andreas thurk and benjamin auer signed with frankfurt and bochum respectively , and mohamed zidan , who was on loan from bremen , was recalled to the current league leaders . that trio scored 30 goals for klopp last season - a total their replacements have n't even begun to match .
strikers mimoun azaouagh and imre szabics have only two goals apiece , far too few for a team whose approach to the game is predicated on its forwards . bremen salvation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team management hopes to see mohamed zidan in a mainz uniform again mainz management has made little secret of the fact they 'd like to bring back zidan , who has seen little playing time at bremen .
but thus far , werder has refused to let the striker go . mainz fans can take comfort in the fact that klopp saved the club in a tooth-and-nails relegation battle last season .
whether he can repeat that feat this time around may depend on decisions made not in mainz , but in bremen . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no changes at the top of the table werder bremen maintain their overall lead with an away win against nuremberg , while stuttgart keep pace by beating hamburg at home .

earlier , sources had suggested up to one quarter of the government-owned company would be offered for sale . political infighting german chancellor angela merkel affirmed on tuesday plans to privatize the country 's rail system despite political infighting about whether to sell the system 's land and tracks too . " we stand by our intention to list deutsche bahn on the stock exchange , " merkel said , speaking to german business leaders . assets of the group include its international freight operations using both trucks and trains , inter-city express -lrb- ice -rrb- bullet trains serving major german cities and metro rail networks .
earlier this year the company opened the jewel among its stations , a glistening glass-and-steel interchange in the heart of berlin . compromise reached bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn last week the federally owned rail company 's ceo , hartmut mehdorn , admitted to having doubts on whether the flotation , which he had enthusiastically promoted , would go through . last week , mehdorn warned the company might need to find other sources of capital for huge projects , but added that he would stay at his post whatever happened . " i 'm not a guy who gives up , " mehdorn said . the retention of state rights to the track was a key demand of the christian democrats , whereas the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- opposed any british-style separation of the railtrack and the rolling-stock businesses .
the compromise is expected to satisfy both parties . an expensive investment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german railway network remains a point of political contention efforts aimed at privatizing the federal railway began in 1994 and since then a staggering 213 billion euros -lrb- $ 271 billion dollars -rrb- of state money has flowed into the railways . the results have been sobering with just 12.4 per cent more people using the train to travel in the period from 1994 to 2005 .
the number of people taking the train for longer trips actually fell by 3.5 per cent during this period .
last year the amount of freight carried by the german railway declined by 1 per cent compared with 2004 . " the 213 billion euro disaster " was how the german daily die welt headlined its wednesday story on germany 's railway privatization bid . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german anti-terrorist technology scans faces in train stations railway authorities in germany are conducting tests of revolutionary biometric facial recognition software that enables computers to pick out the faces of suspected terrorists in a crowd .

markus wolf , the shadowy spy master of communist east germany died in his sleep , according to a family member .
he was 83 years old . called " the man without a face " because western intelligence services long lacked even a picture of him , wolf directed one of the world 's most formidable espionage networks for nearly three decades . wolf died on the 17th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , nov .
9 . wolf successfully ran more than 4,000 spies across the iron curtain during his tenure at the foreign intelligence division of the stasi secret police from 1958 to 1987 , embedding countless " moles " deep into the west german government . most famously , he placed günter guillaume as a top aide to west german chancellor willy brandt .
when the agent was unmasked in 1974 , brandt was forced to resign .
wolf was also responsible for recruiting the head of west german counter-espionage , hans-joachim tiedge , as a double agent .
his spies were said to be so effective that east german head of state erich honecker regularly got to read the weekly intelligence digest of west german espionage before the west german chancellor . man without a face bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolf had a shadowy identity and was called " the man without a face " the west did not even have an authenticated picture of wolf until the late 1970s , and the first public photograph of him was published only in 1982 . known by the russian nickname of " misha , " wolf charmed many of those who had sworn bitter hatred of him .
tall , dressed in elegant western-style suits and wire-framed glasses , and good-looking , he was dubbed " the paul newman of spying " by the west german tabloid press . wolf was born in 1923 in hechingen , western germany .
his father friedrich was a well-known jewish communist writer , and his brother konrad became a famous film director . fearing nazi persecution , the family fled to the soviet union in 1934 , where they stayed for the next 11 years .
he had hoped to study aircraft engineering , but in 1945 was sent by the communist party to work in radio in berlin . he worked in east germany 's moscow embassy for two years as first counsellor before returning to build up the espionage service .
he left his post for " personal reasons " in 1987 . exiled in russia on sept .
30 , 1990 , three days before reunification went into effect he fled to moscow .
a west german arrest warrant had already been out for him for 15 months . in moscow , he wrote books about his family and life as an exile , one of which , " the troika , " was published in the west to critical acclaim . return to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in later years , wolf became a successful author wolf eventually returned of his own free will and was arrested and put on trial in düsseldorf .
he was sentenced in 1993 to six years in prison for high treason , but in a landmark decision , the country 's top court ruled that east german spies could not be prosecuted . wolf was briefly jailed for contempt of court because he resisted a judge 's demand to unmask former spies saying he was a victim of " victors ' justice . " in later years , wolf became a top-selling author , releasing his memoirs called " the man without a face " and a blend of recipes and anecdotes called " secrets of the russian kitchen .

" speaking with one voice is what makes europe strong , " merkel said in a speech addressing the german council on foreign relations in berlin on wednesday . the german chancellor said she would like to see more constructive debates and less quarreling during the six-month german eu presidency , starting on jan .
1 , 2007 . this will be a challenge both with inner-european issues such as the question of constitutional reforms , and in the realm of foreign policy . merkel said that turkey would face consequences if ankara failed to open its ports to ships and planes from cyprus as part of a bid to join the european union . " turkey must fulfill its obligations by the end of the year , " merkel said .
" otherwise the eu will draw the appropriate conclusions . " the german leader underlined that a continuation of ankara 's present ban on ships and aircraft from eu member state cyprus was out of the question . the remarks came as the european union on wednesday gave turkey a mid-december deadline to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels , saying this was a key condition for keeping ankara 's eu entry bid on track . kosovo : a sensitive topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence is a current international topic merkel stressed that negotiations about the future status of kosovo will be of central importance for the eu . " what should happen by no means is that we stabilize one part , but for the price of destabilizing other parts , " merkel said . " the relationship to serbia is complex and it can effect macedonia and bosnia and herzegovina .
that is why we need to approach this with utmost sensitivity without bringing the process to a halt , " she said . the serbian parliament officially adopted the country 's new constitution on wednesday reiterating serbia 's claim over kosovo , offering wide autonomy but ruling out possible independence for the province largely populated by ethnic albanians . keeping the gas flowing another important aspect of the eu foreign policy will be the relationship to russia , one of europe 's most important trade partners and energy suppliers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is an important energy supplier for the eu merkel said that a new cooperation and partnership agreement with russia should have its energy chapter " formulated with clear basic rules . " " russia is at the moment not ready to ratify the transit protocol of the energy charter treaty , " merkel said .
" we would like to see that happen . " the energy charter treaty - an international agreement which was signed in 1994 together with a protocol on energy efficiency with the aim of integrating western and eastern european energy markets - would give european companies wider access to russian gas and oil fields and to the russian energy market .
russia , however , remains wary of foreign companies tapping into the country 's energy sources . " many eyes will be directed towards germany as far as wider responsibility in the world is concerned , " merkel said .
" and we will not be able to shun this responsibility .

9 . wolf successfully ran more than 4,000 spies across the iron curtain during his tenure at the foreign intelligence division of the stasi secret police from 1958 to 1987 , embedding countless " moles " deep into the west german government . most famously , he placed günter guillaume as a top aide to west german chancellor willy brandt .

" speaking with one voice is what makes europe strong , " merkel said in a speech addressing the german council on foreign relations in berlin on wednesday . the german chancellor said she would like to see more constructive debates and less quarreling during the six-month german eu presidency , starting on jan .
1 , 2007 . this will be a challenge both with inner-european issues such as the question of constitutional reforms , and in the realm of foreign policy . merkel said that turkey would face consequences if ankara failed to open its ports to ships and planes from cyprus as part of a bid to join the european union . " turkey must fulfill its obligations by the end of the year , " merkel said .
" otherwise the eu will draw the appropriate conclusions . " the german leader underlined that a continuation of ankara 's present ban on ships and aircraft from eu member state cyprus was out of the question . the remarks came as the european union on wednesday gave turkey a mid-december deadline to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels , saying this was a key condition for keeping ankara 's eu entry bid on track . kosovo : a sensitive topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence is a current international topic merkel stressed that negotiations about the future status of kosovo will be of central importance for the eu . " what should happen by no means is that we stabilize one part , but for the price of destabilizing other parts , " merkel said . " the relationship to serbia is complex and it can effect macedonia and bosnia and herzegovina .
that is why we need to approach this with utmost sensitivity without bringing the process to a halt , " she said . the serbian parliament officially adopted the country 's new constitution on wednesday reiterating serbia 's claim over kosovo , offering wide autonomy but ruling out possible independence for the province largely populated by ethnic albanians . keeping the gas flowing another important aspect of the eu foreign policy will be the relationship to russia , one of europe 's most important trade partners and energy suppliers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is an important energy supplier for the eu merkel said that a new cooperation and partnership agreement with russia should have its energy chapter " formulated with clear basic rules . " " russia is at the moment not ready to ratify the transit protocol of the energy charter treaty , " merkel said .
" we would like to see that happen . " the energy charter treaty - an international agreement which was signed in 1994 together with a protocol on energy efficiency with the aim of integrating western and eastern european energy markets - would give european companies wider access to russian gas and oil fields and to the russian energy market .
russia , however , remains wary of foreign companies tapping into the country 's energy sources . " many eyes will be directed towards germany as far as wider responsibility in the world is concerned , " merkel said .
" and we will not be able to shun this responsibility .

markus wolf , the shadowy spy master of communist east germany died in his sleep , according to a family member .
he was 83 years old . called " the man without a face " because western intelligence services long lacked even a picture of him , wolf directed one of the world 's most formidable espionage networks for nearly three decades . wolf died on the 17th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , nov .
9 . wolf successfully ran more than 4,000 spies across the iron curtain during his tenure at the foreign intelligence division of the stasi secret police from 1958 to 1987 , embedding countless " moles " deep into the west german government . most famously , he placed günter guillaume as a top aide to west german chancellor willy brandt .
when the agent was unmasked in 1974 , brandt was forced to resign .
wolf was also responsible for recruiting the head of west german counter-espionage , hans-joachim tiedge , as a double agent .
his spies were said to be so effective that east german head of state erich honecker regularly got to read the weekly intelligence digest of west german espionage before the west german chancellor . man without a face bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolf had a shadowy identity and was called " the man without a face " the west did not even have an authenticated picture of wolf until the late 1970s , and the first public photograph of him was published only in 1982 . known by the russian nickname of " misha , " wolf charmed many of those who had sworn bitter hatred of him .
tall , dressed in elegant western-style suits and wire-framed glasses , and good-looking , he was dubbed " the paul newman of spying " by the west german tabloid press . wolf was born in 1923 in hechingen , western germany .
his father friedrich was a well-known jewish communist writer , and his brother konrad became a famous film director . fearing nazi persecution , the family fled to the soviet union in 1934 , where they stayed for the next 11 years .
he had hoped to study aircraft engineering , but in 1945 was sent by the communist party to work in radio in berlin . he worked in east germany 's moscow embassy for two years as first counsellor before returning to build up the espionage service .
he left his post for " personal reasons " in 1987 . exiled in russia on sept .
30 , 1990 , three days before reunification went into effect he fled to moscow .
a west german arrest warrant had already been out for him for 15 months . in moscow , he wrote books about his family and life as an exile , one of which , " the troika , " was published in the west to critical acclaim . return to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in later years , wolf became a successful author wolf eventually returned of his own free will and was arrested and put on trial in düsseldorf .
he was sentenced in 1993 to six years in prison for high treason , but in a landmark decision , the country 's top court ruled that east german spies could not be prosecuted . wolf was briefly jailed for contempt of court because he resisted a judge 's demand to unmask former spies saying he was a victim of " victors ' justice .

above all , his iraq policies are to blame , commentators said . the leipziger volkszeitung said no one can dismiss iraq as the main reason republicans lost the election .
" a war president has found himself on the defensive , even in his own country : george bush will himself admit that he is the chief reason for the defeat of his republican party in the congressional elections .
the recent corruption and sex scandals meant a loss of moral ground .
but nothing influenced the results as much as the inability of the us government to pacify the situation in iraq . " according to the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung , democrats were able to frame the election as a vote for or against bush 's iraq policy .
yet republicans will still have a chance in the next election , if bush can show some type of victory in iraq and if democrats lean too far left .
in the us , " patriotism remains more important than pacifism and america remains a religious country .
the war in iraq will remain , in retrospect legitimate , as long as it ends with a victory . " le figaro of paris noted president bush is now a " lame duck . "
" he has wasted his political capital and does n't have many options left .
it is , one might say , an optimal chance for him to radically change his approach .
he must rescue what he can from his grandiose plan to democratize the middle east , which up to now , has only had one concrete result : the trial against saddam hussein . " the dutch newspaper volkskrant said voters punished the republican congress for not intervening to correct the mistaken policies of president bush .
" the election results must be seen as a republican defeat rather than as a win for the democrats .
the voters have punished president bush for his failed iraq politics -lrb- and for his dreadful appearance after hurricane katrina . -rrb- " in the uk , the independent reflected most opinions with its front-page headline : " it 's the war , stupid . " the financial times said bush could salvage the remainder of his presidency by showing humility and cooperating with the democrats .
" americans have at last started to hold to account the republican leadership and the administration of george w. bush for their incompetence and disdain for the law , and for the way they have dragged america 's reputation through the mud and muddle of the middle east . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de waiting for the us foreign policy sea change foreign opponents of the war in iraq on cheered the prospect of a democratic-controlled us congress , while allies of president george w. bush pondered the possibility of a major shift in us foreign policy .
-lrb- 09.11.2006 -rrb- us elections mark new beginning for transatlantic ties the democratic party 's victory in us midterm elections has been welcomed across the atlantic .
german experts expect this political change to improve bilateral relations , both politically and in terms of public opinion .
-lrb- 08.11.2006 -rrb- europeans revel in us republican defeat the european reaction to democrat wins in midterm us elections was overwhelmingly positive .
observers said they hoped the us and europe could start healing widening trans-atlantic rifts .

above all , his iraq policies are to blame , commentators said . the leipziger volkszeitung said no one can dismiss iraq as the main reason republicans lost the election .
" a war president has found himself on the defensive , even in his own country : george bush will himself admit that he is the chief reason for the defeat of his republican party in the congressional elections .
the recent corruption and sex scandals meant a loss of moral ground .
but nothing influenced the results as much as the inability of the us government to pacify the situation in iraq . " according to the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung , democrats were able to frame the election as a vote for or against bush 's iraq policy .
yet republicans will still have a chance in the next election , if bush can show some type of victory in iraq and if democrats lean too far left .
in the us , " patriotism remains more important than pacifism and america remains a religious country .
the war in iraq will remain , in retrospect legitimate , as long as it ends with a victory . " le figaro of paris noted president bush is now a " lame duck . "
" he has wasted his political capital and does n't have many options left .
it is , one might say , an optimal chance for him to radically change his approach .
he must rescue what he can from his grandiose plan to democratize the middle east , which up to now , has only had one concrete result : the trial against saddam hussein . " the dutch newspaper volkskrant said voters punished the republican congress for not intervening to correct the mistaken policies of president bush .
" the election results must be seen as a republican defeat rather than as a win for the democrats .
the voters have punished president bush for his failed iraq politics -lrb- and for his dreadful appearance after hurricane katrina . -rrb- " in the uk , the independent reflected most opinions with its front-page headline : " it 's the war , stupid . " the financial times said bush could salvage the remainder of his presidency by showing humility and cooperating with the democrats .
" americans have at last started to hold to account the republican leadership and the administration of george w. bush for their incompetence and disdain for the law , and for the way they have dragged america 's reputation through the mud and muddle of the middle east .

" speaking with one voice is what makes europe strong , " merkel said in a speech addressing the german council on foreign relations in berlin on wednesday . the german chancellor said she would like to see more constructive debates and less quarreling during the six-month german eu presidency , starting on jan .
1 , 2007 . this will be a challenge both with inner-european issues such as the question of constitutional reforms , and in the realm of foreign policy . merkel said that turkey would face consequences if ankara failed to open its ports to ships and planes from cyprus as part of a bid to join the european union . " turkey must fulfill its obligations by the end of the year , " merkel said .
" otherwise the eu will draw the appropriate conclusions . " the german leader underlined that a continuation of ankara 's present ban on ships and aircraft from eu member state cyprus was out of the question . the remarks came as the european union on wednesday gave turkey a mid-december deadline to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels , saying this was a key condition for keeping ankara 's eu entry bid on track . kosovo : a sensitive topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence is a current international topic merkel stressed that negotiations about the future status of kosovo will be of central importance for the eu .

" the relationship to serbia is complex and it can effect macedonia and bosnia and herzegovina .
that is why we need to approach this with utmost sensitivity without bringing the process to a halt , " she said . the serbian parliament officially adopted the country 's new constitution on wednesday reiterating serbia 's claim over kosovo , offering wide autonomy but ruling out possible independence for the province largely populated by ethnic albanians . keeping the gas flowing another important aspect of the eu foreign policy will be the relationship to russia , one of europe 's most important trade partners and energy suppliers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is an important energy supplier for the eu merkel said that a new cooperation and partnership agreement with russia should have its energy chapter " formulated with clear basic rules . " " russia is at the moment not ready to ratify the transit protocol of the energy charter treaty , " merkel said .
" we would like to see that happen . " the energy charter treaty - an international agreement which was signed in 1994 together with a protocol on energy efficiency with the aim of integrating western and eastern european energy markets - would give european companies wider access to russian gas and oil fields and to the russian energy market .
russia , however , remains wary of foreign companies tapping into the country 's energy sources . " many eyes will be directed towards germany as far as wider responsibility in the world is concerned , " merkel said .

above all , his iraq policies are to blame , commentators said . the leipziger volkszeitung said no one can dismiss iraq as the main reason republicans lost the election .
" a war president has found himself on the defensive , even in his own country : george bush will himself admit that he is the chief reason for the defeat of his republican party in the congressional elections .
the recent corruption and sex scandals meant a loss of moral ground .
but nothing influenced the results as much as the inability of the us government to pacify the situation in iraq . " according to the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung , democrats were able to frame the election as a vote for or against bush 's iraq policy .
yet republicans will still have a chance in the next election , if bush can show some type of victory in iraq and if democrats lean too far left .
in the us , " patriotism remains more important than pacifism and america remains a religious country .
the war in iraq will remain , in retrospect legitimate , as long as it ends with a victory . " le figaro of paris noted president bush is now a " lame duck . "
" he has wasted his political capital and does n't have many options left .
it is , one might say , an optimal chance for him to radically change his approach .
he must rescue what he can from his grandiose plan to democratize the middle east , which up to now , has only had one concrete result : the trial against saddam hussein . " the dutch newspaper volkskrant said voters punished the republican congress for not intervening to correct the mistaken policies of president bush .
" the election results must be seen as a republican defeat rather than as a win for the democrats .
the voters have punished president bush for his failed iraq politics -lrb- and for his dreadful appearance after hurricane katrina . -rrb- " in the uk , the independent reflected most opinions with its front-page headline : " it 's the war , stupid . " the financial times said bush could salvage the remainder of his presidency by showing humility and cooperating with the democrats .
" americans have at last started to hold to account the republican leadership and the administration of george w. bush for their incompetence and disdain for the law , and for the way they have dragged america 's reputation through the mud and muddle of the middle east . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de waiting for the us foreign policy sea change foreign opponents of the war in iraq on cheered the prospect of a democratic-controlled us congress , while allies of president george w. bush pondered the possibility of a major shift in us foreign policy .
-lrb- 09.11.2006 -rrb- us elections mark new beginning for transatlantic ties the democratic party 's victory in us midterm elections has been welcomed across the atlantic .
german experts expect this political change to improve bilateral relations , both politically and in terms of public opinion .
-lrb- 08.11.2006 -rrb- europeans revel in us republican defeat the european reaction to democrat wins in midterm us elections was overwhelmingly positive .

markus wolf , the shadowy spy master of communist east germany died in his sleep , according to a family member .
he was 83 years old . called " the man without a face " because western intelligence services long lacked even a picture of him , wolf directed one of the world 's most formidable espionage networks for nearly three decades . wolf died on the 17th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , nov .
9 . wolf successfully ran more than 4,000 spies across the iron curtain during his tenure at the foreign intelligence division of the stasi secret police from 1958 to 1987 , embedding countless " moles " deep into the west german government . most famously , he placed günter guillaume as a top aide to west german chancellor willy brandt .
when the agent was unmasked in 1974 , brandt was forced to resign .
wolf was also responsible for recruiting the head of west german counter-espionage , hans-joachim tiedge , as a double agent .
his spies were said to be so effective that east german head of state erich honecker regularly got to read the weekly intelligence digest of west german espionage before the west german chancellor . man without a face bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolf had a shadowy identity and was called " the man without a face " the west did not even have an authenticated picture of wolf until the late 1970s , and the first public photograph of him was published only in 1982 . known by the russian nickname of " misha , " wolf charmed many of those who had sworn bitter hatred of him .
tall , dressed in elegant western-style suits and wire-framed glasses , and good-looking , he was dubbed " the paul newman of spying " by the west german tabloid press . wolf was born in 1923 in hechingen , western germany .
his father friedrich was a well-known jewish communist writer , and his brother konrad became a famous film director . fearing nazi persecution , the family fled to the soviet union in 1934 , where they stayed for the next 11 years .
he had hoped to study aircraft engineering , but in 1945 was sent by the communist party to work in radio in berlin . he worked in east germany 's moscow embassy for two years as first counsellor before returning to build up the espionage service .
he left his post for " personal reasons " in 1987 . exiled in russia on sept .
30 , 1990 , three days before reunification went into effect he fled to moscow .
a west german arrest warrant had already been out for him for 15 months . in moscow , he wrote books about his family and life as an exile , one of which , " the troika , " was published in the west to critical acclaim . return to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in later years , wolf became a successful author wolf eventually returned of his own free will and was arrested and put on trial in düsseldorf .
he was sentenced in 1993 to six years in prison for high treason , but in a landmark decision , the country 's top court ruled that east german spies could not be prosecuted . wolf was briefly jailed for contempt of court because he resisted a judge 's demand to unmask former spies saying he was a victim of " victors ' justice . " in later years , wolf became a top-selling author , releasing his memoirs called " the man without a face " and a blend of recipes and anecdotes called " secrets of the russian kitchen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 09.11.2006 ten-game winless streak leaves mainz reeling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 6-1 drubbing by bremen has been just one of mainz 's low points tiny mainz won legions of fans as they avoided relegation the past two seasons .
but personal changes and plain old bad luck have left coach jürgen klopp searching for answers and mainz bottom of the table . " this defeat just feels wretched and dirty , " said klopp immediately after his team lost to 2-1 at home to wolfsburg on tuesday .
the game summed up the likeable western german club 's whole season .
mainz had the majority of possession , but it was their opponents who made more of their opportunities . when mainz were promoted in 2004 , most experts predicted they would go straight back down to the second division .
klopp defied the odds , keeping the underdogs in the first division with an aggressive brand of attacking soccer that was both entertaining and successful . klopp himself , who is as excitable as any fan on the sidelines , is arguably the league 's most popular coach .
but ten winless games on the trot have left mainz in the relegation zone and given klopp more reason to tear at his hair than to pump his fists . " at the moment it 's a very difficult test , " klopp said after the disappointment against wolfsburg .
" but we 'll get through it .
i take heart from the fact that we kept trying for 90 minutes .
the ball just did n't want to go in . " anemic attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ever-passionate jürgen klopp has vowed to fight on that , in a nutshell , is mainz 's problem .
the team has scored only 10 goals this season , exactly half of its tally at this point in the 2004 campaign , mainz 's first in the top flight . this shortcoming is understandable considering that mainz lost all three of its top strikers last year in the off-season .
andreas thurk and benjamin auer signed with frankfurt and bochum respectively , and mohamed zidan , who was on loan from bremen , was recalled to the current league leaders . that trio scored 30 goals for klopp last season - a total their replacements have n't even begun to match .
strikers mimoun azaouagh and imre szabics have only two goals apiece , far too few for a team whose approach to the game is predicated on its forwards . bremen salvation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team management hopes to see mohamed zidan in a mainz uniform again mainz management has made little secret of the fact they 'd like to bring back zidan , who has seen little playing time at bremen .
but thus far , werder has refused to let the striker go . mainz fans can take comfort in the fact that klopp saved the club in a tooth-and-nails relegation battle last season .

but personal changes and plain old bad luck have left coach jürgen klopp searching for answers and mainz bottom of the table . " this defeat just feels wretched and dirty , " said klopp immediately after his team lost to 2-1 at home to wolfsburg on tuesday .
the game summed up the likeable western german club 's whole season .
mainz had the majority of possession , but it was their opponents who made more of their opportunities . when mainz were promoted in 2004 , most experts predicted they would go straight back down to the second division .
klopp defied the odds , keeping the underdogs in the first division with an aggressive brand of attacking soccer that was both entertaining and successful . klopp himself , who is as excitable as any fan on the sidelines , is arguably the league 's most popular coach .
but ten winless games on the trot have left mainz in the relegation zone and given klopp more reason to tear at his hair than to pump his fists . " at the moment it 's a very difficult test , " klopp said after the disappointment against wolfsburg .

the team has scored only 10 goals this season , exactly half of its tally at this point in the 2004 campaign , mainz 's first in the top flight . this shortcoming is understandable considering that mainz lost all three of its top strikers last year in the off-season .
andreas thurk and benjamin auer signed with frankfurt and bochum respectively , and mohamed zidan , who was on loan from bremen , was recalled to the current league leaders . that trio scored 30 goals for klopp last season - a total their replacements have n't even begun to match .

earlier , sources had suggested up to one quarter of the government-owned company would be offered for sale . political infighting german chancellor angela merkel affirmed on tuesday plans to privatize the country 's rail system despite political infighting about whether to sell the system 's land and tracks too . " we stand by our intention to list deutsche bahn on the stock exchange , " merkel said , speaking to german business leaders . assets of the group include its international freight operations using both trucks and trains , inter-city express -lrb- ice -rrb- bullet trains serving major german cities and metro rail networks .
earlier this year the company opened the jewel among its stations , a glistening glass-and-steel interchange in the heart of berlin . compromise reached bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn last week the federally owned rail company 's ceo , hartmut mehdorn , admitted to having doubts on whether the flotation , which he had enthusiastically promoted , would go through . last week , mehdorn warned the company might need to find other sources of capital for huge projects , but added that he would stay at his post whatever happened . " i 'm not a guy who gives up , " mehdorn said . the retention of state rights to the track was a key demand of the christian democrats , whereas the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- opposed any british-style separation of the railtrack and the rolling-stock businesses .
the compromise is expected to satisfy both parties . an expensive investment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german railway network remains a point of political contention efforts aimed at privatizing the federal railway began in 1994 and since then a staggering 213 billion euros -lrb- $ 271 billion dollars -rrb- of state money has flowed into the railways . the results have been sobering with just 12.4 per cent more people using the train to travel in the period from 1994 to 2005 .
the number of people taking the train for longer trips actually fell by 3.5 per cent during this period .
last year the amount of freight carried by the german railway declined by 1 per cent compared with 2004 . " the 213 billion euro disaster " was how the german daily die welt headlined its wednesday story on germany 's railway privatization bid . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german anti-terrorist technology scans faces in train stations railway authorities in germany are conducting tests of revolutionary biometric facial recognition software that enables computers to pick out the faces of suspected terrorists in a crowd .

the war in iraq will remain , in retrospect legitimate , as long as it ends with a victory . " le figaro of paris noted president bush is now a " lame duck . "
" he has wasted his political capital and does n't have many options left .
it is , one might say , an optimal chance for him to radically change his approach .
he must rescue what he can from his grandiose plan to democratize the middle east , which up to now , has only had one concrete result : the trial against saddam hussein .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de deutsche bahn -pipe- 09.11.2006 germany agrees to partly privatize railway system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government has invested 213 billion euros into the railways since 1994 germany 's ruling coalition has agreed to partly privatize the country 's federal rail system by 2009 , government officials announced on wednesday in berlin after months of wrangling . investors are to be offered a minority stake in the deutsche bahn rail company , which operates not only trains but also trucks in several european nations . hans-peter friedrich , representing chancellor angela merkel 's own christian democrats , said after inter-party talks that the government would remain owner of the 34,000 kilometers of track and the stations , but deutsche bahn would obtain contractual rights of use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee , who is a social democrat , said the parties struck a deal where the government would not take over any of bahn 's debt and existing job guarantees for bahn staff would remain in place . a privatization bill would be drafted by the end of next march . another social democrat , ludwig stiegler , said the size of the first share tranche would depend on the value of deutsche bahn at the time of the offering .
earlier , sources had suggested up to one quarter of the government-owned company would be offered for sale . political infighting german chancellor angela merkel affirmed on tuesday plans to privatize the country 's rail system despite political infighting about whether to sell the system 's land and tracks too . " we stand by our intention to list deutsche bahn on the stock exchange , " merkel said , speaking to german business leaders . assets of the group include its international freight operations using both trucks and trains , inter-city express -lrb- ice -rrb- bullet trains serving major german cities and metro rail networks .
earlier this year the company opened the jewel among its stations , a glistening glass-and-steel interchange in the heart of berlin . compromise reached bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn last week the federally owned rail company 's ceo , hartmut mehdorn , admitted to having doubts on whether the flotation , which he had enthusiastically promoted , would go through . last week , mehdorn warned the company might need to find other sources of capital for huge projects , but added that he would stay at his post whatever happened . " i 'm not a guy who gives up , " mehdorn said . the retention of state rights to the track was a key demand of the christian democrats , whereas the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- opposed any british-style separation of the railtrack and the rolling-stock businesses .
the compromise is expected to satisfy both parties . an expensive investment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german railway network remains a point of political contention efforts aimed at privatizing the federal railway began in 1994 and since then a staggering 213 billion euros -lrb- $ 271 billion dollars -rrb- of state money has flowed into the railways . the results have been sobering with just 12.4 per cent more people using the train to travel in the period from 1994 to 2005 .
the number of people taking the train for longer trips actually fell by 3.5 per cent during this period .
last year the amount of freight carried by the german railway declined by 1 per cent compared with 2004 . " the 213 billion euro disaster " was how the german daily die welt headlined its wednesday story on germany 's railway privatization bid . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german anti-terrorist technology scans faces in train stations railway authorities in germany are conducting tests of revolutionary biometric facial recognition software that enables computers to pick out the faces of suspected terrorists in a crowd .

markus wolf , the shadowy spy master of communist east germany died in his sleep , according to a family member .
he was 83 years old . called " the man without a face " because western intelligence services long lacked even a picture of him , wolf directed one of the world 's most formidable espionage networks for nearly three decades . wolf died on the 17th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , nov .

when the agent was unmasked in 1974 , brandt was forced to resign .
wolf was also responsible for recruiting the head of west german counter-espionage , hans-joachim tiedge , as a double agent .

he was sentenced in 1993 to six years in prison for high treason , but in a landmark decision , the country 's top court ruled that east german spies could not be prosecuted . wolf was briefly jailed for contempt of court because he resisted a judge 's demand to unmask former spies saying he was a victim of " victors ' justice .

" japan 's support for iraq will not change , " japanese prime minister shinzo abe told reporters . " the international community has worked to rebuild iraq .
japan will continue to do what we can , " said abe , who took office in september .
his predecessor , junichiro koizumi , had taken the landmark step of deploying japanese troops to iraq . japanese opposition leaders saw the election result as a major slap in the face for bush and warned abe against pursuing what they described as koizumi 's slavish support for the us president . bush has been severely judged " president bush , who was an ally of former prime minister koizumi , has been severely judged by his people , " said mizuho fukushima , head of the social democratic party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi suggests that iraq was a deciding factor italian prime minister romano prodi , who had labeled the iraq war a " grave mistake " following his election earlier this year , said the conflict was chiefly responsible for the heavy losses suffered by bush 's republican party . " there were also a few problems in domestic politics , but these also came from the war in iraq , " prodi was quoted as saying by the ansa news agency . senate loss would lead to negotiations if the republicans lose control of the senate as well as the house of representatives , bush " will certainly be a president who will have to negotiate everything with the opposition , " prodi added . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , one of washington 's staunchest allies , acknowledged that the iraqi issue had a " dominant influence " in the election result , and called on bush and the new congress to work together on key foreign policy issues . " the world needs a determined and energetic united states , " rasmussen said , adding that he hoped " the president and congress , under these new conditions , reach a common line on iraq and afghanistan .

" we do not see the us government 's capacity to act on foreign policy affected by the outcome of the elections , " he added . but karsten voigt , a key advisor to chancellor angela merkel on transatlantic issues , predicted that washington would now be seen to lean more heavily on europe for help with its foreign policy challenges . " the democrats have criticized president bush for not listening enough to the europeans , to the allies , " voigt said .
" the president has already moved in this direction , especially towards the europeans , but the democrats will demand that he goes further . " eu socialists hail " beginning of the nightmare 's end " the second-largest bloc in the european parliament , the socialist group sent a congratulatory message to the democrats , hailing their victory as " the beginning of the end of a six-year nightmare for the world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz and his socialists welcomed the results " your victory will allow europe and the united states to resume their partnership , " socialist group president martin schulz said in the message . global finance markets wobbled on fears that the democrat success could prompt less market-friendly policies in the world 's biggest economy . european indices eased off fresh five-year highs struck the previous day , while japanese shares tumbled by more than one percent , as investors also feared that a split in power in washington would create legislative gridlock . mixed reactions in iraq in iraq itself , there was mixed public mixed reaction to the election result . qais abu ahmed , a middle-aged sunni employee in the housing ministry , said he preferred the republicans to stay in power because the iraqi army itself was still too weak to ensure security in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us troop withdrawl would provoke mixed feelings " any withdrawal of the american army would be a big disaster .
there would be at the very least a civil war , if not a major massacre the next day , " he said . some iraqis , however , saw in the democrat victory the hope of an early us pullout .

" speaking with one voice is what makes europe strong , " merkel said in a speech addressing the german council on foreign relations in berlin on wednesday . the german chancellor said she would like to see more constructive debates and less quarreling during the six-month german eu presidency , starting on jan .
1 , 2007 . this will be a challenge both with inner-european issues such as the question of constitutional reforms , and in the realm of foreign policy . merkel said that turkey would face consequences if ankara failed to open its ports to ships and planes from cyprus as part of a bid to join the european union . " turkey must fulfill its obligations by the end of the year , " merkel said .
" otherwise the eu will draw the appropriate conclusions . " the german leader underlined that a continuation of ankara 's present ban on ships and aircraft from eu member state cyprus was out of the question . the remarks came as the european union on wednesday gave turkey a mid-december deadline to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels , saying this was a key condition for keeping ankara 's eu entry bid on track . kosovo : a sensitive topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence is a current international topic merkel stressed that negotiations about the future status of kosovo will be of central importance for the eu . " what should happen by no means is that we stabilize one part , but for the price of destabilizing other parts , " merkel said . " the relationship to serbia is complex and it can effect macedonia and bosnia and herzegovina .
that is why we need to approach this with utmost sensitivity without bringing the process to a halt , " she said . the serbian parliament officially adopted the country 's new constitution on wednesday reiterating serbia 's claim over kosovo , offering wide autonomy but ruling out possible independence for the province largely populated by ethnic albanians . keeping the gas flowing another important aspect of the eu foreign policy will be the relationship to russia , one of europe 's most important trade partners and energy suppliers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is an important energy supplier for the eu merkel said that a new cooperation and partnership agreement with russia should have its energy chapter " formulated with clear basic rules . " " russia is at the moment not ready to ratify the transit protocol of the energy charter treaty , " merkel said .
" we would like to see that happen . " the energy charter treaty - an international agreement which was signed in 1994 together with a protocol on energy efficiency with the aim of integrating western and eastern european energy markets - would give european companies wider access to russian gas and oil fields and to the russian energy market .
russia , however , remains wary of foreign companies tapping into the country 's energy sources . " many eyes will be directed towards germany as far as wider responsibility in the world is concerned , " merkel said .

" japan 's support for iraq will not change , " japanese prime minister shinzo abe told reporters . " the international community has worked to rebuild iraq .
japan will continue to do what we can , " said abe , who took office in september .
his predecessor , junichiro koizumi , had taken the landmark step of deploying japanese troops to iraq . japanese opposition leaders saw the election result as a major slap in the face for bush and warned abe against pursuing what they described as koizumi 's slavish support for the us president . bush has been severely judged " president bush , who was an ally of former prime minister koizumi , has been severely judged by his people , " said mizuho fukushima , head of the social democratic party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi suggests that iraq was a deciding factor italian prime minister romano prodi , who had labeled the iraq war a " grave mistake " following his election earlier this year , said the conflict was chiefly responsible for the heavy losses suffered by bush 's republican party . " there were also a few problems in domestic politics , but these also came from the war in iraq , " prodi was quoted as saying by the ansa news agency . senate loss would lead to negotiations if the republicans lose control of the senate as well as the house of representatives , bush " will certainly be a president who will have to negotiate everything with the opposition , " prodi added . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , one of washington 's staunchest allies , acknowledged that the iraqi issue had a " dominant influence " in the election result , and called on bush and the new congress to work together on key foreign policy issues . " the world needs a determined and energetic united states , " rasmussen said , adding that he hoped " the president and congress , under these new conditions , reach a common line on iraq and afghanistan . " germany magnanimous over midterms in germany , a government spokesman rejected suggestions that the republican defeat would cripple bush 's foreign policy for the remaining two years of the president 's term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt expects closer ties in the future " regardless of the outcome of the elections , the german government will continue to work with the us government and the us president , " spokesman ulrich wilhelm told a press conference .
" we do not see the us government 's capacity to act on foreign policy affected by the outcome of the elections , " he added . but karsten voigt , a key advisor to chancellor angela merkel on transatlantic issues , predicted that washington would now be seen to lean more heavily on europe for help with its foreign policy challenges . " the democrats have criticized president bush for not listening enough to the europeans , to the allies , " voigt said .

earlier , sources had suggested up to one quarter of the government-owned company would be offered for sale . political infighting german chancellor angela merkel affirmed on tuesday plans to privatize the country 's rail system despite political infighting about whether to sell the system 's land and tracks too . " we stand by our intention to list deutsche bahn on the stock exchange , " merkel said , speaking to german business leaders . assets of the group include its international freight operations using both trucks and trains , inter-city express -lrb- ice -rrb- bullet trains serving major german cities and metro rail networks .
earlier this year the company opened the jewel among its stations , a glistening glass-and-steel interchange in the heart of berlin . compromise reached bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn last week the federally owned rail company 's ceo , hartmut mehdorn , admitted to having doubts on whether the flotation , which he had enthusiastically promoted , would go through . last week , mehdorn warned the company might need to find other sources of capital for huge projects , but added that he would stay at his post whatever happened . " i 'm not a guy who gives up , " mehdorn said . the retention of state rights to the track was a key demand of the christian democrats , whereas the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- opposed any british-style separation of the railtrack and the rolling-stock businesses .
the compromise is expected to satisfy both parties . an expensive investment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german railway network remains a point of political contention efforts aimed at privatizing the federal railway began in 1994 and since then a staggering 213 billion euros -lrb- $ 271 billion dollars -rrb- of state money has flowed into the railways . the results have been sobering with just 12.4 per cent more people using the train to travel in the period from 1994 to 2005 .
the number of people taking the train for longer trips actually fell by 3.5 per cent during this period .
last year the amount of freight carried by the german railway declined by 1 per cent compared with 2004 . " the 213 billion euro disaster " was how the german daily die welt headlined its wednesday story on germany 's railway privatization bid . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german anti-terrorist technology scans faces in train stations railway authorities in germany are conducting tests of revolutionary biometric facial recognition software that enables computers to pick out the faces of suspected terrorists in a crowd .

but personal changes and plain old bad luck have left coach jürgen klopp searching for answers and mainz bottom of the table . " this defeat just feels wretched and dirty , " said klopp immediately after his team lost to 2-1 at home to wolfsburg on tuesday .
the game summed up the likeable western german club 's whole season .
mainz had the majority of possession , but it was their opponents who made more of their opportunities . when mainz were promoted in 2004 , most experts predicted they would go straight back down to the second division .
klopp defied the odds , keeping the underdogs in the first division with an aggressive brand of attacking soccer that was both entertaining and successful . klopp himself , who is as excitable as any fan on the sidelines , is arguably the league 's most popular coach .
but ten winless games on the trot have left mainz in the relegation zone and given klopp more reason to tear at his hair than to pump his fists . " at the moment it 's a very difficult test , " klopp said after the disappointment against wolfsburg .

the team has scored only 10 goals this season , exactly half of its tally at this point in the 2004 campaign , mainz 's first in the top flight . this shortcoming is understandable considering that mainz lost all three of its top strikers last year in the off-season .
andreas thurk and benjamin auer signed with frankfurt and bochum respectively , and mohamed zidan , who was on loan from bremen , was recalled to the current league leaders . that trio scored 30 goals for klopp last season - a total their replacements have n't even begun to match .

the team has scored only 10 goals this season , exactly half of its tally at this point in the 2004 campaign , mainz 's first in the top flight . this shortcoming is understandable considering that mainz lost all three of its top strikers last year in the off-season .
andreas thurk and benjamin auer signed with frankfurt and bochum respectively , and mohamed zidan , who was on loan from bremen , was recalled to the current league leaders . that trio scored 30 goals for klopp last season - a total their replacements have n't even begun to match .

" japan 's support for iraq will not change , " japanese prime minister shinzo abe told reporters . " the international community has worked to rebuild iraq .
japan will continue to do what we can , " said abe , who took office in september .
his predecessor , junichiro koizumi , had taken the landmark step of deploying japanese troops to iraq . japanese opposition leaders saw the election result as a major slap in the face for bush and warned abe against pursuing what they described as koizumi 's slavish support for the us president . bush has been severely judged " president bush , who was an ally of former prime minister koizumi , has been severely judged by his people , " said mizuho fukushima , head of the social democratic party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi suggests that iraq was a deciding factor italian prime minister romano prodi , who had labeled the iraq war a " grave mistake " following his election earlier this year , said the conflict was chiefly responsible for the heavy losses suffered by bush 's republican party . " there were also a few problems in domestic politics , but these also came from the war in iraq , " prodi was quoted as saying by the ansa news agency . senate loss would lead to negotiations if the republicans lose control of the senate as well as the house of representatives , bush " will certainly be a president who will have to negotiate everything with the opposition , " prodi added . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , one of washington 's staunchest allies , acknowledged that the iraqi issue had a " dominant influence " in the election result , and called on bush and the new congress to work together on key foreign policy issues . " the world needs a determined and energetic united states , " rasmussen said , adding that he hoped " the president and congress , under these new conditions , reach a common line on iraq and afghanistan . " germany magnanimous over midterms in germany , a government spokesman rejected suggestions that the republican defeat would cripple bush 's foreign policy for the remaining two years of the president 's term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt expects closer ties in the future " regardless of the outcome of the elections , the german government will continue to work with the us government and the us president , " spokesman ulrich wilhelm told a press conference .
" we do not see the us government 's capacity to act on foreign policy affected by the outcome of the elections , " he added . but karsten voigt , a key advisor to chancellor angela merkel on transatlantic issues , predicted that washington would now be seen to lean more heavily on europe for help with its foreign policy challenges . " the democrats have criticized president bush for not listening enough to the europeans , to the allies , " voigt said .
" the president has already moved in this direction , especially towards the europeans , but the democrats will demand that he goes further . " eu socialists hail " beginning of the nightmare 's end " the second-largest bloc in the european parliament , the socialist group sent a congratulatory message to the democrats , hailing their victory as " the beginning of the end of a six-year nightmare for the world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz and his socialists welcomed the results " your victory will allow europe and the united states to resume their partnership , " socialist group president martin schulz said in the message . global finance markets wobbled on fears that the democrat success could prompt less market-friendly policies in the world 's biggest economy . european indices eased off fresh five-year highs struck the previous day , while japanese shares tumbled by more than one percent , as investors also feared that a split in power in washington would create legislative gridlock . mixed reactions in iraq in iraq itself , there was mixed public mixed reaction to the election result . qais abu ahmed , a middle-aged sunni employee in the housing ministry , said he preferred the republicans to stay in power because the iraqi army itself was still too weak to ensure security in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us troop withdrawl would provoke mixed feelings " any withdrawal of the american army would be a big disaster .
there would be at the very least a civil war , if not a major massacre the next day , " he said . some iraqis , however , saw in the democrat victory the hope of an early us pullout .

some germans remain skeptical of democracy , suspicious of jews and believe they are superior to other nations . approximately 5,000 germans were questioned in survey conducted for the respected friedrich ebert foundation , which is run by the social democratic party , partner in chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government . some expressed anti-democratic views .
nine percent of those polled believed that under some circumstances a dictatorship can be a better system to run a state than a democracy .
an iron-fisted leader who would " govern germany for the benefit of all " would be supported by 15 percent of the respondents .
one in four - 26 percent - said they favored a single party in germany " that would embody the national community as a whole . " regional differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a minority of germans hold far-right political views sociologist oliver decker of the university of leipzig , who conducted the study for the usuma opinion research institute , said he noticed key regional differences .
easterners , he said , were more likely to express xenophobic views while westerners were more anti-semitic . forty-four percent of those in the former communist east said that foreigners came to germany to exploit the generous social welfare system , versus 35.2 percent in the west . meanwhile 15.8 percent of westerners agreed with the statement " jews use dirty tricks more than other people " , against six percent in the east . westerners were also more likely to play down the importance of the nazi era , with nine percent saying they thought the focus on this period was exaggerated versus five percent in the east . about 15 percent said they believed the germans were " by nature " superior to other cultures while one in 10 said they believed that some human beings were unworthy to live . decker said that unemployed germans and pensioners expressed right-wing extremist views most often .
more men held far-right opinions than women . the issue concerns politicians in the german mainstream .
far-right parties have made major inroads in the economically depressed east and are represented in three state legislatures , although none have seats in the national parliament . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german jewish leader says right-wing violence recalls 1930s the president of the central council of jews in germany has said that the country was seeing a groundswell of right-wing violence which reminded her of the nazi era .

above all , his iraq policies are to blame , commentators said . the leipziger volkszeitung said no one can dismiss iraq as the main reason republicans lost the election .
" a war president has found himself on the defensive , even in his own country : george bush will himself admit that he is the chief reason for the defeat of his republican party in the congressional elections .
the recent corruption and sex scandals meant a loss of moral ground .
but nothing influenced the results as much as the inability of the us government to pacify the situation in iraq . " according to the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung , democrats were able to frame the election as a vote for or against bush 's iraq policy .
yet republicans will still have a chance in the next election , if bush can show some type of victory in iraq and if democrats lean too far left .
in the us , " patriotism remains more important than pacifism and america remains a religious country .
the war in iraq will remain , in retrospect legitimate , as long as it ends with a victory . " le figaro of paris noted president bush is now a " lame duck . "
" he has wasted his political capital and does n't have many options left .
it is , one might say , an optimal chance for him to radically change his approach .
he must rescue what he can from his grandiose plan to democratize the middle east , which up to now , has only had one concrete result : the trial against saddam hussein . " the dutch newspaper volkskrant said voters punished the republican congress for not intervening to correct the mistaken policies of president bush .
" the election results must be seen as a republican defeat rather than as a win for the democrats .
the voters have punished president bush for his failed iraq politics -lrb- and for his dreadful appearance after hurricane katrina . -rrb- " in the uk , the independent reflected most opinions with its front-page headline : " it 's the war , stupid . " the financial times said bush could salvage the remainder of his presidency by showing humility and cooperating with the democrats .
" americans have at last started to hold to account the republican leadership and the administration of george w. bush for their incompetence and disdain for the law , and for the way they have dragged america 's reputation through the mud and muddle of the middle east .

some germans remain skeptical of democracy , suspicious of jews and believe they are superior to other nations . approximately 5,000 germans were questioned in survey conducted for the respected friedrich ebert foundation , which is run by the social democratic party , partner in chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government . some expressed anti-democratic views .
nine percent of those polled believed that under some circumstances a dictatorship can be a better system to run a state than a democracy .

easterners , he said , were more likely to express xenophobic views while westerners were more anti-semitic . forty-four percent of those in the former communist east said that foreigners came to germany to exploit the generous social welfare system , versus 35.2 percent in the west . meanwhile 15.8 percent of westerners agreed with the statement " jews use dirty tricks more than other people " , against six percent in the east . westerners were also more likely to play down the importance of the nazi era , with nine percent saying they thought the focus on this period was exaggerated versus five percent in the east . about 15 percent said they believed the germans were " by nature " superior to other cultures while one in 10 said they believed that some human beings were unworthy to live . decker said that unemployed germans and pensioners expressed right-wing extremist views most often .
more men held far-right opinions than women . the issue concerns politicians in the german mainstream .

above all , his iraq policies are to blame , commentators said . the leipziger volkszeitung said no one can dismiss iraq as the main reason republicans lost the election .
" a war president has found himself on the defensive , even in his own country : george bush will himself admit that he is the chief reason for the defeat of his republican party in the congressional elections .
the recent corruption and sex scandals meant a loss of moral ground .
but nothing influenced the results as much as the inability of the us government to pacify the situation in iraq . " according to the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung , democrats were able to frame the election as a vote for or against bush 's iraq policy .
yet republicans will still have a chance in the next election , if bush can show some type of victory in iraq and if democrats lean too far left .
in the us , " patriotism remains more important than pacifism and america remains a religious country .
the war in iraq will remain , in retrospect legitimate , as long as it ends with a victory . " le figaro of paris noted president bush is now a " lame duck . "
" he has wasted his political capital and does n't have many options left .
it is , one might say , an optimal chance for him to radically change his approach .
he must rescue what he can from his grandiose plan to democratize the middle east , which up to now , has only had one concrete result : the trial against saddam hussein . " the dutch newspaper volkskrant said voters punished the republican congress for not intervening to correct the mistaken policies of president bush .
" the election results must be seen as a republican defeat rather than as a win for the democrats .
the voters have punished president bush for his failed iraq politics -lrb- and for his dreadful appearance after hurricane katrina . -rrb- " in the uk , the independent reflected most opinions with its front-page headline : " it 's the war , stupid . " the financial times said bush could salvage the remainder of his presidency by showing humility and cooperating with the democrats .
" americans have at last started to hold to account the republican leadership and the administration of george w. bush for their incompetence and disdain for the law , and for the way they have dragged america 's reputation through the mud and muddle of the middle east .

9 on jakobsplatz where a jewish house of worship once stood , prior to being destroyed by the nazis in 1938 . a new jewish center containing a synagogue , museum and kindergarten is set to be opened in munich on nov .
9 in the presence of german leaders , including germany 's president horst köhler and jewish community leader charlotte knobloch . the synagogue will be opened on the 68th anniversary of the so-called " night of broken glass " - the day on which nazi gangs smashed windows or set fire to jewish synagogues , shops and homes and beat jews to death in 1938 . the munich synagogue " ohel jakob " was one of the 1,000 synagogues that were trashed , looted and burned during the " night of broken glass . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch attended the munich synagogue as a child the new synagogue carries the same name as its predecessor .
it could not be rebuilt on its original site - which has in the meantime been transformed into an underground parking lot - but in its proximity . " naturally , i still have memories , because i was there , with my father and my family , as a child , " knobloch said of the original temple .
" it was our synagogue and it was very impressive , especially for a child . " according to knobloch , who also serves as president of the jewish council in germany , the newly built jewish center in downtown munich is the largest jewish construction project in europe .
it cost 71,5 million euros -lrb- $ 91 million -rrb- . jewish renaissance the opening of a new synagogue in munich is seen by many as a sign of jewish revival in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish community in munich is undergoing a significant change according to historian michael brenner , co-editor of " jewish munich - from the middle ages to the present , " the munich jewish community - which is with its 9,300 members the second largest in germany - is going through an important change . " i am a historian and not a prophet , " brenner said .
" i can not say if the community will take advantage of this chance .
but the chance is there and i believe that the creation of a visible center will allow the community to bid farewell to its backyard existence , so to speak , and arrive in the city center . " " there is a chance for the community to become a visible part of the city , which was not the case until now , " brenner said . since 1989 , some 190,000 jews from the former soviet union have come to germany .
with an influx of new immigrants , the jewish community in munich decided that in addition to a new synagogue , it needed a new cultural center as well .
the move to the jakobsplatz in the heart of munich was a fruit of collaboration between knobloch and munich 's mayor christian ude . a homecoming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center and synagogue will be prominent in the city center the jewish center is bound to become an important architectural and cultural landmark in downtown munich .
the five-storey community and cultural center will contain offices , a school and a kindergarten . the large assembly hall , a kosher restaurant and the next-door jewish museum will be open to general public .
the underground passage connecting the two buildings bears the names of the 4,500 munich jews that were murdered by the nazis . charlotte knobloch , who lost relatives during the holocaust , sees the rebuilding of the synagogue as a symbolic homecoming . " after we wrapped everything up - the finances , the premises and the competition - i knew that we had arrived here in munich , that our settling down in the heart of the city had been accepted , " knobloch said . " and then i knew that we must now think of the future .

but personal changes and plain old bad luck have left coach jürgen klopp searching for answers and mainz bottom of the table . " this defeat just feels wretched and dirty , " said klopp immediately after his team lost to 2-1 at home to wolfsburg on tuesday .
the game summed up the likeable western german club 's whole season .
mainz had the majority of possession , but it was their opponents who made more of their opportunities . when mainz were promoted in 2004 , most experts predicted they would go straight back down to the second division .
klopp defied the odds , keeping the underdogs in the first division with an aggressive brand of attacking soccer that was both entertaining and successful . klopp himself , who is as excitable as any fan on the sidelines , is arguably the league 's most popular coach .
but ten winless games on the trot have left mainz in the relegation zone and given klopp more reason to tear at his hair than to pump his fists . " at the moment it 's a very difficult test , " klopp said after the disappointment against wolfsburg .
" but we 'll get through it .
i take heart from the fact that we kept trying for 90 minutes .
the ball just did n't want to go in . " anemic attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ever-passionate jürgen klopp has vowed to fight on that , in a nutshell , is mainz 's problem .
the team has scored only 10 goals this season , exactly half of its tally at this point in the 2004 campaign , mainz 's first in the top flight . this shortcoming is understandable considering that mainz lost all three of its top strikers last year in the off-season .
andreas thurk and benjamin auer signed with frankfurt and bochum respectively , and mohamed zidan , who was on loan from bremen , was recalled to the current league leaders . that trio scored 30 goals for klopp last season - a total their replacements have n't even begun to match .
strikers mimoun azaouagh and imre szabics have only two goals apiece , far too few for a team whose approach to the game is predicated on its forwards . bremen salvation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team management hopes to see mohamed zidan in a mainz uniform again mainz management has made little secret of the fact they 'd like to bring back zidan , who has seen little playing time at bremen .
but thus far , werder has refused to let the striker go . mainz fans can take comfort in the fact that klopp saved the club in a tooth-and-nails relegation battle last season .

but personal changes and plain old bad luck have left coach jürgen klopp searching for answers and mainz bottom of the table . " this defeat just feels wretched and dirty , " said klopp immediately after his team lost to 2-1 at home to wolfsburg on tuesday .
the game summed up the likeable western german club 's whole season .
mainz had the majority of possession , but it was their opponents who made more of their opportunities . when mainz were promoted in 2004 , most experts predicted they would go straight back down to the second division .
klopp defied the odds , keeping the underdogs in the first division with an aggressive brand of attacking soccer that was both entertaining and successful . klopp himself , who is as excitable as any fan on the sidelines , is arguably the league 's most popular coach .
but ten winless games on the trot have left mainz in the relegation zone and given klopp more reason to tear at his hair than to pump his fists . " at the moment it 's a very difficult test , " klopp said after the disappointment against wolfsburg .
" but we 'll get through it .
i take heart from the fact that we kept trying for 90 minutes .
the ball just did n't want to go in . " anemic attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ever-passionate jürgen klopp has vowed to fight on that , in a nutshell , is mainz 's problem .
the team has scored only 10 goals this season , exactly half of its tally at this point in the 2004 campaign , mainz 's first in the top flight . this shortcoming is understandable considering that mainz lost all three of its top strikers last year in the off-season .
andreas thurk and benjamin auer signed with frankfurt and bochum respectively , and mohamed zidan , who was on loan from bremen , was recalled to the current league leaders . that trio scored 30 goals for klopp last season - a total their replacements have n't even begun to match .
strikers mimoun azaouagh and imre szabics have only two goals apiece , far too few for a team whose approach to the game is predicated on its forwards . bremen salvation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team management hopes to see mohamed zidan in a mainz uniform again mainz management has made little secret of the fact they 'd like to bring back zidan , who has seen little playing time at bremen .
but thus far , werder has refused to let the striker go . mainz fans can take comfort in the fact that klopp saved the club in a tooth-and-nails relegation battle last season .
whether he can repeat that feat this time around may depend on decisions made not in mainz , but in bremen . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no changes at the top of the table werder bremen maintain their overall lead with an away win against nuremberg , while stuttgart keep pace by beating hamburg at home .

" japan 's support for iraq will not change , " japanese prime minister shinzo abe told reporters . " the international community has worked to rebuild iraq .
japan will continue to do what we can , " said abe , who took office in september .
his predecessor , junichiro koizumi , had taken the landmark step of deploying japanese troops to iraq . japanese opposition leaders saw the election result as a major slap in the face for bush and warned abe against pursuing what they described as koizumi 's slavish support for the us president . bush has been severely judged " president bush , who was an ally of former prime minister koizumi , has been severely judged by his people , " said mizuho fukushima , head of the social democratic party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi suggests that iraq was a deciding factor italian prime minister romano prodi , who had labeled the iraq war a " grave mistake " following his election earlier this year , said the conflict was chiefly responsible for the heavy losses suffered by bush 's republican party . " there were also a few problems in domestic politics , but these also came from the war in iraq , " prodi was quoted as saying by the ansa news agency . senate loss would lead to negotiations if the republicans lose control of the senate as well as the house of representatives , bush " will certainly be a president who will have to negotiate everything with the opposition , " prodi added . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , one of washington 's staunchest allies , acknowledged that the iraqi issue had a " dominant influence " in the election result , and called on bush and the new congress to work together on key foreign policy issues . " the world needs a determined and energetic united states , " rasmussen said , adding that he hoped " the president and congress , under these new conditions , reach a common line on iraq and afghanistan . " germany magnanimous over midterms in germany , a government spokesman rejected suggestions that the republican defeat would cripple bush 's foreign policy for the remaining two years of the president 's term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt expects closer ties in the future " regardless of the outcome of the elections , the german government will continue to work with the us government and the us president , " spokesman ulrich wilhelm told a press conference .
" we do not see the us government 's capacity to act on foreign policy affected by the outcome of the elections , " he added . but karsten voigt , a key advisor to chancellor angela merkel on transatlantic issues , predicted that washington would now be seen to lean more heavily on europe for help with its foreign policy challenges . " the democrats have criticized president bush for not listening enough to the europeans , to the allies , " voigt said .
" the president has already moved in this direction , especially towards the europeans , but the democrats will demand that he goes further . " eu socialists hail " beginning of the nightmare 's end " the second-largest bloc in the european parliament , the socialist group sent a congratulatory message to the democrats , hailing their victory as " the beginning of the end of a six-year nightmare for the world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz and his socialists welcomed the results " your victory will allow europe and the united states to resume their partnership , " socialist group president martin schulz said in the message . global finance markets wobbled on fears that the democrat success could prompt less market-friendly policies in the world 's biggest economy . european indices eased off fresh five-year highs struck the previous day , while japanese shares tumbled by more than one percent , as investors also feared that a split in power in washington would create legislative gridlock . mixed reactions in iraq in iraq itself , there was mixed public mixed reaction to the election result . qais abu ahmed , a middle-aged sunni employee in the housing ministry , said he preferred the republicans to stay in power because the iraqi army itself was still too weak to ensure security in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us troop withdrawl would provoke mixed feelings " any withdrawal of the american army would be a big disaster .
there would be at the very least a civil war , if not a major massacre the next day , " he said . some iraqis , however , saw in the democrat victory the hope of an early us pullout . " i want the withdrawal of the american army so that we iraqis can sit down together and restore stability , " said ismail khalil , an employee of the shiite-run health ministry . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans revel in us republican defeat the european reaction to democrat wins in midterm us elections was overwhelmingly positive .

" it is not working this way .
something needs to change . " bayern 's dutch striker mark van bommel said : " now we need a good run . " hanover 's coach , dieter hecking , who saw his side achieve only their second season victory , said he was very happy .
" we showed another hanover in the game .
an excellent team effort was rewarded . " his bayern counterpart , felix magath , said his team did too little in the first half .
" we made a major mistake in the first half and that cost us .
in the second half we played better , but could not create the chances we needed .
we struggle against well-structured defences . " winning results for schalke and stuttgart troubled schalke , where infighting has again grabbed most of the recent headlines , put all of that aside with a convincing 2-0 victory at borussia mönchengladbach .

" a war president has found himself on the defensive , even in his own country : george bush will himself admit that he is the chief reason for the defeat of his republican party in the congressional elections .

he was sentenced in 1993 to six years in prison for high treason , but in a landmark decision , the country 's top court ruled that east german spies could not be prosecuted . wolf was briefly jailed for contempt of court because he resisted a judge 's demand to unmask former spies saying he was a victim of " victors ' justice .

" speaking with one voice is what makes europe strong , " merkel said in a speech addressing the german council on foreign relations in berlin on wednesday . the german chancellor said she would like to see more constructive debates and less quarreling during the six-month german eu presidency , starting on jan .
1 , 2007 . this will be a challenge both with inner-european issues such as the question of constitutional reforms , and in the realm of foreign policy . merkel said that turkey would face consequences if ankara failed to open its ports to ships and planes from cyprus as part of a bid to join the european union . " turkey must fulfill its obligations by the end of the year , " merkel said .
" otherwise the eu will draw the appropriate conclusions . " the german leader underlined that a continuation of ankara 's present ban on ships and aircraft from eu member state cyprus was out of the question . the remarks came as the european union on wednesday gave turkey a mid-december deadline to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels , saying this was a key condition for keeping ankara 's eu entry bid on track . kosovo : a sensitive topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence is a current international topic merkel stressed that negotiations about the future status of kosovo will be of central importance for the eu . " what should happen by no means is that we stabilize one part , but for the price of destabilizing other parts , " merkel said . " the relationship to serbia is complex and it can effect macedonia and bosnia and herzegovina .
that is why we need to approach this with utmost sensitivity without bringing the process to a halt , " she said . the serbian parliament officially adopted the country 's new constitution on wednesday reiterating serbia 's claim over kosovo , offering wide autonomy but ruling out possible independence for the province largely populated by ethnic albanians . keeping the gas flowing another important aspect of the eu foreign policy will be the relationship to russia , one of europe 's most important trade partners and energy suppliers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is an important energy supplier for the eu merkel said that a new cooperation and partnership agreement with russia should have its energy chapter " formulated with clear basic rules . " " russia is at the moment not ready to ratify the transit protocol of the energy charter treaty , " merkel said .
" we would like to see that happen . " the energy charter treaty - an international agreement which was signed in 1994 together with a protocol on energy efficiency with the aim of integrating western and eastern european energy markets - would give european companies wider access to russian gas and oil fields and to the russian energy market .
russia , however , remains wary of foreign companies tapping into the country 's energy sources . " many eyes will be directed towards germany as far as wider responsibility in the world is concerned , " merkel said .
" and we will not be able to shun this responsibility .

markus wolf , the shadowy spy master of communist east germany died in his sleep , according to a family member .
he was 83 years old . called " the man without a face " because western intelligence services long lacked even a picture of him , wolf directed one of the world 's most formidable espionage networks for nearly three decades . wolf died on the 17th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , nov .
9 . wolf successfully ran more than 4,000 spies across the iron curtain during his tenure at the foreign intelligence division of the stasi secret police from 1958 to 1987 , embedding countless " moles " deep into the west german government . most famously , he placed günter guillaume as a top aide to west german chancellor willy brandt .
when the agent was unmasked in 1974 , brandt was forced to resign .
wolf was also responsible for recruiting the head of west german counter-espionage , hans-joachim tiedge , as a double agent .
his spies were said to be so effective that east german head of state erich honecker regularly got to read the weekly intelligence digest of west german espionage before the west german chancellor . man without a face bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolf had a shadowy identity and was called " the man without a face " the west did not even have an authenticated picture of wolf until the late 1970s , and the first public photograph of him was published only in 1982 . known by the russian nickname of " misha , " wolf charmed many of those who had sworn bitter hatred of him .
tall , dressed in elegant western-style suits and wire-framed glasses , and good-looking , he was dubbed " the paul newman of spying " by the west german tabloid press . wolf was born in 1923 in hechingen , western germany .
his father friedrich was a well-known jewish communist writer , and his brother konrad became a famous film director . fearing nazi persecution , the family fled to the soviet union in 1934 , where they stayed for the next 11 years .
he had hoped to study aircraft engineering , but in 1945 was sent by the communist party to work in radio in berlin . he worked in east germany 's moscow embassy for two years as first counsellor before returning to build up the espionage service .

" speaking with one voice is what makes europe strong , " merkel said in a speech addressing the german council on foreign relations in berlin on wednesday . the german chancellor said she would like to see more constructive debates and less quarreling during the six-month german eu presidency , starting on jan .
1 , 2007 . this will be a challenge both with inner-european issues such as the question of constitutional reforms , and in the realm of foreign policy . merkel said that turkey would face consequences if ankara failed to open its ports to ships and planes from cyprus as part of a bid to join the european union . " turkey must fulfill its obligations by the end of the year , " merkel said .
" otherwise the eu will draw the appropriate conclusions . " the german leader underlined that a continuation of ankara 's present ban on ships and aircraft from eu member state cyprus was out of the question . the remarks came as the european union on wednesday gave turkey a mid-december deadline to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels , saying this was a key condition for keeping ankara 's eu entry bid on track . kosovo : a sensitive topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence is a current international topic merkel stressed that negotiations about the future status of kosovo will be of central importance for the eu .

" the relationship to serbia is complex and it can effect macedonia and bosnia and herzegovina .
that is why we need to approach this with utmost sensitivity without bringing the process to a halt , " she said . the serbian parliament officially adopted the country 's new constitution on wednesday reiterating serbia 's claim over kosovo , offering wide autonomy but ruling out possible independence for the province largely populated by ethnic albanians . keeping the gas flowing another important aspect of the eu foreign policy will be the relationship to russia , one of europe 's most important trade partners and energy suppliers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is an important energy supplier for the eu merkel said that a new cooperation and partnership agreement with russia should have its energy chapter " formulated with clear basic rules .

markus wolf , the shadowy spy master of communist east germany died in his sleep , according to a family member .
he was 83 years old . called " the man without a face " because western intelligence services long lacked even a picture of him , wolf directed one of the world 's most formidable espionage networks for nearly three decades . wolf died on the 17th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , nov .
9 . wolf successfully ran more than 4,000 spies across the iron curtain during his tenure at the foreign intelligence division of the stasi secret police from 1958 to 1987 , embedding countless " moles " deep into the west german government . most famously , he placed günter guillaume as a top aide to west german chancellor willy brandt .
when the agent was unmasked in 1974 , brandt was forced to resign .
wolf was also responsible for recruiting the head of west german counter-espionage , hans-joachim tiedge , as a double agent .
his spies were said to be so effective that east german head of state erich honecker regularly got to read the weekly intelligence digest of west german espionage before the west german chancellor . man without a face bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolf had a shadowy identity and was called " the man without a face " the west did not even have an authenticated picture of wolf until the late 1970s , and the first public photograph of him was published only in 1982 . known by the russian nickname of " misha , " wolf charmed many of those who had sworn bitter hatred of him .
tall , dressed in elegant western-style suits and wire-framed glasses , and good-looking , he was dubbed " the paul newman of spying " by the west german tabloid press . wolf was born in 1923 in hechingen , western germany .
his father friedrich was a well-known jewish communist writer , and his brother konrad became a famous film director . fearing nazi persecution , the family fled to the soviet union in 1934 , where they stayed for the next 11 years .
he had hoped to study aircraft engineering , but in 1945 was sent by the communist party to work in radio in berlin . he worked in east germany 's moscow embassy for two years as first counsellor before returning to build up the espionage service .
he left his post for " personal reasons " in 1987 . exiled in russia on sept .
30 , 1990 , three days before reunification went into effect he fled to moscow .
a west german arrest warrant had already been out for him for 15 months . in moscow , he wrote books about his family and life as an exile , one of which , " the troika , " was published in the west to critical acclaim . return to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in later years , wolf became a successful author wolf eventually returned of his own free will and was arrested and put on trial in düsseldorf .
he was sentenced in 1993 to six years in prison for high treason , but in a landmark decision , the country 's top court ruled that east german spies could not be prosecuted . wolf was briefly jailed for contempt of court because he resisted a judge 's demand to unmask former spies saying he was a victim of " victors ' justice . " in later years , wolf became a top-selling author , releasing his memoirs called " the man without a face " and a blend of recipes and anecdotes called " secrets of the russian kitchen .

" japan 's support for iraq will not change , " japanese prime minister shinzo abe told reporters . " the international community has worked to rebuild iraq .
japan will continue to do what we can , " said abe , who took office in september .
his predecessor , junichiro koizumi , had taken the landmark step of deploying japanese troops to iraq . japanese opposition leaders saw the election result as a major slap in the face for bush and warned abe against pursuing what they described as koizumi 's slavish support for the us president . bush has been severely judged " president bush , who was an ally of former prime minister koizumi , has been severely judged by his people , " said mizuho fukushima , head of the social democratic party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi suggests that iraq was a deciding factor italian prime minister romano prodi , who had labeled the iraq war a " grave mistake " following his election earlier this year , said the conflict was chiefly responsible for the heavy losses suffered by bush 's republican party . " there were also a few problems in domestic politics , but these also came from the war in iraq , " prodi was quoted as saying by the ansa news agency . senate loss would lead to negotiations if the republicans lose control of the senate as well as the house of representatives , bush " will certainly be a president who will have to negotiate everything with the opposition , " prodi added . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , one of washington 's staunchest allies , acknowledged that the iraqi issue had a " dominant influence " in the election result , and called on bush and the new congress to work together on key foreign policy issues . " the world needs a determined and energetic united states , " rasmussen said , adding that he hoped " the president and congress , under these new conditions , reach a common line on iraq and afghanistan . " germany magnanimous over midterms in germany , a government spokesman rejected suggestions that the republican defeat would cripple bush 's foreign policy for the remaining two years of the president 's term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt expects closer ties in the future " regardless of the outcome of the elections , the german government will continue to work with the us government and the us president , " spokesman ulrich wilhelm told a press conference .
" we do not see the us government 's capacity to act on foreign policy affected by the outcome of the elections , " he added . but karsten voigt , a key advisor to chancellor angela merkel on transatlantic issues , predicted that washington would now be seen to lean more heavily on europe for help with its foreign policy challenges . " the democrats have criticized president bush for not listening enough to the europeans , to the allies , " voigt said .
" the president has already moved in this direction , especially towards the europeans , but the democrats will demand that he goes further . " eu socialists hail " beginning of the nightmare 's end " the second-largest bloc in the european parliament , the socialist group sent a congratulatory message to the democrats , hailing their victory as " the beginning of the end of a six-year nightmare for the world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz and his socialists welcomed the results " your victory will allow europe and the united states to resume their partnership , " socialist group president martin schulz said in the message . global finance markets wobbled on fears that the democrat success could prompt less market-friendly policies in the world 's biggest economy . european indices eased off fresh five-year highs struck the previous day , while japanese shares tumbled by more than one percent , as investors also feared that a split in power in washington would create legislative gridlock . mixed reactions in iraq in iraq itself , there was mixed public mixed reaction to the election result . qais abu ahmed , a middle-aged sunni employee in the housing ministry , said he preferred the republicans to stay in power because the iraqi army itself was still too weak to ensure security in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us troop withdrawl would provoke mixed feelings " any withdrawal of the american army would be a big disaster .
there would be at the very least a civil war , if not a major massacre the next day , " he said . some iraqis , however , saw in the democrat victory the hope of an early us pullout .

earlier , sources had suggested up to one quarter of the government-owned company would be offered for sale . political infighting german chancellor angela merkel affirmed on tuesday plans to privatize the country 's rail system despite political infighting about whether to sell the system 's land and tracks too . " we stand by our intention to list deutsche bahn on the stock exchange , " merkel said , speaking to german business leaders . assets of the group include its international freight operations using both trucks and trains , inter-city express -lrb- ice -rrb- bullet trains serving major german cities and metro rail networks .

" i 'm not a guy who gives up , " mehdorn said . the retention of state rights to the track was a key demand of the christian democrats , whereas the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- opposed any british-style separation of the railtrack and the rolling-stock businesses .
the compromise is expected to satisfy both parties . an expensive investment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german railway network remains a point of political contention efforts aimed at privatizing the federal railway began in 1994 and since then a staggering 213 billion euros -lrb- $ 271 billion dollars -rrb- of state money has flowed into the railways . the results have been sobering with just 12.4 per cent more people using the train to travel in the period from 1994 to 2005 .
the number of people taking the train for longer trips actually fell by 3.5 per cent during this period .
last year the amount of freight carried by the german railway declined by 1 per cent compared with 2004 .

9 in the presence of german leaders , including germany 's president horst köhler and jewish community leader charlotte knobloch . the synagogue will be opened on the 68th anniversary of the so-called " night of broken glass " - the day on which nazi gangs smashed windows or set fire to jewish synagogues , shops and homes and beat jews to death in 1938 . the munich synagogue " ohel jakob " was one of the 1,000 synagogues that were trashed , looted and burned during the " night of broken glass . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch attended the munich synagogue as a child the new synagogue carries the same name as its predecessor .
it could not be rebuilt on its original site - which has in the meantime been transformed into an underground parking lot - but in its proximity . " naturally , i still have memories , because i was there , with my father and my family , as a child , " knobloch said of the original temple .
" it was our synagogue and it was very impressive , especially for a child . " according to knobloch , who also serves as president of the jewish council in germany , the newly built jewish center in downtown munich is the largest jewish construction project in europe .
it cost 71,5 million euros -lrb- $ 91 million -rrb- . jewish renaissance the opening of a new synagogue in munich is seen by many as a sign of jewish revival in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish community in munich is undergoing a significant change according to historian michael brenner , co-editor of " jewish munich - from the middle ages to the present , " the munich jewish community - which is with its 9,300 members the second largest in germany - is going through an important change . " i am a historian and not a prophet , " brenner said .
" i can not say if the community will take advantage of this chance .
but the chance is there and i believe that the creation of a visible center will allow the community to bid farewell to its backyard existence , so to speak , and arrive in the city center . " " there is a chance for the community to become a visible part of the city , which was not the case until now , " brenner said . since 1989 , some 190,000 jews from the former soviet union have come to germany .
with an influx of new immigrants , the jewish community in munich decided that in addition to a new synagogue , it needed a new cultural center as well .

the five-storey community and cultural center will contain offices , a school and a kindergarten . the large assembly hall , a kosher restaurant and the next-door jewish museum will be open to general public .
the underground passage connecting the two buildings bears the names of the 4,500 munich jews that were murdered by the nazis . charlotte knobloch , who lost relatives during the holocaust , sees the rebuilding of the synagogue as a symbolic homecoming . " after we wrapped everything up - the finances , the premises and the competition - i knew that we had arrived here in munich , that our settling down in the heart of the city had been accepted , " knobloch said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 09.11.2006 ten-game winless streak leaves mainz reeling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 6-1 drubbing by bremen has been just one of mainz 's low points tiny mainz won legions of fans as they avoided relegation the past two seasons .
but personal changes and plain old bad luck have left coach jürgen klopp searching for answers and mainz bottom of the table . " this defeat just feels wretched and dirty , " said klopp immediately after his team lost to 2-1 at home to wolfsburg on tuesday .
the game summed up the likeable western german club 's whole season .
mainz had the majority of possession , but it was their opponents who made more of their opportunities . when mainz were promoted in 2004 , most experts predicted they would go straight back down to the second division .
klopp defied the odds , keeping the underdogs in the first division with an aggressive brand of attacking soccer that was both entertaining and successful . klopp himself , who is as excitable as any fan on the sidelines , is arguably the league 's most popular coach .
but ten winless games on the trot have left mainz in the relegation zone and given klopp more reason to tear at his hair than to pump his fists . " at the moment it 's a very difficult test , " klopp said after the disappointment against wolfsburg .
" but we 'll get through it .
i take heart from the fact that we kept trying for 90 minutes .
the ball just did n't want to go in . " anemic attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ever-passionate jürgen klopp has vowed to fight on that , in a nutshell , is mainz 's problem .
the team has scored only 10 goals this season , exactly half of its tally at this point in the 2004 campaign , mainz 's first in the top flight . this shortcoming is understandable considering that mainz lost all three of its top strikers last year in the off-season .
andreas thurk and benjamin auer signed with frankfurt and bochum respectively , and mohamed zidan , who was on loan from bremen , was recalled to the current league leaders . that trio scored 30 goals for klopp last season - a total their replacements have n't even begun to match .
strikers mimoun azaouagh and imre szabics have only two goals apiece , far too few for a team whose approach to the game is predicated on its forwards . bremen salvation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team management hopes to see mohamed zidan in a mainz uniform again mainz management has made little secret of the fact they 'd like to bring back zidan , who has seen little playing time at bremen .

some germans remain skeptical of democracy , suspicious of jews and believe they are superior to other nations . approximately 5,000 germans were questioned in survey conducted for the respected friedrich ebert foundation , which is run by the social democratic party , partner in chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government . some expressed anti-democratic views .
nine percent of those polled believed that under some circumstances a dictatorship can be a better system to run a state than a democracy .
an iron-fisted leader who would " govern germany for the benefit of all " would be supported by 15 percent of the respondents .
one in four - 26 percent - said they favored a single party in germany " that would embody the national community as a whole . " regional differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a minority of germans hold far-right political views sociologist oliver decker of the university of leipzig , who conducted the study for the usuma opinion research institute , said he noticed key regional differences .
easterners , he said , were more likely to express xenophobic views while westerners were more anti-semitic . forty-four percent of those in the former communist east said that foreigners came to germany to exploit the generous social welfare system , versus 35.2 percent in the west . meanwhile 15.8 percent of westerners agreed with the statement " jews use dirty tricks more than other people " , against six percent in the east . westerners were also more likely to play down the importance of the nazi era , with nine percent saying they thought the focus on this period was exaggerated versus five percent in the east . about 15 percent said they believed the germans were " by nature " superior to other cultures while one in 10 said they believed that some human beings were unworthy to live . decker said that unemployed germans and pensioners expressed right-wing extremist views most often .
more men held far-right opinions than women . the issue concerns politicians in the german mainstream .
far-right parties have made major inroads in the economically depressed east and are represented in three state legislatures , although none have seats in the national parliament . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german jewish leader says right-wing violence recalls 1930s the president of the central council of jews in germany has said that the country was seeing a groundswell of right-wing violence which reminded her of the nazi era .

" japan 's support for iraq will not change , " japanese prime minister shinzo abe told reporters . " the international community has worked to rebuild iraq .
japan will continue to do what we can , " said abe , who took office in september .
his predecessor , junichiro koizumi , had taken the landmark step of deploying japanese troops to iraq . japanese opposition leaders saw the election result as a major slap in the face for bush and warned abe against pursuing what they described as koizumi 's slavish support for the us president . bush has been severely judged " president bush , who was an ally of former prime minister koizumi , has been severely judged by his people , " said mizuho fukushima , head of the social democratic party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi suggests that iraq was a deciding factor italian prime minister romano prodi , who had labeled the iraq war a " grave mistake " following his election earlier this year , said the conflict was chiefly responsible for the heavy losses suffered by bush 's republican party . " there were also a few problems in domestic politics , but these also came from the war in iraq , " prodi was quoted as saying by the ansa news agency . senate loss would lead to negotiations if the republicans lose control of the senate as well as the house of representatives , bush " will certainly be a president who will have to negotiate everything with the opposition , " prodi added . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , one of washington 's staunchest allies , acknowledged that the iraqi issue had a " dominant influence " in the election result , and called on bush and the new congress to work together on key foreign policy issues . " the world needs a determined and energetic united states , " rasmussen said , adding that he hoped " the president and congress , under these new conditions , reach a common line on iraq and afghanistan .

" the democrats have criticized president bush for not listening enough to the europeans , to the allies , " voigt said .
" the president has already moved in this direction , especially towards the europeans , but the democrats will demand that he goes further . " eu socialists hail " beginning of the nightmare 's end " the second-largest bloc in the european parliament , the socialist group sent a congratulatory message to the democrats , hailing their victory as " the beginning of the end of a six-year nightmare for the world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz and his socialists welcomed the results " your victory will allow europe and the united states to resume their partnership , " socialist group president martin schulz said in the message . global finance markets wobbled on fears that the democrat success could prompt less market-friendly policies in the world 's biggest economy . european indices eased off fresh five-year highs struck the previous day , while japanese shares tumbled by more than one percent , as investors also feared that a split in power in washington would create legislative gridlock . mixed reactions in iraq in iraq itself , there was mixed public mixed reaction to the election result . qais abu ahmed , a middle-aged sunni employee in the housing ministry , said he preferred the republicans to stay in power because the iraqi army itself was still too weak to ensure security in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us troop withdrawl would provoke mixed feelings " any withdrawal of the american army would be a big disaster .
there would be at the very least a civil war , if not a major massacre the next day , " he said . some iraqis , however , saw in the democrat victory the hope of an early us pullout .

" japan 's support for iraq will not change , " japanese prime minister shinzo abe told reporters . " the international community has worked to rebuild iraq .
japan will continue to do what we can , " said abe , who took office in september .
his predecessor , junichiro koizumi , had taken the landmark step of deploying japanese troops to iraq . japanese opposition leaders saw the election result as a major slap in the face for bush and warned abe against pursuing what they described as koizumi 's slavish support for the us president . bush has been severely judged " president bush , who was an ally of former prime minister koizumi , has been severely judged by his people , " said mizuho fukushima , head of the social democratic party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi suggests that iraq was a deciding factor italian prime minister romano prodi , who had labeled the iraq war a " grave mistake " following his election earlier this year , said the conflict was chiefly responsible for the heavy losses suffered by bush 's republican party . " there were also a few problems in domestic politics , but these also came from the war in iraq , " prodi was quoted as saying by the ansa news agency . senate loss would lead to negotiations if the republicans lose control of the senate as well as the house of representatives , bush " will certainly be a president who will have to negotiate everything with the opposition , " prodi added . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , one of washington 's staunchest allies , acknowledged that the iraqi issue had a " dominant influence " in the election result , and called on bush and the new congress to work together on key foreign policy issues . " the world needs a determined and energetic united states , " rasmussen said , adding that he hoped " the president and congress , under these new conditions , reach a common line on iraq and afghanistan . " germany magnanimous over midterms in germany , a government spokesman rejected suggestions that the republican defeat would cripple bush 's foreign policy for the remaining two years of the president 's term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt expects closer ties in the future " regardless of the outcome of the elections , the german government will continue to work with the us government and the us president , " spokesman ulrich wilhelm told a press conference .
" we do not see the us government 's capacity to act on foreign policy affected by the outcome of the elections , " he added . but karsten voigt , a key advisor to chancellor angela merkel on transatlantic issues , predicted that washington would now be seen to lean more heavily on europe for help with its foreign policy challenges . " the democrats have criticized president bush for not listening enough to the europeans , to the allies , " voigt said .
" the president has already moved in this direction , especially towards the europeans , but the democrats will demand that he goes further . " eu socialists hail " beginning of the nightmare 's end " the second-largest bloc in the european parliament , the socialist group sent a congratulatory message to the democrats , hailing their victory as " the beginning of the end of a six-year nightmare for the world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz and his socialists welcomed the results " your victory will allow europe and the united states to resume their partnership , " socialist group president martin schulz said in the message . global finance markets wobbled on fears that the democrat success could prompt less market-friendly policies in the world 's biggest economy . european indices eased off fresh five-year highs struck the previous day , while japanese shares tumbled by more than one percent , as investors also feared that a split in power in washington would create legislative gridlock . mixed reactions in iraq in iraq itself , there was mixed public mixed reaction to the election result . qais abu ahmed , a middle-aged sunni employee in the housing ministry , said he preferred the republicans to stay in power because the iraqi army itself was still too weak to ensure security in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us troop withdrawl would provoke mixed feelings " any withdrawal of the american army would be a big disaster .
there would be at the very least a civil war , if not a major massacre the next day , " he said . some iraqis , however , saw in the democrat victory the hope of an early us pullout . " i want the withdrawal of the american army so that we iraqis can sit down together and restore stability , " said ismail khalil , an employee of the shiite-run health ministry . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans revel in us republican defeat the european reaction to democrat wins in midterm us elections was overwhelmingly positive .

but personal changes and plain old bad luck have left coach jürgen klopp searching for answers and mainz bottom of the table . " this defeat just feels wretched and dirty , " said klopp immediately after his team lost to 2-1 at home to wolfsburg on tuesday .
the game summed up the likeable western german club 's whole season .
mainz had the majority of possession , but it was their opponents who made more of their opportunities . when mainz were promoted in 2004 , most experts predicted they would go straight back down to the second division .
klopp defied the odds , keeping the underdogs in the first division with an aggressive brand of attacking soccer that was both entertaining and successful . klopp himself , who is as excitable as any fan on the sidelines , is arguably the league 's most popular coach .
but ten winless games on the trot have left mainz in the relegation zone and given klopp more reason to tear at his hair than to pump his fists . " at the moment it 's a very difficult test , " klopp said after the disappointment against wolfsburg .

the team has scored only 10 goals this season , exactly half of its tally at this point in the 2004 campaign , mainz 's first in the top flight . this shortcoming is understandable considering that mainz lost all three of its top strikers last year in the off-season .
andreas thurk and benjamin auer signed with frankfurt and bochum respectively , and mohamed zidan , who was on loan from bremen , was recalled to the current league leaders . that trio scored 30 goals for klopp last season - a total their replacements have n't even begun to match .

but thus far , werder has refused to let the striker go . mainz fans can take comfort in the fact that klopp saved the club in a tooth-and-nails relegation battle last season .

andreas thurk and benjamin auer signed with frankfurt and bochum respectively , and mohamed zidan , who was on loan from bremen , was recalled to the current league leaders . that trio scored 30 goals for klopp last season - a total their replacements have n't even begun to match .

9 in the presence of german leaders , including germany 's president horst köhler and jewish community leader charlotte knobloch . the synagogue will be opened on the 68th anniversary of the so-called " night of broken glass " - the day on which nazi gangs smashed windows or set fire to jewish synagogues , shops and homes and beat jews to death in 1938 . the munich synagogue " ohel jakob " was one of the 1,000 synagogues that were trashed , looted and burned during the " night of broken glass . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch attended the munich synagogue as a child the new synagogue carries the same name as its predecessor .
it could not be rebuilt on its original site - which has in the meantime been transformed into an underground parking lot - but in its proximity . " naturally , i still have memories , because i was there , with my father and my family , as a child , " knobloch said of the original temple .
" it was our synagogue and it was very impressive , especially for a child . " according to knobloch , who also serves as president of the jewish council in germany , the newly built jewish center in downtown munich is the largest jewish construction project in europe .
it cost 71,5 million euros -lrb- $ 91 million -rrb- . jewish renaissance the opening of a new synagogue in munich is seen by many as a sign of jewish revival in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish community in munich is undergoing a significant change according to historian michael brenner , co-editor of " jewish munich - from the middle ages to the present , " the munich jewish community - which is with its 9,300 members the second largest in germany - is going through an important change . " i am a historian and not a prophet , " brenner said .
" i can not say if the community will take advantage of this chance .
but the chance is there and i believe that the creation of a visible center will allow the community to bid farewell to its backyard existence , so to speak , and arrive in the city center . " " there is a chance for the community to become a visible part of the city , which was not the case until now , " brenner said . since 1989 , some 190,000 jews from the former soviet union have come to germany .
with an influx of new immigrants , the jewish community in munich decided that in addition to a new synagogue , it needed a new cultural center as well .
the move to the jakobsplatz in the heart of munich was a fruit of collaboration between knobloch and munich 's mayor christian ude . a homecoming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center and synagogue will be prominent in the city center the jewish center is bound to become an important architectural and cultural landmark in downtown munich .
the five-storey community and cultural center will contain offices , a school and a kindergarten . the large assembly hall , a kosher restaurant and the next-door jewish museum will be open to general public .
the underground passage connecting the two buildings bears the names of the 4,500 munich jews that were murdered by the nazis . charlotte knobloch , who lost relatives during the holocaust , sees the rebuilding of the synagogue as a symbolic homecoming . " after we wrapped everything up - the finances , the premises and the competition - i knew that we had arrived here in munich , that our settling down in the heart of the city had been accepted , " knobloch said .

markus wolf , the shadowy spy master of communist east germany died in his sleep , according to a family member .
he was 83 years old . called " the man without a face " because western intelligence services long lacked even a picture of him , wolf directed one of the world 's most formidable espionage networks for nearly three decades . wolf died on the 17th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , nov .
9 . wolf successfully ran more than 4,000 spies across the iron curtain during his tenure at the foreign intelligence division of the stasi secret police from 1958 to 1987 , embedding countless " moles " deep into the west german government . most famously , he placed günter guillaume as a top aide to west german chancellor willy brandt .
when the agent was unmasked in 1974 , brandt was forced to resign .

markus wolf , the shadowy spy master of communist east germany died in his sleep , according to a family member .
he was 83 years old . called " the man without a face " because western intelligence services long lacked even a picture of him , wolf directed one of the world 's most formidable espionage networks for nearly three decades . wolf died on the 17th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , nov .
9 . wolf successfully ran more than 4,000 spies across the iron curtain during his tenure at the foreign intelligence division of the stasi secret police from 1958 to 1987 , embedding countless " moles " deep into the west german government . most famously , he placed günter guillaume as a top aide to west german chancellor willy brandt .
when the agent was unmasked in 1974 , brandt was forced to resign .
wolf was also responsible for recruiting the head of west german counter-espionage , hans-joachim tiedge , as a double agent .
his spies were said to be so effective that east german head of state erich honecker regularly got to read the weekly intelligence digest of west german espionage before the west german chancellor . man without a face bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolf had a shadowy identity and was called " the man without a face " the west did not even have an authenticated picture of wolf until the late 1970s , and the first public photograph of him was published only in 1982 . known by the russian nickname of " misha , " wolf charmed many of those who had sworn bitter hatred of him .

above all , his iraq policies are to blame , commentators said . the leipziger volkszeitung said no one can dismiss iraq as the main reason republicans lost the election .
" a war president has found himself on the defensive , even in his own country : george bush will himself admit that he is the chief reason for the defeat of his republican party in the congressional elections .
the recent corruption and sex scandals meant a loss of moral ground .
but nothing influenced the results as much as the inability of the us government to pacify the situation in iraq . " according to the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung , democrats were able to frame the election as a vote for or against bush 's iraq policy .
yet republicans will still have a chance in the next election , if bush can show some type of victory in iraq and if democrats lean too far left .
in the us , " patriotism remains more important than pacifism and america remains a religious country .
the war in iraq will remain , in retrospect legitimate , as long as it ends with a victory . " le figaro of paris noted president bush is now a " lame duck . "
" he has wasted his political capital and does n't have many options left .
it is , one might say , an optimal chance for him to radically change his approach .
he must rescue what he can from his grandiose plan to democratize the middle east , which up to now , has only had one concrete result : the trial against saddam hussein . " the dutch newspaper volkskrant said voters punished the republican congress for not intervening to correct the mistaken policies of president bush .
" the election results must be seen as a republican defeat rather than as a win for the democrats .

the democrats won control of the house of representatives in the polls , and us media reports say they will also take the senate .
there is some anxiety in the indian media about the fate of a key nuclear deal- still to be ratified by congress .
the pakistani media say there will be no immediate impact of the polls on the " war on terror " in the region .
newspapers were mixed in their reaction to the impact of the elections on pakistan - most said it was " too early to predict " while others hoped for a " softening of the war against terror . "
democrats will be slightly colder in their attitude towards pakistan the nation " as for president pervez musharraf , he should probably still feel secure enough in his government 's alliance with the americans since george bush is not going anywhere anytime soon , " said the news newspaper in an editorial .
" however a democratic-dominated congress may bring considerable pressure to bear on washington - something that the indian lobbies in the us capital will be sure to exploit - in its relationship with various countries and it is quite possible that matters such as the peace agreement in parts of the tribal areas reached between the local tribes and the pakistan government may come under closer scrutiny . "
the nation said that , since the american voters did not factor in the situation in afghanistan while casting their ballots , " the impact on pakistan wo n't be immediate " .
the us wants pakistan on its side in the ' war on terror ' however , without elaborating the newspaper warned that that the " democrats will be slightly colder in their attitude towards pakistan " .
the dawn said it would be in " america 's own interest if -lsb- mr bush 's -rsb- militancy is tempered with moderation " .
" what this holds for pakistan only time will tell . "
' massive support ' indian newspapers hoped that the country 's traditionally warm ties with the democrats will help push through the landmark civilian nuclear deal between the two countries .
the deal , which is still to be ratified by the us congress , gives india access to us nuclear technology .
it reverses us policy , which restricted nuclear co-operation after india tested a nuclear weapon in 1974 .
" the massive vote in support of the deal in the house of representatives earlier this year indicates that there is a non partisan support for the measure , " said hindustan times in an editorial .
the indian express said india had already learnt that " very little can be achieved in the us congress without bipartisan support " .
the poll results , of course , have brought in an element of uncertainty as the democrats may demand more concessions from india , which may not be acceptable to new delhi the tribune " the return of washington to the norm of a divided government , then , is unlikely to make a fundamental difference to the future of the nuclear deal , which will pass the us congress only when all the forces are aboard . "
the tribune echoed a similar sentiment , saying that the " weakened position " of mr bush " may have its impact on the deal , but the situation will become clear only after the coming lame-duck congress session " .
" the poll results , of course , have brought in an element of uncertainty as the democrats may demand more concessions from india , which may not be acceptable to new delhi , " the paper said .
the times of india said it was " unlikely that when the us congress convenes for a lame duck session after the polls it will take up the nuclear issue " .
" this will , of course , delay the nuclear accord .. but there is no reason to believe that the deal is dead .. there is bipartisan support for the agreement .. new delhi will just have to be patient and keep lobbying in capital hill for an early passage of the bill on nuclear deal " .
the newspaper said the upswing in the ties between the two countries will not be affected as both the republicans and democrats are " committed to better ties with delhi " .
the pioneer was more circumspect , saying that " this is hardly the moment -lsb- for india -rsb- to speculate on the future of the civil nuclear cooperation bill simply because it is nowhere on the democrat 's radar screen " .

the democrats won control of the house of representatives in the polls , and us media reports say they will also take the senate .
there is some anxiety in the indian media about the fate of a key nuclear deal- still to be ratified by congress .
the pakistani media say there will be no immediate impact of the polls on the " war on terror " in the region .
newspapers were mixed in their reaction to the impact of the elections on pakistan - most said it was " too early to predict " while others hoped for a " softening of the war against terror . "
democrats will be slightly colder in their attitude towards pakistan the nation " as for president pervez musharraf , he should probably still feel secure enough in his government 's alliance with the americans since george bush is not going anywhere anytime soon , " said the news newspaper in an editorial .
" however a democratic-dominated congress may bring considerable pressure to bear on washington - something that the indian lobbies in the us capital will be sure to exploit - in its relationship with various countries and it is quite possible that matters such as the peace agreement in parts of the tribal areas reached between the local tribes and the pakistan government may come under closer scrutiny . "
the nation said that , since the american voters did not factor in the situation in afghanistan while casting their ballots , " the impact on pakistan wo n't be immediate " .
the us wants pakistan on its side in the ' war on terror ' however , without elaborating the newspaper warned that that the " democrats will be slightly colder in their attitude towards pakistan " .
the dawn said it would be in " america 's own interest if -lsb- mr bush 's -rsb- militancy is tempered with moderation " .
" what this holds for pakistan only time will tell . "
' massive support ' indian newspapers hoped that the country 's traditionally warm ties with the democrats will help push through the landmark civilian nuclear deal between the two countries .
the deal , which is still to be ratified by the us congress , gives india access to us nuclear technology .
it reverses us policy , which restricted nuclear co-operation after india tested a nuclear weapon in 1974 .
" the massive vote in support of the deal in the house of representatives earlier this year indicates that there is a non partisan support for the measure , " said hindustan times in an editorial .
the indian express said india had already learnt that " very little can be achieved in the us congress without bipartisan support " .

jim bates has served as a witness in dozens of cases related to scotland yard 's inquiry into internet child pornography , operation ore .
but doubts have been cast over his competence after it emerged he had misled a court about his qualifications . "
if -lsb- jim bates -rsb- was appearing as a defence witness it may be appropriate to challenge his credibility " cps statement shy keenan , of phoenix survivors , which offers support to child abuse victims , said mr bates should not be allowed to work as an expert witness while he is under investigation .
" surely his involvement in such matters should be suspended at least until after the very serious questions regarding his alleged qualifications and expert status have been officially dealt with . "
" this matter could potentially lead to a review of all involved cases or indeed further proceedings . "
high-profile mr bates told bbc news he accepts he erred in claiming he had a bachelor of science in electronic engineering in court documents .
he is under investigation by the child exploitation and online protection -lrb- ceop -rrb- centre , which is affiliated to soca -lrb- serious organised crime agency -rrb- .
but he accused ceop of harassment and leaking information to the media in an attempt to " discredit " him after highlighting what he claims were serious flaws with several operation ore investigations .
mr bates is president of the institution of analysts and programmers -lrb- iap -rrb- and has been involved in high-profile cases as an expert witness both for the prosecution and defence . "
i have evidence to prove operation ore was based on a completely false series of premises " jim bates he was used as an expert witness for the metropolitan police against gurpal virdi , the sikh officer wrongly accused of sending racist hate mail to himself and colleagues .
however , mr virdi was exonerated and reinstated with a formal apology in 2000 after an employment tribunal ruled he had been the victim of racism .
mr bates has previously served as an advisor to scotland yard 's computer crime unit and lectured at the police training school at bramshill .
false statement in court papers dated september 1998 seen by bbc news , mr bates states : " i hold a bachelor of science degree in electronic engineering " .
in 2004 , it emerged that he held no such qualification and had never been to university .
the crown prosecution service -lrb- cps -rrb- has since advised its prosecutors to " challenge his credibility " in cases where mr bates appears as a defence witness .
" prosecutors would have to disclose to the defence that allegations have been made against mr bates if we were using him as a prosecution expert , " said a cps statement .
" if he was appearing as a defence witness it may be appropriate to challenge his credibility . "
mr bates said he now mainly works as an expert witness for defence teams , including cases involving child pornography on the internet , but that the credibility allegations were hindering him .
" one of the effects of being targeted like this means that as an expert witness , counsel will understandably be reluctant to employ me directly because of such issues regarding my integrity , " he said .
he said he has been gathering evidence to prove certain officers involved in operation ore had been careless with their investigations with a view to clearing his name .
" i have evidence to prove operation ore was based on a completely false series of premises and police officers should have been aware of this if they had done their job properly , " he said .

decades of conflict and sanctions had wrecked the infrastructure of roads , power stations , schools and hospitals .
when us president george w bush announced the war had ended , he promised the us would help to rebuild iraq , saying : " now that the dictator 's gone we and our coalition partners are helping iraqis to lay the foundations of a free economy . "
" the cpa handed over $ 8.8bn in cash to the iraqi government even though that new government had no security or accounting system .
no one can account for it " henry waxman democratic congressman since then , huge sums have gone towards reconstruction .
the us has spent $ 36bn of its own money .
more controversially it has also spent $ 22bn of iraqi cash .
these iraqi funds were controlled by the americans during the year-long occupation that followed the war .
they consisted mainly of iraqi oil revenues and leftover cash from the oil-for-food programme - the pre-war sanctions regime run by the united nations .
the money was in the development fund for iraq , set up by the un as the war ended .
' a huge scandal ' in hearings on capitol hill in washington , democratic congressman henry waxman has emerged as the most vocal critic of the us ' record on reconstruction .
in particular , mr waxman says proper accounting procedures were ignored when large sums of iraqi cash were handed over by the coalition provisional authority -lrb- cpa -rrb- - the us-led body that ran iraq immediately after the war - to get iraqi ministries functioning again .
" i think we 're looking at a huge scandal .
the cpa handed over $ 8.8bn in cash to the iraqi government even though that new government had no security or accounting system .
" no one can account for it .
we do n't know who got that money , " mr waxman said .
stuart bowen is the special inspector general for iraq reconstruction .
his task is to follow the paper trail - and after more than 100 investigations his work paints a grim picture of waste and mismanagement .
mr bowen said billions of dollars were shrink-wrapped in plastic and flown out of the us to baghdad .
" it was $ 2bn a flight , and i know of at least six flights , " he said .
mr bowen said some of the cash went to pay the salaries of thousands of " ghost employees " , or iraqi civil servants who did not actually exist .
' spending to save lives ' as the planes landed with their hefty bundles of greenbacks , they became the responsibility of a man named david oliver .
mr oliver was in baghdad in the summer of 2003 as the cpa 's first head of finance .
he helped establish the financial framework , but resisted pressure to bring in outside auditors . "
billions of dollars of their -lsb- iraqi -rsb- money disappeared , yes i understand , i 'm saying what difference does it make ?
i chose to give that money to the iraqis , they got the power working within eight days in the major hospitals in baghdad " david oliver cpa head of finance as head of finance at the time surely he must know what happened to the $ 8.8bn ?
" i have no idea , i ca n't tell you whether or not the money went to the right things or did n't - nor do i actually think it is important , " he said .
yes , but the fact is that billions of dollars have disappeared without trace .
" of their money .
billions of dollars of their money disappeared , yes i understand , i 'm saying what difference does it make ? "
that may seem an astonishingly complacent statement .
but it made no difference to mr oliver because he felt there were more pressing priorities .
" there were 1,600 british-trained auditors in iraq , so why lay another infrastructure that was american and designed for a completely different culture and different set of circumstances ? "
he said premature babies in intensive care units were dying during power outages because hospitals had no back-up power supplies .
" i chose to give that money to the iraqis , they got the power working within eight days in the major hospitals in baghdad , " he said .
by following us procurement and audit procedures it would have taken 30 or 40 days before the problem was even looked at , he said .
in his view it was more important to save lives to get things done than worry about accounting procedures .
' on america 's watch ' andy bearpark was in charge of infrastructure and development at the cpa .
it was his job to supervise reconstruction , but he says never in his career had he come across such a lack of preparation .
" the plan had to be created at the same time as it was being implemented .
everything to do with the cpa was being invented from scratch , from a zero base , " he said .
in this atmosphere of improvisation and chaos , it is perhaps not surprising that accounting procedures took a back seat .
not long after arriving in baghdad , mr bearpark recalls being handed a huge dossier on the long-term rebuilding of iraq .
it had been drawn up by the us construction company , bechtel .
" the figures they came up with was about $ 20bn .
but these things were being done amazingly quickly .
the time pressure was something i 'd never , ever experienced before , " he said .
" i remember being given that bechtel assessment ... and having something like three hours to say : ' is this a good idea or a bad idea ? " '
but while most of the corruption allegations centre on the iraqi money , the financial chaos also extended to projects financed by us taxpayers .
one early contract - to halliburton - aroused great controversy because it appeared to bypass normal rules .
it was awarded without any process of bidding for it .
so what have we got ?
allegations of impropriety in the awarding of contracts in the us , chaos at the occupation authority that ran post-war iraq and large sums of iraqi oil money disappearing apparently without any record of how it was spent .

decades of conflict and sanctions had wrecked the infrastructure of roads , power stations , schools and hospitals .
when us president george w bush announced the war had ended , he promised the us would help to rebuild iraq , saying : " now that the dictator 's gone we and our coalition partners are helping iraqis to lay the foundations of a free economy . "
the cpa handed over $ 8.8bn in cash to the iraqi government even though that new government had no security or accounting system .
no one can account for it henry waxman democratic congressman since then , huge sums have gone towards reconstruction .
the us has spent $ 36bn of its own money .
more controversially it has also spent $ 22bn of iraqi cash .
these iraqi funds were controlled by the americans during the year-long occupation that followed the war .
they consisted mainly of iraqi oil revenues and leftover cash from the oil-for-food programme - the pre-war sanctions regime run by the united nations .
the money was in the development fund for iraq , set up by the un as the war ended .
' a huge scandal ' in hearings on capitol hill in washington , democratic congressman henry waxman has emerged as the most vocal critic of the us ' record on reconstruction .
in particular , mr waxman says proper accounting procedures were ignored when large sums of iraqi cash were handed over by the coalition provisional authority -lrb- cpa -rrb- - the us-led body that ran iraq immediately after the war - to get iraqi ministries functioning again .
" i think we 're looking at a huge scandal .
the cpa handed over $ 8.8bn in cash to the iraqi government even though that new government had no security or accounting system .
" no one can account for it .
we do n't know who got that money , " mr waxman said .
stuart bowen is the special inspector general for iraq reconstruction .
his task is to follow the paper trail - and after more than 100 investigations his work paints a grim picture of waste and mismanagement .
mr bowen said billions of dollars were shrink-wrapped in plastic and flown out of the us to baghdad .
" it was $ 2bn a flight , and i know of at least six flights , " he said .
mr bowen said some of the cash went to pay the salaries of thousands of " ghost employees " , or iraqi civil servants who did not actually exist .
' spending to save lives ' as the planes landed with their hefty bundles of greenbacks , they became the responsibility of a man named david oliver .
mr oliver was in baghdad in the summer of 2003 as the cpa 's first head of finance .
he helped establish the financial framework , but resisted pressure to bring in outside auditors .

billions of dollars of their money disappeared , yes i understand , i 'm saying what difference does it make ? "
that may seem an astonishingly complacent statement .
but it made no difference to mr oliver because he felt there were more pressing priorities .
" there were 1,600 british-trained auditors in iraq , so why lay another infrastructure that was american and designed for a completely different culture and different set of circumstances ? "
he said premature babies in intensive care units were dying during power outages because hospitals had no back-up power supplies .
" i chose to give that money to the iraqis , they got the power working within eight days in the major hospitals in baghdad , " he said .
by following us procurement and audit procedures it would have taken 30 or 40 days before the problem was even looked at , he said .
in his view it was more important to save lives to get things done than worry about accounting procedures .
' on america 's watch ' andy bearpark was in charge of infrastructure and development at the cpa .
it was his job to supervise reconstruction , but he says never in his career had he come across such a lack of preparation .
" the plan had to be created at the same time as it was being implemented .
everything to do with the cpa was being invented from scratch , from a zero base , " he said .
in this atmosphere of improvisation and chaos , it is perhaps not surprising that accounting procedures took a back seat .
not long after arriving in baghdad , mr bearpark recalls being handed a huge dossier on the long-term rebuilding of iraq .
it had been drawn up by the us construction company , bechtel .
" the figures they came up with was about $ 20bn .

the time pressure was something i 'd never , ever experienced before , " he said .
" i remember being given that bechtel assessment ... and having something like three hours to say : ' is this a good idea or a bad idea ? " '
but while most of the corruption allegations centre on the iraqi money , the financial chaos also extended to projects financed by us taxpayers .

decades of conflict and sanctions had wrecked the infrastructure of roads , power stations , schools and hospitals .
when us president george w bush announced the war had ended , he promised the us would help to rebuild iraq , saying : " now that the dictator 's gone we and our coalition partners are helping iraqis to lay the foundations of a free economy . "
the cpa handed over $ 8.8bn in cash to the iraqi government even though that new government had no security or accounting system .
no one can account for it henry waxman democratic congressman since then , huge sums have gone towards reconstruction .
the us has spent $ 36bn of its own money .
more controversially it has also spent $ 22bn of iraqi cash .
these iraqi funds were controlled by the americans during the year-long occupation that followed the war .
they consisted mainly of iraqi oil revenues and leftover cash from the oil-for-food programme - the pre-war sanctions regime run by the united nations .
the money was in the development fund for iraq , set up by the un as the war ended .
' a huge scandal ' in hearings on capitol hill in washington , democratic congressman henry waxman has emerged as the most vocal critic of the us ' record on reconstruction .
in particular , mr waxman says proper accounting procedures were ignored when large sums of iraqi cash were handed over by the coalition provisional authority -lrb- cpa -rrb- - the us-led body that ran iraq immediately after the war - to get iraqi ministries functioning again .
" i think we 're looking at a huge scandal .
the cpa handed over $ 8.8bn in cash to the iraqi government even though that new government had no security or accounting system .
" no one can account for it .
we do n't know who got that money , " mr waxman said .
stuart bowen is the special inspector general for iraq reconstruction .
his task is to follow the paper trail - and after more than 100 investigations his work paints a grim picture of waste and mismanagement .
mr bowen said billions of dollars were shrink-wrapped in plastic and flown out of the us to baghdad .
" it was $ 2bn a flight , and i know of at least six flights , " he said .
mr bowen said some of the cash went to pay the salaries of thousands of " ghost employees " , or iraqi civil servants who did not actually exist .
' spending to save lives ' as the planes landed with their hefty bundles of greenbacks , they became the responsibility of a man named david oliver .
mr oliver was in baghdad in the summer of 2003 as the cpa 's first head of finance .
he helped establish the financial framework , but resisted pressure to bring in outside auditors .
billions of dollars of their -lsb- iraqi -rsb- money disappeared , yes i understand , i 'm saying what difference does it make ?
i chose to give that money to the iraqis , they got the power working within eight days in the major hospitals in baghdad david oliver cpa head of finance as head of finance at the time surely he must know what happened to the $ 8.8bn ?
" i have no idea , i ca n't tell you whether or not the money went to the right things or did n't - nor do i actually think it is important , " he said .
yes , but the fact is that billions of dollars have disappeared without trace .
" of their money .
billions of dollars of their money disappeared , yes i understand , i 'm saying what difference does it make ? "
that may seem an astonishingly complacent statement .
but it made no difference to mr oliver because he felt there were more pressing priorities .
" there were 1,600 british-trained auditors in iraq , so why lay another infrastructure that was american and designed for a completely different culture and different set of circumstances ? "
he said premature babies in intensive care units were dying during power outages because hospitals had no back-up power supplies .
" i chose to give that money to the iraqis , they got the power working within eight days in the major hospitals in baghdad , " he said .
by following us procurement and audit procedures it would have taken 30 or 40 days before the problem was even looked at , he said .
in his view it was more important to save lives to get things done than worry about accounting procedures .
' on america 's watch ' andy bearpark was in charge of infrastructure and development at the cpa .
it was his job to supervise reconstruction , but he says never in his career had he come across such a lack of preparation .
" the plan had to be created at the same time as it was being implemented .
everything to do with the cpa was being invented from scratch , from a zero base , " he said .
in this atmosphere of improvisation and chaos , it is perhaps not surprising that accounting procedures took a back seat .
not long after arriving in baghdad , mr bearpark recalls being handed a huge dossier on the long-term rebuilding of iraq .
it had been drawn up by the us construction company , bechtel .
" the figures they came up with was about $ 20bn .
but these things were being done amazingly quickly .
the time pressure was something i 'd never , ever experienced before , " he said .
" i remember being given that bechtel assessment ... and having something like three hours to say : ' is this a good idea or a bad idea ? " '
but while most of the corruption allegations centre on the iraqi money , the financial chaos also extended to projects financed by us taxpayers .
one early contract - to halliburton - aroused great controversy because it appeared to bypass normal rules .
it was awarded without any process of bidding for it .
so what have we got ?
allegations of impropriety in the awarding of contracts in the us , chaos at the occupation authority that ran post-war iraq and large sums of iraqi oil money disappearing apparently without any record of how it was spent .
and all this on america 's watch .
mark gregory 's documentary series the baghdad billions - an investigation into how money allocated to reconstruction in iraq has been spent - can be heard on the world service at 0900 gmt on 9 and 10 november .

the 81-year-old is reported to be in a stable condition and will remain in hospital in kuala lumpur for the next few days .
dr mahathir was malaysia 's longest serving prime minister , having spent 22 years in office before his retirement in 2003 .
he still wields considerable influence on domestic politics and business .
more recently , he has been in a political scrap with his chosen successor , prime minister abdullah badawi , whom he accuses of corruption , nepotism and mismanaging the economy .
controversial figure dr mahathir was admitted to the national heart institute in the early hours of thursday , hospital officials said .
" he had a mild heart attack late last night , early this morning , " dr mahathir 's son mokhzani mahathir told reuters news agency .
" he is under observation , the condition is stable .
the doctors gave some medication .
he is likely to remain in hospital for a few days . "
the heart attack happened shortly after dr mahathir returned from a trip to new zealand .
" he had been a travelling a lot ...
he had quite a hectic schedule and he ate too much , " mokhzani mahathir said .
dr mahathir , a former medical doctor , underwent heart bypass surgery in 1989 and has been receiving regular check-ups since then .
although a controversial figure abroad for his barbed comments about the west and scant regard for human rights , at home dr mahathir is considered the father of modern malaysia .
during his time in office , he helped transform malaysia from a mainly rural economy into an asian economic tiger .
despite promising not to interfere when he retired three years ago , dr mahathir has launched a series of stinging attacks on his hand-picked successor in recent months .
analysts say he has been angered by changes introduced by abdullah badawi that appear to be partially dismantling his legacy .

the 81-year-old is reported to be in a stable condition and will remain in hospital in kuala lumpur for the next few days .
dr mahathir was malaysia 's longest serving prime minister , having spent 22 years in office before his retirement in 2003 .
he still wields considerable influence on domestic politics and business .
more recently , he has been in a political scrap with his chosen successor , prime minister abdullah badawi , whom he accuses of corruption , nepotism and mismanaging the economy .
controversial figure dr mahathir was admitted to the national heart institute in the early hours of thursday , hospital officials said .
" he had a mild heart attack late last night , early this morning , " dr mahathir 's son mokhzani mahathir told reuters news agency .
" he is under observation , the condition is stable .
the doctors gave some medication .
he is likely to remain in hospital for a few days . "
the heart attack happened shortly after dr mahathir returned from a trip to new zealand .
" he had been a travelling a lot ...
he had quite a hectic schedule and he ate too much , " mokhzani mahathir said .
dr mahathir , a former medical doctor , underwent heart bypass surgery in 1989 and has been receiving regular check-ups since then .
although a controversial figure abroad for his barbed comments about the west and scant regard for human rights , at home dr mahathir is considered the father of modern malaysia .
during his time in office , he helped transform malaysia from a mainly rural economy into an asian economic tiger .
despite promising not to interfere when he retired three years ago , dr mahathir has launched a series of stinging attacks on his hand-picked successor in recent months .
analysts say he has been angered by changes introduced by abdullah badawi that appear to be partially dismantling his legacy .

by rebecca morelle health reporter , bbc news stem cells can transform into any other cell getting stem cells into the clinic is seen as the holy grail of medicine .
injections of these cells , which have the special ability to transform into any other type of cell , have been paraded as the panacea for diseases , from parkinson 's to diabetes .
and recent advances , such as clinical trials where heart attack patients are to be injected with stem cells or research showing their possible ability to restore the sight of blind mice , suggest this hope could be becoming a reality .
but is this really the case ?
stem cell ' cowboys ' we are at the stage where some stem cell research is moving from animal models towards the clinic , says professor anne mclaren , a developmental biologist from cambridge university .
but while there has been much progress , there has also been a lot of hype , she adds .
" and i believe stem cell research really must n't be overhyped - it will be a good while even before the somatic -lrb- adult or foetal -rrb- stem cells are applied in the clinic , and a decade or more before embryonic stem cells are . "
skin has been a success story for stem cells some attempts to edge stem cells closer towards the clinic are faring better than others .
in fact , stem cells have been used for years in bone marrow transplants for leukaemia , and using stem cells to grow skin to graft onto burns patients has also been a great success .
presently , research looking at stem cells to repair eyes , cartilage and even the spinal cord is also looking promising .
but , according to professor richard gardner , a stem cell expert based at oxford university , people are " emphasising the promise " and " failing to highlight the problems that are yet to be overcome " .
" and in the meantime , " he says , " there is the real concern about the stem cell cowboys . "
" you 've got these people charging thousands of pounds to inject dubious cells into people suffering from diseases such as multiple sclerosis , and people who are chasing couples about to give birth and charging them thousands of pounds to store their baby 's umbilical cord cells . "
this is unethical , he says , because there are some fundamental problems regarding how these stem cells , whether they are adult , foetal or embryonic , will behave once they are in the body .
too much , too soon dr huseyin mehmet , from the us-based merck research laboratories , agrees .
i would be loathe to start sticking stem cells willy-nilly into patients huseyin mehmet " i do not doubt that stem cell transplantation will be a therapy of the future , but i think we ought to be focusing much more on basic mechanisms of stem cell differentiation - how stem cells make the decision to move from their stem cell state into a more committed phenotype .
" and i do n't think we know anything near enough about how we can control what our stem cells do in the test tube , the animal and the patient .
" i think we are so far away from knowing that , that i would be loathe to start sticking stem cells willy-nilly into patients . "
but while stem cell transplant advances may be further off than hoped , the field is racing ahead in other , perhaps more " blue skies " , areas of research .
dr steven pollard is a researcher at the wellcome trust centre for stem cell research , based at cambridge university , and works on brain stem cells .
he says : " with brain stem cells , it would be very unrealistic to build up patients ' hopes that these could be used as a repair mechanism in transplants , but what they will do is become a very useful tool to understand the basic biology of disease . "
unlimited access by creating stem cells from an animal or human with a particular disease , such as motor neurone disease , scientists can watch what is going on in the cells as they change into other cell types , tracking any peculiarities in the process , seeing what happens as they develop and grow .
and understanding the mechanism of a disease can be key to providing insights into possible treatments , or even cures .
dr pollard also predicts stem cells will prove very useful for drug screening .
stem cells may aid cancer research " to have unlimited access to human neural material offers the opportunity to screen drugs to look at how we can affect cell behaviour , test toxicity and these sorts of things . "
he adds that knowledge about the basic biology of stem cells is going to be important in cancer research .
" i think this will be one of the more likely success stories .
" for a lot of tumours , like brain tumours or breast cancers , it seems to be the case that there is a sub-population of cells within the tumour that you could call cancer stem cells .
so understanding those and targeting those is a pretty major area . "
' unrealistic expectations ' so slowly but surely , stem cell research is progressing , and scientists agree it is indeed an exciting and promising area .
but it seems , initially , that the biggest advances may be in understanding how these special cells work , working out how they can be controlled and harnessed , and using them to explore our basic biology before they will find a permanent home in the clinic .
professor gardner says : " i 'm very mindful of what happened 30 years ago when everyone in the field was promoting gene therapy - this area has limped along and there has really been no major pay off yet .
" i think already with the stem cell field there is a real concern about engendering unrealistic expectations among those who stand to benefit .
" it is important to highlight what may be possible , but at the same time highlight some of the formidable technical problems that one has to grapple . "

by rebecca morelle health reporter , bbc news stem cells can transform into any other cell getting stem cells into the clinic is seen as the holy grail of medicine .
injections of these cells , which have the special ability to transform into any other type of cell , have been paraded as the panacea for diseases , from parkinson 's to diabetes .
and recent advances , such as clinical trials where heart attack patients are to be injected with stem cells or research showing their possible ability to restore the sight of blind mice , suggest this hope could be becoming a reality .
but is this really the case ?
stem cell ' cowboys ' we are at the stage where some stem cell research is moving from animal models towards the clinic , says professor anne mclaren , a developmental biologist from cambridge university .
but while there has been much progress , there has also been a lot of hype , she adds .
" and i believe stem cell research really must n't be overhyped - it will be a good while even before the somatic -lrb- adult or foetal -rrb- stem cells are applied in the clinic , and a decade or more before embryonic stem cells are . "
skin has been a success story for stem cells some attempts to edge stem cells closer towards the clinic are faring better than others .
in fact , stem cells have been used for years in bone marrow transplants for leukaemia , and using stem cells to grow skin to graft onto burns patients has also been a great success .
presently , research looking at stem cells to repair eyes , cartilage and even the spinal cord is also looking promising .
but , according to professor richard gardner , a stem cell expert based at oxford university , people are " emphasising the promise " and " failing to highlight the problems that are yet to be overcome " .
" and in the meantime , " he says , " there is the real concern about the stem cell cowboys . "
" you 've got these people charging thousands of pounds to inject dubious cells into people suffering from diseases such as multiple sclerosis , and people who are chasing couples about to give birth and charging them thousands of pounds to store their baby 's umbilical cord cells . "
this is unethical , he says , because there are some fundamental problems regarding how these stem cells , whether they are adult , foetal or embryonic , will behave once they are in the body .
too much , too soon dr huseyin mehmet , from the us-based merck research laboratories , agrees .
i would be loathe to start sticking stem cells willy-nilly into patients huseyin mehmet " i do not doubt that stem cell transplantation will be a therapy of the future , but i think we ought to be focusing much more on basic mechanisms of stem cell differentiation - how stem cells make the decision to move from their stem cell state into a more committed phenotype .
" and i do n't think we know anything near enough about how we can control what our stem cells do in the test tube , the animal and the patient .
" i think we are so far away from knowing that , that i would be loathe to start sticking stem cells willy-nilly into patients . "
but while stem cell transplant advances may be further off than hoped , the field is racing ahead in other , perhaps more " blue skies " , areas of research .
dr steven pollard is a researcher at the wellcome trust centre for stem cell research , based at cambridge university , and works on brain stem cells .
he says : " with brain stem cells , it would be very unrealistic to build up patients ' hopes that these could be used as a repair mechanism in transplants , but what they will do is become a very useful tool to understand the basic biology of disease . "
unlimited access by creating stem cells from an animal or human with a particular disease , such as motor neurone disease , scientists can watch what is going on in the cells as they change into other cell types , tracking any peculiarities in the process , seeing what happens as they develop and grow .
and understanding the mechanism of a disease can be key to providing insights into possible treatments , or even cures .
dr pollard also predicts stem cells will prove very useful for drug screening .
stem cells may aid cancer research " to have unlimited access to human neural material offers the opportunity to screen drugs to look at how we can affect cell behaviour , test toxicity and these sorts of things . "
he adds that knowledge about the basic biology of stem cells is going to be important in cancer research .
" i think this will be one of the more likely success stories .
" for a lot of tumours , like brain tumours or breast cancers , it seems to be the case that there is a sub-population of cells within the tumour that you could call cancer stem cells .
so understanding those and targeting those is a pretty major area . "
' unrealistic expectations ' so slowly but surely , stem cell research is progressing , and scientists agree it is indeed an exciting and promising area .
but it seems , initially , that the biggest advances may be in understanding how these special cells work , working out how they can be controlled and harnessed , and using them to explore our basic biology before they will find a permanent home in the clinic .
professor gardner says : " i 'm very mindful of what happened 30 years ago when everyone in the field was promoting gene therapy - this area has limped along and there has really been no major pay off yet .
" i think already with the stem cell field there is a real concern about engendering unrealistic expectations among those who stand to benefit .
" it is important to highlight what may be possible , but at the same time highlight some of the formidable technical problems that one has to grapple . "

nearly £ 120,000 is to be spent improving the playing surface of every pitch in the city .
a further £ 70,000 to be spent on a temporary pavilion to replace changing facilities branded the worst in the capital .
the move follows public pressure to improve facilities .
about 10,000 people are to march in protest in january .
this proposal is all about improving the quality of equipment in edinburgh and allowing young people to play sport on a higher standard of pitch than they do now donald anderson edinburgh council campaigners have welcomed the investment .
donald anderson , edinburgh 's culture and leisure leader , said white line marking would be introduced at every pitch , unlike some which currently have their lines burned into the ground , and pitches would be levelled and spiked to improve drainage .
grass cutting will also be carried out on a 10 day cycle , as opposed to the current system which can see some sites go for weeks or months without having their grass properly cut .
the rotting pavilion at double hedges playing fields in liberton will be shut down and be replaced by temporary changing blocks while money is found to fund a full refurbishment of the dilapidated building .
councillor anderson said the double hedges site was " by far the worst in the city " .
he said : " this is n't a permanent solution to the problem at double hedges .
" rather , it will provide far better changing rooms and showers for players while we try to find the money to rebuild the pavilion , which is in a dreadful state .
" we are already putting money into improving other pitches and facilities across the city , but i realise that there is a long way to go before they are up to a suitably high standard . "
pathetic facilities he added : " this proposal is all about improving the quality of equipment in edinburgh and allowing young people to play sport on a higher standard of pitch than they do now .
" maintaining this standard will cost about £ 168,000 per year , and we are currently trying to identify additional funding for this in 2007-08 . "
hutchison vale football club youth coach , les trotter , said : " there are countless examples across the city where clubs are having to train and play matches with either no or run down facilities .
" i 've seen rat infested pavilions with human excrement in them , it 's an absolute disgrace .
" the pavilion at double hedges was a disgrace and i 'm happy that at least something has been done to condemn the pathetic facilities there . "

the closest planet to our star appeared as a tiny black dot creeping over the solar face between 1912 gmt on wednesday to 0010 gmt on thursday .
some observatories held special viewing parties for the public .
the entire transit was visible from the western us , south-east australia , new zealand , canada and the south pacific .
parts of the transit were visible before sunset on wednesday in the rest of the americas , and after sunrise on thursday in east asia and the rest of australia .
this time , skygazers in europe , africa , the middle east and asia west of burma missed out .
the previous mercury transit was in 2003 ; the next will be on 9 may 2016 .
mercury races around the sun in only 88 days , but it is rarely in direct alignment between us and the sun because its orbit is tilted with respect to the earth 's .
transits occur roughly 13 times every century .
mercury 's disc appears only 1/194 the size of the sun 's mercury is so tiny that transits could not be seen before the invention of the telescope .
the first person to witness one was the french astronomer pierre gassendi , in 1631 .
his discovery sparked the realisation that transits could be used to establish a way of measuring distances in the solar system .
the method is that of simple geometry - observing an object from two points that are a known distance apart , which provides the base line for a triangle .
filtering out in los angeles , about 30 enthusiasts set up telescopes on the lawn of the recently restored griffith observatory , one of several around the world to host viewing parties .

the 1.2-tonne , $ 430m spacecraft carries seven scientific instruments that will gather information on the composition and structure of mercury 's crust , its geological history , its polar regions , atmosphere and magnetic environment , as well as the make-up of its core .

some observatories held special viewing parties for the public .
the entire transit was visible from the western us , south-east australia , new zealand , canada and the south pacific .
parts of the transit were visible before sunset on wednesday in the rest of the americas , and after sunrise on thursday in east asia and the rest of australia .
this time , skygazers in europe , africa , the middle east and asia west of burma missed out .
click here to see a global viewing map the previous mercury transit was in 2003 ; the next will be on 9 may 2016 .
mercury races around the sun in only 88 days , but it is rarely in direct alignment between us and the sun because its orbit is tilted with respect to the earth 's .
transits occur roughly 13 times every century .
mercury 's disc appears only 1/194 the size of the sun 's mercury is so tiny that transits could not be seen before the invention of the telescope .
the first person to witness one was the french astronomer pierre gassendi , in 1631 .
his discovery sparked the realisation that transits could be used to establish a way of measuring distances in the solar system .
the method is that of simple geometry - observing an object from two points that are a known distance apart , which provides the base line for a triangle .
filtering out in los angeles , about 30 enthusiasts set up telescopes on the lawn of the recently restored griffith observatory , one of several around the world to host viewing parties .
others followed the transit on the web , with a number of astronomical institutions and agencies streaming video .
the planet mercury closest planet to the sun diameter : 4,800km mercurian year : 88 days equator surface temp : 450c partially mapped by mariner has global magnetic field composition is iron-rich may be ice in polar craters for many astronomers , both amateur and professional , it was simply an event to wonder at .
but researchers at the university of hawaii 's institute for astronomy used the opportunity to measure the amount of sodium in mercury 's tenuous atmosphere , measure its altitude , and determine how it varies from mercury 's pole to its equator .
several spacecraft also looked on , including japan 's hinode probe -lrb- the recently launched and renamed solar-b spacecraft -rrb- , the nasa / esa solar and heliospheric observatory -lrb- soho -rrb- , and the nasa transition region and coronal explorer -lrb- trace -rrb- .
spacecraft have visited mercury only once - the us mariner 10 mission in 1974-75 .
but this is all about to change .
the us mercury messenger probe is due to arrive at the planet in 2009 .
the 1.2-tonne , $ 430m spacecraft carries seven scientific instruments that will gather information on the composition and structure of mercury 's crust , its geological history , its polar regions , atmosphere and magnetic environment , as well as the make-up of its core .
messenger will be followed by europe 's bepicolombo mission .
it is expected to rendezvous with the first planet in about 2015-16 .
the entire transit was visible from the western us , south-east australia , new zealand , canada and the south pacific some regions saw just some of the transit - before sunset on wednesday in the rest of the americas , and after sunrise on thursday in east asia and the rest of australia the transit was not visible from europe , africa , the middle east or asia west of burma .

the research by akamai revealed users ' dwindling patience with websites that take time to show up .
it found 75 % of the 1,058 people asked would not return to websites that took longer than four seconds to load .
the time it took a site to appear on screen came second to high prices and shipping costs in the list of shoppers ' pet-hates , the research revealed .
akamai consulted those who shop regularly online to find out what they like and dislike about e-tailing sites .
about half of mature net-shoppers - who have been buying online for more than two years or who spend more than $ 1,500 -lrb- £ 788 -rrb- a year online - ranked page-loading time as a priority .
it found that one-third of those questioned abandon sites that take time to load , are hard to navigate or take too long to handle the checkout process .
the four-second threshold is half the time previous research , conducted during the early days of the web-shopping boom , suggested that shoppers would wait for a site to finish loading .
to make matters worse , the research found that the experience shoppers have on a retail site colours their entire view of the company behind it .
about 30 % of those responding said they formed a " negative perception " of a company with a badly put-together site or would tell their family and friends about their experiences .
further research by akamai found that almost half of the online stores in the list of the top 500 us shopping sites take longer than the four-second threshold to finish loading .
the survey questioned 1,058 net shoppers during the first six months of 2006 .
consultants jupiter research did the survey for akamai .
