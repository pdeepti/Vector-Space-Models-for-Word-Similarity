still , the issue is highly sensitive . germany 's ministers of defense and interior affairs said the country would be prepared to contribute to an international peacekeeping force in lebanon once the united nations ' security council specifies a mandate for the operation this week . german chancellor angela merkel edged around the question in the past , saying it was too early to decide on germany 's possible roles in a peacekeeping force .
the question of sending german troops to the israel-lebanon border has divided germany . government spokesman thomas steg told reporters there would be more clarity over what role germany would likely fulfill by the end of the week .
he added that the cabinet would discuss the matter next week , and that any final decision would be made in september when parliament reconvenes following the summer break . steg said that germany 's future role in lebanon would also be limited by its means . " we can only provide what we can afford , " steg said . ceasefire paves way for mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli soldiers ride in a truck after returning from southern lebanon in northern israel monday , aug .
14 discussion of german participation in a mission to lebanon became possible again on monday due to the un-mandated ceasefire that went into effect in the month-long conflict between israel and hezbollah . interior minister wolfgang schäuble said germany must fulfill its international obligations if asked to contribute soldiers to a peacekeeping force . " we do not want to refuse - we can not refuse , " schäuble told zdf television . defense minister franz josef jung said germany " could not refuse if everyone asks us to make a contribution . " support not unanimous however , political support for sending german soldiers is not unanimous . the powerful bavarian sister party of merkel 's christian democrats is opposed , saying the issue is too sensitive because of germany 's past . bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the leader of the free market liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , is also strongly against german participation . " if there is one area of the world where german soldiers have no place , it is the israeli border , " westerwelle told the saarbrücker zeitung .
" our history forbids it . " israeli prime minister ehud olmert has given strong backing to the idea of including german troops , but for many jews in germany , the idea of sending german soldiers to the middle east 60 years after the murder of 6 million jews raises moral questions . germany 's central council of jews has said the thought that the grandchildren of perpetrators of the holocaust might find themselves shooting at the grandchildren of the nazis ' victims was impossible to contemplate . italy and france are leading the scramble to beef up the small un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- which will be key to making the tenuous cessation of hostilities .five nations - indonesia , malaysia , morocco , spain and turkey - have already agreed to contribute troops to the international force , the lebanese government said on sunday . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates sending soldiers to middle east as a ceasefire to the fighting in lebanon begins to look more likely , the debate over whether germany should take part in international peacekeeping there has divided the country 's politicians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.08.2006 growth in germany tops five-year high in second quarter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extra summer sunshine boosted economic growth in outdoor sectors warm weather , the world cup , vat increases in 2007 and swelling corporate profits are a few reasons why germany 's economy reached a record high last quarter .
but experts are n't sure how long the boom can last . the german economy , the biggest in the 12-country euro zone , is growing at its fastest rate since the dot.com boom five years ago , data showed on monday .
the growth can be attributed in part to increased construction spending and booming company profits . germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter of this year compared with the first quarter , federal statistics office destatis said in a statement . that represented an acceleration from the 0.7 percent growth rate in the preceding three months and was the fastest rate of growth since the first quarter of 2001 . data from the eu 's eurostat data agency showed monday that german expansion had helped the euro zone economy to hit its fastest rate of growth in six years in the second quarter . domestic growth stimuli bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup in germany brought in fans - and a few extra euros this time , growth in germany was not solely export-driven , as it had been in previous economic upturns in the country . " growth impulses are coming primarily from inside germany , " destatis said .
" while the momentum of foreign trade has weakened , it was primarily investment in construction and equipment that contributed to the economic pick-up in the second quarter . " over 12 months , growth measured one percent in the second quarter because of differences in the number of working days .
when adjusted for working days , growth was at 2.4 percent . the unseasonably warm weather helped boost activity in outdoor sectors such as the construction industry and companies are investing their record-high profits in new plants and equipment . world cup and upcoming vat increase the world cup soccer championships , held in germany in june and july , also provided a boost to consumer spending , a sector had previously held back the development of a broad-based recovery in germany . furthermore , households are bringing forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the planned rise in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent , which will take effect in january . the ministry of economy in berlin hailed the second-quarter gdp data as proof that the economic gridlock of recent years had finally been lifted . " the recovery has gained in breadth and strength , " said economy minister michael glos .
" the situation on the labor market has improved noticeably .
the outlook for this year is decidedly positive . " the dihk federation of german chambers of commerce agreed . " our forecast for full-year growth of up to two percent is within reach , " dihk president martin wansleben added . growth across the euro zone other euro zone countries , such as france and the netherlands , have similarly beaten growth expectations for the second quarter , suggesting that the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- may have to revise its own growth forecasts for the entire euro area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : value-added tax will jump from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 the euro zone expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter , separate data published by the eu 's statistics office eurostat showed on monday .
the expansion of the euro zone economy added to the arguments for further interest rate hikes by the ecb . the ecb 's benchmark refinancing rate currently stands at 3 percent and is expected to rise to 3.5 percent by the end of this year in order to keep a lid on inflation in the 12 countries that share the euro . " the german gdp data are almost too good to be true , " said bank of america economist holger schmieding .
" in less than two years , germany seems to have turned from the sick man of europe into one of the old continent 's ' wunderkinder . " ' some say euro zone growth to start losing steam however , some analysts were skeptical about whether the german economy would be able to maintain the same momentum during the coming months given the planned rise in vat , which experts believe will put the brakes on consumer demand next year . " the weather-driven rebound in second-quarter construction will not be repeated in the third quarter , " said schmieding at bank of america .
" retail sales may recede after the world cup effect in may and june " and the vat increase will be also provide a temporary hit to activity . the european commission in brussels also predicted that euro zone growth would probably start losing steam soon , with analysts pointing the finger at the stronger euro , slowing global growth , high oil prices , higher interest rates and tighter fiscal policy . in germany , dihk similarly warned that german growth may soon pass its zenith , not least because of the vat hike and the one-off nature of the world cup effect . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european central bank raises rates on inflation fears the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- raised the key euro-zone interest rate by a quarter point to 3.0 percent on thursday , making borrowing costs the highest in three-and-a-half years in order to curb inflation .

" of almost 200 high-ranking members of the bdv … in the years prior to 1982 , more than a third can be found in the members ' index of the nsdap or are in another way tainted , " der spiegel wrote .
" three former general secretaries and several vice-presidents are affected . " the very first president of the bdv , hans krüger , was forced to resign from his post in 1964 due to his nazi past . in an interview with the magazine , the current head of the bdv , erika steinbach , said that simply counting the number of members who were associated in some way with the nazis did not say much . " you have to differentiate whether someone just went along with the nazis or whether they really carried out a role that would be insupportable for an organization , " she said . when the magazine said making this distinction would be the point of an internal investigation , steinbach added while it would surely be " interesting , " such an investigation would " cost money that we do n't have . " " if i had the feeling that there was a bomb waiting to go off underneath the surface , then i would have taken action long ago , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.08.2006 growth in germany tops five-year high in second quarter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extra summer sunshine boosted economic growth in outdoor sectors warm weather , the world cup , vat increases in 2007 and swelling corporate profits are a few reasons why germany 's economy reached a record high last quarter .
but experts are n't sure how long the boom can last . the german economy , the biggest in the 12-country euro zone , is growing at its fastest rate since the dot.com boom five years ago , data showed on monday .
the growth can be attributed in part to increased construction spending and booming company profits . germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter of this year compared with the first quarter , federal statistics office destatis said in a statement . that represented an acceleration from the 0.7 percent growth rate in the preceding three months and was the fastest rate of growth since the first quarter of 2001 . data from the eu 's eurostat data agency showed monday that german expansion had helped the euro zone economy to hit its fastest rate of growth in six years in the second quarter . domestic growth stimuli bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup in germany brought in fans - and a few extra euros this time , growth in germany was not solely export-driven , as it had been in previous economic upturns in the country . " growth impulses are coming primarily from inside germany , " destatis said .
" while the momentum of foreign trade has weakened , it was primarily investment in construction and equipment that contributed to the economic pick-up in the second quarter . " over 12 months , growth measured one percent in the second quarter because of differences in the number of working days .
when adjusted for working days , growth was at 2.4 percent . the unseasonably warm weather helped boost activity in outdoor sectors such as the construction industry and companies are investing their record-high profits in new plants and equipment . world cup and upcoming vat increase the world cup soccer championships , held in germany in june and july , also provided a boost to consumer spending , a sector had previously held back the development of a broad-based recovery in germany . furthermore , households are bringing forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the planned rise in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent , which will take effect in january . the ministry of economy in berlin hailed the second-quarter gdp data as proof that the economic gridlock of recent years had finally been lifted . " the recovery has gained in breadth and strength , " said economy minister michael glos .
" the situation on the labor market has improved noticeably .
the outlook for this year is decidedly positive . " the dihk federation of german chambers of commerce agreed . " our forecast for full-year growth of up to two percent is within reach , " dihk president martin wansleben added . growth across the euro zone other euro zone countries , such as france and the netherlands , have similarly beaten growth expectations for the second quarter , suggesting that the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- may have to revise its own growth forecasts for the entire euro area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : value-added tax will jump from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 the euro zone expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter , separate data published by the eu 's statistics office eurostat showed on monday .
the expansion of the euro zone economy added to the arguments for further interest rate hikes by the ecb . the ecb 's benchmark refinancing rate currently stands at 3 percent and is expected to rise to 3.5 percent by the end of this year in order to keep a lid on inflation in the 12 countries that share the euro . " the german gdp data are almost too good to be true , " said bank of america economist holger schmieding .
" in less than two years , germany seems to have turned from the sick man of europe into one of the old continent 's ' wunderkinder . " ' some say euro zone growth to start losing steam however , some analysts were skeptical about whether the german economy would be able to maintain the same momentum during the coming months given the planned rise in vat , which experts believe will put the brakes on consumer demand next year . " the weather-driven rebound in second-quarter construction will not be repeated in the third quarter , " said schmieding at bank of america .
" retail sales may recede after the world cup effect in may and june " and the vat increase will be also provide a temporary hit to activity . the european commission in brussels also predicted that euro zone growth would probably start losing steam soon , with analysts pointing the finger at the stronger euro , slowing global growth , high oil prices , higher interest rates and tighter fiscal policy . in germany , dihk similarly warned that german growth may soon pass its zenith , not least because of the vat hike and the one-off nature of the world cup effect . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european central bank raises rates on inflation fears the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- raised the key euro-zone interest rate by a quarter point to 3.0 percent on thursday , making borrowing costs the highest in three-and-a-half years in order to curb inflation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.08.2006 growth in germany tops five-year high in second quarter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extra summer sunshine boosted economic growth in outdoor sectors warm weather , the world cup , vat increases in 2007 and swelling corporate profits are a few reasons why germany 's economy reached a record high last quarter .
but experts are n't sure how long the boom can last . the german economy , the biggest in the 12-country euro zone , is growing at its fastest rate since the dot.com boom five years ago , data showed on monday .
the growth can be attributed in part to increased construction spending and booming company profits . germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter of this year compared with the first quarter , federal statistics office destatis said in a statement . that represented an acceleration from the 0.7 percent growth rate in the preceding three months and was the fastest rate of growth since the first quarter of 2001 . data from the eu 's eurostat data agency showed monday that german expansion had helped the euro zone economy to hit its fastest rate of growth in six years in the second quarter . domestic growth stimuli bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup in germany brought in fans - and a few extra euros this time , growth in germany was not solely export-driven , as it had been in previous economic upturns in the country . " growth impulses are coming primarily from inside germany , " destatis said .
" while the momentum of foreign trade has weakened , it was primarily investment in construction and equipment that contributed to the economic pick-up in the second quarter . " over 12 months , growth measured one percent in the second quarter because of differences in the number of working days .
when adjusted for working days , growth was at 2.4 percent . the unseasonably warm weather helped boost activity in outdoor sectors such as the construction industry and companies are investing their record-high profits in new plants and equipment . world cup and upcoming vat increase the world cup soccer championships , held in germany in june and july , also provided a boost to consumer spending , a sector had previously held back the development of a broad-based recovery in germany . furthermore , households are bringing forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the planned rise in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent , which will take effect in january . the ministry of economy in berlin hailed the second-quarter gdp data as proof that the economic gridlock of recent years had finally been lifted . " the recovery has gained in breadth and strength , " said economy minister michael glos .
" the situation on the labor market has improved noticeably .
the outlook for this year is decidedly positive . " the dihk federation of german chambers of commerce agreed . " our forecast for full-year growth of up to two percent is within reach , " dihk president martin wansleben added . growth across the euro zone other euro zone countries , such as france and the netherlands , have similarly beaten growth expectations for the second quarter , suggesting that the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- may have to revise its own growth forecasts for the entire euro area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : value-added tax will jump from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 the euro zone expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter , separate data published by the eu 's statistics office eurostat showed on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.08.2006 ministers : germany prepared to take part in lebanon mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a displaced lebanese family returns home after the ceasefire if germany were asked to participate in an international peacekeeping mission in lebanon , it could not refuse , two top level german ministers said on monday .
still , the issue is highly sensitive . germany 's ministers of defense and interior affairs said the country would be prepared to contribute to an international peacekeeping force in lebanon once the united nations ' security council specifies a mandate for the operation this week . german chancellor angela merkel edged around the question in the past , saying it was too early to decide on germany 's possible roles in a peacekeeping force .
the question of sending german troops to the israel-lebanon border has divided germany . government spokesman thomas steg told reporters there would be more clarity over what role germany would likely fulfill by the end of the week .
he added that the cabinet would discuss the matter next week , and that any final decision would be made in september when parliament reconvenes following the summer break . steg said that germany 's future role in lebanon would also be limited by its means . " we can only provide what we can afford , " steg said . ceasefire paves way for mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli soldiers ride in a truck after returning from southern lebanon in northern israel monday , aug .
14 discussion of german participation in a mission to lebanon became possible again on monday due to the un-mandated ceasefire that went into effect in the month-long conflict between israel and hezbollah . interior minister wolfgang schäuble said germany must fulfill its international obligations if asked to contribute soldiers to a peacekeeping force . " we do not want to refuse - we can not refuse , " schäuble told zdf television . defense minister franz josef jung said germany " could not refuse if everyone asks us to make a contribution . " support not unanimous however , political support for sending german soldiers is not unanimous . the powerful bavarian sister party of merkel 's christian democrats is opposed , saying the issue is too sensitive because of germany 's past . bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the leader of the free market liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , is also strongly against german participation . " if there is one area of the world where german soldiers have no place , it is the israeli border , " westerwelle told the saarbrücker zeitung .
" our history forbids it . " israeli prime minister ehud olmert has given strong backing to the idea of including german troops , but for many jews in germany , the idea of sending german soldiers to the middle east 60 years after the murder of 6 million jews raises moral questions . germany 's central council of jews has said the thought that the grandchildren of perpetrators of the holocaust might find themselves shooting at the grandchildren of the nazis ' victims was impossible to contemplate . italy and france are leading the scramble to beef up the small un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- which will be key to making the tenuous cessation of hostilities .five nations - indonesia , malaysia , morocco , spain and turkey - have already agreed to contribute troops to the international force , the lebanese government said on sunday . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates sending soldiers to middle east as a ceasefire to the fighting in lebanon begins to look more likely , the debate over whether germany should take part in international peacekeeping there has divided the country 's politicians .

the building is likely to cost biss in the region of 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 638,650 -rrb- . biss is looking to invest between 13 and 14 million euros in the project which will turn the prison into a 66-room establishment with an adjoining complex of 14 senior citizen apartments . city 's homeless to staff hotel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biss hopes to give homeless people a chance to find employment - and accomodation - at the hotel the association hopes to employ between 25 and 40 homeless people as staff in the hotel , providing them with the means to afford their own accommodation . the current prison population will be moved to a new facility in 2008 , leaving the 6,000-square-meter -lrb- 64,500 square feet -rrb- building up for grabs .
if the prison building is not given over to any official state government department , it will be made available on the open public market , leaving the way free for biss to acquire the property . the organization has already hired a design team to draw up plans for the possible make-over .
architect henning dickhoff from a + p architecture in munich told the süddeutsche zeitung that the preparatory design work had been completed and a preliminary construction inquiry had been lodged with the city council . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de globetrotting behind bars traveling around the globe for a year and visiting 60 countries along the way might be a dream for many .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.08.2006 growth in germany tops five-year high in second quarter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extra summer sunshine boosted economic growth in outdoor sectors warm weather , the world cup , vat increases in 2007 and swelling corporate profits are a few reasons why germany 's economy reached a record high last quarter .
but experts are n't sure how long the boom can last . the german economy , the biggest in the 12-country euro zone , is growing at its fastest rate since the dot.com boom five years ago , data showed on monday .
the growth can be attributed in part to increased construction spending and booming company profits . germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter of this year compared with the first quarter , federal statistics office destatis said in a statement . that represented an acceleration from the 0.7 percent growth rate in the preceding three months and was the fastest rate of growth since the first quarter of 2001 . data from the eu 's eurostat data agency showed monday that german expansion had helped the euro zone economy to hit its fastest rate of growth in six years in the second quarter . domestic growth stimuli bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup in germany brought in fans - and a few extra euros this time , growth in germany was not solely export-driven , as it had been in previous economic upturns in the country . " growth impulses are coming primarily from inside germany , " destatis said .
" while the momentum of foreign trade has weakened , it was primarily investment in construction and equipment that contributed to the economic pick-up in the second quarter . " over 12 months , growth measured one percent in the second quarter because of differences in the number of working days .
when adjusted for working days , growth was at 2.4 percent . the unseasonably warm weather helped boost activity in outdoor sectors such as the construction industry and companies are investing their record-high profits in new plants and equipment . world cup and upcoming vat increase the world cup soccer championships , held in germany in june and july , also provided a boost to consumer spending , a sector had previously held back the development of a broad-based recovery in germany . furthermore , households are bringing forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the planned rise in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent , which will take effect in january . the ministry of economy in berlin hailed the second-quarter gdp data as proof that the economic gridlock of recent years had finally been lifted . " the recovery has gained in breadth and strength , " said economy minister michael glos .
" the situation on the labor market has improved noticeably .
the outlook for this year is decidedly positive . " the dihk federation of german chambers of commerce agreed . " our forecast for full-year growth of up to two percent is within reach , " dihk president martin wansleben added . growth across the euro zone other euro zone countries , such as france and the netherlands , have similarly beaten growth expectations for the second quarter , suggesting that the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- may have to revise its own growth forecasts for the entire euro area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : value-added tax will jump from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 the euro zone expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter , separate data published by the eu 's statistics office eurostat showed on monday .
the expansion of the euro zone economy added to the arguments for further interest rate hikes by the ecb . the ecb 's benchmark refinancing rate currently stands at 3 percent and is expected to rise to 3.5 percent by the end of this year in order to keep a lid on inflation in the 12 countries that share the euro . " the german gdp data are almost too good to be true , " said bank of america economist holger schmieding .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : günter grass grass defends long silence as book sales soar judging grass opinion : a late confession is better than no confession at all " i do n't hold onto ideological distortions " germany -pipe- 14.08.2006 nobel prize winner grass under fire for belated ss confession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : someone smeared swastikas on the door to grass ' house in 1997 nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he was drafted into nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss elite force during world war ii . the 78-year-old grass told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that the stunning confession would feature in his memoir " peeling onions , " which is due to appear in september .
so far , it had only been known that the author , best known abroad for his 1959 novel " the tin drum , " was conscripted into the german air defense forces . but in his autobiography he also recounted that he tried to join the third reich 's submarine forces when he was 15 years old but was rejected because he was too young .
he said that he was drafted into the elite waffen ss the following year but denied suggestions that he joined willingly . grass , for many years a prominent leftist and pacifist , was wounded in 1945 and sent to an american prisoner of war camp . " i wanted to make clear once again what happened then and above all things concerning me , " he told the newspaper .
" my silence for all these years is one of the reasons why i wrote this book .
it had to come out . " contemporaries disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter kempowski fellow german author walter kempowski was among the first of his grass 's contemporaries to comment , telling the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that the revelation was " a bit late " while grass biographer michael jürgs said he was " personally disappointed " and lamented " the end of a moral authority . " leading literature critic hellmuth karasek criticized the timing but also agreed there was no reason to reproach grass as he had done much in his career and life since the war to inspire people . " the fact he was in the ss at 17 is by itself a misdemeanor - had grass not been one to throw his weight around as a moral authority so much since then , " karasek told german radio .
" if i were cynical , i would say he did not reveal it sooner at the risk of not winning a nobel prize .
do n't misunderstand me : grass deserved the nobel prize more than any other german writer .
but everything now has to be seen in a new light . " joachim fest , a leading historian , told der spiegel magazine : " after 60 years , this confession comes a bit too late .
i ca n't understand how someone who for decades set himself up as a moral authority , a rather smug one , could pull this off . " michael wolffsohn , a prominent military historian , also faulted grass for waiting so long .
grass 's " moralizing , though not his storytelling , life 's work is devalued by his persistent silence , " wolffsohn wrote in the online netzeitung daily . cdu politician demands return of prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 meanwhile , wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union called for grass to return the nobel prize he won for literature in 1999 .
börnsen told the german daily bild that grass should adhere to his own moral standards and " honorably return the prize . " sections of the german press were equally deflated by the admission . " grass 's confession right before the publication of his autobiography leaves behind a bad taste of book promotion , " wrote bild am sonntag newspaper columnist helmut böger .
" even after his admission , grass remains germany 's most important living author .
but he has lost his standing as a moral authority .
he can not be castigated for being a member of the ss ...
but he can be for lying about it for 60 years . " however , ralph giordano , a leading german-jewish writer , said he would not condemn grass and praised his belated confession . " it 's good what günter grass has now done , " giordano said .
" what 's worse than making a mistake is not coming to terms with it .
his example also shows how seducible young people can be . " the muted reactions outside of germany were mostly of displeasure and disappointment . robert fulford , a columnist with canada 's national post , accused grass of hypocrisy . " during his long career as a public man , grass has never passed up a chance to speak out for outspokenness , " he wrote .
" ' the job of a citizen is to keep his mouth open , ' he liked to say - though not necessarily in all cases , of course . " walesa calls for renouncement of citizenship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel peace prize winner lech walesa former polish president lech walesa took an even harder line by demanding that grass renounce his honorary citizenship of gdansk .
grass , who was born in the baltic port of danzig , now the polish city of gdansk , became an honorary citizen of the city in 1993 . " an uncomfortable situation has developed , " walesa , who is also an honorary citizen of gdansk , said in an interview monday with the bild newspaper .
" i do not feel comfortable in that company .
i do not know whether one should consider revoking the title .
if it had been known he was in the ss , he would never have received the honor .
it would be best if he relinquished it himself . " in his admission , grass said he never fired a shot during his time with the feared elite force whose notoriety he only grasped once his unit had been defeated , when one of his superiors ordered him to get rid of his uniform . nuremberg trials revealed truth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waffen ss was notoriously brutal the feared paramilitary unit was branded a criminal organization at the nuremberg war crimes trials .
only then , grass claimed , did he start to understand . " i was stupid enough to believe that germans would not do such things and took it all for propaganda , " he said .
the revelations of ss brutality at nuremberg trials then caused him " feelings of guilt and shame .

as the crowning but ultimately disappointing event of the 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , a star-studded production of " the threepenny opera " opened in berlin . the fact that brecht 's " threepenny opera " opened at the admiralspalast in berlin was a little miracle in itself .
the historic building from the beginning of the 20th century , hastily renovated by entrepreneur falk walter , was not deemed safe for public use until the day before the premiere , when city officials finally gave their seal of approval . the media feverishly followed the will-they-or-wo n't-they drama of the most talked-about production of the year .
in the end , all those wires ominously sticking out of the walls , blotches of paint , mops , buckets and vaguely disguised piles of rubble indicated that the building - originally an ice rink and a luxury spa , which then , in the 1920s , became a theater - was and still is a construction site , an unfinished project .
very much like brecht 's revolutionary dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the admiralspalast is still not fully renovated the scent of undried paint - known to cause either mild headaches or mild hallucinations , depending on your age and social status - mixed well with the perfumes of berlin society ladies , while one toilette sign in the theater foyer still pointed to a hole in the wall , covered by a simple wooden board . this hole in the wall - a real metaphoric nowhere - would have been better suited as backdrop for beckett 's " waiting for godot . "
estragon : " shall we go ? "
vladimir : " let 's go . "
stage directions : " they do n't move . " " at least , the stage is standing , " said a bartender before the saturday night performance , offering a glass of champagne to an elderly lady while performing an acrobatic balancing act over several crates of beer . an anticlimax and while the stage was standing , the performance fell flat .
with all the media hullabaloo leading up to the premiere , one was almost convinced it was going to be something special . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director karl maria brandauer -lrb- left -rrb- and punk rocker campino austrian actor and director klaus maria brandauer assembled a stellar ensemble .
german punk singer campino of the band die toten hosen played the role of mack the knife , king of thieves . gottfried john - known to film buffs from several fassbinder movies and to the rest of the universe as the evil russian general arkadii grigorovich ourumov from james bond 's russian stunt in " golden eye " - played mr. peachum . katrin sass - one of most popular actresses from former east germany , who experienced a pan-german comeback with her touching appearance in the blockbuster hit " good bye , lenin " - added quite a bit of slapstick cheekiness to the role of manipulative alcoholic mrs. peachum . but most of the ensemble appeared helpless in an overly conventional production which lacked both the dramatic gusto and political audacity .
staging the play as an authentic costume drama set in london in the 1920s , brandauer created a sluggish , outdated and all too reverent production which failed to excite let alone provoke . a betrayal of sorts heiner müller said in an interview once that " to use brecht without criticizing him is to betray him . "
turning " the threepenny opera " into a wax museum musical was one such betrayal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit minichmayr -lrb- polly -rrb- and campino -lrb- mack the knife -rrb- the highlight of the evening turned out to be birgit minichmayr 's performance as polly .
the austrian-born actress , who joined berlin 's volksbühne theater in 2004 , after earning her laurels at vienna 's burgtheater , showed once again that she is one of the most exciting young german-speaking actresses today . her polly was both loud and vulnerable , rebellious and scared .
the otherworldly force of her voice , which assumes a subtle huskiness in the higher register , turned her rendering of pirate jenny 's song into a moment of chilling , spectral beauty . sweeping the roads the most contradictory - and most brechtian - moment of the evening happened outside the theater .
the elegant guests were greeted on arrival by a couple of homeless berliners selling a special edition of their newspaper , strassenfeger -lrb- street sweeper -rrb- , entirely dedicated to the new production of " the threepenny opera . "
it is fascinating what kind of advertising a budget of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.5 million -rrb- can get you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katrin sass -lrb- left -rrb- played mrs. peachum with a great sense of humor one after another , the well-off and the extremely well-off couples stopped at the theater entry to buy themselves a copy of strassenfeger .
after all , they all came to watch brecht .
it felt appropriate to get close to the masses .
so they blinded the homeless with their pearly white teeth , and smiled like there was no tomorrow .
it was a spectacle worth of buñuel 's " discreet charm of the bourgeoise . " but those were exactly the kind of people , who - under different , non-theatrical , non-brechtian circumstances - would have looked the other way .
luckily for them , they do n't normally ride the subway that much . brecht in a post-revolutionary age when mack the knife cried out his famous invective - " what is robbing a bank when compared to founding a bank ? " - his words had to come out as petulant rather than subversive , especially to deutsche bank president josef ackermann , one of the most prominent guests at the premiere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandauer 's reading of brecht was too tame and unexciting what 's more , " the threepenny opera " at the admiralspalast was sponsored by deutsche bank - a company that celebrated its record yields of 2.5 billion euros two years ago by firing more than 6,000 people , or every tenth employee . even to brecht - who was himself no stranger to wheelings and dealings of all sorts , and whose austrian passport allowed him to dream his communist dream in east berlin while keeping a bank account in switzerland - the happy artistic collective bringing together a punk rocker and a big banker would have seemed self-defeating . brecht said once that his work was " the swan song of the millennium . "
in brandauer 's no-risk production , brecht 's swan song died a muffled , echoless death . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating bertolt brecht click here for a dw-world.de dossier on brecht 's life and international influence .
a communist in a city of angels he blamed the sunshine in la , which " shriveled up the brains of gifted writers leaving them incapable of anything but film-writing . "
but when brecht himself tried to become a hollywood screenwriter , he failed miserably .

the historic building from the beginning of the 20th century , hastily renovated by entrepreneur falk walter , was not deemed safe for public use until the day before the premiere , when city officials finally gave their seal of approval . the media feverishly followed the will-they-or-wo n't-they drama of the most talked-about production of the year .
in the end , all those wires ominously sticking out of the walls , blotches of paint , mops , buckets and vaguely disguised piles of rubble indicated that the building - originally an ice rink and a luxury spa , which then , in the 1920s , became a theater - was and still is a construction site , an unfinished project .
very much like brecht 's revolutionary dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the admiralspalast is still not fully renovated the scent of undried paint - known to cause either mild headaches or mild hallucinations , depending on your age and social status - mixed well with the perfumes of berlin society ladies , while one toilette sign in the theater foyer still pointed to a hole in the wall , covered by a simple wooden board . this hole in the wall - a real metaphoric nowhere - would have been better suited as backdrop for beckett 's " waiting for godot . "
estragon : " shall we go ? "
vladimir : " let 's go . "
stage directions : " they do n't move . " " at least , the stage is standing , " said a bartender before the saturday night performance , offering a glass of champagne to an elderly lady while performing an acrobatic balancing act over several crates of beer . an anticlimax and while the stage was standing , the performance fell flat .
with all the media hullabaloo leading up to the premiere , one was almost convinced it was going to be something special . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director karl maria brandauer -lrb- left -rrb- and punk rocker campino austrian actor and director klaus maria brandauer assembled a stellar ensemble .
german punk singer campino of the band die toten hosen played the role of mack the knife , king of thieves . gottfried john - known to film buffs from several fassbinder movies and to the rest of the universe as the evil russian general arkadii grigorovich ourumov from james bond 's russian stunt in " golden eye " - played mr. peachum . katrin sass - one of most popular actresses from former east germany , who experienced a pan-german comeback with her touching appearance in the blockbuster hit " good bye , lenin " - added quite a bit of slapstick cheekiness to the role of manipulative alcoholic mrs. peachum . but most of the ensemble appeared helpless in an overly conventional production which lacked both the dramatic gusto and political audacity .
staging the play as an authentic costume drama set in london in the 1920s , brandauer created a sluggish , outdated and all too reverent production which failed to excite let alone provoke . a betrayal of sorts heiner müller said in an interview once that " to use brecht without criticizing him is to betray him . "
turning " the threepenny opera " into a wax museum musical was one such betrayal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit minichmayr -lrb- polly -rrb- and campino -lrb- mack the knife -rrb- the highlight of the evening turned out to be birgit minichmayr 's performance as polly .
the austrian-born actress , who joined berlin 's volksbühne theater in 2004 , after earning her laurels at vienna 's burgtheater , showed once again that she is one of the most exciting young german-speaking actresses today . her polly was both loud and vulnerable , rebellious and scared .
the otherworldly force of her voice , which assumes a subtle huskiness in the higher register , turned her rendering of pirate jenny 's song into a moment of chilling , spectral beauty . sweeping the roads the most contradictory - and most brechtian - moment of the evening happened outside the theater .
the elegant guests were greeted on arrival by a couple of homeless berliners selling a special edition of their newspaper , strassenfeger -lrb- street sweeper -rrb- , entirely dedicated to the new production of " the threepenny opera . "
it is fascinating what kind of advertising a budget of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.5 million -rrb- can get you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katrin sass -lrb- left -rrb- played mrs. peachum with a great sense of humor one after another , the well-off and the extremely well-off couples stopped at the theater entry to buy themselves a copy of strassenfeger .
after all , they all came to watch brecht .
it felt appropriate to get close to the masses .
so they blinded the homeless with their pearly white teeth , and smiled like there was no tomorrow .
it was a spectacle worth of buñuel 's " discreet charm of the bourgeoise . " but those were exactly the kind of people , who - under different , non-theatrical , non-brechtian circumstances - would have looked the other way .
luckily for them , they do n't normally ride the subway that much . brecht in a post-revolutionary age when mack the knife cried out his famous invective - " what is robbing a bank when compared to founding a bank ? " - his words had to come out as petulant rather than subversive , especially to deutsche bank president josef ackermann , one of the most prominent guests at the premiere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandauer 's reading of brecht was too tame and unexciting what 's more , " the threepenny opera " at the admiralspalast was sponsored by deutsche bank - a company that celebrated its record yields of 2.5 billion euros two years ago by firing more than 6,000 people , or every tenth employee . even to brecht - who was himself no stranger to wheelings and dealings of all sorts , and whose austrian passport allowed him to dream his communist dream in east berlin while keeping a bank account in switzerland - the happy artistic collective bringing together a punk rocker and a big banker would have seemed self-defeating . brecht said once that his work was " the swan song of the millennium . "

with all the media hullabaloo leading up to the premiere , one was almost convinced it was going to be something special . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director karl maria brandauer -lrb- left -rrb- and punk rocker campino austrian actor and director klaus maria brandauer assembled a stellar ensemble .
german punk singer campino of the band die toten hosen played the role of mack the knife , king of thieves . gottfried john - known to film buffs from several fassbinder movies and to the rest of the universe as the evil russian general arkadii grigorovich ourumov from james bond 's russian stunt in " golden eye " - played mr. peachum . katrin sass - one of most popular actresses from former east germany , who experienced a pan-german comeback with her touching appearance in the blockbuster hit " good bye , lenin " - added quite a bit of slapstick cheekiness to the role of manipulative alcoholic mrs. peachum . but most of the ensemble appeared helpless in an overly conventional production which lacked both the dramatic gusto and political audacity .
staging the play as an authentic costume drama set in london in the 1920s , brandauer created a sluggish , outdated and all too reverent production which failed to excite let alone provoke . a betrayal of sorts heiner müller said in an interview once that " to use brecht without criticizing him is to betray him . "
turning " the threepenny opera " into a wax museum musical was one such betrayal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit minichmayr -lrb- polly -rrb- and campino -lrb- mack the knife -rrb- the highlight of the evening turned out to be birgit minichmayr 's performance as polly .
the austrian-born actress , who joined berlin 's volksbühne theater in 2004 , after earning her laurels at vienna 's burgtheater , showed once again that she is one of the most exciting young german-speaking actresses today . her polly was both loud and vulnerable , rebellious and scared .
the otherworldly force of her voice , which assumes a subtle huskiness in the higher register , turned her rendering of pirate jenny 's song into a moment of chilling , spectral beauty . sweeping the roads the most contradictory - and most brechtian - moment of the evening happened outside the theater .
the elegant guests were greeted on arrival by a couple of homeless berliners selling a special edition of their newspaper , strassenfeger -lrb- street sweeper -rrb- , entirely dedicated to the new production of " the threepenny opera . "
it is fascinating what kind of advertising a budget of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.5 million -rrb- can get you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katrin sass -lrb- left -rrb- played mrs. peachum with a great sense of humor one after another , the well-off and the extremely well-off couples stopped at the theater entry to buy themselves a copy of strassenfeger .
after all , they all came to watch brecht .
it felt appropriate to get close to the masses .
so they blinded the homeless with their pearly white teeth , and smiled like there was no tomorrow .
it was a spectacle worth of buñuel 's " discreet charm of the bourgeoise . " but those were exactly the kind of people , who - under different , non-theatrical , non-brechtian circumstances - would have looked the other way .
luckily for them , they do n't normally ride the subway that much . brecht in a post-revolutionary age when mack the knife cried out his famous invective - " what is robbing a bank when compared to founding a bank ? " - his words had to come out as petulant rather than subversive , especially to deutsche bank president josef ackermann , one of the most prominent guests at the premiere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandauer 's reading of brecht was too tame and unexciting what 's more , " the threepenny opera " at the admiralspalast was sponsored by deutsche bank - a company that celebrated its record yields of 2.5 billion euros two years ago by firing more than 6,000 people , or every tenth employee . even to brecht - who was himself no stranger to wheelings and dealings of all sorts , and whose austrian passport allowed him to dream his communist dream in east berlin while keeping a bank account in switzerland - the happy artistic collective bringing together a punk rocker and a big banker would have seemed self-defeating . brecht said once that his work was " the swan song of the millennium . "
in brandauer 's no-risk production , brecht 's swan song died a muffled , echoless death . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating bertolt brecht click here for a dw-world.de dossier on brecht 's life and international influence .

so far , it had only been known that the author , best known abroad for his 1959 novel " the tin drum , " was conscripted into the german air defense forces . but in his autobiography he also recounted that he tried to join the third reich 's submarine forces when he was 15 years old but was rejected because he was too young .
he said that he was drafted into the elite waffen ss the following year but denied suggestions that he joined willingly . grass , for many years a prominent leftist and pacifist , was wounded in 1945 and sent to an american prisoner of war camp . " i wanted to make clear once again what happened then and above all things concerning me , " he told the newspaper .
" my silence for all these years is one of the reasons why i wrote this book .
it had to come out . " contemporaries disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter kempowski fellow german author walter kempowski was among the first of his grass 's contemporaries to comment , telling the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that the revelation was " a bit late " while grass biographer michael jürgs said he was " personally disappointed " and lamented " the end of a moral authority . " leading literature critic hellmuth karasek criticized the timing but also agreed there was no reason to reproach grass as he had done much in his career and life since the war to inspire people . " the fact he was in the ss at 17 is by itself a misdemeanor - had grass not been one to throw his weight around as a moral authority so much since then , " karasek told german radio .
" if i were cynical , i would say he did not reveal it sooner at the risk of not winning a nobel prize .
do n't misunderstand me : grass deserved the nobel prize more than any other german writer .
but everything now has to be seen in a new light . " joachim fest , a leading historian , told der spiegel magazine : " after 60 years , this confession comes a bit too late .
i ca n't understand how someone who for decades set himself up as a moral authority , a rather smug one , could pull this off . " michael wolffsohn , a prominent military historian , also faulted grass for waiting so long .
grass 's " moralizing , though not his storytelling , life 's work is devalued by his persistent silence , " wolffsohn wrote in the online netzeitung daily . cdu politician demands return of prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 meanwhile , wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union called for grass to return the nobel prize he won for literature in 1999 .
börnsen told the german daily bild that grass should adhere to his own moral standards and " honorably return the prize . " sections of the german press were equally deflated by the admission . " grass 's confession right before the publication of his autobiography leaves behind a bad taste of book promotion , " wrote bild am sonntag newspaper columnist helmut böger .
" even after his admission , grass remains germany 's most important living author .
but he has lost his standing as a moral authority .
he can not be castigated for being a member of the ss ...
but he can be for lying about it for 60 years . " however , ralph giordano , a leading german-jewish writer , said he would not condemn grass and praised his belated confession . " it 's good what günter grass has now done , " giordano said .
" what 's worse than making a mistake is not coming to terms with it .
his example also shows how seducible young people can be . " the muted reactions outside of germany were mostly of displeasure and disappointment . robert fulford , a columnist with canada 's national post , accused grass of hypocrisy . " during his long career as a public man , grass has never passed up a chance to speak out for outspokenness , " he wrote .
" ' the job of a citizen is to keep his mouth open , ' he liked to say - though not necessarily in all cases , of course . " walesa calls for renouncement of citizenship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel peace prize winner lech walesa former polish president lech walesa took an even harder line by demanding that grass renounce his honorary citizenship of gdansk .
grass , who was born in the baltic port of danzig , now the polish city of gdansk , became an honorary citizen of the city in 1993 . " an uncomfortable situation has developed , " walesa , who is also an honorary citizen of gdansk , said in an interview monday with the bild newspaper .
" i do not feel comfortable in that company .
i do not know whether one should consider revoking the title .
if it had been known he was in the ss , he would never have received the honor .
it would be best if he relinquished it himself . " in his admission , grass said he never fired a shot during his time with the feared elite force whose notoriety he only grasped once his unit had been defeated , when one of his superiors ordered him to get rid of his uniform . nuremberg trials revealed truth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waffen ss was notoriously brutal the feared paramilitary unit was branded a criminal organization at the nuremberg war crimes trials .
only then , grass claimed , did he start to understand . " i was stupid enough to believe that germans would not do such things and took it all for propaganda , " he said .
the revelations of ss brutality at nuremberg trials then caused him " feelings of guilt and shame . " grass has spent the decades since the end of the war demanding that germans come to terms with their nazi past by coming clean on it . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the taboo breaker with his new novel , nobel-prize winner günther grass confronts a subject previously dealt with only by the right wing .

not that the security council had n't tried its best : stopping the recent fighting was significantly more complicated than in other crisis and war situations .
this was no war between two states with regular armed forces , but rather one of those " asymmetrical " conflicts that have started replacing " traditional " wars . the success of the un resolution depends not on the good will of the security council members , but only on the warring parties .

but it 's still a long way to peace , says dw 's peter philipp . after weeks of discussion , the un security council managed to find a formula for a ceasefire in lebanon .
the weapons have been silent since monday morning .
but things are not necessarily that simple : resolution 1701 would not be the first un resolution about the middle east that awakens hopes which it does n't fulfill .
not that the security council had n't tried its best : stopping the recent fighting was significantly more complicated than in other crisis and war situations .
this was no war between two states with regular armed forces , but rather one of those " asymmetrical " conflicts that have started replacing " traditional " wars . the success of the un resolution depends not on the good will of the security council members , but only on the warring parties .
and both parties apparently agreed to it only because they realized that things could n't go on like this any longer . a no-win situation the israeli government does not acknowledge this openly , but it must have realized that it got itself involved in a military adventure that it could n't win at any level : even the strongest army in the region is powerless against the well-equipped and extremely motivated group of local guerillas such as hezbollah .
and it was madness to think that it was possible to defeat or expel hezbollah with air strikes . israel also lost against the people in lebanon who do not support hezbollah : massive israeli attacks on civilians and the infrastructure in the country have cost israel its last bits of sympathy and understanding in lebanon . it was no different internationally .
israel complained that the media reported one-sidedly and that the lebanese suffering was pushed more to the foreground than that of the israelis .
it was pushed to foreground because it was many times bigger and because it was caused by a state whose prime minister only recently claimed that it had the most moral army in the world . hezbollah could n't afford to go on like this but hezbollah must have also begun to realize that it can not afford a war of this kind in the long term .
although they did surprise everybody - the israelis , in particular - with their firmness and endurance , they would have in the long term succumbed to the massive israeli strikes and led lebanon to disaster along the way . even as it is , hezbollah bears the responsibility of having started this war .
but it knew how to present itself as the only resistance group that should be taken seriously .
had the war escalated even further , hezbollah would have probably lost this sympathy bonus from the lebanese people . and now ?
there is a long way from a ceasefire - if it is kept - to permanent peace .
it will surely take several weeks for the lebanese and international forces to replace the israeli troops in southern lebanon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : günter grass grass defends long silence as book sales soar judging grass opinion : a late confession is better than no confession at all " i do n't hold onto ideological distortions " germany -pipe- 14.08.2006 nobel prize winner grass under fire for belated ss confession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : someone smeared swastikas on the door to grass ' house in 1997 nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he was drafted into nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss elite force during world war ii . the 78-year-old grass told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that the stunning confession would feature in his memoir " peeling onions , " which is due to appear in september .
so far , it had only been known that the author , best known abroad for his 1959 novel " the tin drum , " was conscripted into the german air defense forces . but in his autobiography he also recounted that he tried to join the third reich 's submarine forces when he was 15 years old but was rejected because he was too young .
he said that he was drafted into the elite waffen ss the following year but denied suggestions that he joined willingly . grass , for many years a prominent leftist and pacifist , was wounded in 1945 and sent to an american prisoner of war camp . " i wanted to make clear once again what happened then and above all things concerning me , " he told the newspaper .
" my silence for all these years is one of the reasons why i wrote this book .
it had to come out . " contemporaries disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter kempowski fellow german author walter kempowski was among the first of his grass 's contemporaries to comment , telling the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that the revelation was " a bit late " while grass biographer michael jürgs said he was " personally disappointed " and lamented " the end of a moral authority . " leading literature critic hellmuth karasek criticized the timing but also agreed there was no reason to reproach grass as he had done much in his career and life since the war to inspire people . " the fact he was in the ss at 17 is by itself a misdemeanor - had grass not been one to throw his weight around as a moral authority so much since then , " karasek told german radio .
" if i were cynical , i would say he did not reveal it sooner at the risk of not winning a nobel prize .
do n't misunderstand me : grass deserved the nobel prize more than any other german writer .
but everything now has to be seen in a new light . " joachim fest , a leading historian , told der spiegel magazine : " after 60 years , this confession comes a bit too late .
i ca n't understand how someone who for decades set himself up as a moral authority , a rather smug one , could pull this off . " michael wolffsohn , a prominent military historian , also faulted grass for waiting so long .
grass 's " moralizing , though not his storytelling , life 's work is devalued by his persistent silence , " wolffsohn wrote in the online netzeitung daily . cdu politician demands return of prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 meanwhile , wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union called for grass to return the nobel prize he won for literature in 1999 .
börnsen told the german daily bild that grass should adhere to his own moral standards and " honorably return the prize . " sections of the german press were equally deflated by the admission . " grass 's confession right before the publication of his autobiography leaves behind a bad taste of book promotion , " wrote bild am sonntag newspaper columnist helmut böger .
" even after his admission , grass remains germany 's most important living author .
but he has lost his standing as a moral authority .
he can not be castigated for being a member of the ss ...
but he can be for lying about it for 60 years . " however , ralph giordano , a leading german-jewish writer , said he would not condemn grass and praised his belated confession . " it 's good what günter grass has now done , " giordano said .
" what 's worse than making a mistake is not coming to terms with it .
his example also shows how seducible young people can be . " the muted reactions outside of germany were mostly of displeasure and disappointment . robert fulford , a columnist with canada 's national post , accused grass of hypocrisy . " during his long career as a public man , grass has never passed up a chance to speak out for outspokenness , " he wrote .
" ' the job of a citizen is to keep his mouth open , ' he liked to say - though not necessarily in all cases , of course . " walesa calls for renouncement of citizenship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel peace prize winner lech walesa former polish president lech walesa took an even harder line by demanding that grass renounce his honorary citizenship of gdansk .
grass , who was born in the baltic port of danzig , now the polish city of gdansk , became an honorary citizen of the city in 1993 . " an uncomfortable situation has developed , " walesa , who is also an honorary citizen of gdansk , said in an interview monday with the bild newspaper .
" i do not feel comfortable in that company .
i do not know whether one should consider revoking the title .
if it had been known he was in the ss , he would never have received the honor .
it would be best if he relinquished it himself . " in his admission , grass said he never fired a shot during his time with the feared elite force whose notoriety he only grasped once his unit had been defeated , when one of his superiors ordered him to get rid of his uniform . nuremberg trials revealed truth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waffen ss was notoriously brutal the feared paramilitary unit was branded a criminal organization at the nuremberg war crimes trials .
only then , grass claimed , did he start to understand . " i was stupid enough to believe that germans would not do such things and took it all for propaganda , " he said .
the revelations of ss brutality at nuremberg trials then caused him " feelings of guilt and shame . " grass has spent the decades since the end of the war demanding that germans come to terms with their nazi past by coming clean on it . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the taboo breaker with his new novel , nobel-prize winner günther grass confronts a subject previously dealt with only by the right wing .

so far , it had only been known that the author , best known abroad for his 1959 novel " the tin drum , " was conscripted into the german air defense forces . but in his autobiography he also recounted that he tried to join the third reich 's submarine forces when he was 15 years old but was rejected because he was too young .
he said that he was drafted into the elite waffen ss the following year but denied suggestions that he joined willingly . grass , for many years a prominent leftist and pacifist , was wounded in 1945 and sent to an american prisoner of war camp . " i wanted to make clear once again what happened then and above all things concerning me , " he told the newspaper .
" my silence for all these years is one of the reasons why i wrote this book .
it had to come out . " contemporaries disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter kempowski fellow german author walter kempowski was among the first of his grass 's contemporaries to comment , telling the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that the revelation was " a bit late " while grass biographer michael jürgs said he was " personally disappointed " and lamented " the end of a moral authority . " leading literature critic hellmuth karasek criticized the timing but also agreed there was no reason to reproach grass as he had done much in his career and life since the war to inspire people . " the fact he was in the ss at 17 is by itself a misdemeanor - had grass not been one to throw his weight around as a moral authority so much since then , " karasek told german radio .
" if i were cynical , i would say he did not reveal it sooner at the risk of not winning a nobel prize .
do n't misunderstand me : grass deserved the nobel prize more than any other german writer .
but everything now has to be seen in a new light . " joachim fest , a leading historian , told der spiegel magazine : " after 60 years , this confession comes a bit too late .
i ca n't understand how someone who for decades set himself up as a moral authority , a rather smug one , could pull this off . " michael wolffsohn , a prominent military historian , also faulted grass for waiting so long .
grass 's " moralizing , though not his storytelling , life 's work is devalued by his persistent silence , " wolffsohn wrote in the online netzeitung daily . cdu politician demands return of prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 meanwhile , wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union called for grass to return the nobel prize he won for literature in 1999 .
börnsen told the german daily bild that grass should adhere to his own moral standards and " honorably return the prize . " sections of the german press were equally deflated by the admission . " grass 's confession right before the publication of his autobiography leaves behind a bad taste of book promotion , " wrote bild am sonntag newspaper columnist helmut böger .
" even after his admission , grass remains germany 's most important living author .
but he has lost his standing as a moral authority .
he can not be castigated for being a member of the ss ...
but he can be for lying about it for 60 years . " however , ralph giordano , a leading german-jewish writer , said he would not condemn grass and praised his belated confession . " it 's good what günter grass has now done , " giordano said .
" what 's worse than making a mistake is not coming to terms with it .
his example also shows how seducible young people can be . " the muted reactions outside of germany were mostly of displeasure and disappointment . robert fulford , a columnist with canada 's national post , accused grass of hypocrisy . " during his long career as a public man , grass has never passed up a chance to speak out for outspokenness , " he wrote .
" ' the job of a citizen is to keep his mouth open , ' he liked to say - though not necessarily in all cases , of course . " walesa calls for renouncement of citizenship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel peace prize winner lech walesa former polish president lech walesa took an even harder line by demanding that grass renounce his honorary citizenship of gdansk .
grass , who was born in the baltic port of danzig , now the polish city of gdansk , became an honorary citizen of the city in 1993 . " an uncomfortable situation has developed , " walesa , who is also an honorary citizen of gdansk , said in an interview monday with the bild newspaper .
" i do not feel comfortable in that company .
i do not know whether one should consider revoking the title .
if it had been known he was in the ss , he would never have received the honor .
it would be best if he relinquished it himself . " in his admission , grass said he never fired a shot during his time with the feared elite force whose notoriety he only grasped once his unit had been defeated , when one of his superiors ordered him to get rid of his uniform . nuremberg trials revealed truth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waffen ss was notoriously brutal the feared paramilitary unit was branded a criminal organization at the nuremberg war crimes trials .
only then , grass claimed , did he start to understand . " i was stupid enough to believe that germans would not do such things and took it all for propaganda , " he said .
the revelations of ss brutality at nuremberg trials then caused him " feelings of guilt and shame .

still , the issue is highly sensitive . germany 's ministers of defense and interior affairs said the country would be prepared to contribute to an international peacekeeping force in lebanon once the united nations ' security council specifies a mandate for the operation this week . german chancellor angela merkel edged around the question in the past , saying it was too early to decide on germany 's possible roles in a peacekeeping force .
the question of sending german troops to the israel-lebanon border has divided germany . government spokesman thomas steg told reporters there would be more clarity over what role germany would likely fulfill by the end of the week .
he added that the cabinet would discuss the matter next week , and that any final decision would be made in september when parliament reconvenes following the summer break . steg said that germany 's future role in lebanon would also be limited by its means . " we can only provide what we can afford , " steg said . ceasefire paves way for mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli soldiers ride in a truck after returning from southern lebanon in northern israel monday , aug .
14 discussion of german participation in a mission to lebanon became possible again on monday due to the un-mandated ceasefire that went into effect in the month-long conflict between israel and hezbollah . interior minister wolfgang schäuble said germany must fulfill its international obligations if asked to contribute soldiers to a peacekeeping force . " we do not want to refuse - we can not refuse , " schäuble told zdf television . defense minister franz josef jung said germany " could not refuse if everyone asks us to make a contribution . " support not unanimous however , political support for sending german soldiers is not unanimous . the powerful bavarian sister party of merkel 's christian democrats is opposed , saying the issue is too sensitive because of germany 's past . bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the leader of the free market liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , is also strongly against german participation .

still , the issue is highly sensitive . germany 's ministers of defense and interior affairs said the country would be prepared to contribute to an international peacekeeping force in lebanon once the united nations ' security council specifies a mandate for the operation this week . german chancellor angela merkel edged around the question in the past , saying it was too early to decide on germany 's possible roles in a peacekeeping force .
the question of sending german troops to the israel-lebanon border has divided germany . government spokesman thomas steg told reporters there would be more clarity over what role germany would likely fulfill by the end of the week .
he added that the cabinet would discuss the matter next week , and that any final decision would be made in september when parliament reconvenes following the summer break . steg said that germany 's future role in lebanon would also be limited by its means . " we can only provide what we can afford , " steg said . ceasefire paves way for mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli soldiers ride in a truck after returning from southern lebanon in northern israel monday , aug .
14 discussion of german participation in a mission to lebanon became possible again on monday due to the un-mandated ceasefire that went into effect in the month-long conflict between israel and hezbollah . interior minister wolfgang schäuble said germany must fulfill its international obligations if asked to contribute soldiers to a peacekeeping force . " we do not want to refuse - we can not refuse , " schäuble told zdf television . defense minister franz josef jung said germany " could not refuse if everyone asks us to make a contribution . " support not unanimous however , political support for sending german soldiers is not unanimous . the powerful bavarian sister party of merkel 's christian democrats is opposed , saying the issue is too sensitive because of germany 's past . bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the leader of the free market liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , is also strongly against german participation .

but it 's still a long way to peace , says dw 's peter philipp . after weeks of discussion , the un security council managed to find a formula for a ceasefire in lebanon .
the weapons have been silent since monday morning .
but things are not necessarily that simple : resolution 1701 would not be the first un resolution about the middle east that awakens hopes which it does n't fulfill .
not that the security council had n't tried its best : stopping the recent fighting was significantly more complicated than in other crisis and war situations .
this was no war between two states with regular armed forces , but rather one of those " asymmetrical " conflicts that have started replacing " traditional " wars . the success of the un resolution depends not on the good will of the security council members , but only on the warring parties .
and both parties apparently agreed to it only because they realized that things could n't go on like this any longer . a no-win situation the israeli government does not acknowledge this openly , but it must have realized that it got itself involved in a military adventure that it could n't win at any level : even the strongest army in the region is powerless against the well-equipped and extremely motivated group of local guerillas such as hezbollah .
and it was madness to think that it was possible to defeat or expel hezbollah with air strikes . israel also lost against the people in lebanon who do not support hezbollah : massive israeli attacks on civilians and the infrastructure in the country have cost israel its last bits of sympathy and understanding in lebanon . it was no different internationally .
israel complained that the media reported one-sidedly and that the lebanese suffering was pushed more to the foreground than that of the israelis .
it was pushed to foreground because it was many times bigger and because it was caused by a state whose prime minister only recently claimed that it had the most moral army in the world . hezbollah could n't afford to go on like this but hezbollah must have also begun to realize that it can not afford a war of this kind in the long term .
although they did surprise everybody - the israelis , in particular - with their firmness and endurance , they would have in the long term succumbed to the massive israeli strikes and led lebanon to disaster along the way . even as it is , hezbollah bears the responsibility of having started this war .
but it knew how to present itself as the only resistance group that should be taken seriously .
had the war escalated even further , hezbollah would have probably lost this sympathy bonus from the lebanese people . and now ?
there is a long way from a ceasefire - if it is kept - to permanent peace .
it will surely take several weeks for the lebanese and international forces to replace the israeli troops in southern lebanon .
in the meantime , they will not want to leave the country and hezbollah will also not want to put their arms to rest . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east -lrb- tt -rrb- . peter philipp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates sending soldiers to middle east as a ceasefire to the fighting in lebanon begins to look more likely , the debate over whether germany should take part in international peacekeeping there has divided the country 's politicians .

still , the issue is highly sensitive . germany 's ministers of defense and interior affairs said the country would be prepared to contribute to an international peacekeeping force in lebanon once the united nations ' security council specifies a mandate for the operation this week . german chancellor angela merkel edged around the question in the past , saying it was too early to decide on germany 's possible roles in a peacekeeping force .
the question of sending german troops to the israel-lebanon border has divided germany . government spokesman thomas steg told reporters there would be more clarity over what role germany would likely fulfill by the end of the week .
he added that the cabinet would discuss the matter next week , and that any final decision would be made in september when parliament reconvenes following the summer break . steg said that germany 's future role in lebanon would also be limited by its means . " we can only provide what we can afford , " steg said . ceasefire paves way for mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli soldiers ride in a truck after returning from southern lebanon in northern israel monday , aug .
14 discussion of german participation in a mission to lebanon became possible again on monday due to the un-mandated ceasefire that went into effect in the month-long conflict between israel and hezbollah . interior minister wolfgang schäuble said germany must fulfill its international obligations if asked to contribute soldiers to a peacekeeping force . " we do not want to refuse - we can not refuse , " schäuble told zdf television . defense minister franz josef jung said germany " could not refuse if everyone asks us to make a contribution . " support not unanimous however , political support for sending german soldiers is not unanimous . the powerful bavarian sister party of merkel 's christian democrats is opposed , saying the issue is too sensitive because of germany 's past . bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the leader of the free market liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , is also strongly against german participation . " if there is one area of the world where german soldiers have no place , it is the israeli border , " westerwelle told the saarbrücker zeitung .
" our history forbids it . " israeli prime minister ehud olmert has given strong backing to the idea of including german troops , but for many jews in germany , the idea of sending german soldiers to the middle east 60 years after the murder of 6 million jews raises moral questions . germany 's central council of jews has said the thought that the grandchildren of perpetrators of the holocaust might find themselves shooting at the grandchildren of the nazis ' victims was impossible to contemplate . italy and france are leading the scramble to beef up the small un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- which will be key to making the tenuous cessation of hostilities .five nations - indonesia , malaysia , morocco , spain and turkey - have already agreed to contribute troops to the international force , the lebanese government said on sunday . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates sending soldiers to middle east as a ceasefire to the fighting in lebanon begins to look more likely , the debate over whether germany should take part in international peacekeeping there has divided the country 's politicians .

as the crowning but ultimately disappointing event of the 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , a star-studded production of " the threepenny opera " opened in berlin . the fact that brecht 's " threepenny opera " opened at the admiralspalast in berlin was a little miracle in itself .
the historic building from the beginning of the 20th century , hastily renovated by entrepreneur falk walter , was not deemed safe for public use until the day before the premiere , when city officials finally gave their seal of approval . the media feverishly followed the will-they-or-wo n't-they drama of the most talked-about production of the year .
in the end , all those wires ominously sticking out of the walls , blotches of paint , mops , buckets and vaguely disguised piles of rubble indicated that the building - originally an ice rink and a luxury spa , which then , in the 1920s , became a theater - was and still is a construction site , an unfinished project .
very much like brecht 's revolutionary dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the admiralspalast is still not fully renovated the scent of undried paint - known to cause either mild headaches or mild hallucinations , depending on your age and social status - mixed well with the perfumes of berlin society ladies , while one toilette sign in the theater foyer still pointed to a hole in the wall , covered by a simple wooden board . this hole in the wall - a real metaphoric nowhere - would have been better suited as backdrop for beckett 's " waiting for godot . "
estragon : " shall we go ? "
vladimir : " let 's go . "
stage directions : " they do n't move . " " at least , the stage is standing , " said a bartender before the saturday night performance , offering a glass of champagne to an elderly lady while performing an acrobatic balancing act over several crates of beer . an anticlimax and while the stage was standing , the performance fell flat .
with all the media hullabaloo leading up to the premiere , one was almost convinced it was going to be something special . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director karl maria brandauer -lrb- left -rrb- and punk rocker campino austrian actor and director klaus maria brandauer assembled a stellar ensemble .
german punk singer campino of the band die toten hosen played the role of mack the knife , king of thieves . gottfried john - known to film buffs from several fassbinder movies and to the rest of the universe as the evil russian general arkadii grigorovich ourumov from james bond 's russian stunt in " golden eye " - played mr. peachum . katrin sass - one of most popular actresses from former east germany , who experienced a pan-german comeback with her touching appearance in the blockbuster hit " good bye , lenin " - added quite a bit of slapstick cheekiness to the role of manipulative alcoholic mrs. peachum . but most of the ensemble appeared helpless in an overly conventional production which lacked both the dramatic gusto and political audacity .
staging the play as an authentic costume drama set in london in the 1920s , brandauer created a sluggish , outdated and all too reverent production which failed to excite let alone provoke . a betrayal of sorts heiner müller said in an interview once that " to use brecht without criticizing him is to betray him . "
turning " the threepenny opera " into a wax museum musical was one such betrayal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit minichmayr -lrb- polly -rrb- and campino -lrb- mack the knife -rrb- the highlight of the evening turned out to be birgit minichmayr 's performance as polly .
the austrian-born actress , who joined berlin 's volksbühne theater in 2004 , after earning her laurels at vienna 's burgtheater , showed once again that she is one of the most exciting young german-speaking actresses today . her polly was both loud and vulnerable , rebellious and scared .
the otherworldly force of her voice , which assumes a subtle huskiness in the higher register , turned her rendering of pirate jenny 's song into a moment of chilling , spectral beauty . sweeping the roads the most contradictory - and most brechtian - moment of the evening happened outside the theater .
the elegant guests were greeted on arrival by a couple of homeless berliners selling a special edition of their newspaper , strassenfeger -lrb- street sweeper -rrb- , entirely dedicated to the new production of " the threepenny opera . "
it is fascinating what kind of advertising a budget of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.5 million -rrb- can get you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katrin sass -lrb- left -rrb- played mrs. peachum with a great sense of humor one after another , the well-off and the extremely well-off couples stopped at the theater entry to buy themselves a copy of strassenfeger .
after all , they all came to watch brecht .
it felt appropriate to get close to the masses .
so they blinded the homeless with their pearly white teeth , and smiled like there was no tomorrow .
it was a spectacle worth of buñuel 's " discreet charm of the bourgeoise . " but those were exactly the kind of people , who - under different , non-theatrical , non-brechtian circumstances - would have looked the other way .
luckily for them , they do n't normally ride the subway that much . brecht in a post-revolutionary age when mack the knife cried out his famous invective - " what is robbing a bank when compared to founding a bank ? " - his words had to come out as petulant rather than subversive , especially to deutsche bank president josef ackermann , one of the most prominent guests at the premiere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandauer 's reading of brecht was too tame and unexciting what 's more , " the threepenny opera " at the admiralspalast was sponsored by deutsche bank - a company that celebrated its record yields of 2.5 billion euros two years ago by firing more than 6,000 people , or every tenth employee . even to brecht - who was himself no stranger to wheelings and dealings of all sorts , and whose austrian passport allowed him to dream his communist dream in east berlin while keeping a bank account in switzerland - the happy artistic collective bringing together a punk rocker and a big banker would have seemed self-defeating . brecht said once that his work was " the swan song of the millennium .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 14.08.2006 opinion : " it 's a long way to peace " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in accordance with un resolution 1701 , a ceasefire in the conflict between israel and hezbollah in lebanon came into effect on monday morning .
but it 's still a long way to peace , says dw 's peter philipp . after weeks of discussion , the un security council managed to find a formula for a ceasefire in lebanon .
the weapons have been silent since monday morning .
but things are not necessarily that simple : resolution 1701 would not be the first un resolution about the middle east that awakens hopes which it does n't fulfill .
not that the security council had n't tried its best : stopping the recent fighting was significantly more complicated than in other crisis and war situations .
this was no war between two states with regular armed forces , but rather one of those " asymmetrical " conflicts that have started replacing " traditional " wars . the success of the un resolution depends not on the good will of the security council members , but only on the warring parties .
and both parties apparently agreed to it only because they realized that things could n't go on like this any longer . a no-win situation the israeli government does not acknowledge this openly , but it must have realized that it got itself involved in a military adventure that it could n't win at any level : even the strongest army in the region is powerless against the well-equipped and extremely motivated group of local guerillas such as hezbollah .
and it was madness to think that it was possible to defeat or expel hezbollah with air strikes . israel also lost against the people in lebanon who do not support hezbollah : massive israeli attacks on civilians and the infrastructure in the country have cost israel its last bits of sympathy and understanding in lebanon . it was no different internationally .
israel complained that the media reported one-sidedly and that the lebanese suffering was pushed more to the foreground than that of the israelis .
it was pushed to foreground because it was many times bigger and because it was caused by a state whose prime minister only recently claimed that it had the most moral army in the world . hezbollah could n't afford to go on like this but hezbollah must have also begun to realize that it can not afford a war of this kind in the long term .
although they did surprise everybody - the israelis , in particular - with their firmness and endurance , they would have in the long term succumbed to the massive israeli strikes and led lebanon to disaster along the way . even as it is , hezbollah bears the responsibility of having started this war .
but it knew how to present itself as the only resistance group that should be taken seriously .
had the war escalated even further , hezbollah would have probably lost this sympathy bonus from the lebanese people . and now ?
there is a long way from a ceasefire - if it is kept - to permanent peace .
it will surely take several weeks for the lebanese and international forces to replace the israeli troops in southern lebanon .
in the meantime , they will not want to leave the country and hezbollah will also not want to put their arms to rest . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east -lrb- tt -rrb- . peter philipp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates sending soldiers to middle east as a ceasefire to the fighting in lebanon begins to look more likely , the debate over whether germany should take part in international peacekeeping there has divided the country 's politicians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : celebrating bertolt brecht " bertolt brecht 's influence can not be overestimated " bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere a communist in a city of angels culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2006 brandauer 's betrayal of brecht großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the threepenny opera " has been the most talked-about play in berlin this year berlin is in brecht fever .
as the crowning but ultimately disappointing event of the 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , a star-studded production of " the threepenny opera " opened in berlin . the fact that brecht 's " threepenny opera " opened at the admiralspalast in berlin was a little miracle in itself .
the historic building from the beginning of the 20th century , hastily renovated by entrepreneur falk walter , was not deemed safe for public use until the day before the premiere , when city officials finally gave their seal of approval . the media feverishly followed the will-they-or-wo n't-they drama of the most talked-about production of the year .
in the end , all those wires ominously sticking out of the walls , blotches of paint , mops , buckets and vaguely disguised piles of rubble indicated that the building - originally an ice rink and a luxury spa , which then , in the 1920s , became a theater - was and still is a construction site , an unfinished project .
very much like brecht 's revolutionary dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the admiralspalast is still not fully renovated the scent of undried paint - known to cause either mild headaches or mild hallucinations , depending on your age and social status - mixed well with the perfumes of berlin society ladies , while one toilette sign in the theater foyer still pointed to a hole in the wall , covered by a simple wooden board . this hole in the wall - a real metaphoric nowhere - would have been better suited as backdrop for beckett 's " waiting for godot . "
estragon : " shall we go ? "
vladimir : " let 's go . "
stage directions : " they do n't move . " " at least , the stage is standing , " said a bartender before the saturday night performance , offering a glass of champagne to an elderly lady while performing an acrobatic balancing act over several crates of beer . an anticlimax and while the stage was standing , the performance fell flat .
with all the media hullabaloo leading up to the premiere , one was almost convinced it was going to be something special . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director karl maria brandauer -lrb- left -rrb- and punk rocker campino austrian actor and director klaus maria brandauer assembled a stellar ensemble .
german punk singer campino of the band die toten hosen played the role of mack the knife , king of thieves . gottfried john - known to film buffs from several fassbinder movies and to the rest of the universe as the evil russian general arkadii grigorovich ourumov from james bond 's russian stunt in " golden eye " - played mr. peachum . katrin sass - one of most popular actresses from former east germany , who experienced a pan-german comeback with her touching appearance in the blockbuster hit " good bye , lenin " - added quite a bit of slapstick cheekiness to the role of manipulative alcoholic mrs. peachum . but most of the ensemble appeared helpless in an overly conventional production which lacked both the dramatic gusto and political audacity .
staging the play as an authentic costume drama set in london in the 1920s , brandauer created a sluggish , outdated and all too reverent production which failed to excite let alone provoke . a betrayal of sorts heiner müller said in an interview once that " to use brecht without criticizing him is to betray him . "
turning " the threepenny opera " into a wax museum musical was one such betrayal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit minichmayr -lrb- polly -rrb- and campino -lrb- mack the knife -rrb- the highlight of the evening turned out to be birgit minichmayr 's performance as polly .
the austrian-born actress , who joined berlin 's volksbühne theater in 2004 , after earning her laurels at vienna 's burgtheater , showed once again that she is one of the most exciting young german-speaking actresses today . her polly was both loud and vulnerable , rebellious and scared .
the otherworldly force of her voice , which assumes a subtle huskiness in the higher register , turned her rendering of pirate jenny 's song into a moment of chilling , spectral beauty . sweeping the roads the most contradictory - and most brechtian - moment of the evening happened outside the theater .
the elegant guests were greeted on arrival by a couple of homeless berliners selling a special edition of their newspaper , strassenfeger -lrb- street sweeper -rrb- , entirely dedicated to the new production of " the threepenny opera . "
it is fascinating what kind of advertising a budget of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.5 million -rrb- can get you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katrin sass -lrb- left -rrb- played mrs. peachum with a great sense of humor one after another , the well-off and the extremely well-off couples stopped at the theater entry to buy themselves a copy of strassenfeger .
after all , they all came to watch brecht .
it felt appropriate to get close to the masses .
so they blinded the homeless with their pearly white teeth , and smiled like there was no tomorrow .
it was a spectacle worth of buñuel 's " discreet charm of the bourgeoise . " but those were exactly the kind of people , who - under different , non-theatrical , non-brechtian circumstances - would have looked the other way .
luckily for them , they do n't normally ride the subway that much . brecht in a post-revolutionary age when mack the knife cried out his famous invective - " what is robbing a bank when compared to founding a bank ? " - his words had to come out as petulant rather than subversive , especially to deutsche bank president josef ackermann , one of the most prominent guests at the premiere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandauer 's reading of brecht was too tame and unexciting what 's more , " the threepenny opera " at the admiralspalast was sponsored by deutsche bank - a company that celebrated its record yields of 2.5 billion euros two years ago by firing more than 6,000 people , or every tenth employee . even to brecht - who was himself no stranger to wheelings and dealings of all sorts , and whose austrian passport allowed him to dream his communist dream in east berlin while keeping a bank account in switzerland - the happy artistic collective bringing together a punk rocker and a big banker would have seemed self-defeating . brecht said once that his work was " the swan song of the millennium . "
in brandauer 's no-risk production , brecht 's swan song died a muffled , echoless death . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating bertolt brecht click here for a dw-world.de dossier on brecht 's life and international influence .
a communist in a city of angels he blamed the sunshine in la , which " shriveled up the brains of gifted writers leaving them incapable of anything but film-writing . "
but when brecht himself tried to become a hollywood screenwriter , he failed miserably .

he carped on capitalism and did n't mesh with the gdr - most importantly , he entertained .

" of almost 200 high-ranking members of the bdv … in the years prior to 1982 , more than a third can be found in the members ' index of the nsdap or are in another way tainted , " der spiegel wrote .
" three former general secretaries and several vice-presidents are affected . " the very first president of the bdv , hans krüger , was forced to resign from his post in 1964 due to his nazi past . in an interview with the magazine , the current head of the bdv , erika steinbach , said that simply counting the number of members who were associated in some way with the nazis did not say much . " you have to differentiate whether someone just went along with the nazis or whether they really carried out a role that would be insupportable for an organization , " she said . when the magazine said making this distinction would be the point of an internal investigation , steinbach added while it would surely be " interesting , " such an investigation would " cost money that we do n't have . " " if i had the feeling that there was a bomb waiting to go off underneath the surface , then i would have taken action long ago , " she said .
" but i do n't have the impression that the expellees have a greater number of -lrb- nazi -rrb- perpetrators in their ranks than the rest of the nation .

so far , it had only been known that the author , best known abroad for his 1959 novel " the tin drum , " was conscripted into the german air defense forces . but in his autobiography he also recounted that he tried to join the third reich 's submarine forces when he was 15 years old but was rejected because he was too young .
he said that he was drafted into the elite waffen ss the following year but denied suggestions that he joined willingly . grass , for many years a prominent leftist and pacifist , was wounded in 1945 and sent to an american prisoner of war camp . " i wanted to make clear once again what happened then and above all things concerning me , " he told the newspaper .
" my silence for all these years is one of the reasons why i wrote this book .
it had to come out . " contemporaries disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter kempowski fellow german author walter kempowski was among the first of his grass 's contemporaries to comment , telling the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that the revelation was " a bit late " while grass biographer michael jürgs said he was " personally disappointed " and lamented " the end of a moral authority . " leading literature critic hellmuth karasek criticized the timing but also agreed there was no reason to reproach grass as he had done much in his career and life since the war to inspire people . " the fact he was in the ss at 17 is by itself a misdemeanor - had grass not been one to throw his weight around as a moral authority so much since then , " karasek told german radio .
" if i were cynical , i would say he did not reveal it sooner at the risk of not winning a nobel prize .
do n't misunderstand me : grass deserved the nobel prize more than any other german writer .
but everything now has to be seen in a new light . " joachim fest , a leading historian , told der spiegel magazine : " after 60 years , this confession comes a bit too late .
i ca n't understand how someone who for decades set himself up as a moral authority , a rather smug one , could pull this off . " michael wolffsohn , a prominent military historian , also faulted grass for waiting so long .
grass 's " moralizing , though not his storytelling , life 's work is devalued by his persistent silence , " wolffsohn wrote in the online netzeitung daily . cdu politician demands return of prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 meanwhile , wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union called for grass to return the nobel prize he won for literature in 1999 .
börnsen told the german daily bild that grass should adhere to his own moral standards and " honorably return the prize . " sections of the german press were equally deflated by the admission . " grass 's confession right before the publication of his autobiography leaves behind a bad taste of book promotion , " wrote bild am sonntag newspaper columnist helmut böger .
" even after his admission , grass remains germany 's most important living author .
but he has lost his standing as a moral authority .
he can not be castigated for being a member of the ss ...
but he can be for lying about it for 60 years . " however , ralph giordano , a leading german-jewish writer , said he would not condemn grass and praised his belated confession . " it 's good what günter grass has now done , " giordano said .
" what 's worse than making a mistake is not coming to terms with it .
his example also shows how seducible young people can be . " the muted reactions outside of germany were mostly of displeasure and disappointment . robert fulford , a columnist with canada 's national post , accused grass of hypocrisy . " during his long career as a public man , grass has never passed up a chance to speak out for outspokenness , " he wrote .

" walesa calls for renouncement of citizenship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel peace prize winner lech walesa former polish president lech walesa took an even harder line by demanding that grass renounce his honorary citizenship of gdansk .
grass , who was born in the baltic port of danzig , now the polish city of gdansk , became an honorary citizen of the city in 1993 . " an uncomfortable situation has developed , " walesa , who is also an honorary citizen of gdansk , said in an interview monday with the bild newspaper .
" i do not feel comfortable in that company .
i do not know whether one should consider revoking the title .
if it had been known he was in the ss , he would never have received the honor .
it would be best if he relinquished it himself .

only then , grass claimed , did he start to understand . " i was stupid enough to believe that germans would not do such things and took it all for propaganda , " he said .

so far , it had only been known that the author , best known abroad for his 1959 novel " the tin drum , " was conscripted into the german air defense forces . but in his autobiography he also recounted that he tried to join the third reich 's submarine forces when he was 15 years old but was rejected because he was too young .
he said that he was drafted into the elite waffen ss the following year but denied suggestions that he joined willingly . grass , for many years a prominent leftist and pacifist , was wounded in 1945 and sent to an american prisoner of war camp . " i wanted to make clear once again what happened then and above all things concerning me , " he told the newspaper .
" my silence for all these years is one of the reasons why i wrote this book .
it had to come out . " contemporaries disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter kempowski fellow german author walter kempowski was among the first of his grass 's contemporaries to comment , telling the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that the revelation was " a bit late " while grass biographer michael jürgs said he was " personally disappointed " and lamented " the end of a moral authority . " leading literature critic hellmuth karasek criticized the timing but also agreed there was no reason to reproach grass as he had done much in his career and life since the war to inspire people . " the fact he was in the ss at 17 is by itself a misdemeanor - had grass not been one to throw his weight around as a moral authority so much since then , " karasek told german radio .
" if i were cynical , i would say he did not reveal it sooner at the risk of not winning a nobel prize .
do n't misunderstand me : grass deserved the nobel prize more than any other german writer .
but everything now has to be seen in a new light . " joachim fest , a leading historian , told der spiegel magazine : " after 60 years , this confession comes a bit too late .
i ca n't understand how someone who for decades set himself up as a moral authority , a rather smug one , could pull this off . " michael wolffsohn , a prominent military historian , also faulted grass for waiting so long .
grass 's " moralizing , though not his storytelling , life 's work is devalued by his persistent silence , " wolffsohn wrote in the online netzeitung daily . cdu politician demands return of prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 meanwhile , wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union called for grass to return the nobel prize he won for literature in 1999 .
börnsen told the german daily bild that grass should adhere to his own moral standards and " honorably return the prize . " sections of the german press were equally deflated by the admission . " grass 's confession right before the publication of his autobiography leaves behind a bad taste of book promotion , " wrote bild am sonntag newspaper columnist helmut böger .
" even after his admission , grass remains germany 's most important living author .
but he has lost his standing as a moral authority .
he can not be castigated for being a member of the ss ...
but he can be for lying about it for 60 years . " however , ralph giordano , a leading german-jewish writer , said he would not condemn grass and praised his belated confession . " it 's good what günter grass has now done , " giordano said .
" what 's worse than making a mistake is not coming to terms with it .
his example also shows how seducible young people can be . " the muted reactions outside of germany were mostly of displeasure and disappointment . robert fulford , a columnist with canada 's national post , accused grass of hypocrisy . " during his long career as a public man , grass has never passed up a chance to speak out for outspokenness , " he wrote .
" ' the job of a citizen is to keep his mouth open , ' he liked to say - though not necessarily in all cases , of course . " walesa calls for renouncement of citizenship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel peace prize winner lech walesa former polish president lech walesa took an even harder line by demanding that grass renounce his honorary citizenship of gdansk .
grass , who was born in the baltic port of danzig , now the polish city of gdansk , became an honorary citizen of the city in 1993 . " an uncomfortable situation has developed , " walesa , who is also an honorary citizen of gdansk , said in an interview monday with the bild newspaper .
" i do not feel comfortable in that company .
i do not know whether one should consider revoking the title .
if it had been known he was in the ss , he would never have received the honor .
it would be best if he relinquished it himself . " in his admission , grass said he never fired a shot during his time with the feared elite force whose notoriety he only grasped once his unit had been defeated , when one of his superiors ordered him to get rid of his uniform . nuremberg trials revealed truth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waffen ss was notoriously brutal the feared paramilitary unit was branded a criminal organization at the nuremberg war crimes trials .
only then , grass claimed , did he start to understand . " i was stupid enough to believe that germans would not do such things and took it all for propaganda , " he said .
the revelations of ss brutality at nuremberg trials then caused him " feelings of guilt and shame . " grass has spent the decades since the end of the war demanding that germans come to terms with their nazi past by coming clean on it . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the taboo breaker with his new novel , nobel-prize winner günther grass confronts a subject previously dealt with only by the right wing .

but it 's still a long way to peace , says dw 's peter philipp . after weeks of discussion , the un security council managed to find a formula for a ceasefire in lebanon .
the weapons have been silent since monday morning .
but things are not necessarily that simple : resolution 1701 would not be the first un resolution about the middle east that awakens hopes which it does n't fulfill .
not that the security council had n't tried its best : stopping the recent fighting was significantly more complicated than in other crisis and war situations .
this was no war between two states with regular armed forces , but rather one of those " asymmetrical " conflicts that have started replacing " traditional " wars . the success of the un resolution depends not on the good will of the security council members , but only on the warring parties .
and both parties apparently agreed to it only because they realized that things could n't go on like this any longer . a no-win situation the israeli government does not acknowledge this openly , but it must have realized that it got itself involved in a military adventure that it could n't win at any level : even the strongest army in the region is powerless against the well-equipped and extremely motivated group of local guerillas such as hezbollah .
and it was madness to think that it was possible to defeat or expel hezbollah with air strikes . israel also lost against the people in lebanon who do not support hezbollah : massive israeli attacks on civilians and the infrastructure in the country have cost israel its last bits of sympathy and understanding in lebanon . it was no different internationally .
israel complained that the media reported one-sidedly and that the lebanese suffering was pushed more to the foreground than that of the israelis .
it was pushed to foreground because it was many times bigger and because it was caused by a state whose prime minister only recently claimed that it had the most moral army in the world . hezbollah could n't afford to go on like this but hezbollah must have also begun to realize that it can not afford a war of this kind in the long term .
although they did surprise everybody - the israelis , in particular - with their firmness and endurance , they would have in the long term succumbed to the massive israeli strikes and led lebanon to disaster along the way . even as it is , hezbollah bears the responsibility of having started this war .
but it knew how to present itself as the only resistance group that should be taken seriously .
had the war escalated even further , hezbollah would have probably lost this sympathy bonus from the lebanese people . and now ?
there is a long way from a ceasefire - if it is kept - to permanent peace .
it will surely take several weeks for the lebanese and international forces to replace the israeli troops in southern lebanon .
in the meantime , they will not want to leave the country and hezbollah will also not want to put their arms to rest . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east -lrb- tt -rrb- . peter philipp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates sending soldiers to middle east as a ceasefire to the fighting in lebanon begins to look more likely , the debate over whether germany should take part in international peacekeeping there has divided the country 's politicians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : celebrating bertolt brecht " bertolt brecht 's influence can not be overestimated " bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere a communist in a city of angels culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2006 brandauer 's betrayal of brecht großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the threepenny opera " has been the most talked-about play in berlin this year berlin is in brecht fever .
as the crowning but ultimately disappointing event of the 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , a star-studded production of " the threepenny opera " opened in berlin . the fact that brecht 's " threepenny opera " opened at the admiralspalast in berlin was a little miracle in itself .
the historic building from the beginning of the 20th century , hastily renovated by entrepreneur falk walter , was not deemed safe for public use until the day before the premiere , when city officials finally gave their seal of approval . the media feverishly followed the will-they-or-wo n't-they drama of the most talked-about production of the year .
in the end , all those wires ominously sticking out of the walls , blotches of paint , mops , buckets and vaguely disguised piles of rubble indicated that the building - originally an ice rink and a luxury spa , which then , in the 1920s , became a theater - was and still is a construction site , an unfinished project .
very much like brecht 's revolutionary dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the admiralspalast is still not fully renovated the scent of undried paint - known to cause either mild headaches or mild hallucinations , depending on your age and social status - mixed well with the perfumes of berlin society ladies , while one toilette sign in the theater foyer still pointed to a hole in the wall , covered by a simple wooden board . this hole in the wall - a real metaphoric nowhere - would have been better suited as backdrop for beckett 's " waiting for godot . "
estragon : " shall we go ? "
vladimir : " let 's go . "
stage directions : " they do n't move . " " at least , the stage is standing , " said a bartender before the saturday night performance , offering a glass of champagne to an elderly lady while performing an acrobatic balancing act over several crates of beer . an anticlimax and while the stage was standing , the performance fell flat .
with all the media hullabaloo leading up to the premiere , one was almost convinced it was going to be something special . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director karl maria brandauer -lrb- left -rrb- and punk rocker campino austrian actor and director klaus maria brandauer assembled a stellar ensemble .
german punk singer campino of the band die toten hosen played the role of mack the knife , king of thieves . gottfried john - known to film buffs from several fassbinder movies and to the rest of the universe as the evil russian general arkadii grigorovich ourumov from james bond 's russian stunt in " golden eye " - played mr. peachum . katrin sass - one of most popular actresses from former east germany , who experienced a pan-german comeback with her touching appearance in the blockbuster hit " good bye , lenin " - added quite a bit of slapstick cheekiness to the role of manipulative alcoholic mrs. peachum . but most of the ensemble appeared helpless in an overly conventional production which lacked both the dramatic gusto and political audacity .
staging the play as an authentic costume drama set in london in the 1920s , brandauer created a sluggish , outdated and all too reverent production which failed to excite let alone provoke . a betrayal of sorts heiner müller said in an interview once that " to use brecht without criticizing him is to betray him . "
turning " the threepenny opera " into a wax museum musical was one such betrayal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit minichmayr -lrb- polly -rrb- and campino -lrb- mack the knife -rrb- the highlight of the evening turned out to be birgit minichmayr 's performance as polly .
the austrian-born actress , who joined berlin 's volksbühne theater in 2004 , after earning her laurels at vienna 's burgtheater , showed once again that she is one of the most exciting young german-speaking actresses today . her polly was both loud and vulnerable , rebellious and scared .
the otherworldly force of her voice , which assumes a subtle huskiness in the higher register , turned her rendering of pirate jenny 's song into a moment of chilling , spectral beauty . sweeping the roads the most contradictory - and most brechtian - moment of the evening happened outside the theater .
the elegant guests were greeted on arrival by a couple of homeless berliners selling a special edition of their newspaper , strassenfeger -lrb- street sweeper -rrb- , entirely dedicated to the new production of " the threepenny opera . "
it is fascinating what kind of advertising a budget of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.5 million -rrb- can get you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katrin sass -lrb- left -rrb- played mrs. peachum with a great sense of humor one after another , the well-off and the extremely well-off couples stopped at the theater entry to buy themselves a copy of strassenfeger .
after all , they all came to watch brecht .
it felt appropriate to get close to the masses .
so they blinded the homeless with their pearly white teeth , and smiled like there was no tomorrow .
it was a spectacle worth of buñuel 's " discreet charm of the bourgeoise . " but those were exactly the kind of people , who - under different , non-theatrical , non-brechtian circumstances - would have looked the other way .
luckily for them , they do n't normally ride the subway that much . brecht in a post-revolutionary age when mack the knife cried out his famous invective - " what is robbing a bank when compared to founding a bank ? " - his words had to come out as petulant rather than subversive , especially to deutsche bank president josef ackermann , one of the most prominent guests at the premiere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandauer 's reading of brecht was too tame and unexciting what 's more , " the threepenny opera " at the admiralspalast was sponsored by deutsche bank - a company that celebrated its record yields of 2.5 billion euros two years ago by firing more than 6,000 people , or every tenth employee . even to brecht - who was himself no stranger to wheelings and dealings of all sorts , and whose austrian passport allowed him to dream his communist dream in east berlin while keeping a bank account in switzerland - the happy artistic collective bringing together a punk rocker and a big banker would have seemed self-defeating . brecht said once that his work was " the swan song of the millennium . "
in brandauer 's no-risk production , brecht 's swan song died a muffled , echoless death . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating bertolt brecht click here for a dw-world.de dossier on brecht 's life and international influence .
a communist in a city of angels he blamed the sunshine in la , which " shriveled up the brains of gifted writers leaving them incapable of anything but film-writing . "
but when brecht himself tried to become a hollywood screenwriter , he failed miserably .

so far , it had only been known that the author , best known abroad for his 1959 novel " the tin drum , " was conscripted into the german air defense forces . but in his autobiography he also recounted that he tried to join the third reich 's submarine forces when he was 15 years old but was rejected because he was too young .
he said that he was drafted into the elite waffen ss the following year but denied suggestions that he joined willingly . grass , for many years a prominent leftist and pacifist , was wounded in 1945 and sent to an american prisoner of war camp . " i wanted to make clear once again what happened then and above all things concerning me , " he told the newspaper .
" my silence for all these years is one of the reasons why i wrote this book .
it had to come out . " contemporaries disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter kempowski fellow german author walter kempowski was among the first of his grass 's contemporaries to comment , telling the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that the revelation was " a bit late " while grass biographer michael jürgs said he was " personally disappointed " and lamented " the end of a moral authority . " leading literature critic hellmuth karasek criticized the timing but also agreed there was no reason to reproach grass as he had done much in his career and life since the war to inspire people . " the fact he was in the ss at 17 is by itself a misdemeanor - had grass not been one to throw his weight around as a moral authority so much since then , " karasek told german radio .
" if i were cynical , i would say he did not reveal it sooner at the risk of not winning a nobel prize .
do n't misunderstand me : grass deserved the nobel prize more than any other german writer .
but everything now has to be seen in a new light . " joachim fest , a leading historian , told der spiegel magazine : " after 60 years , this confession comes a bit too late .
i ca n't understand how someone who for decades set himself up as a moral authority , a rather smug one , could pull this off . " michael wolffsohn , a prominent military historian , also faulted grass for waiting so long .
grass 's " moralizing , though not his storytelling , life 's work is devalued by his persistent silence , " wolffsohn wrote in the online netzeitung daily . cdu politician demands return of prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 meanwhile , wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union called for grass to return the nobel prize he won for literature in 1999 .
börnsen told the german daily bild that grass should adhere to his own moral standards and " honorably return the prize . " sections of the german press were equally deflated by the admission . " grass 's confession right before the publication of his autobiography leaves behind a bad taste of book promotion , " wrote bild am sonntag newspaper columnist helmut böger .
" even after his admission , grass remains germany 's most important living author .
but he has lost his standing as a moral authority .
he can not be castigated for being a member of the ss ...
but he can be for lying about it for 60 years . " however , ralph giordano , a leading german-jewish writer , said he would not condemn grass and praised his belated confession . " it 's good what günter grass has now done , " giordano said .
" what 's worse than making a mistake is not coming to terms with it .
his example also shows how seducible young people can be . " the muted reactions outside of germany were mostly of displeasure and disappointment . robert fulford , a columnist with canada 's national post , accused grass of hypocrisy . " during his long career as a public man , grass has never passed up a chance to speak out for outspokenness , " he wrote .
" ' the job of a citizen is to keep his mouth open , ' he liked to say - though not necessarily in all cases , of course . " walesa calls for renouncement of citizenship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel peace prize winner lech walesa former polish president lech walesa took an even harder line by demanding that grass renounce his honorary citizenship of gdansk .
grass , who was born in the baltic port of danzig , now the polish city of gdansk , became an honorary citizen of the city in 1993 . " an uncomfortable situation has developed , " walesa , who is also an honorary citizen of gdansk , said in an interview monday with the bild newspaper .
" i do not feel comfortable in that company .
i do not know whether one should consider revoking the title .
if it had been known he was in the ss , he would never have received the honor .
it would be best if he relinquished it himself . " in his admission , grass said he never fired a shot during his time with the feared elite force whose notoriety he only grasped once his unit had been defeated , when one of his superiors ordered him to get rid of his uniform . nuremberg trials revealed truth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waffen ss was notoriously brutal the feared paramilitary unit was branded a criminal organization at the nuremberg war crimes trials .
only then , grass claimed , did he start to understand . " i was stupid enough to believe that germans would not do such things and took it all for propaganda , " he said .
the revelations of ss brutality at nuremberg trials then caused him " feelings of guilt and shame . " grass has spent the decades since the end of the war demanding that germans come to terms with their nazi past by coming clean on it . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the taboo breaker with his new novel , nobel-prize winner günther grass confronts a subject previously dealt with only by the right wing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : celebrating bertolt brecht " bertolt brecht 's influence can not be overestimated " bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere a communist in a city of angels culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2006 brandauer 's betrayal of brecht großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the threepenny opera " has been the most talked-about play in berlin this year berlin is in brecht fever .
as the crowning but ultimately disappointing event of the 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , a star-studded production of " the threepenny opera " opened in berlin . the fact that brecht 's " threepenny opera " opened at the admiralspalast in berlin was a little miracle in itself .
the historic building from the beginning of the 20th century , hastily renovated by entrepreneur falk walter , was not deemed safe for public use until the day before the premiere , when city officials finally gave their seal of approval . the media feverishly followed the will-they-or-wo n't-they drama of the most talked-about production of the year .
in the end , all those wires ominously sticking out of the walls , blotches of paint , mops , buckets and vaguely disguised piles of rubble indicated that the building - originally an ice rink and a luxury spa , which then , in the 1920s , became a theater - was and still is a construction site , an unfinished project .
very much like brecht 's revolutionary dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the admiralspalast is still not fully renovated the scent of undried paint - known to cause either mild headaches or mild hallucinations , depending on your age and social status - mixed well with the perfumes of berlin society ladies , while one toilette sign in the theater foyer still pointed to a hole in the wall , covered by a simple wooden board . this hole in the wall - a real metaphoric nowhere - would have been better suited as backdrop for beckett 's " waiting for godot . "
estragon : " shall we go ? "
vladimir : " let 's go . "
stage directions : " they do n't move . " " at least , the stage is standing , " said a bartender before the saturday night performance , offering a glass of champagne to an elderly lady while performing an acrobatic balancing act over several crates of beer . an anticlimax and while the stage was standing , the performance fell flat .
with all the media hullabaloo leading up to the premiere , one was almost convinced it was going to be something special . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director karl maria brandauer -lrb- left -rrb- and punk rocker campino austrian actor and director klaus maria brandauer assembled a stellar ensemble .
german punk singer campino of the band die toten hosen played the role of mack the knife , king of thieves . gottfried john - known to film buffs from several fassbinder movies and to the rest of the universe as the evil russian general arkadii grigorovich ourumov from james bond 's russian stunt in " golden eye " - played mr. peachum . katrin sass - one of most popular actresses from former east germany , who experienced a pan-german comeback with her touching appearance in the blockbuster hit " good bye , lenin " - added quite a bit of slapstick cheekiness to the role of manipulative alcoholic mrs. peachum . but most of the ensemble appeared helpless in an overly conventional production which lacked both the dramatic gusto and political audacity .
staging the play as an authentic costume drama set in london in the 1920s , brandauer created a sluggish , outdated and all too reverent production which failed to excite let alone provoke . a betrayal of sorts heiner müller said in an interview once that " to use brecht without criticizing him is to betray him . "
turning " the threepenny opera " into a wax museum musical was one such betrayal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit minichmayr -lrb- polly -rrb- and campino -lrb- mack the knife -rrb- the highlight of the evening turned out to be birgit minichmayr 's performance as polly .
the austrian-born actress , who joined berlin 's volksbühne theater in 2004 , after earning her laurels at vienna 's burgtheater , showed once again that she is one of the most exciting young german-speaking actresses today . her polly was both loud and vulnerable , rebellious and scared .
the otherworldly force of her voice , which assumes a subtle huskiness in the higher register , turned her rendering of pirate jenny 's song into a moment of chilling , spectral beauty . sweeping the roads the most contradictory - and most brechtian - moment of the evening happened outside the theater .
the elegant guests were greeted on arrival by a couple of homeless berliners selling a special edition of their newspaper , strassenfeger -lrb- street sweeper -rrb- , entirely dedicated to the new production of " the threepenny opera . "
it is fascinating what kind of advertising a budget of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.5 million -rrb- can get you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katrin sass -lrb- left -rrb- played mrs. peachum with a great sense of humor one after another , the well-off and the extremely well-off couples stopped at the theater entry to buy themselves a copy of strassenfeger .
after all , they all came to watch brecht .
it felt appropriate to get close to the masses .
so they blinded the homeless with their pearly white teeth , and smiled like there was no tomorrow .
it was a spectacle worth of buñuel 's " discreet charm of the bourgeoise . " but those were exactly the kind of people , who - under different , non-theatrical , non-brechtian circumstances - would have looked the other way .
luckily for them , they do n't normally ride the subway that much . brecht in a post-revolutionary age when mack the knife cried out his famous invective - " what is robbing a bank when compared to founding a bank ? " - his words had to come out as petulant rather than subversive , especially to deutsche bank president josef ackermann , one of the most prominent guests at the premiere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandauer 's reading of brecht was too tame and unexciting what 's more , " the threepenny opera " at the admiralspalast was sponsored by deutsche bank - a company that celebrated its record yields of 2.5 billion euros two years ago by firing more than 6,000 people , or every tenth employee . even to brecht - who was himself no stranger to wheelings and dealings of all sorts , and whose austrian passport allowed him to dream his communist dream in east berlin while keeping a bank account in switzerland - the happy artistic collective bringing together a punk rocker and a big banker would have seemed self-defeating . brecht said once that his work was " the swan song of the millennium . "
in brandauer 's no-risk production , brecht 's swan song died a muffled , echoless death . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating bertolt brecht click here for a dw-world.de dossier on brecht 's life and international influence .

one homeless association in munich is taking that perception even further by actually turning a corrective facility into a four star establishment . the organization behind biss magazine , a publication sold on the streets of the bavarian city by munich 's homeless , is looking to buy the women 's and young offender 's prison in the neudeck area and turn it into a luxury hotel .
the building is likely to cost biss in the region of 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 638,650 -rrb- . biss is looking to invest between 13 and 14 million euros in the project which will turn the prison into a 66-room establishment with an adjoining complex of 14 senior citizen apartments . city 's homeless to staff hotel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biss hopes to give homeless people a chance to find employment - and accomodation - at the hotel the association hopes to employ between 25 and 40 homeless people as staff in the hotel , providing them with the means to afford their own accommodation . the current prison population will be moved to a new facility in 2008 , leaving the 6,000-square-meter -lrb- 64,500 square feet -rrb- building up for grabs .
if the prison building is not given over to any official state government department , it will be made available on the open public market , leaving the way free for biss to acquire the property . the organization has already hired a design team to draw up plans for the possible make-over .

but experts are n't sure how long the boom can last . the german economy , the biggest in the 12-country euro zone , is growing at its fastest rate since the dot.com boom five years ago , data showed on monday .
the growth can be attributed in part to increased construction spending and booming company profits . germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter of this year compared with the first quarter , federal statistics office destatis said in a statement . that represented an acceleration from the 0.7 percent growth rate in the preceding three months and was the fastest rate of growth since the first quarter of 2001 . data from the eu 's eurostat data agency showed monday that german expansion had helped the euro zone economy to hit its fastest rate of growth in six years in the second quarter . domestic growth stimuli bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup in germany brought in fans - and a few extra euros this time , growth in germany was not solely export-driven , as it had been in previous economic upturns in the country . " growth impulses are coming primarily from inside germany , " destatis said .
" while the momentum of foreign trade has weakened , it was primarily investment in construction and equipment that contributed to the economic pick-up in the second quarter . " over 12 months , growth measured one percent in the second quarter because of differences in the number of working days .
when adjusted for working days , growth was at 2.4 percent . the unseasonably warm weather helped boost activity in outdoor sectors such as the construction industry and companies are investing their record-high profits in new plants and equipment . world cup and upcoming vat increase the world cup soccer championships , held in germany in june and july , also provided a boost to consumer spending , a sector had previously held back the development of a broad-based recovery in germany . furthermore , households are bringing forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the planned rise in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent , which will take effect in january . the ministry of economy in berlin hailed the second-quarter gdp data as proof that the economic gridlock of recent years had finally been lifted . " the recovery has gained in breadth and strength , " said economy minister michael glos .
" the situation on the labor market has improved noticeably .
the outlook for this year is decidedly positive . " the dihk federation of german chambers of commerce agreed . " our forecast for full-year growth of up to two percent is within reach , " dihk president martin wansleben added . growth across the euro zone other euro zone countries , such as france and the netherlands , have similarly beaten growth expectations for the second quarter , suggesting that the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- may have to revise its own growth forecasts for the entire euro area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : value-added tax will jump from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 the euro zone expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter , separate data published by the eu 's statistics office eurostat showed on monday .
the expansion of the euro zone economy added to the arguments for further interest rate hikes by the ecb . the ecb 's benchmark refinancing rate currently stands at 3 percent and is expected to rise to 3.5 percent by the end of this year in order to keep a lid on inflation in the 12 countries that share the euro . " the german gdp data are almost too good to be true , " said bank of america economist holger schmieding .
" in less than two years , germany seems to have turned from the sick man of europe into one of the old continent 's ' wunderkinder . " ' some say euro zone growth to start losing steam however , some analysts were skeptical about whether the german economy would be able to maintain the same momentum during the coming months given the planned rise in vat , which experts believe will put the brakes on consumer demand next year . " the weather-driven rebound in second-quarter construction will not be repeated in the third quarter , " said schmieding at bank of america .
" retail sales may recede after the world cup effect in may and june " and the vat increase will be also provide a temporary hit to activity . the european commission in brussels also predicted that euro zone growth would probably start losing steam soon , with analysts pointing the finger at the stronger euro , slowing global growth , high oil prices , higher interest rates and tighter fiscal policy . in germany , dihk similarly warned that german growth may soon pass its zenith , not least because of the vat hike and the one-off nature of the world cup effect . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european central bank raises rates on inflation fears the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- raised the key euro-zone interest rate by a quarter point to 3.0 percent on thursday , making borrowing costs the highest in three-and-a-half years in order to curb inflation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 14.08.2006 opinion : " it 's a long way to peace " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in accordance with un resolution 1701 , a ceasefire in the conflict between israel and hezbollah in lebanon came into effect on monday morning .
but it 's still a long way to peace , says dw 's peter philipp . after weeks of discussion , the un security council managed to find a formula for a ceasefire in lebanon .
the weapons have been silent since monday morning .
but things are not necessarily that simple : resolution 1701 would not be the first un resolution about the middle east that awakens hopes which it does n't fulfill .
not that the security council had n't tried its best : stopping the recent fighting was significantly more complicated than in other crisis and war situations .
this was no war between two states with regular armed forces , but rather one of those " asymmetrical " conflicts that have started replacing " traditional " wars . the success of the un resolution depends not on the good will of the security council members , but only on the warring parties .
and both parties apparently agreed to it only because they realized that things could n't go on like this any longer . a no-win situation the israeli government does not acknowledge this openly , but it must have realized that it got itself involved in a military adventure that it could n't win at any level : even the strongest army in the region is powerless against the well-equipped and extremely motivated group of local guerillas such as hezbollah .
and it was madness to think that it was possible to defeat or expel hezbollah with air strikes . israel also lost against the people in lebanon who do not support hezbollah : massive israeli attacks on civilians and the infrastructure in the country have cost israel its last bits of sympathy and understanding in lebanon . it was no different internationally .
israel complained that the media reported one-sidedly and that the lebanese suffering was pushed more to the foreground than that of the israelis .
it was pushed to foreground because it was many times bigger and because it was caused by a state whose prime minister only recently claimed that it had the most moral army in the world . hezbollah could n't afford to go on like this but hezbollah must have also begun to realize that it can not afford a war of this kind in the long term .
although they did surprise everybody - the israelis , in particular - with their firmness and endurance , they would have in the long term succumbed to the massive israeli strikes and led lebanon to disaster along the way . even as it is , hezbollah bears the responsibility of having started this war .
but it knew how to present itself as the only resistance group that should be taken seriously .
had the war escalated even further , hezbollah would have probably lost this sympathy bonus from the lebanese people . and now ?
there is a long way from a ceasefire - if it is kept - to permanent peace .
it will surely take several weeks for the lebanese and international forces to replace the israeli troops in southern lebanon .
in the meantime , they will not want to leave the country and hezbollah will also not want to put their arms to rest . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east -lrb- tt -rrb- . peter philipp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates sending soldiers to middle east as a ceasefire to the fighting in lebanon begins to look more likely , the debate over whether germany should take part in international peacekeeping there has divided the country 's politicians .

" growth impulses are coming primarily from inside germany , " destatis said .
" while the momentum of foreign trade has weakened , it was primarily investment in construction and equipment that contributed to the economic pick-up in the second quarter . " over 12 months , growth measured one percent in the second quarter because of differences in the number of working days .
when adjusted for working days , growth was at 2.4 percent . the unseasonably warm weather helped boost activity in outdoor sectors such as the construction industry and companies are investing their record-high profits in new plants and equipment . world cup and upcoming vat increase the world cup soccer championships , held in germany in june and july , also provided a boost to consumer spending , a sector had previously held back the development of a broad-based recovery in germany . furthermore , households are bringing forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the planned rise in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent , which will take effect in january . the ministry of economy in berlin hailed the second-quarter gdp data as proof that the economic gridlock of recent years had finally been lifted .

the expansion of the euro zone economy added to the arguments for further interest rate hikes by the ecb . the ecb 's benchmark refinancing rate currently stands at 3 percent and is expected to rise to 3.5 percent by the end of this year in order to keep a lid on inflation in the 12 countries that share the euro .

one homeless association in munich is taking that perception even further by actually turning a corrective facility into a four star establishment . the organization behind biss magazine , a publication sold on the streets of the bavarian city by munich 's homeless , is looking to buy the women 's and young offender 's prison in the neudeck area and turn it into a luxury hotel .
the building is likely to cost biss in the region of 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 638,650 -rrb- . biss is looking to invest between 13 and 14 million euros in the project which will turn the prison into a 66-room establishment with an adjoining complex of 14 senior citizen apartments . city 's homeless to staff hotel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biss hopes to give homeless people a chance to find employment - and accomodation - at the hotel the association hopes to employ between 25 and 40 homeless people as staff in the hotel , providing them with the means to afford their own accommodation . the current prison population will be moved to a new facility in 2008 , leaving the 6,000-square-meter -lrb- 64,500 square feet -rrb- building up for grabs .
if the prison building is not given over to any official state government department , it will be made available on the open public market , leaving the way free for biss to acquire the property . the organization has already hired a design team to draw up plans for the possible make-over .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : celebrating bertolt brecht " bertolt brecht 's influence can not be overestimated " bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere a communist in a city of angels culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2006 brandauer 's betrayal of brecht großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the threepenny opera " has been the most talked-about play in berlin this year berlin is in brecht fever .
as the crowning but ultimately disappointing event of the 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , a star-studded production of " the threepenny opera " opened in berlin . the fact that brecht 's " threepenny opera " opened at the admiralspalast in berlin was a little miracle in itself .
the historic building from the beginning of the 20th century , hastily renovated by entrepreneur falk walter , was not deemed safe for public use until the day before the premiere , when city officials finally gave their seal of approval . the media feverishly followed the will-they-or-wo n't-they drama of the most talked-about production of the year .
in the end , all those wires ominously sticking out of the walls , blotches of paint , mops , buckets and vaguely disguised piles of rubble indicated that the building - originally an ice rink and a luxury spa , which then , in the 1920s , became a theater - was and still is a construction site , an unfinished project .
very much like brecht 's revolutionary dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the admiralspalast is still not fully renovated the scent of undried paint - known to cause either mild headaches or mild hallucinations , depending on your age and social status - mixed well with the perfumes of berlin society ladies , while one toilette sign in the theater foyer still pointed to a hole in the wall , covered by a simple wooden board . this hole in the wall - a real metaphoric nowhere - would have been better suited as backdrop for beckett 's " waiting for godot . "
estragon : " shall we go ? "
vladimir : " let 's go . "
stage directions : " they do n't move . " " at least , the stage is standing , " said a bartender before the saturday night performance , offering a glass of champagne to an elderly lady while performing an acrobatic balancing act over several crates of beer . an anticlimax and while the stage was standing , the performance fell flat .
with all the media hullabaloo leading up to the premiere , one was almost convinced it was going to be something special . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director karl maria brandauer -lrb- left -rrb- and punk rocker campino austrian actor and director klaus maria brandauer assembled a stellar ensemble .
german punk singer campino of the band die toten hosen played the role of mack the knife , king of thieves . gottfried john - known to film buffs from several fassbinder movies and to the rest of the universe as the evil russian general arkadii grigorovich ourumov from james bond 's russian stunt in " golden eye " - played mr. peachum . katrin sass - one of most popular actresses from former east germany , who experienced a pan-german comeback with her touching appearance in the blockbuster hit " good bye , lenin " - added quite a bit of slapstick cheekiness to the role of manipulative alcoholic mrs. peachum . but most of the ensemble appeared helpless in an overly conventional production which lacked both the dramatic gusto and political audacity .
staging the play as an authentic costume drama set in london in the 1920s , brandauer created a sluggish , outdated and all too reverent production which failed to excite let alone provoke . a betrayal of sorts heiner müller said in an interview once that " to use brecht without criticizing him is to betray him . "
turning " the threepenny opera " into a wax museum musical was one such betrayal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit minichmayr -lrb- polly -rrb- and campino -lrb- mack the knife -rrb- the highlight of the evening turned out to be birgit minichmayr 's performance as polly .
the austrian-born actress , who joined berlin 's volksbühne theater in 2004 , after earning her laurels at vienna 's burgtheater , showed once again that she is one of the most exciting young german-speaking actresses today . her polly was both loud and vulnerable , rebellious and scared .

as the crowning but ultimately disappointing event of the 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , a star-studded production of " the threepenny opera " opened in berlin . the fact that brecht 's " threepenny opera " opened at the admiralspalast in berlin was a little miracle in itself .
the historic building from the beginning of the 20th century , hastily renovated by entrepreneur falk walter , was not deemed safe for public use until the day before the premiere , when city officials finally gave their seal of approval . the media feverishly followed the will-they-or-wo n't-they drama of the most talked-about production of the year .
in the end , all those wires ominously sticking out of the walls , blotches of paint , mops , buckets and vaguely disguised piles of rubble indicated that the building - originally an ice rink and a luxury spa , which then , in the 1920s , became a theater - was and still is a construction site , an unfinished project .
very much like brecht 's revolutionary dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the admiralspalast is still not fully renovated the scent of undried paint - known to cause either mild headaches or mild hallucinations , depending on your age and social status - mixed well with the perfumes of berlin society ladies , while one toilette sign in the theater foyer still pointed to a hole in the wall , covered by a simple wooden board . this hole in the wall - a real metaphoric nowhere - would have been better suited as backdrop for beckett 's " waiting for godot . "
estragon : " shall we go ? "
vladimir : " let 's go . "
stage directions : " they do n't move . " " at least , the stage is standing , " said a bartender before the saturday night performance , offering a glass of champagne to an elderly lady while performing an acrobatic balancing act over several crates of beer . an anticlimax and while the stage was standing , the performance fell flat .
with all the media hullabaloo leading up to the premiere , one was almost convinced it was going to be something special . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director karl maria brandauer -lrb- left -rrb- and punk rocker campino austrian actor and director klaus maria brandauer assembled a stellar ensemble .
german punk singer campino of the band die toten hosen played the role of mack the knife , king of thieves . gottfried john - known to film buffs from several fassbinder movies and to the rest of the universe as the evil russian general arkadii grigorovich ourumov from james bond 's russian stunt in " golden eye " - played mr. peachum . katrin sass - one of most popular actresses from former east germany , who experienced a pan-german comeback with her touching appearance in the blockbuster hit " good bye , lenin " - added quite a bit of slapstick cheekiness to the role of manipulative alcoholic mrs. peachum . but most of the ensemble appeared helpless in an overly conventional production which lacked both the dramatic gusto and political audacity .
staging the play as an authentic costume drama set in london in the 1920s , brandauer created a sluggish , outdated and all too reverent production which failed to excite let alone provoke . a betrayal of sorts heiner müller said in an interview once that " to use brecht without criticizing him is to betray him . "
turning " the threepenny opera " into a wax museum musical was one such betrayal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit minichmayr -lrb- polly -rrb- and campino -lrb- mack the knife -rrb- the highlight of the evening turned out to be birgit minichmayr 's performance as polly .
the austrian-born actress , who joined berlin 's volksbühne theater in 2004 , after earning her laurels at vienna 's burgtheater , showed once again that she is one of the most exciting young german-speaking actresses today . her polly was both loud and vulnerable , rebellious and scared .

as the crowning but ultimately disappointing event of the 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , a star-studded production of " the threepenny opera " opened in berlin . the fact that brecht 's " threepenny opera " opened at the admiralspalast in berlin was a little miracle in itself .
the historic building from the beginning of the 20th century , hastily renovated by entrepreneur falk walter , was not deemed safe for public use until the day before the premiere , when city officials finally gave their seal of approval . the media feverishly followed the will-they-or-wo n't-they drama of the most talked-about production of the year .
in the end , all those wires ominously sticking out of the walls , blotches of paint , mops , buckets and vaguely disguised piles of rubble indicated that the building - originally an ice rink and a luxury spa , which then , in the 1920s , became a theater - was and still is a construction site , an unfinished project .
very much like brecht 's revolutionary dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the admiralspalast is still not fully renovated the scent of undried paint - known to cause either mild headaches or mild hallucinations , depending on your age and social status - mixed well with the perfumes of berlin society ladies , while one toilette sign in the theater foyer still pointed to a hole in the wall , covered by a simple wooden board . this hole in the wall - a real metaphoric nowhere - would have been better suited as backdrop for beckett 's " waiting for godot . "
estragon : " shall we go ? "
vladimir : " let 's go . "
stage directions : " they do n't move . " " at least , the stage is standing , " said a bartender before the saturday night performance , offering a glass of champagne to an elderly lady while performing an acrobatic balancing act over several crates of beer . an anticlimax and while the stage was standing , the performance fell flat .
with all the media hullabaloo leading up to the premiere , one was almost convinced it was going to be something special . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director karl maria brandauer -lrb- left -rrb- and punk rocker campino austrian actor and director klaus maria brandauer assembled a stellar ensemble .
german punk singer campino of the band die toten hosen played the role of mack the knife , king of thieves . gottfried john - known to film buffs from several fassbinder movies and to the rest of the universe as the evil russian general arkadii grigorovich ourumov from james bond 's russian stunt in " golden eye " - played mr. peachum . katrin sass - one of most popular actresses from former east germany , who experienced a pan-german comeback with her touching appearance in the blockbuster hit " good bye , lenin " - added quite a bit of slapstick cheekiness to the role of manipulative alcoholic mrs. peachum . but most of the ensemble appeared helpless in an overly conventional production which lacked both the dramatic gusto and political audacity .
staging the play as an authentic costume drama set in london in the 1920s , brandauer created a sluggish , outdated and all too reverent production which failed to excite let alone provoke . a betrayal of sorts heiner müller said in an interview once that " to use brecht without criticizing him is to betray him . "
turning " the threepenny opera " into a wax museum musical was one such betrayal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit minichmayr -lrb- polly -rrb- and campino -lrb- mack the knife -rrb- the highlight of the evening turned out to be birgit minichmayr 's performance as polly .
the austrian-born actress , who joined berlin 's volksbühne theater in 2004 , after earning her laurels at vienna 's burgtheater , showed once again that she is one of the most exciting young german-speaking actresses today . her polly was both loud and vulnerable , rebellious and scared .
the otherworldly force of her voice , which assumes a subtle huskiness in the higher register , turned her rendering of pirate jenny 's song into a moment of chilling , spectral beauty . sweeping the roads the most contradictory - and most brechtian - moment of the evening happened outside the theater .
the elegant guests were greeted on arrival by a couple of homeless berliners selling a special edition of their newspaper , strassenfeger -lrb- street sweeper -rrb- , entirely dedicated to the new production of " the threepenny opera . "
it is fascinating what kind of advertising a budget of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.5 million -rrb- can get you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katrin sass -lrb- left -rrb- played mrs. peachum with a great sense of humor one after another , the well-off and the extremely well-off couples stopped at the theater entry to buy themselves a copy of strassenfeger .
after all , they all came to watch brecht .
it felt appropriate to get close to the masses .
so they blinded the homeless with their pearly white teeth , and smiled like there was no tomorrow .
it was a spectacle worth of buñuel 's " discreet charm of the bourgeoise . " but those were exactly the kind of people , who - under different , non-theatrical , non-brechtian circumstances - would have looked the other way .
luckily for them , they do n't normally ride the subway that much . brecht in a post-revolutionary age when mack the knife cried out his famous invective - " what is robbing a bank when compared to founding a bank ? " - his words had to come out as petulant rather than subversive , especially to deutsche bank president josef ackermann , one of the most prominent guests at the premiere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandauer 's reading of brecht was too tame and unexciting what 's more , " the threepenny opera " at the admiralspalast was sponsored by deutsche bank - a company that celebrated its record yields of 2.5 billion euros two years ago by firing more than 6,000 people , or every tenth employee . even to brecht - who was himself no stranger to wheelings and dealings of all sorts , and whose austrian passport allowed him to dream his communist dream in east berlin while keeping a bank account in switzerland - the happy artistic collective bringing together a punk rocker and a big banker would have seemed self-defeating . brecht said once that his work was " the swan song of the millennium .

" of almost 200 high-ranking members of the bdv … in the years prior to 1982 , more than a third can be found in the members ' index of the nsdap or are in another way tainted , " der spiegel wrote .
" three former general secretaries and several vice-presidents are affected . " the very first president of the bdv , hans krüger , was forced to resign from his post in 1964 due to his nazi past . in an interview with the magazine , the current head of the bdv , erika steinbach , said that simply counting the number of members who were associated in some way with the nazis did not say much . " you have to differentiate whether someone just went along with the nazis or whether they really carried out a role that would be insupportable for an organization , " she said . when the magazine said making this distinction would be the point of an internal investigation , steinbach added while it would surely be " interesting , " such an investigation would " cost money that we do n't have . " " if i had the feeling that there was a bomb waiting to go off underneath the surface , then i would have taken action long ago , " she said .
" but i do n't have the impression that the expellees have a greater number of -lrb- nazi -rrb- perpetrators in their ranks than the rest of the nation .

so far , it had only been known that the author , best known abroad for his 1959 novel " the tin drum , " was conscripted into the german air defense forces . but in his autobiography he also recounted that he tried to join the third reich 's submarine forces when he was 15 years old but was rejected because he was too young .
he said that he was drafted into the elite waffen ss the following year but denied suggestions that he joined willingly . grass , for many years a prominent leftist and pacifist , was wounded in 1945 and sent to an american prisoner of war camp . " i wanted to make clear once again what happened then and above all things concerning me , " he told the newspaper .
" my silence for all these years is one of the reasons why i wrote this book .
it had to come out . " contemporaries disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter kempowski fellow german author walter kempowski was among the first of his grass 's contemporaries to comment , telling the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that the revelation was " a bit late " while grass biographer michael jürgs said he was " personally disappointed " and lamented " the end of a moral authority . " leading literature critic hellmuth karasek criticized the timing but also agreed there was no reason to reproach grass as he had done much in his career and life since the war to inspire people . " the fact he was in the ss at 17 is by itself a misdemeanor - had grass not been one to throw his weight around as a moral authority so much since then , " karasek told german radio .
" if i were cynical , i would say he did not reveal it sooner at the risk of not winning a nobel prize .
do n't misunderstand me : grass deserved the nobel prize more than any other german writer .
but everything now has to be seen in a new light . " joachim fest , a leading historian , told der spiegel magazine : " after 60 years , this confession comes a bit too late .
i ca n't understand how someone who for decades set himself up as a moral authority , a rather smug one , could pull this off . " michael wolffsohn , a prominent military historian , also faulted grass for waiting so long .
grass 's " moralizing , though not his storytelling , life 's work is devalued by his persistent silence , " wolffsohn wrote in the online netzeitung daily . cdu politician demands return of prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 meanwhile , wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union called for grass to return the nobel prize he won for literature in 1999 .
börnsen told the german daily bild that grass should adhere to his own moral standards and " honorably return the prize . " sections of the german press were equally deflated by the admission . " grass 's confession right before the publication of his autobiography leaves behind a bad taste of book promotion , " wrote bild am sonntag newspaper columnist helmut böger .
" even after his admission , grass remains germany 's most important living author .
but he has lost his standing as a moral authority .
he can not be castigated for being a member of the ss ...
but he can be for lying about it for 60 years . " however , ralph giordano , a leading german-jewish writer , said he would not condemn grass and praised his belated confession . " it 's good what günter grass has now done , " giordano said .
" what 's worse than making a mistake is not coming to terms with it .
his example also shows how seducible young people can be . " the muted reactions outside of germany were mostly of displeasure and disappointment . robert fulford , a columnist with canada 's national post , accused grass of hypocrisy . " during his long career as a public man , grass has never passed up a chance to speak out for outspokenness , " he wrote .
" ' the job of a citizen is to keep his mouth open , ' he liked to say - though not necessarily in all cases , of course . " walesa calls for renouncement of citizenship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel peace prize winner lech walesa former polish president lech walesa took an even harder line by demanding that grass renounce his honorary citizenship of gdansk .
grass , who was born in the baltic port of danzig , now the polish city of gdansk , became an honorary citizen of the city in 1993 . " an uncomfortable situation has developed , " walesa , who is also an honorary citizen of gdansk , said in an interview monday with the bild newspaper .
" i do not feel comfortable in that company .
i do not know whether one should consider revoking the title .
if it had been known he was in the ss , he would never have received the honor .
it would be best if he relinquished it himself . " in his admission , grass said he never fired a shot during his time with the feared elite force whose notoriety he only grasped once his unit had been defeated , when one of his superiors ordered him to get rid of his uniform . nuremberg trials revealed truth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waffen ss was notoriously brutal the feared paramilitary unit was branded a criminal organization at the nuremberg war crimes trials .
only then , grass claimed , did he start to understand . " i was stupid enough to believe that germans would not do such things and took it all for propaganda , " he said .

so far , it had only been known that the author , best known abroad for his 1959 novel " the tin drum , " was conscripted into the german air defense forces . but in his autobiography he also recounted that he tried to join the third reich 's submarine forces when he was 15 years old but was rejected because he was too young .
he said that he was drafted into the elite waffen ss the following year but denied suggestions that he joined willingly . grass , for many years a prominent leftist and pacifist , was wounded in 1945 and sent to an american prisoner of war camp . " i wanted to make clear once again what happened then and above all things concerning me , " he told the newspaper .
" my silence for all these years is one of the reasons why i wrote this book .
it had to come out . " contemporaries disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter kempowski fellow german author walter kempowski was among the first of his grass 's contemporaries to comment , telling the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that the revelation was " a bit late " while grass biographer michael jürgs said he was " personally disappointed " and lamented " the end of a moral authority . " leading literature critic hellmuth karasek criticized the timing but also agreed there was no reason to reproach grass as he had done much in his career and life since the war to inspire people . " the fact he was in the ss at 17 is by itself a misdemeanor - had grass not been one to throw his weight around as a moral authority so much since then , " karasek told german radio .
" if i were cynical , i would say he did not reveal it sooner at the risk of not winning a nobel prize .
do n't misunderstand me : grass deserved the nobel prize more than any other german writer .
but everything now has to be seen in a new light . " joachim fest , a leading historian , told der spiegel magazine : " after 60 years , this confession comes a bit too late .
i ca n't understand how someone who for decades set himself up as a moral authority , a rather smug one , could pull this off . " michael wolffsohn , a prominent military historian , also faulted grass for waiting so long .
grass 's " moralizing , though not his storytelling , life 's work is devalued by his persistent silence , " wolffsohn wrote in the online netzeitung daily . cdu politician demands return of prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 meanwhile , wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union called for grass to return the nobel prize he won for literature in 1999 .
börnsen told the german daily bild that grass should adhere to his own moral standards and " honorably return the prize . " sections of the german press were equally deflated by the admission . " grass 's confession right before the publication of his autobiography leaves behind a bad taste of book promotion , " wrote bild am sonntag newspaper columnist helmut böger .
" even after his admission , grass remains germany 's most important living author .
but he has lost his standing as a moral authority .
he can not be castigated for being a member of the ss ...
but he can be for lying about it for 60 years . " however , ralph giordano , a leading german-jewish writer , said he would not condemn grass and praised his belated confession . " it 's good what günter grass has now done , " giordano said .
" what 's worse than making a mistake is not coming to terms with it .
his example also shows how seducible young people can be . " the muted reactions outside of germany were mostly of displeasure and disappointment . robert fulford , a columnist with canada 's national post , accused grass of hypocrisy . " during his long career as a public man , grass has never passed up a chance to speak out for outspokenness , " he wrote .
" ' the job of a citizen is to keep his mouth open , ' he liked to say - though not necessarily in all cases , of course . " walesa calls for renouncement of citizenship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel peace prize winner lech walesa former polish president lech walesa took an even harder line by demanding that grass renounce his honorary citizenship of gdansk .
grass , who was born in the baltic port of danzig , now the polish city of gdansk , became an honorary citizen of the city in 1993 . " an uncomfortable situation has developed , " walesa , who is also an honorary citizen of gdansk , said in an interview monday with the bild newspaper .
" i do not feel comfortable in that company .
i do not know whether one should consider revoking the title .
if it had been known he was in the ss , he would never have received the honor .
it would be best if he relinquished it himself .

only then , grass claimed , did he start to understand . " i was stupid enough to believe that germans would not do such things and took it all for propaganda , " he said .

but it 's still a long way to peace , says dw 's peter philipp . after weeks of discussion , the un security council managed to find a formula for a ceasefire in lebanon .
the weapons have been silent since monday morning .
but things are not necessarily that simple : resolution 1701 would not be the first un resolution about the middle east that awakens hopes which it does n't fulfill .
not that the security council had n't tried its best : stopping the recent fighting was significantly more complicated than in other crisis and war situations .
this was no war between two states with regular armed forces , but rather one of those " asymmetrical " conflicts that have started replacing " traditional " wars . the success of the un resolution depends not on the good will of the security council members , but only on the warring parties .
and both parties apparently agreed to it only because they realized that things could n't go on like this any longer . a no-win situation the israeli government does not acknowledge this openly , but it must have realized that it got itself involved in a military adventure that it could n't win at any level : even the strongest army in the region is powerless against the well-equipped and extremely motivated group of local guerillas such as hezbollah .
and it was madness to think that it was possible to defeat or expel hezbollah with air strikes . israel also lost against the people in lebanon who do not support hezbollah : massive israeli attacks on civilians and the infrastructure in the country have cost israel its last bits of sympathy and understanding in lebanon . it was no different internationally .
israel complained that the media reported one-sidedly and that the lebanese suffering was pushed more to the foreground than that of the israelis .
it was pushed to foreground because it was many times bigger and because it was caused by a state whose prime minister only recently claimed that it had the most moral army in the world . hezbollah could n't afford to go on like this but hezbollah must have also begun to realize that it can not afford a war of this kind in the long term .
although they did surprise everybody - the israelis , in particular - with their firmness and endurance , they would have in the long term succumbed to the massive israeli strikes and led lebanon to disaster along the way . even as it is , hezbollah bears the responsibility of having started this war .
but it knew how to present itself as the only resistance group that should be taken seriously .
had the war escalated even further , hezbollah would have probably lost this sympathy bonus from the lebanese people . and now ?
there is a long way from a ceasefire - if it is kept - to permanent peace .
it will surely take several weeks for the lebanese and international forces to replace the israeli troops in southern lebanon .
in the meantime , they will not want to leave the country and hezbollah will also not want to put their arms to rest . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east -lrb- tt -rrb- . peter philipp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates sending soldiers to middle east as a ceasefire to the fighting in lebanon begins to look more likely , the debate over whether germany should take part in international peacekeeping there has divided the country 's politicians .

but it 's still a long way to peace , says dw 's peter philipp . after weeks of discussion , the un security council managed to find a formula for a ceasefire in lebanon .
the weapons have been silent since monday morning .
but things are not necessarily that simple : resolution 1701 would not be the first un resolution about the middle east that awakens hopes which it does n't fulfill .
not that the security council had n't tried its best : stopping the recent fighting was significantly more complicated than in other crisis and war situations .
this was no war between two states with regular armed forces , but rather one of those " asymmetrical " conflicts that have started replacing " traditional " wars . the success of the un resolution depends not on the good will of the security council members , but only on the warring parties .
and both parties apparently agreed to it only because they realized that things could n't go on like this any longer . a no-win situation the israeli government does not acknowledge this openly , but it must have realized that it got itself involved in a military adventure that it could n't win at any level : even the strongest army in the region is powerless against the well-equipped and extremely motivated group of local guerillas such as hezbollah .
and it was madness to think that it was possible to defeat or expel hezbollah with air strikes . israel also lost against the people in lebanon who do not support hezbollah : massive israeli attacks on civilians and the infrastructure in the country have cost israel its last bits of sympathy and understanding in lebanon . it was no different internationally .
israel complained that the media reported one-sidedly and that the lebanese suffering was pushed more to the foreground than that of the israelis .
it was pushed to foreground because it was many times bigger and because it was caused by a state whose prime minister only recently claimed that it had the most moral army in the world . hezbollah could n't afford to go on like this but hezbollah must have also begun to realize that it can not afford a war of this kind in the long term .
although they did surprise everybody - the israelis , in particular - with their firmness and endurance , they would have in the long term succumbed to the massive israeli strikes and led lebanon to disaster along the way . even as it is , hezbollah bears the responsibility of having started this war .
but it knew how to present itself as the only resistance group that should be taken seriously .
had the war escalated even further , hezbollah would have probably lost this sympathy bonus from the lebanese people . and now ?
there is a long way from a ceasefire - if it is kept - to permanent peace .
it will surely take several weeks for the lebanese and international forces to replace the israeli troops in southern lebanon .
in the meantime , they will not want to leave the country and hezbollah will also not want to put their arms to rest . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east -lrb- tt -rrb- . peter philipp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates sending soldiers to middle east as a ceasefire to the fighting in lebanon begins to look more likely , the debate over whether germany should take part in international peacekeeping there has divided the country 's politicians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.08.2006 growth in germany tops five-year high in second quarter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extra summer sunshine boosted economic growth in outdoor sectors warm weather , the world cup , vat increases in 2007 and swelling corporate profits are a few reasons why germany 's economy reached a record high last quarter .
but experts are n't sure how long the boom can last . the german economy , the biggest in the 12-country euro zone , is growing at its fastest rate since the dot.com boom five years ago , data showed on monday .
the growth can be attributed in part to increased construction spending and booming company profits . germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter of this year compared with the first quarter , federal statistics office destatis said in a statement . that represented an acceleration from the 0.7 percent growth rate in the preceding three months and was the fastest rate of growth since the first quarter of 2001 . data from the eu 's eurostat data agency showed monday that german expansion had helped the euro zone economy to hit its fastest rate of growth in six years in the second quarter . domestic growth stimuli bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup in germany brought in fans - and a few extra euros this time , growth in germany was not solely export-driven , as it had been in previous economic upturns in the country . " growth impulses are coming primarily from inside germany , " destatis said .
" while the momentum of foreign trade has weakened , it was primarily investment in construction and equipment that contributed to the economic pick-up in the second quarter . " over 12 months , growth measured one percent in the second quarter because of differences in the number of working days .
when adjusted for working days , growth was at 2.4 percent . the unseasonably warm weather helped boost activity in outdoor sectors such as the construction industry and companies are investing their record-high profits in new plants and equipment . world cup and upcoming vat increase the world cup soccer championships , held in germany in june and july , also provided a boost to consumer spending , a sector had previously held back the development of a broad-based recovery in germany . furthermore , households are bringing forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the planned rise in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent , which will take effect in january . the ministry of economy in berlin hailed the second-quarter gdp data as proof that the economic gridlock of recent years had finally been lifted . " the recovery has gained in breadth and strength , " said economy minister michael glos .
" the situation on the labor market has improved noticeably .
the outlook for this year is decidedly positive . " the dihk federation of german chambers of commerce agreed . " our forecast for full-year growth of up to two percent is within reach , " dihk president martin wansleben added . growth across the euro zone other euro zone countries , such as france and the netherlands , have similarly beaten growth expectations for the second quarter , suggesting that the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- may have to revise its own growth forecasts for the entire euro area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : value-added tax will jump from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 the euro zone expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter , separate data published by the eu 's statistics office eurostat showed on monday .
the expansion of the euro zone economy added to the arguments for further interest rate hikes by the ecb . the ecb 's benchmark refinancing rate currently stands at 3 percent and is expected to rise to 3.5 percent by the end of this year in order to keep a lid on inflation in the 12 countries that share the euro . " the german gdp data are almost too good to be true , " said bank of america economist holger schmieding .
" in less than two years , germany seems to have turned from the sick man of europe into one of the old continent 's ' wunderkinder .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.08.2006 growth in germany tops five-year high in second quarter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extra summer sunshine boosted economic growth in outdoor sectors warm weather , the world cup , vat increases in 2007 and swelling corporate profits are a few reasons why germany 's economy reached a record high last quarter .
but experts are n't sure how long the boom can last . the german economy , the biggest in the 12-country euro zone , is growing at its fastest rate since the dot.com boom five years ago , data showed on monday .
the growth can be attributed in part to increased construction spending and booming company profits . germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter of this year compared with the first quarter , federal statistics office destatis said in a statement . that represented an acceleration from the 0.7 percent growth rate in the preceding three months and was the fastest rate of growth since the first quarter of 2001 . data from the eu 's eurostat data agency showed monday that german expansion had helped the euro zone economy to hit its fastest rate of growth in six years in the second quarter . domestic growth stimuli bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup in germany brought in fans - and a few extra euros this time , growth in germany was not solely export-driven , as it had been in previous economic upturns in the country . " growth impulses are coming primarily from inside germany , " destatis said .
" while the momentum of foreign trade has weakened , it was primarily investment in construction and equipment that contributed to the economic pick-up in the second quarter . " over 12 months , growth measured one percent in the second quarter because of differences in the number of working days .
when adjusted for working days , growth was at 2.4 percent . the unseasonably warm weather helped boost activity in outdoor sectors such as the construction industry and companies are investing their record-high profits in new plants and equipment . world cup and upcoming vat increase the world cup soccer championships , held in germany in june and july , also provided a boost to consumer spending , a sector had previously held back the development of a broad-based recovery in germany . furthermore , households are bringing forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the planned rise in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent , which will take effect in january . the ministry of economy in berlin hailed the second-quarter gdp data as proof that the economic gridlock of recent years had finally been lifted . " the recovery has gained in breadth and strength , " said economy minister michael glos .
" the situation on the labor market has improved noticeably .
the outlook for this year is decidedly positive . " the dihk federation of german chambers of commerce agreed . " our forecast for full-year growth of up to two percent is within reach , " dihk president martin wansleben added . growth across the euro zone other euro zone countries , such as france and the netherlands , have similarly beaten growth expectations for the second quarter , suggesting that the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- may have to revise its own growth forecasts for the entire euro area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : value-added tax will jump from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 the euro zone expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter , separate data published by the eu 's statistics office eurostat showed on monday .
the expansion of the euro zone economy added to the arguments for further interest rate hikes by the ecb . the ecb 's benchmark refinancing rate currently stands at 3 percent and is expected to rise to 3.5 percent by the end of this year in order to keep a lid on inflation in the 12 countries that share the euro . " the german gdp data are almost too good to be true , " said bank of america economist holger schmieding .
" in less than two years , germany seems to have turned from the sick man of europe into one of the old continent 's ' wunderkinder . " ' some say euro zone growth to start losing steam however , some analysts were skeptical about whether the german economy would be able to maintain the same momentum during the coming months given the planned rise in vat , which experts believe will put the brakes on consumer demand next year . " the weather-driven rebound in second-quarter construction will not be repeated in the third quarter , " said schmieding at bank of america .

but it 's still a long way to peace , says dw 's peter philipp . after weeks of discussion , the un security council managed to find a formula for a ceasefire in lebanon .
the weapons have been silent since monday morning .
but things are not necessarily that simple : resolution 1701 would not be the first un resolution about the middle east that awakens hopes which it does n't fulfill .
not that the security council had n't tried its best : stopping the recent fighting was significantly more complicated than in other crisis and war situations .
this was no war between two states with regular armed forces , but rather one of those " asymmetrical " conflicts that have started replacing " traditional " wars . the success of the un resolution depends not on the good will of the security council members , but only on the warring parties .
and both parties apparently agreed to it only because they realized that things could n't go on like this any longer . a no-win situation the israeli government does not acknowledge this openly , but it must have realized that it got itself involved in a military adventure that it could n't win at any level : even the strongest army in the region is powerless against the well-equipped and extremely motivated group of local guerillas such as hezbollah .
and it was madness to think that it was possible to defeat or expel hezbollah with air strikes . israel also lost against the people in lebanon who do not support hezbollah : massive israeli attacks on civilians and the infrastructure in the country have cost israel its last bits of sympathy and understanding in lebanon . it was no different internationally .
israel complained that the media reported one-sidedly and that the lebanese suffering was pushed more to the foreground than that of the israelis .
it was pushed to foreground because it was many times bigger and because it was caused by a state whose prime minister only recently claimed that it had the most moral army in the world . hezbollah could n't afford to go on like this but hezbollah must have also begun to realize that it can not afford a war of this kind in the long term .
although they did surprise everybody - the israelis , in particular - with their firmness and endurance , they would have in the long term succumbed to the massive israeli strikes and led lebanon to disaster along the way . even as it is , hezbollah bears the responsibility of having started this war .
but it knew how to present itself as the only resistance group that should be taken seriously .
had the war escalated even further , hezbollah would have probably lost this sympathy bonus from the lebanese people . and now ?
there is a long way from a ceasefire - if it is kept - to permanent peace .
it will surely take several weeks for the lebanese and international forces to replace the israeli troops in southern lebanon .
in the meantime , they will not want to leave the country and hezbollah will also not want to put their arms to rest . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east -lrb- tt -rrb- . peter philipp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates sending soldiers to middle east as a ceasefire to the fighting in lebanon begins to look more likely , the debate over whether germany should take part in international peacekeeping there has divided the country 's politicians .

but experts are n't sure how long the boom can last . the german economy , the biggest in the 12-country euro zone , is growing at its fastest rate since the dot.com boom five years ago , data showed on monday .
the growth can be attributed in part to increased construction spending and booming company profits . germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter of this year compared with the first quarter , federal statistics office destatis said in a statement . that represented an acceleration from the 0.7 percent growth rate in the preceding three months and was the fastest rate of growth since the first quarter of 2001 . data from the eu 's eurostat data agency showed monday that german expansion had helped the euro zone economy to hit its fastest rate of growth in six years in the second quarter . domestic growth stimuli bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup in germany brought in fans - and a few extra euros this time , growth in germany was not solely export-driven , as it had been in previous economic upturns in the country . " growth impulses are coming primarily from inside germany , " destatis said .
" while the momentum of foreign trade has weakened , it was primarily investment in construction and equipment that contributed to the economic pick-up in the second quarter . " over 12 months , growth measured one percent in the second quarter because of differences in the number of working days .
when adjusted for working days , growth was at 2.4 percent . the unseasonably warm weather helped boost activity in outdoor sectors such as the construction industry and companies are investing their record-high profits in new plants and equipment . world cup and upcoming vat increase the world cup soccer championships , held in germany in june and july , also provided a boost to consumer spending , a sector had previously held back the development of a broad-based recovery in germany . furthermore , households are bringing forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the planned rise in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent , which will take effect in january . the ministry of economy in berlin hailed the second-quarter gdp data as proof that the economic gridlock of recent years had finally been lifted . " the recovery has gained in breadth and strength , " said economy minister michael glos .
" the situation on the labor market has improved noticeably .
the outlook for this year is decidedly positive . " the dihk federation of german chambers of commerce agreed . " our forecast for full-year growth of up to two percent is within reach , " dihk president martin wansleben added . growth across the euro zone other euro zone countries , such as france and the netherlands , have similarly beaten growth expectations for the second quarter , suggesting that the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- may have to revise its own growth forecasts for the entire euro area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : value-added tax will jump from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 the euro zone expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter , separate data published by the eu 's statistics office eurostat showed on monday .
the expansion of the euro zone economy added to the arguments for further interest rate hikes by the ecb . the ecb 's benchmark refinancing rate currently stands at 3 percent and is expected to rise to 3.5 percent by the end of this year in order to keep a lid on inflation in the 12 countries that share the euro . " the german gdp data are almost too good to be true , " said bank of america economist holger schmieding .
" in less than two years , germany seems to have turned from the sick man of europe into one of the old continent 's ' wunderkinder . " ' some say euro zone growth to start losing steam however , some analysts were skeptical about whether the german economy would be able to maintain the same momentum during the coming months given the planned rise in vat , which experts believe will put the brakes on consumer demand next year . " the weather-driven rebound in second-quarter construction will not be repeated in the third quarter , " said schmieding at bank of america .
" retail sales may recede after the world cup effect in may and june " and the vat increase will be also provide a temporary hit to activity . the european commission in brussels also predicted that euro zone growth would probably start losing steam soon , with analysts pointing the finger at the stronger euro , slowing global growth , high oil prices , higher interest rates and tighter fiscal policy . in germany , dihk similarly warned that german growth may soon pass its zenith , not least because of the vat hike and the one-off nature of the world cup effect . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european central bank raises rates on inflation fears the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- raised the key euro-zone interest rate by a quarter point to 3.0 percent on thursday , making borrowing costs the highest in three-and-a-half years in order to curb inflation .

the expansion of the euro zone economy added to the arguments for further interest rate hikes by the ecb . the ecb 's benchmark refinancing rate currently stands at 3 percent and is expected to rise to 3.5 percent by the end of this year in order to keep a lid on inflation in the 12 countries that share the euro . " the german gdp data are almost too good to be true , " said bank of america economist holger schmieding .
" in less than two years , germany seems to have turned from the sick man of europe into one of the old continent 's ' wunderkinder . " ' some say euro zone growth to start losing steam however , some analysts were skeptical about whether the german economy would be able to maintain the same momentum during the coming months given the planned rise in vat , which experts believe will put the brakes on consumer demand next year . " the weather-driven rebound in second-quarter construction will not be repeated in the third quarter , " said schmieding at bank of america .
" retail sales may recede after the world cup effect in may and june " and the vat increase will be also provide a temporary hit to activity . the european commission in brussels also predicted that euro zone growth would probably start losing steam soon , with analysts pointing the finger at the stronger euro , slowing global growth , high oil prices , higher interest rates and tighter fiscal policy . in germany , dihk similarly warned that german growth may soon pass its zenith , not least because of the vat hike and the one-off nature of the world cup effect . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european central bank raises rates on inflation fears the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- raised the key euro-zone interest rate by a quarter point to 3.0 percent on thursday , making borrowing costs the highest in three-and-a-half years in order to curb inflation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : günter grass grass defends long silence as book sales soar judging grass opinion : a late confession is better than no confession at all " i do n't hold onto ideological distortions " germany -pipe- 14.08.2006 nobel prize winner grass under fire for belated ss confession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : someone smeared swastikas on the door to grass ' house in 1997 nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he was drafted into nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss elite force during world war ii . the 78-year-old grass told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that the stunning confession would feature in his memoir " peeling onions , " which is due to appear in september .
so far , it had only been known that the author , best known abroad for his 1959 novel " the tin drum , " was conscripted into the german air defense forces . but in his autobiography he also recounted that he tried to join the third reich 's submarine forces when he was 15 years old but was rejected because he was too young .
he said that he was drafted into the elite waffen ss the following year but denied suggestions that he joined willingly . grass , for many years a prominent leftist and pacifist , was wounded in 1945 and sent to an american prisoner of war camp . " i wanted to make clear once again what happened then and above all things concerning me , " he told the newspaper .
" my silence for all these years is one of the reasons why i wrote this book .
it had to come out . " contemporaries disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter kempowski fellow german author walter kempowski was among the first of his grass 's contemporaries to comment , telling the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that the revelation was " a bit late " while grass biographer michael jürgs said he was " personally disappointed " and lamented " the end of a moral authority . " leading literature critic hellmuth karasek criticized the timing but also agreed there was no reason to reproach grass as he had done much in his career and life since the war to inspire people . " the fact he was in the ss at 17 is by itself a misdemeanor - had grass not been one to throw his weight around as a moral authority so much since then , " karasek told german radio .
" if i were cynical , i would say he did not reveal it sooner at the risk of not winning a nobel prize .
do n't misunderstand me : grass deserved the nobel prize more than any other german writer .
but everything now has to be seen in a new light . " joachim fest , a leading historian , told der spiegel magazine : " after 60 years , this confession comes a bit too late .
i ca n't understand how someone who for decades set himself up as a moral authority , a rather smug one , could pull this off . " michael wolffsohn , a prominent military historian , also faulted grass for waiting so long .
grass 's " moralizing , though not his storytelling , life 's work is devalued by his persistent silence , " wolffsohn wrote in the online netzeitung daily . cdu politician demands return of prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 meanwhile , wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union called for grass to return the nobel prize he won for literature in 1999 .
börnsen told the german daily bild that grass should adhere to his own moral standards and " honorably return the prize . " sections of the german press were equally deflated by the admission . " grass 's confession right before the publication of his autobiography leaves behind a bad taste of book promotion , " wrote bild am sonntag newspaper columnist helmut böger .
" even after his admission , grass remains germany 's most important living author .
but he has lost his standing as a moral authority .
he can not be castigated for being a member of the ss ...
but he can be for lying about it for 60 years . " however , ralph giordano , a leading german-jewish writer , said he would not condemn grass and praised his belated confession . " it 's good what günter grass has now done , " giordano said .
" what 's worse than making a mistake is not coming to terms with it .
his example also shows how seducible young people can be . " the muted reactions outside of germany were mostly of displeasure and disappointment . robert fulford , a columnist with canada 's national post , accused grass of hypocrisy . " during his long career as a public man , grass has never passed up a chance to speak out for outspokenness , " he wrote .
" ' the job of a citizen is to keep his mouth open , ' he liked to say - though not necessarily in all cases , of course . " walesa calls for renouncement of citizenship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel peace prize winner lech walesa former polish president lech walesa took an even harder line by demanding that grass renounce his honorary citizenship of gdansk .
grass , who was born in the baltic port of danzig , now the polish city of gdansk , became an honorary citizen of the city in 1993 . " an uncomfortable situation has developed , " walesa , who is also an honorary citizen of gdansk , said in an interview monday with the bild newspaper .
" i do not feel comfortable in that company .
i do not know whether one should consider revoking the title .
if it had been known he was in the ss , he would never have received the honor .
it would be best if he relinquished it himself . " in his admission , grass said he never fired a shot during his time with the feared elite force whose notoriety he only grasped once his unit had been defeated , when one of his superiors ordered him to get rid of his uniform . nuremberg trials revealed truth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waffen ss was notoriously brutal the feared paramilitary unit was branded a criminal organization at the nuremberg war crimes trials .
only then , grass claimed , did he start to understand . " i was stupid enough to believe that germans would not do such things and took it all for propaganda , " he said .
the revelations of ss brutality at nuremberg trials then caused him " feelings of guilt and shame . " grass has spent the decades since the end of the war demanding that germans come to terms with their nazi past by coming clean on it . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the taboo breaker with his new novel , nobel-prize winner günther grass confronts a subject previously dealt with only by the right wing .

so far , it had only been known that the author , best known abroad for his 1959 novel " the tin drum , " was conscripted into the german air defense forces . but in his autobiography he also recounted that he tried to join the third reich 's submarine forces when he was 15 years old but was rejected because he was too young .
he said that he was drafted into the elite waffen ss the following year but denied suggestions that he joined willingly . grass , for many years a prominent leftist and pacifist , was wounded in 1945 and sent to an american prisoner of war camp . " i wanted to make clear once again what happened then and above all things concerning me , " he told the newspaper .
" my silence for all these years is one of the reasons why i wrote this book .
it had to come out . " contemporaries disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter kempowski fellow german author walter kempowski was among the first of his grass 's contemporaries to comment , telling the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that the revelation was " a bit late " while grass biographer michael jürgs said he was " personally disappointed " and lamented " the end of a moral authority . " leading literature critic hellmuth karasek criticized the timing but also agreed there was no reason to reproach grass as he had done much in his career and life since the war to inspire people . " the fact he was in the ss at 17 is by itself a misdemeanor - had grass not been one to throw his weight around as a moral authority so much since then , " karasek told german radio .
" if i were cynical , i would say he did not reveal it sooner at the risk of not winning a nobel prize .
do n't misunderstand me : grass deserved the nobel prize more than any other german writer .
but everything now has to be seen in a new light . " joachim fest , a leading historian , told der spiegel magazine : " after 60 years , this confession comes a bit too late .
i ca n't understand how someone who for decades set himself up as a moral authority , a rather smug one , could pull this off . " michael wolffsohn , a prominent military historian , also faulted grass for waiting so long .
grass 's " moralizing , though not his storytelling , life 's work is devalued by his persistent silence , " wolffsohn wrote in the online netzeitung daily . cdu politician demands return of prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 meanwhile , wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union called for grass to return the nobel prize he won for literature in 1999 .
börnsen told the german daily bild that grass should adhere to his own moral standards and " honorably return the prize . " sections of the german press were equally deflated by the admission . " grass 's confession right before the publication of his autobiography leaves behind a bad taste of book promotion , " wrote bild am sonntag newspaper columnist helmut böger .
" even after his admission , grass remains germany 's most important living author .
but he has lost his standing as a moral authority .
he can not be castigated for being a member of the ss ...
but he can be for lying about it for 60 years . " however , ralph giordano , a leading german-jewish writer , said he would not condemn grass and praised his belated confession . " it 's good what günter grass has now done , " giordano said .
" what 's worse than making a mistake is not coming to terms with it .
his example also shows how seducible young people can be .

but it 's still a long way to peace , says dw 's peter philipp . after weeks of discussion , the un security council managed to find a formula for a ceasefire in lebanon .
the weapons have been silent since monday morning .
but things are not necessarily that simple : resolution 1701 would not be the first un resolution about the middle east that awakens hopes which it does n't fulfill .
not that the security council had n't tried its best : stopping the recent fighting was significantly more complicated than in other crisis and war situations .
this was no war between two states with regular armed forces , but rather one of those " asymmetrical " conflicts that have started replacing " traditional " wars . the success of the un resolution depends not on the good will of the security council members , but only on the warring parties .
and both parties apparently agreed to it only because they realized that things could n't go on like this any longer . a no-win situation the israeli government does not acknowledge this openly , but it must have realized that it got itself involved in a military adventure that it could n't win at any level : even the strongest army in the region is powerless against the well-equipped and extremely motivated group of local guerillas such as hezbollah .
and it was madness to think that it was possible to defeat or expel hezbollah with air strikes . israel also lost against the people in lebanon who do not support hezbollah : massive israeli attacks on civilians and the infrastructure in the country have cost israel its last bits of sympathy and understanding in lebanon . it was no different internationally .
israel complained that the media reported one-sidedly and that the lebanese suffering was pushed more to the foreground than that of the israelis .
it was pushed to foreground because it was many times bigger and because it was caused by a state whose prime minister only recently claimed that it had the most moral army in the world . hezbollah could n't afford to go on like this but hezbollah must have also begun to realize that it can not afford a war of this kind in the long term .
although they did surprise everybody - the israelis , in particular - with their firmness and endurance , they would have in the long term succumbed to the massive israeli strikes and led lebanon to disaster along the way . even as it is , hezbollah bears the responsibility of having started this war .
but it knew how to present itself as the only resistance group that should be taken seriously .
had the war escalated even further , hezbollah would have probably lost this sympathy bonus from the lebanese people . and now ?
there is a long way from a ceasefire - if it is kept - to permanent peace .
it will surely take several weeks for the lebanese and international forces to replace the israeli troops in southern lebanon .
in the meantime , they will not want to leave the country and hezbollah will also not want to put their arms to rest . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east -lrb- tt -rrb- . peter philipp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates sending soldiers to middle east as a ceasefire to the fighting in lebanon begins to look more likely , the debate over whether germany should take part in international peacekeeping there has divided the country 's politicians .

but it 's still a long way to peace , says dw 's peter philipp . after weeks of discussion , the un security council managed to find a formula for a ceasefire in lebanon .
the weapons have been silent since monday morning .
but things are not necessarily that simple : resolution 1701 would not be the first un resolution about the middle east that awakens hopes which it does n't fulfill .
not that the security council had n't tried its best : stopping the recent fighting was significantly more complicated than in other crisis and war situations .
this was no war between two states with regular armed forces , but rather one of those " asymmetrical " conflicts that have started replacing " traditional " wars . the success of the un resolution depends not on the good will of the security council members , but only on the warring parties .
and both parties apparently agreed to it only because they realized that things could n't go on like this any longer . a no-win situation the israeli government does not acknowledge this openly , but it must have realized that it got itself involved in a military adventure that it could n't win at any level : even the strongest army in the region is powerless against the well-equipped and extremely motivated group of local guerillas such as hezbollah .
and it was madness to think that it was possible to defeat or expel hezbollah with air strikes . israel also lost against the people in lebanon who do not support hezbollah : massive israeli attacks on civilians and the infrastructure in the country have cost israel its last bits of sympathy and understanding in lebanon . it was no different internationally .
israel complained that the media reported one-sidedly and that the lebanese suffering was pushed more to the foreground than that of the israelis .
it was pushed to foreground because it was many times bigger and because it was caused by a state whose prime minister only recently claimed that it had the most moral army in the world . hezbollah could n't afford to go on like this but hezbollah must have also begun to realize that it can not afford a war of this kind in the long term .
although they did surprise everybody - the israelis , in particular - with their firmness and endurance , they would have in the long term succumbed to the massive israeli strikes and led lebanon to disaster along the way . even as it is , hezbollah bears the responsibility of having started this war .
but it knew how to present itself as the only resistance group that should be taken seriously .
had the war escalated even further , hezbollah would have probably lost this sympathy bonus from the lebanese people . and now ?
there is a long way from a ceasefire - if it is kept - to permanent peace .
it will surely take several weeks for the lebanese and international forces to replace the israeli troops in southern lebanon .
in the meantime , they will not want to leave the country and hezbollah will also not want to put their arms to rest . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east -lrb- tt -rrb- . peter philipp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates sending soldiers to middle east as a ceasefire to the fighting in lebanon begins to look more likely , the debate over whether germany should take part in international peacekeeping there has divided the country 's politicians .

the question of sending german troops to the israel-lebanon border has divided germany . government spokesman thomas steg told reporters there would be more clarity over what role germany would likely fulfill by the end of the week .
he added that the cabinet would discuss the matter next week , and that any final decision would be made in september when parliament reconvenes following the summer break . steg said that germany 's future role in lebanon would also be limited by its means .

still , the issue is highly sensitive . germany 's ministers of defense and interior affairs said the country would be prepared to contribute to an international peacekeeping force in lebanon once the united nations ' security council specifies a mandate for the operation this week . german chancellor angela merkel edged around the question in the past , saying it was too early to decide on germany 's possible roles in a peacekeeping force .
the question of sending german troops to the israel-lebanon border has divided germany . government spokesman thomas steg told reporters there would be more clarity over what role germany would likely fulfill by the end of the week .
he added that the cabinet would discuss the matter next week , and that any final decision would be made in september when parliament reconvenes following the summer break . steg said that germany 's future role in lebanon would also be limited by its means .

the building is likely to cost biss in the region of 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 638,650 -rrb- . biss is looking to invest between 13 and 14 million euros in the project which will turn the prison into a 66-room establishment with an adjoining complex of 14 senior citizen apartments . city 's homeless to staff hotel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biss hopes to give homeless people a chance to find employment - and accomodation - at the hotel the association hopes to employ between 25 and 40 homeless people as staff in the hotel , providing them with the means to afford their own accommodation . the current prison population will be moved to a new facility in 2008 , leaving the 6,000-square-meter -lrb- 64,500 square feet -rrb- building up for grabs .
if the prison building is not given over to any official state government department , it will be made available on the open public market , leaving the way free for biss to acquire the property . the organization has already hired a design team to draw up plans for the possible make-over .
architect henning dickhoff from a + p architecture in munich told the süddeutsche zeitung that the preparatory design work had been completed and a preliminary construction inquiry had been lodged with the city council . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de globetrotting behind bars traveling around the globe for a year and visiting 60 countries along the way might be a dream for many .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : celebrating bertolt brecht " bertolt brecht 's influence can not be overestimated " bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere a communist in a city of angels culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2006 brandauer 's betrayal of brecht großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the threepenny opera " has been the most talked-about play in berlin this year berlin is in brecht fever .
as the crowning but ultimately disappointing event of the 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , a star-studded production of " the threepenny opera " opened in berlin . the fact that brecht 's " threepenny opera " opened at the admiralspalast in berlin was a little miracle in itself .
the historic building from the beginning of the 20th century , hastily renovated by entrepreneur falk walter , was not deemed safe for public use until the day before the premiere , when city officials finally gave their seal of approval . the media feverishly followed the will-they-or-wo n't-they drama of the most talked-about production of the year .
in the end , all those wires ominously sticking out of the walls , blotches of paint , mops , buckets and vaguely disguised piles of rubble indicated that the building - originally an ice rink and a luxury spa , which then , in the 1920s , became a theater - was and still is a construction site , an unfinished project .
very much like brecht 's revolutionary dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the admiralspalast is still not fully renovated the scent of undried paint - known to cause either mild headaches or mild hallucinations , depending on your age and social status - mixed well with the perfumes of berlin society ladies , while one toilette sign in the theater foyer still pointed to a hole in the wall , covered by a simple wooden board . this hole in the wall - a real metaphoric nowhere - would have been better suited as backdrop for beckett 's " waiting for godot . "
estragon : " shall we go ? "
vladimir : " let 's go . "
stage directions : " they do n't move . " " at least , the stage is standing , " said a bartender before the saturday night performance , offering a glass of champagne to an elderly lady while performing an acrobatic balancing act over several crates of beer . an anticlimax and while the stage was standing , the performance fell flat .
with all the media hullabaloo leading up to the premiere , one was almost convinced it was going to be something special . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director karl maria brandauer -lrb- left -rrb- and punk rocker campino austrian actor and director klaus maria brandauer assembled a stellar ensemble .
german punk singer campino of the band die toten hosen played the role of mack the knife , king of thieves . gottfried john - known to film buffs from several fassbinder movies and to the rest of the universe as the evil russian general arkadii grigorovich ourumov from james bond 's russian stunt in " golden eye " - played mr. peachum . katrin sass - one of most popular actresses from former east germany , who experienced a pan-german comeback with her touching appearance in the blockbuster hit " good bye , lenin " - added quite a bit of slapstick cheekiness to the role of manipulative alcoholic mrs. peachum . but most of the ensemble appeared helpless in an overly conventional production which lacked both the dramatic gusto and political audacity .
staging the play as an authentic costume drama set in london in the 1920s , brandauer created a sluggish , outdated and all too reverent production which failed to excite let alone provoke . a betrayal of sorts heiner müller said in an interview once that " to use brecht without criticizing him is to betray him . "
turning " the threepenny opera " into a wax museum musical was one such betrayal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit minichmayr -lrb- polly -rrb- and campino -lrb- mack the knife -rrb- the highlight of the evening turned out to be birgit minichmayr 's performance as polly .
the austrian-born actress , who joined berlin 's volksbühne theater in 2004 , after earning her laurels at vienna 's burgtheater , showed once again that she is one of the most exciting young german-speaking actresses today . her polly was both loud and vulnerable , rebellious and scared .
the otherworldly force of her voice , which assumes a subtle huskiness in the higher register , turned her rendering of pirate jenny 's song into a moment of chilling , spectral beauty . sweeping the roads the most contradictory - and most brechtian - moment of the evening happened outside the theater .
the elegant guests were greeted on arrival by a couple of homeless berliners selling a special edition of their newspaper , strassenfeger -lrb- street sweeper -rrb- , entirely dedicated to the new production of " the threepenny opera . "
it is fascinating what kind of advertising a budget of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.5 million -rrb- can get you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katrin sass -lrb- left -rrb- played mrs. peachum with a great sense of humor one after another , the well-off and the extremely well-off couples stopped at the theater entry to buy themselves a copy of strassenfeger .
after all , they all came to watch brecht .
it felt appropriate to get close to the masses .
so they blinded the homeless with their pearly white teeth , and smiled like there was no tomorrow .
it was a spectacle worth of buñuel 's " discreet charm of the bourgeoise . " but those were exactly the kind of people , who - under different , non-theatrical , non-brechtian circumstances - would have looked the other way .
luckily for them , they do n't normally ride the subway that much . brecht in a post-revolutionary age when mack the knife cried out his famous invective - " what is robbing a bank when compared to founding a bank ? " - his words had to come out as petulant rather than subversive , especially to deutsche bank president josef ackermann , one of the most prominent guests at the premiere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandauer 's reading of brecht was too tame and unexciting what 's more , " the threepenny opera " at the admiralspalast was sponsored by deutsche bank - a company that celebrated its record yields of 2.5 billion euros two years ago by firing more than 6,000 people , or every tenth employee . even to brecht - who was himself no stranger to wheelings and dealings of all sorts , and whose austrian passport allowed him to dream his communist dream in east berlin while keeping a bank account in switzerland - the happy artistic collective bringing together a punk rocker and a big banker would have seemed self-defeating . brecht said once that his work was " the swan song of the millennium . "

the historic building from the beginning of the 20th century , hastily renovated by entrepreneur falk walter , was not deemed safe for public use until the day before the premiere , when city officials finally gave their seal of approval . the media feverishly followed the will-they-or-wo n't-they drama of the most talked-about production of the year .
in the end , all those wires ominously sticking out of the walls , blotches of paint , mops , buckets and vaguely disguised piles of rubble indicated that the building - originally an ice rink and a luxury spa , which then , in the 1920s , became a theater - was and still is a construction site , an unfinished project .
very much like brecht 's revolutionary dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the admiralspalast is still not fully renovated the scent of undried paint - known to cause either mild headaches or mild hallucinations , depending on your age and social status - mixed well with the perfumes of berlin society ladies , while one toilette sign in the theater foyer still pointed to a hole in the wall , covered by a simple wooden board . this hole in the wall - a real metaphoric nowhere - would have been better suited as backdrop for beckett 's " waiting for godot . "
estragon : " shall we go ? "
vladimir : " let 's go . "
stage directions : " they do n't move . " " at least , the stage is standing , " said a bartender before the saturday night performance , offering a glass of champagne to an elderly lady while performing an acrobatic balancing act over several crates of beer . an anticlimax and while the stage was standing , the performance fell flat .
with all the media hullabaloo leading up to the premiere , one was almost convinced it was going to be something special . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director karl maria brandauer -lrb- left -rrb- and punk rocker campino austrian actor and director klaus maria brandauer assembled a stellar ensemble .
german punk singer campino of the band die toten hosen played the role of mack the knife , king of thieves . gottfried john - known to film buffs from several fassbinder movies and to the rest of the universe as the evil russian general arkadii grigorovich ourumov from james bond 's russian stunt in " golden eye " - played mr. peachum . katrin sass - one of most popular actresses from former east germany , who experienced a pan-german comeback with her touching appearance in the blockbuster hit " good bye , lenin " - added quite a bit of slapstick cheekiness to the role of manipulative alcoholic mrs. peachum . but most of the ensemble appeared helpless in an overly conventional production which lacked both the dramatic gusto and political audacity .
staging the play as an authentic costume drama set in london in the 1920s , brandauer created a sluggish , outdated and all too reverent production which failed to excite let alone provoke . a betrayal of sorts heiner müller said in an interview once that " to use brecht without criticizing him is to betray him . "
turning " the threepenny opera " into a wax museum musical was one such betrayal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit minichmayr -lrb- polly -rrb- and campino -lrb- mack the knife -rrb- the highlight of the evening turned out to be birgit minichmayr 's performance as polly .
the austrian-born actress , who joined berlin 's volksbühne theater in 2004 , after earning her laurels at vienna 's burgtheater , showed once again that she is one of the most exciting young german-speaking actresses today . her polly was both loud and vulnerable , rebellious and scared .
the otherworldly force of her voice , which assumes a subtle huskiness in the higher register , turned her rendering of pirate jenny 's song into a moment of chilling , spectral beauty . sweeping the roads the most contradictory - and most brechtian - moment of the evening happened outside the theater .
the elegant guests were greeted on arrival by a couple of homeless berliners selling a special edition of their newspaper , strassenfeger -lrb- street sweeper -rrb- , entirely dedicated to the new production of " the threepenny opera . "
it is fascinating what kind of advertising a budget of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.5 million -rrb- can get you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katrin sass -lrb- left -rrb- played mrs. peachum with a great sense of humor one after another , the well-off and the extremely well-off couples stopped at the theater entry to buy themselves a copy of strassenfeger .
after all , they all came to watch brecht .
it felt appropriate to get close to the masses .
so they blinded the homeless with their pearly white teeth , and smiled like there was no tomorrow .
it was a spectacle worth of buñuel 's " discreet charm of the bourgeoise . " but those were exactly the kind of people , who - under different , non-theatrical , non-brechtian circumstances - would have looked the other way .
luckily for them , they do n't normally ride the subway that much . brecht in a post-revolutionary age when mack the knife cried out his famous invective - " what is robbing a bank when compared to founding a bank ? " - his words had to come out as petulant rather than subversive , especially to deutsche bank president josef ackermann , one of the most prominent guests at the premiere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandauer 's reading of brecht was too tame and unexciting what 's more , " the threepenny opera " at the admiralspalast was sponsored by deutsche bank - a company that celebrated its record yields of 2.5 billion euros two years ago by firing more than 6,000 people , or every tenth employee . even to brecht - who was himself no stranger to wheelings and dealings of all sorts , and whose austrian passport allowed him to dream his communist dream in east berlin while keeping a bank account in switzerland - the happy artistic collective bringing together a punk rocker and a big banker would have seemed self-defeating . brecht said once that his work was " the swan song of the millennium .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.08.2006 growth in germany tops five-year high in second quarter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extra summer sunshine boosted economic growth in outdoor sectors warm weather , the world cup , vat increases in 2007 and swelling corporate profits are a few reasons why germany 's economy reached a record high last quarter .
but experts are n't sure how long the boom can last . the german economy , the biggest in the 12-country euro zone , is growing at its fastest rate since the dot.com boom five years ago , data showed on monday .
the growth can be attributed in part to increased construction spending and booming company profits . germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter of this year compared with the first quarter , federal statistics office destatis said in a statement . that represented an acceleration from the 0.7 percent growth rate in the preceding three months and was the fastest rate of growth since the first quarter of 2001 . data from the eu 's eurostat data agency showed monday that german expansion had helped the euro zone economy to hit its fastest rate of growth in six years in the second quarter . domestic growth stimuli bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup in germany brought in fans - and a few extra euros this time , growth in germany was not solely export-driven , as it had been in previous economic upturns in the country .

but experts are n't sure how long the boom can last . the german economy , the biggest in the 12-country euro zone , is growing at its fastest rate since the dot.com boom five years ago , data showed on monday .
the growth can be attributed in part to increased construction spending and booming company profits . germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter of this year compared with the first quarter , federal statistics office destatis said in a statement . that represented an acceleration from the 0.7 percent growth rate in the preceding three months and was the fastest rate of growth since the first quarter of 2001 . data from the eu 's eurostat data agency showed monday that german expansion had helped the euro zone economy to hit its fastest rate of growth in six years in the second quarter . domestic growth stimuli bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup in germany brought in fans - and a few extra euros this time , growth in germany was not solely export-driven , as it had been in previous economic upturns in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 14.08.2006 opinion : " it 's a long way to peace " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in accordance with un resolution 1701 , a ceasefire in the conflict between israel and hezbollah in lebanon came into effect on monday morning .
but it 's still a long way to peace , says dw 's peter philipp . after weeks of discussion , the un security council managed to find a formula for a ceasefire in lebanon .
the weapons have been silent since monday morning .
but things are not necessarily that simple : resolution 1701 would not be the first un resolution about the middle east that awakens hopes which it does n't fulfill .
not that the security council had n't tried its best : stopping the recent fighting was significantly more complicated than in other crisis and war situations .
this was no war between two states with regular armed forces , but rather one of those " asymmetrical " conflicts that have started replacing " traditional " wars . the success of the un resolution depends not on the good will of the security council members , but only on the warring parties .
and both parties apparently agreed to it only because they realized that things could n't go on like this any longer . a no-win situation the israeli government does not acknowledge this openly , but it must have realized that it got itself involved in a military adventure that it could n't win at any level : even the strongest army in the region is powerless against the well-equipped and extremely motivated group of local guerillas such as hezbollah .
and it was madness to think that it was possible to defeat or expel hezbollah with air strikes . israel also lost against the people in lebanon who do not support hezbollah : massive israeli attacks on civilians and the infrastructure in the country have cost israel its last bits of sympathy and understanding in lebanon . it was no different internationally .
israel complained that the media reported one-sidedly and that the lebanese suffering was pushed more to the foreground than that of the israelis .
it was pushed to foreground because it was many times bigger and because it was caused by a state whose prime minister only recently claimed that it had the most moral army in the world . hezbollah could n't afford to go on like this but hezbollah must have also begun to realize that it can not afford a war of this kind in the long term .
although they did surprise everybody - the israelis , in particular - with their firmness and endurance , they would have in the long term succumbed to the massive israeli strikes and led lebanon to disaster along the way . even as it is , hezbollah bears the responsibility of having started this war .
but it knew how to present itself as the only resistance group that should be taken seriously .
had the war escalated even further , hezbollah would have probably lost this sympathy bonus from the lebanese people . and now ?
there is a long way from a ceasefire - if it is kept - to permanent peace .
it will surely take several weeks for the lebanese and international forces to replace the israeli troops in southern lebanon .
in the meantime , they will not want to leave the country and hezbollah will also not want to put their arms to rest . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east -lrb- tt -rrb- . peter philipp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates sending soldiers to middle east as a ceasefire to the fighting in lebanon begins to look more likely , the debate over whether germany should take part in international peacekeeping there has divided the country 's politicians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : celebrating bertolt brecht " bertolt brecht 's influence can not be overestimated " bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere a communist in a city of angels culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2006 brandauer 's betrayal of brecht großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the threepenny opera " has been the most talked-about play in berlin this year berlin is in brecht fever .
as the crowning but ultimately disappointing event of the 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , a star-studded production of " the threepenny opera " opened in berlin . the fact that brecht 's " threepenny opera " opened at the admiralspalast in berlin was a little miracle in itself .
the historic building from the beginning of the 20th century , hastily renovated by entrepreneur falk walter , was not deemed safe for public use until the day before the premiere , when city officials finally gave their seal of approval . the media feverishly followed the will-they-or-wo n't-they drama of the most talked-about production of the year .
in the end , all those wires ominously sticking out of the walls , blotches of paint , mops , buckets and vaguely disguised piles of rubble indicated that the building - originally an ice rink and a luxury spa , which then , in the 1920s , became a theater - was and still is a construction site , an unfinished project .
very much like brecht 's revolutionary dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the admiralspalast is still not fully renovated the scent of undried paint - known to cause either mild headaches or mild hallucinations , depending on your age and social status - mixed well with the perfumes of berlin society ladies , while one toilette sign in the theater foyer still pointed to a hole in the wall , covered by a simple wooden board . this hole in the wall - a real metaphoric nowhere - would have been better suited as backdrop for beckett 's " waiting for godot . "
estragon : " shall we go ? "
vladimir : " let 's go . "
stage directions : " they do n't move . " " at least , the stage is standing , " said a bartender before the saturday night performance , offering a glass of champagne to an elderly lady while performing an acrobatic balancing act over several crates of beer . an anticlimax and while the stage was standing , the performance fell flat .
with all the media hullabaloo leading up to the premiere , one was almost convinced it was going to be something special . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director karl maria brandauer -lrb- left -rrb- and punk rocker campino austrian actor and director klaus maria brandauer assembled a stellar ensemble .
german punk singer campino of the band die toten hosen played the role of mack the knife , king of thieves . gottfried john - known to film buffs from several fassbinder movies and to the rest of the universe as the evil russian general arkadii grigorovich ourumov from james bond 's russian stunt in " golden eye " - played mr. peachum . katrin sass - one of most popular actresses from former east germany , who experienced a pan-german comeback with her touching appearance in the blockbuster hit " good bye , lenin " - added quite a bit of slapstick cheekiness to the role of manipulative alcoholic mrs. peachum . but most of the ensemble appeared helpless in an overly conventional production which lacked both the dramatic gusto and political audacity .
staging the play as an authentic costume drama set in london in the 1920s , brandauer created a sluggish , outdated and all too reverent production which failed to excite let alone provoke . a betrayal of sorts heiner müller said in an interview once that " to use brecht without criticizing him is to betray him . "
turning " the threepenny opera " into a wax museum musical was one such betrayal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit minichmayr -lrb- polly -rrb- and campino -lrb- mack the knife -rrb- the highlight of the evening turned out to be birgit minichmayr 's performance as polly .
the austrian-born actress , who joined berlin 's volksbühne theater in 2004 , after earning her laurels at vienna 's burgtheater , showed once again that she is one of the most exciting young german-speaking actresses today . her polly was both loud and vulnerable , rebellious and scared .
the otherworldly force of her voice , which assumes a subtle huskiness in the higher register , turned her rendering of pirate jenny 's song into a moment of chilling , spectral beauty . sweeping the roads the most contradictory - and most brechtian - moment of the evening happened outside the theater .
the elegant guests were greeted on arrival by a couple of homeless berliners selling a special edition of their newspaper , strassenfeger -lrb- street sweeper -rrb- , entirely dedicated to the new production of " the threepenny opera . "
it is fascinating what kind of advertising a budget of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.5 million -rrb- can get you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katrin sass -lrb- left -rrb- played mrs. peachum with a great sense of humor one after another , the well-off and the extremely well-off couples stopped at the theater entry to buy themselves a copy of strassenfeger .
after all , they all came to watch brecht .
it felt appropriate to get close to the masses .
so they blinded the homeless with their pearly white teeth , and smiled like there was no tomorrow .
it was a spectacle worth of buñuel 's " discreet charm of the bourgeoise . " but those were exactly the kind of people , who - under different , non-theatrical , non-brechtian circumstances - would have looked the other way .
luckily for them , they do n't normally ride the subway that much . brecht in a post-revolutionary age when mack the knife cried out his famous invective - " what is robbing a bank when compared to founding a bank ? " - his words had to come out as petulant rather than subversive , especially to deutsche bank president josef ackermann , one of the most prominent guests at the premiere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandauer 's reading of brecht was too tame and unexciting what 's more , " the threepenny opera " at the admiralspalast was sponsored by deutsche bank - a company that celebrated its record yields of 2.5 billion euros two years ago by firing more than 6,000 people , or every tenth employee . even to brecht - who was himself no stranger to wheelings and dealings of all sorts , and whose austrian passport allowed him to dream his communist dream in east berlin while keeping a bank account in switzerland - the happy artistic collective bringing together a punk rocker and a big banker would have seemed self-defeating . brecht said once that his work was " the swan song of the millennium . "
in brandauer 's no-risk production , brecht 's swan song died a muffled , echoless death . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating bertolt brecht click here for a dw-world.de dossier on brecht 's life and international influence .

german punk singer campino of the band die toten hosen played the role of mack the knife , king of thieves . gottfried john - known to film buffs from several fassbinder movies and to the rest of the universe as the evil russian general arkadii grigorovich ourumov from james bond 's russian stunt in " golden eye " - played mr. peachum . katrin sass - one of most popular actresses from former east germany , who experienced a pan-german comeback with her touching appearance in the blockbuster hit " good bye , lenin " - added quite a bit of slapstick cheekiness to the role of manipulative alcoholic mrs. peachum . but most of the ensemble appeared helpless in an overly conventional production which lacked both the dramatic gusto and political audacity .
staging the play as an authentic costume drama set in london in the 1920s , brandauer created a sluggish , outdated and all too reverent production which failed to excite let alone provoke . a betrayal of sorts heiner müller said in an interview once that " to use brecht without criticizing him is to betray him . "
turning " the threepenny opera " into a wax museum musical was one such betrayal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit minichmayr -lrb- polly -rrb- and campino -lrb- mack the knife -rrb- the highlight of the evening turned out to be birgit minichmayr 's performance as polly .
the austrian-born actress , who joined berlin 's volksbühne theater in 2004 , after earning her laurels at vienna 's burgtheater , showed once again that she is one of the most exciting young german-speaking actresses today . her polly was both loud and vulnerable , rebellious and scared .
the otherworldly force of her voice , which assumes a subtle huskiness in the higher register , turned her rendering of pirate jenny 's song into a moment of chilling , spectral beauty . sweeping the roads the most contradictory - and most brechtian - moment of the evening happened outside the theater .
the elegant guests were greeted on arrival by a couple of homeless berliners selling a special edition of their newspaper , strassenfeger -lrb- street sweeper -rrb- , entirely dedicated to the new production of " the threepenny opera . "
it is fascinating what kind of advertising a budget of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.5 million -rrb- can get you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katrin sass -lrb- left -rrb- played mrs. peachum with a great sense of humor one after another , the well-off and the extremely well-off couples stopped at the theater entry to buy themselves a copy of strassenfeger .
after all , they all came to watch brecht .
it felt appropriate to get close to the masses .
so they blinded the homeless with their pearly white teeth , and smiled like there was no tomorrow .
it was a spectacle worth of buñuel 's " discreet charm of the bourgeoise . " but those were exactly the kind of people , who - under different , non-theatrical , non-brechtian circumstances - would have looked the other way .
luckily for them , they do n't normally ride the subway that much . brecht in a post-revolutionary age when mack the knife cried out his famous invective - " what is robbing a bank when compared to founding a bank ? " - his words had to come out as petulant rather than subversive , especially to deutsche bank president josef ackermann , one of the most prominent guests at the premiere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandauer 's reading of brecht was too tame and unexciting what 's more , " the threepenny opera " at the admiralspalast was sponsored by deutsche bank - a company that celebrated its record yields of 2.5 billion euros two years ago by firing more than 6,000 people , or every tenth employee . even to brecht - who was himself no stranger to wheelings and dealings of all sorts , and whose austrian passport allowed him to dream his communist dream in east berlin while keeping a bank account in switzerland - the happy artistic collective bringing together a punk rocker and a big banker would have seemed self-defeating . brecht said once that his work was " the swan song of the millennium .

as the crowning but ultimately disappointing event of the 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , a star-studded production of " the threepenny opera " opened in berlin . the fact that brecht 's " threepenny opera " opened at the admiralspalast in berlin was a little miracle in itself .
the historic building from the beginning of the 20th century , hastily renovated by entrepreneur falk walter , was not deemed safe for public use until the day before the premiere , when city officials finally gave their seal of approval . the media feverishly followed the will-they-or-wo n't-they drama of the most talked-about production of the year .
in the end , all those wires ominously sticking out of the walls , blotches of paint , mops , buckets and vaguely disguised piles of rubble indicated that the building - originally an ice rink and a luxury spa , which then , in the 1920s , became a theater - was and still is a construction site , an unfinished project .
very much like brecht 's revolutionary dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the admiralspalast is still not fully renovated the scent of undried paint - known to cause either mild headaches or mild hallucinations , depending on your age and social status - mixed well with the perfumes of berlin society ladies , while one toilette sign in the theater foyer still pointed to a hole in the wall , covered by a simple wooden board . this hole in the wall - a real metaphoric nowhere - would have been better suited as backdrop for beckett 's " waiting for godot .

as the crowning but ultimately disappointing event of the 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , a star-studded production of " the threepenny opera " opened in berlin . the fact that brecht 's " threepenny opera " opened at the admiralspalast in berlin was a little miracle in itself .
the historic building from the beginning of the 20th century , hastily renovated by entrepreneur falk walter , was not deemed safe for public use until the day before the premiere , when city officials finally gave their seal of approval . the media feverishly followed the will-they-or-wo n't-they drama of the most talked-about production of the year .
in the end , all those wires ominously sticking out of the walls , blotches of paint , mops , buckets and vaguely disguised piles of rubble indicated that the building - originally an ice rink and a luxury spa , which then , in the 1920s , became a theater - was and still is a construction site , an unfinished project .
very much like brecht 's revolutionary dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the admiralspalast is still not fully renovated the scent of undried paint - known to cause either mild headaches or mild hallucinations , depending on your age and social status - mixed well with the perfumes of berlin society ladies , while one toilette sign in the theater foyer still pointed to a hole in the wall , covered by a simple wooden board . this hole in the wall - a real metaphoric nowhere - would have been better suited as backdrop for beckett 's " waiting for godot . "
estragon : " shall we go ? "
vladimir : " let 's go . "
stage directions : " they do n't move . " " at least , the stage is standing , " said a bartender before the saturday night performance , offering a glass of champagne to an elderly lady while performing an acrobatic balancing act over several crates of beer . an anticlimax and while the stage was standing , the performance fell flat .
with all the media hullabaloo leading up to the premiere , one was almost convinced it was going to be something special . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director karl maria brandauer -lrb- left -rrb- and punk rocker campino austrian actor and director klaus maria brandauer assembled a stellar ensemble .
german punk singer campino of the band die toten hosen played the role of mack the knife , king of thieves . gottfried john - known to film buffs from several fassbinder movies and to the rest of the universe as the evil russian general arkadii grigorovich ourumov from james bond 's russian stunt in " golden eye " - played mr. peachum . katrin sass - one of most popular actresses from former east germany , who experienced a pan-german comeback with her touching appearance in the blockbuster hit " good bye , lenin " - added quite a bit of slapstick cheekiness to the role of manipulative alcoholic mrs. peachum . but most of the ensemble appeared helpless in an overly conventional production which lacked both the dramatic gusto and political audacity .
staging the play as an authentic costume drama set in london in the 1920s , brandauer created a sluggish , outdated and all too reverent production which failed to excite let alone provoke . a betrayal of sorts heiner müller said in an interview once that " to use brecht without criticizing him is to betray him . "
turning " the threepenny opera " into a wax museum musical was one such betrayal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit minichmayr -lrb- polly -rrb- and campino -lrb- mack the knife -rrb- the highlight of the evening turned out to be birgit minichmayr 's performance as polly .
the austrian-born actress , who joined berlin 's volksbühne theater in 2004 , after earning her laurels at vienna 's burgtheater , showed once again that she is one of the most exciting young german-speaking actresses today . her polly was both loud and vulnerable , rebellious and scared .
the otherworldly force of her voice , which assumes a subtle huskiness in the higher register , turned her rendering of pirate jenny 's song into a moment of chilling , spectral beauty . sweeping the roads the most contradictory - and most brechtian - moment of the evening happened outside the theater .
the elegant guests were greeted on arrival by a couple of homeless berliners selling a special edition of their newspaper , strassenfeger -lrb- street sweeper -rrb- , entirely dedicated to the new production of " the threepenny opera . "

but it 's still a long way to peace , says dw 's peter philipp . after weeks of discussion , the un security council managed to find a formula for a ceasefire in lebanon .
the weapons have been silent since monday morning .
but things are not necessarily that simple : resolution 1701 would not be the first un resolution about the middle east that awakens hopes which it does n't fulfill .
not that the security council had n't tried its best : stopping the recent fighting was significantly more complicated than in other crisis and war situations .
this was no war between two states with regular armed forces , but rather one of those " asymmetrical " conflicts that have started replacing " traditional " wars . the success of the un resolution depends not on the good will of the security council members , but only on the warring parties .
and both parties apparently agreed to it only because they realized that things could n't go on like this any longer . a no-win situation the israeli government does not acknowledge this openly , but it must have realized that it got itself involved in a military adventure that it could n't win at any level : even the strongest army in the region is powerless against the well-equipped and extremely motivated group of local guerillas such as hezbollah .
and it was madness to think that it was possible to defeat or expel hezbollah with air strikes . israel also lost against the people in lebanon who do not support hezbollah : massive israeli attacks on civilians and the infrastructure in the country have cost israel its last bits of sympathy and understanding in lebanon . it was no different internationally .
israel complained that the media reported one-sidedly and that the lebanese suffering was pushed more to the foreground than that of the israelis .
it was pushed to foreground because it was many times bigger and because it was caused by a state whose prime minister only recently claimed that it had the most moral army in the world . hezbollah could n't afford to go on like this but hezbollah must have also begun to realize that it can not afford a war of this kind in the long term .
although they did surprise everybody - the israelis , in particular - with their firmness and endurance , they would have in the long term succumbed to the massive israeli strikes and led lebanon to disaster along the way . even as it is , hezbollah bears the responsibility of having started this war .
but it knew how to present itself as the only resistance group that should be taken seriously .
had the war escalated even further , hezbollah would have probably lost this sympathy bonus from the lebanese people . and now ?
there is a long way from a ceasefire - if it is kept - to permanent peace .
it will surely take several weeks for the lebanese and international forces to replace the israeli troops in southern lebanon .
in the meantime , they will not want to leave the country and hezbollah will also not want to put their arms to rest . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east -lrb- tt -rrb- . peter philipp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates sending soldiers to middle east as a ceasefire to the fighting in lebanon begins to look more likely , the debate over whether germany should take part in international peacekeeping there has divided the country 's politicians .

one homeless association in munich is taking that perception even further by actually turning a corrective facility into a four star establishment . the organization behind biss magazine , a publication sold on the streets of the bavarian city by munich 's homeless , is looking to buy the women 's and young offender 's prison in the neudeck area and turn it into a luxury hotel .
the building is likely to cost biss in the region of 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 638,650 -rrb- . biss is looking to invest between 13 and 14 million euros in the project which will turn the prison into a 66-room establishment with an adjoining complex of 14 senior citizen apartments . city 's homeless to staff hotel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biss hopes to give homeless people a chance to find employment - and accomodation - at the hotel the association hopes to employ between 25 and 40 homeless people as staff in the hotel , providing them with the means to afford their own accommodation . the current prison population will be moved to a new facility in 2008 , leaving the 6,000-square-meter -lrb- 64,500 square feet -rrb- building up for grabs .
if the prison building is not given over to any official state government department , it will be made available on the open public market , leaving the way free for biss to acquire the property . the organization has already hired a design team to draw up plans for the possible make-over .
architect henning dickhoff from a + p architecture in munich told the süddeutsche zeitung that the preparatory design work had been completed and a preliminary construction inquiry had been lodged with the city council . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de globetrotting behind bars traveling around the globe for a year and visiting 60 countries along the way might be a dream for many .

but experts are n't sure how long the boom can last . the german economy , the biggest in the 12-country euro zone , is growing at its fastest rate since the dot.com boom five years ago , data showed on monday .
the growth can be attributed in part to increased construction spending and booming company profits . germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter of this year compared with the first quarter , federal statistics office destatis said in a statement . that represented an acceleration from the 0.7 percent growth rate in the preceding three months and was the fastest rate of growth since the first quarter of 2001 . data from the eu 's eurostat data agency showed monday that german expansion had helped the euro zone economy to hit its fastest rate of growth in six years in the second quarter . domestic growth stimuli bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup in germany brought in fans - and a few extra euros this time , growth in germany was not solely export-driven , as it had been in previous economic upturns in the country . " growth impulses are coming primarily from inside germany , " destatis said .
" while the momentum of foreign trade has weakened , it was primarily investment in construction and equipment that contributed to the economic pick-up in the second quarter . " over 12 months , growth measured one percent in the second quarter because of differences in the number of working days .
when adjusted for working days , growth was at 2.4 percent . the unseasonably warm weather helped boost activity in outdoor sectors such as the construction industry and companies are investing their record-high profits in new plants and equipment . world cup and upcoming vat increase the world cup soccer championships , held in germany in june and july , also provided a boost to consumer spending , a sector had previously held back the development of a broad-based recovery in germany . furthermore , households are bringing forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the planned rise in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent , which will take effect in january . the ministry of economy in berlin hailed the second-quarter gdp data as proof that the economic gridlock of recent years had finally been lifted . " the recovery has gained in breadth and strength , " said economy minister michael glos .
" the situation on the labor market has improved noticeably .
the outlook for this year is decidedly positive . " the dihk federation of german chambers of commerce agreed . " our forecast for full-year growth of up to two percent is within reach , " dihk president martin wansleben added . growth across the euro zone other euro zone countries , such as france and the netherlands , have similarly beaten growth expectations for the second quarter , suggesting that the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- may have to revise its own growth forecasts for the entire euro area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : value-added tax will jump from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 the euro zone expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter , separate data published by the eu 's statistics office eurostat showed on monday .
the expansion of the euro zone economy added to the arguments for further interest rate hikes by the ecb . the ecb 's benchmark refinancing rate currently stands at 3 percent and is expected to rise to 3.5 percent by the end of this year in order to keep a lid on inflation in the 12 countries that share the euro . " the german gdp data are almost too good to be true , " said bank of america economist holger schmieding .
" in less than two years , germany seems to have turned from the sick man of europe into one of the old continent 's ' wunderkinder . " ' some say euro zone growth to start losing steam however , some analysts were skeptical about whether the german economy would be able to maintain the same momentum during the coming months given the planned rise in vat , which experts believe will put the brakes on consumer demand next year . " the weather-driven rebound in second-quarter construction will not be repeated in the third quarter , " said schmieding at bank of america .
" retail sales may recede after the world cup effect in may and june " and the vat increase will be also provide a temporary hit to activity . the european commission in brussels also predicted that euro zone growth would probably start losing steam soon , with analysts pointing the finger at the stronger euro , slowing global growth , high oil prices , higher interest rates and tighter fiscal policy . in germany , dihk similarly warned that german growth may soon pass its zenith , not least because of the vat hike and the one-off nature of the world cup effect . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european central bank raises rates on inflation fears the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- raised the key euro-zone interest rate by a quarter point to 3.0 percent on thursday , making borrowing costs the highest in three-and-a-half years in order to curb inflation .

but experts are n't sure how long the boom can last . the german economy , the biggest in the 12-country euro zone , is growing at its fastest rate since the dot.com boom five years ago , data showed on monday .
the growth can be attributed in part to increased construction spending and booming company profits . germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter of this year compared with the first quarter , federal statistics office destatis said in a statement . that represented an acceleration from the 0.7 percent growth rate in the preceding three months and was the fastest rate of growth since the first quarter of 2001 . data from the eu 's eurostat data agency showed monday that german expansion had helped the euro zone economy to hit its fastest rate of growth in six years in the second quarter . domestic growth stimuli bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup in germany brought in fans - and a few extra euros this time , growth in germany was not solely export-driven , as it had been in previous economic upturns in the country . " growth impulses are coming primarily from inside germany , " destatis said .
" while the momentum of foreign trade has weakened , it was primarily investment in construction and equipment that contributed to the economic pick-up in the second quarter . " over 12 months , growth measured one percent in the second quarter because of differences in the number of working days .
when adjusted for working days , growth was at 2.4 percent . the unseasonably warm weather helped boost activity in outdoor sectors such as the construction industry and companies are investing their record-high profits in new plants and equipment . world cup and upcoming vat increase the world cup soccer championships , held in germany in june and july , also provided a boost to consumer spending , a sector had previously held back the development of a broad-based recovery in germany . furthermore , households are bringing forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the planned rise in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent , which will take effect in january . the ministry of economy in berlin hailed the second-quarter gdp data as proof that the economic gridlock of recent years had finally been lifted . " the recovery has gained in breadth and strength , " said economy minister michael glos .
" the situation on the labor market has improved noticeably .
the outlook for this year is decidedly positive . " the dihk federation of german chambers of commerce agreed .

still , the issue is highly sensitive . germany 's ministers of defense and interior affairs said the country would be prepared to contribute to an international peacekeeping force in lebanon once the united nations ' security council specifies a mandate for the operation this week . german chancellor angela merkel edged around the question in the past , saying it was too early to decide on germany 's possible roles in a peacekeeping force .
the question of sending german troops to the israel-lebanon border has divided germany . government spokesman thomas steg told reporters there would be more clarity over what role germany would likely fulfill by the end of the week .
he added that the cabinet would discuss the matter next week , and that any final decision would be made in september when parliament reconvenes following the summer break . steg said that germany 's future role in lebanon would also be limited by its means .

" if there is one area of the world where german soldiers have no place , it is the israeli border , " westerwelle told the saarbrücker zeitung .
" our history forbids it . " israeli prime minister ehud olmert has given strong backing to the idea of including german troops , but for many jews in germany , the idea of sending german soldiers to the middle east 60 years after the murder of 6 million jews raises moral questions . germany 's central council of jews has said the thought that the grandchildren of perpetrators of the holocaust might find themselves shooting at the grandchildren of the nazis ' victims was impossible to contemplate . italy and france are leading the scramble to beef up the small un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- which will be key to making the tenuous cessation of hostilities .five nations - indonesia , malaysia , morocco , spain and turkey - have already agreed to contribute troops to the international force , the lebanese government said on sunday . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates sending soldiers to middle east as a ceasefire to the fighting in lebanon begins to look more likely , the debate over whether germany should take part in international peacekeeping there has divided the country 's politicians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : günter grass grass defends long silence as book sales soar judging grass opinion : a late confession is better than no confession at all " i do n't hold onto ideological distortions " germany -pipe- 14.08.2006 nobel prize winner grass under fire for belated ss confession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : someone smeared swastikas on the door to grass ' house in 1997 nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he was drafted into nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss elite force during world war ii . the 78-year-old grass told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that the stunning confession would feature in his memoir " peeling onions , " which is due to appear in september .
so far , it had only been known that the author , best known abroad for his 1959 novel " the tin drum , " was conscripted into the german air defense forces . but in his autobiography he also recounted that he tried to join the third reich 's submarine forces when he was 15 years old but was rejected because he was too young .
he said that he was drafted into the elite waffen ss the following year but denied suggestions that he joined willingly . grass , for many years a prominent leftist and pacifist , was wounded in 1945 and sent to an american prisoner of war camp . " i wanted to make clear once again what happened then and above all things concerning me , " he told the newspaper .
" my silence for all these years is one of the reasons why i wrote this book .
it had to come out . " contemporaries disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter kempowski fellow german author walter kempowski was among the first of his grass 's contemporaries to comment , telling the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that the revelation was " a bit late " while grass biographer michael jürgs said he was " personally disappointed " and lamented " the end of a moral authority . " leading literature critic hellmuth karasek criticized the timing but also agreed there was no reason to reproach grass as he had done much in his career and life since the war to inspire people . " the fact he was in the ss at 17 is by itself a misdemeanor - had grass not been one to throw his weight around as a moral authority so much since then , " karasek told german radio .
" if i were cynical , i would say he did not reveal it sooner at the risk of not winning a nobel prize .
do n't misunderstand me : grass deserved the nobel prize more than any other german writer .
but everything now has to be seen in a new light . " joachim fest , a leading historian , told der spiegel magazine : " after 60 years , this confession comes a bit too late .
i ca n't understand how someone who for decades set himself up as a moral authority , a rather smug one , could pull this off . " michael wolffsohn , a prominent military historian , also faulted grass for waiting so long .
grass 's " moralizing , though not his storytelling , life 's work is devalued by his persistent silence , " wolffsohn wrote in the online netzeitung daily . cdu politician demands return of prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 meanwhile , wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union called for grass to return the nobel prize he won for literature in 1999 .
börnsen told the german daily bild that grass should adhere to his own moral standards and " honorably return the prize . " sections of the german press were equally deflated by the admission . " grass 's confession right before the publication of his autobiography leaves behind a bad taste of book promotion , " wrote bild am sonntag newspaper columnist helmut böger .
" even after his admission , grass remains germany 's most important living author .
but he has lost his standing as a moral authority .
he can not be castigated for being a member of the ss ...
but he can be for lying about it for 60 years . " however , ralph giordano , a leading german-jewish writer , said he would not condemn grass and praised his belated confession . " it 's good what günter grass has now done , " giordano said .
" what 's worse than making a mistake is not coming to terms with it .
his example also shows how seducible young people can be . " the muted reactions outside of germany were mostly of displeasure and disappointment . robert fulford , a columnist with canada 's national post , accused grass of hypocrisy . " during his long career as a public man , grass has never passed up a chance to speak out for outspokenness , " he wrote .
" ' the job of a citizen is to keep his mouth open , ' he liked to say - though not necessarily in all cases , of course . " walesa calls for renouncement of citizenship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel peace prize winner lech walesa former polish president lech walesa took an even harder line by demanding that grass renounce his honorary citizenship of gdansk .
grass , who was born in the baltic port of danzig , now the polish city of gdansk , became an honorary citizen of the city in 1993 . " an uncomfortable situation has developed , " walesa , who is also an honorary citizen of gdansk , said in an interview monday with the bild newspaper .
" i do not feel comfortable in that company .
i do not know whether one should consider revoking the title .
if it had been known he was in the ss , he would never have received the honor .
it would be best if he relinquished it himself . " in his admission , grass said he never fired a shot during his time with the feared elite force whose notoriety he only grasped once his unit had been defeated , when one of his superiors ordered him to get rid of his uniform . nuremberg trials revealed truth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waffen ss was notoriously brutal the feared paramilitary unit was branded a criminal organization at the nuremberg war crimes trials .
only then , grass claimed , did he start to understand . " i was stupid enough to believe that germans would not do such things and took it all for propaganda , " he said .
the revelations of ss brutality at nuremberg trials then caused him " feelings of guilt and shame . " grass has spent the decades since the end of the war demanding that germans come to terms with their nazi past by coming clean on it . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the taboo breaker with his new novel , nobel-prize winner günther grass confronts a subject previously dealt with only by the right wing .

so far , it had only been known that the author , best known abroad for his 1959 novel " the tin drum , " was conscripted into the german air defense forces . but in his autobiography he also recounted that he tried to join the third reich 's submarine forces when he was 15 years old but was rejected because he was too young .
he said that he was drafted into the elite waffen ss the following year but denied suggestions that he joined willingly . grass , for many years a prominent leftist and pacifist , was wounded in 1945 and sent to an american prisoner of war camp . " i wanted to make clear once again what happened then and above all things concerning me , " he told the newspaper .
" my silence for all these years is one of the reasons why i wrote this book .
it had to come out . " contemporaries disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter kempowski fellow german author walter kempowski was among the first of his grass 's contemporaries to comment , telling the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that the revelation was " a bit late " while grass biographer michael jürgs said he was " personally disappointed " and lamented " the end of a moral authority . " leading literature critic hellmuth karasek criticized the timing but also agreed there was no reason to reproach grass as he had done much in his career and life since the war to inspire people . " the fact he was in the ss at 17 is by itself a misdemeanor - had grass not been one to throw his weight around as a moral authority so much since then , " karasek told german radio .
" if i were cynical , i would say he did not reveal it sooner at the risk of not winning a nobel prize .
do n't misunderstand me : grass deserved the nobel prize more than any other german writer .
but everything now has to be seen in a new light . " joachim fest , a leading historian , told der spiegel magazine : " after 60 years , this confession comes a bit too late .
i ca n't understand how someone who for decades set himself up as a moral authority , a rather smug one , could pull this off . " michael wolffsohn , a prominent military historian , also faulted grass for waiting so long .
grass 's " moralizing , though not his storytelling , life 's work is devalued by his persistent silence , " wolffsohn wrote in the online netzeitung daily . cdu politician demands return of prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 meanwhile , wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union called for grass to return the nobel prize he won for literature in 1999 .
börnsen told the german daily bild that grass should adhere to his own moral standards and " honorably return the prize . " sections of the german press were equally deflated by the admission . " grass 's confession right before the publication of his autobiography leaves behind a bad taste of book promotion , " wrote bild am sonntag newspaper columnist helmut böger .
" even after his admission , grass remains germany 's most important living author .
but he has lost his standing as a moral authority .
he can not be castigated for being a member of the ss ...
but he can be for lying about it for 60 years . " however , ralph giordano , a leading german-jewish writer , said he would not condemn grass and praised his belated confession . " it 's good what günter grass has now done , " giordano said .
" what 's worse than making a mistake is not coming to terms with it .
his example also shows how seducible young people can be . " the muted reactions outside of germany were mostly of displeasure and disappointment . robert fulford , a columnist with canada 's national post , accused grass of hypocrisy . " during his long career as a public man , grass has never passed up a chance to speak out for outspokenness , " he wrote .
" ' the job of a citizen is to keep his mouth open , ' he liked to say - though not necessarily in all cases , of course . " walesa calls for renouncement of citizenship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel peace prize winner lech walesa former polish president lech walesa took an even harder line by demanding that grass renounce his honorary citizenship of gdansk .
grass , who was born in the baltic port of danzig , now the polish city of gdansk , became an honorary citizen of the city in 1993 . " an uncomfortable situation has developed , " walesa , who is also an honorary citizen of gdansk , said in an interview monday with the bild newspaper .
" i do not feel comfortable in that company .
i do not know whether one should consider revoking the title .
if it had been known he was in the ss , he would never have received the honor .
it would be best if he relinquished it himself . " in his admission , grass said he never fired a shot during his time with the feared elite force whose notoriety he only grasped once his unit had been defeated , when one of his superiors ordered him to get rid of his uniform . nuremberg trials revealed truth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waffen ss was notoriously brutal the feared paramilitary unit was branded a criminal organization at the nuremberg war crimes trials .
only then , grass claimed , did he start to understand . " i was stupid enough to believe that germans would not do such things and took it all for propaganda , " he said .
the revelations of ss brutality at nuremberg trials then caused him " feelings of guilt and shame .

grass , who was born in the baltic port of danzig , now the polish city of gdansk , became an honorary citizen of the city in 1993 . " an uncomfortable situation has developed , " walesa , who is also an honorary citizen of gdansk , said in an interview monday with the bild newspaper .
" i do not feel comfortable in that company .
i do not know whether one should consider revoking the title .
if it had been known he was in the ss , he would never have received the honor .
it would be best if he relinquished it himself .

only then , grass claimed , did he start to understand . " i was stupid enough to believe that germans would not do such things and took it all for propaganda , " he said .
the revelations of ss brutality at nuremberg trials then caused him " feelings of guilt and shame .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : celebrating bertolt brecht " bertolt brecht 's influence can not be overestimated " bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere a communist in a city of angels culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2006 brandauer 's betrayal of brecht großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the threepenny opera " has been the most talked-about play in berlin this year berlin is in brecht fever .
as the crowning but ultimately disappointing event of the 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , a star-studded production of " the threepenny opera " opened in berlin . the fact that brecht 's " threepenny opera " opened at the admiralspalast in berlin was a little miracle in itself .
the historic building from the beginning of the 20th century , hastily renovated by entrepreneur falk walter , was not deemed safe for public use until the day before the premiere , when city officials finally gave their seal of approval . the media feverishly followed the will-they-or-wo n't-they drama of the most talked-about production of the year .
in the end , all those wires ominously sticking out of the walls , blotches of paint , mops , buckets and vaguely disguised piles of rubble indicated that the building - originally an ice rink and a luxury spa , which then , in the 1920s , became a theater - was and still is a construction site , an unfinished project .
very much like brecht 's revolutionary dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the admiralspalast is still not fully renovated the scent of undried paint - known to cause either mild headaches or mild hallucinations , depending on your age and social status - mixed well with the perfumes of berlin society ladies , while one toilette sign in the theater foyer still pointed to a hole in the wall , covered by a simple wooden board . this hole in the wall - a real metaphoric nowhere - would have been better suited as backdrop for beckett 's " waiting for godot . "
estragon : " shall we go ? "
vladimir : " let 's go . "
stage directions : " they do n't move . " " at least , the stage is standing , " said a bartender before the saturday night performance , offering a glass of champagne to an elderly lady while performing an acrobatic balancing act over several crates of beer . an anticlimax and while the stage was standing , the performance fell flat .
with all the media hullabaloo leading up to the premiere , one was almost convinced it was going to be something special . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director karl maria brandauer -lrb- left -rrb- and punk rocker campino austrian actor and director klaus maria brandauer assembled a stellar ensemble .
german punk singer campino of the band die toten hosen played the role of mack the knife , king of thieves . gottfried john - known to film buffs from several fassbinder movies and to the rest of the universe as the evil russian general arkadii grigorovich ourumov from james bond 's russian stunt in " golden eye " - played mr. peachum . katrin sass - one of most popular actresses from former east germany , who experienced a pan-german comeback with her touching appearance in the blockbuster hit " good bye , lenin " - added quite a bit of slapstick cheekiness to the role of manipulative alcoholic mrs. peachum . but most of the ensemble appeared helpless in an overly conventional production which lacked both the dramatic gusto and political audacity .
staging the play as an authentic costume drama set in london in the 1920s , brandauer created a sluggish , outdated and all too reverent production which failed to excite let alone provoke . a betrayal of sorts heiner müller said in an interview once that " to use brecht without criticizing him is to betray him . "
turning " the threepenny opera " into a wax museum musical was one such betrayal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit minichmayr -lrb- polly -rrb- and campino -lrb- mack the knife -rrb- the highlight of the evening turned out to be birgit minichmayr 's performance as polly .
the austrian-born actress , who joined berlin 's volksbühne theater in 2004 , after earning her laurels at vienna 's burgtheater , showed once again that she is one of the most exciting young german-speaking actresses today . her polly was both loud and vulnerable , rebellious and scared .
the otherworldly force of her voice , which assumes a subtle huskiness in the higher register , turned her rendering of pirate jenny 's song into a moment of chilling , spectral beauty . sweeping the roads the most contradictory - and most brechtian - moment of the evening happened outside the theater .
the elegant guests were greeted on arrival by a couple of homeless berliners selling a special edition of their newspaper , strassenfeger -lrb- street sweeper -rrb- , entirely dedicated to the new production of " the threepenny opera . "
it is fascinating what kind of advertising a budget of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.5 million -rrb- can get you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katrin sass -lrb- left -rrb- played mrs. peachum with a great sense of humor one after another , the well-off and the extremely well-off couples stopped at the theater entry to buy themselves a copy of strassenfeger .
after all , they all came to watch brecht .

as the crowning but ultimately disappointing event of the 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , a star-studded production of " the threepenny opera " opened in berlin . the fact that brecht 's " threepenny opera " opened at the admiralspalast in berlin was a little miracle in itself .
the historic building from the beginning of the 20th century , hastily renovated by entrepreneur falk walter , was not deemed safe for public use until the day before the premiere , when city officials finally gave their seal of approval . the media feverishly followed the will-they-or-wo n't-they drama of the most talked-about production of the year .
in the end , all those wires ominously sticking out of the walls , blotches of paint , mops , buckets and vaguely disguised piles of rubble indicated that the building - originally an ice rink and a luxury spa , which then , in the 1920s , became a theater - was and still is a construction site , an unfinished project .
very much like brecht 's revolutionary dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the admiralspalast is still not fully renovated the scent of undried paint - known to cause either mild headaches or mild hallucinations , depending on your age and social status - mixed well with the perfumes of berlin society ladies , while one toilette sign in the theater foyer still pointed to a hole in the wall , covered by a simple wooden board . this hole in the wall - a real metaphoric nowhere - would have been better suited as backdrop for beckett 's " waiting for godot . "
estragon : " shall we go ? "
vladimir : " let 's go . "
stage directions : " they do n't move . " " at least , the stage is standing , " said a bartender before the saturday night performance , offering a glass of champagne to an elderly lady while performing an acrobatic balancing act over several crates of beer . an anticlimax and while the stage was standing , the performance fell flat .
with all the media hullabaloo leading up to the premiere , one was almost convinced it was going to be something special . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director karl maria brandauer -lrb- left -rrb- and punk rocker campino austrian actor and director klaus maria brandauer assembled a stellar ensemble .
german punk singer campino of the band die toten hosen played the role of mack the knife , king of thieves . gottfried john - known to film buffs from several fassbinder movies and to the rest of the universe as the evil russian general arkadii grigorovich ourumov from james bond 's russian stunt in " golden eye " - played mr. peachum . katrin sass - one of most popular actresses from former east germany , who experienced a pan-german comeback with her touching appearance in the blockbuster hit " good bye , lenin " - added quite a bit of slapstick cheekiness to the role of manipulative alcoholic mrs. peachum . but most of the ensemble appeared helpless in an overly conventional production which lacked both the dramatic gusto and political audacity .
staging the play as an authentic costume drama set in london in the 1920s , brandauer created a sluggish , outdated and all too reverent production which failed to excite let alone provoke . a betrayal of sorts heiner müller said in an interview once that " to use brecht without criticizing him is to betray him . "
turning " the threepenny opera " into a wax museum musical was one such betrayal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit minichmayr -lrb- polly -rrb- and campino -lrb- mack the knife -rrb- the highlight of the evening turned out to be birgit minichmayr 's performance as polly .
the austrian-born actress , who joined berlin 's volksbühne theater in 2004 , after earning her laurels at vienna 's burgtheater , showed once again that she is one of the most exciting young german-speaking actresses today . her polly was both loud and vulnerable , rebellious and scared .
the otherworldly force of her voice , which assumes a subtle huskiness in the higher register , turned her rendering of pirate jenny 's song into a moment of chilling , spectral beauty . sweeping the roads the most contradictory - and most brechtian - moment of the evening happened outside the theater .
the elegant guests were greeted on arrival by a couple of homeless berliners selling a special edition of their newspaper , strassenfeger -lrb- street sweeper -rrb- , entirely dedicated to the new production of " the threepenny opera . "
it is fascinating what kind of advertising a budget of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.5 million -rrb- can get you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katrin sass -lrb- left -rrb- played mrs. peachum with a great sense of humor one after another , the well-off and the extremely well-off couples stopped at the theater entry to buy themselves a copy of strassenfeger .
after all , they all came to watch brecht .
it felt appropriate to get close to the masses .
so they blinded the homeless with their pearly white teeth , and smiled like there was no tomorrow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : celebrating bertolt brecht " bertolt brecht 's influence can not be overestimated " bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere a communist in a city of angels culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2006 brandauer 's betrayal of brecht großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the threepenny opera " has been the most talked-about play in berlin this year berlin is in brecht fever .
as the crowning but ultimately disappointing event of the 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , a star-studded production of " the threepenny opera " opened in berlin . the fact that brecht 's " threepenny opera " opened at the admiralspalast in berlin was a little miracle in itself .
the historic building from the beginning of the 20th century , hastily renovated by entrepreneur falk walter , was not deemed safe for public use until the day before the premiere , when city officials finally gave their seal of approval . the media feverishly followed the will-they-or-wo n't-they drama of the most talked-about production of the year .
in the end , all those wires ominously sticking out of the walls , blotches of paint , mops , buckets and vaguely disguised piles of rubble indicated that the building - originally an ice rink and a luxury spa , which then , in the 1920s , became a theater - was and still is a construction site , an unfinished project .
very much like brecht 's revolutionary dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the admiralspalast is still not fully renovated the scent of undried paint - known to cause either mild headaches or mild hallucinations , depending on your age and social status - mixed well with the perfumes of berlin society ladies , while one toilette sign in the theater foyer still pointed to a hole in the wall , covered by a simple wooden board . this hole in the wall - a real metaphoric nowhere - would have been better suited as backdrop for beckett 's " waiting for godot . "
estragon : " shall we go ? "
vladimir : " let 's go . "
stage directions : " they do n't move . " " at least , the stage is standing , " said a bartender before the saturday night performance , offering a glass of champagne to an elderly lady while performing an acrobatic balancing act over several crates of beer . an anticlimax and while the stage was standing , the performance fell flat .
with all the media hullabaloo leading up to the premiere , one was almost convinced it was going to be something special . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director karl maria brandauer -lrb- left -rrb- and punk rocker campino austrian actor and director klaus maria brandauer assembled a stellar ensemble .
german punk singer campino of the band die toten hosen played the role of mack the knife , king of thieves . gottfried john - known to film buffs from several fassbinder movies and to the rest of the universe as the evil russian general arkadii grigorovich ourumov from james bond 's russian stunt in " golden eye " - played mr. peachum . katrin sass - one of most popular actresses from former east germany , who experienced a pan-german comeback with her touching appearance in the blockbuster hit " good bye , lenin " - added quite a bit of slapstick cheekiness to the role of manipulative alcoholic mrs. peachum . but most of the ensemble appeared helpless in an overly conventional production which lacked both the dramatic gusto and political audacity .
staging the play as an authentic costume drama set in london in the 1920s , brandauer created a sluggish , outdated and all too reverent production which failed to excite let alone provoke . a betrayal of sorts heiner müller said in an interview once that " to use brecht without criticizing him is to betray him . "
turning " the threepenny opera " into a wax museum musical was one such betrayal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit minichmayr -lrb- polly -rrb- and campino -lrb- mack the knife -rrb- the highlight of the evening turned out to be birgit minichmayr 's performance as polly .
the austrian-born actress , who joined berlin 's volksbühne theater in 2004 , after earning her laurels at vienna 's burgtheater , showed once again that she is one of the most exciting young german-speaking actresses today . her polly was both loud and vulnerable , rebellious and scared .
the otherworldly force of her voice , which assumes a subtle huskiness in the higher register , turned her rendering of pirate jenny 's song into a moment of chilling , spectral beauty . sweeping the roads the most contradictory - and most brechtian - moment of the evening happened outside the theater .
the elegant guests were greeted on arrival by a couple of homeless berliners selling a special edition of their newspaper , strassenfeger -lrb- street sweeper -rrb- , entirely dedicated to the new production of " the threepenny opera . "
it is fascinating what kind of advertising a budget of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.5 million -rrb- can get you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katrin sass -lrb- left -rrb- played mrs. peachum with a great sense of humor one after another , the well-off and the extremely well-off couples stopped at the theater entry to buy themselves a copy of strassenfeger .
after all , they all came to watch brecht .
it felt appropriate to get close to the masses .
so they blinded the homeless with their pearly white teeth , and smiled like there was no tomorrow .
it was a spectacle worth of buñuel 's " discreet charm of the bourgeoise . " but those were exactly the kind of people , who - under different , non-theatrical , non-brechtian circumstances - would have looked the other way .
luckily for them , they do n't normally ride the subway that much . brecht in a post-revolutionary age when mack the knife cried out his famous invective - " what is robbing a bank when compared to founding a bank ? " - his words had to come out as petulant rather than subversive , especially to deutsche bank president josef ackermann , one of the most prominent guests at the premiere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandauer 's reading of brecht was too tame and unexciting what 's more , " the threepenny opera " at the admiralspalast was sponsored by deutsche bank - a company that celebrated its record yields of 2.5 billion euros two years ago by firing more than 6,000 people , or every tenth employee . even to brecht - who was himself no stranger to wheelings and dealings of all sorts , and whose austrian passport allowed him to dream his communist dream in east berlin while keeping a bank account in switzerland - the happy artistic collective bringing together a punk rocker and a big banker would have seemed self-defeating . brecht said once that his work was " the swan song of the millennium . "
in brandauer 's no-risk production , brecht 's swan song died a muffled , echoless death . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating bertolt brecht click here for a dw-world.de dossier on brecht 's life and international influence .

but when brecht himself tried to become a hollywood screenwriter , he failed miserably .

but experts are n't sure how long the boom can last . the german economy , the biggest in the 12-country euro zone , is growing at its fastest rate since the dot.com boom five years ago , data showed on monday .
the growth can be attributed in part to increased construction spending and booming company profits . germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter of this year compared with the first quarter , federal statistics office destatis said in a statement . that represented an acceleration from the 0.7 percent growth rate in the preceding three months and was the fastest rate of growth since the first quarter of 2001 . data from the eu 's eurostat data agency showed monday that german expansion had helped the euro zone economy to hit its fastest rate of growth in six years in the second quarter . domestic growth stimuli bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup in germany brought in fans - and a few extra euros this time , growth in germany was not solely export-driven , as it had been in previous economic upturns in the country . " growth impulses are coming primarily from inside germany , " destatis said .
" while the momentum of foreign trade has weakened , it was primarily investment in construction and equipment that contributed to the economic pick-up in the second quarter . " over 12 months , growth measured one percent in the second quarter because of differences in the number of working days .
when adjusted for working days , growth was at 2.4 percent . the unseasonably warm weather helped boost activity in outdoor sectors such as the construction industry and companies are investing their record-high profits in new plants and equipment . world cup and upcoming vat increase the world cup soccer championships , held in germany in june and july , also provided a boost to consumer spending , a sector had previously held back the development of a broad-based recovery in germany . furthermore , households are bringing forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the planned rise in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent , which will take effect in january . the ministry of economy in berlin hailed the second-quarter gdp data as proof that the economic gridlock of recent years had finally been lifted . " the recovery has gained in breadth and strength , " said economy minister michael glos .
" the situation on the labor market has improved noticeably .
the outlook for this year is decidedly positive . " the dihk federation of german chambers of commerce agreed . " our forecast for full-year growth of up to two percent is within reach , " dihk president martin wansleben added . growth across the euro zone other euro zone countries , such as france and the netherlands , have similarly beaten growth expectations for the second quarter , suggesting that the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- may have to revise its own growth forecasts for the entire euro area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : value-added tax will jump from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 the euro zone expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter , separate data published by the eu 's statistics office eurostat showed on monday .
the expansion of the euro zone economy added to the arguments for further interest rate hikes by the ecb . the ecb 's benchmark refinancing rate currently stands at 3 percent and is expected to rise to 3.5 percent by the end of this year in order to keep a lid on inflation in the 12 countries that share the euro . " the german gdp data are almost too good to be true , " said bank of america economist holger schmieding .
" in less than two years , germany seems to have turned from the sick man of europe into one of the old continent 's ' wunderkinder . " ' some say euro zone growth to start losing steam however , some analysts were skeptical about whether the german economy would be able to maintain the same momentum during the coming months given the planned rise in vat , which experts believe will put the brakes on consumer demand next year . " the weather-driven rebound in second-quarter construction will not be repeated in the third quarter , " said schmieding at bank of america .
" retail sales may recede after the world cup effect in may and june " and the vat increase will be also provide a temporary hit to activity . the european commission in brussels also predicted that euro zone growth would probably start losing steam soon , with analysts pointing the finger at the stronger euro , slowing global growth , high oil prices , higher interest rates and tighter fiscal policy . in germany , dihk similarly warned that german growth may soon pass its zenith , not least because of the vat hike and the one-off nature of the world cup effect . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european central bank raises rates on inflation fears the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- raised the key euro-zone interest rate by a quarter point to 3.0 percent on thursday , making borrowing costs the highest in three-and-a-half years in order to curb inflation .

but experts are n't sure how long the boom can last . the german economy , the biggest in the 12-country euro zone , is growing at its fastest rate since the dot.com boom five years ago , data showed on monday .
the growth can be attributed in part to increased construction spending and booming company profits . germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter of this year compared with the first quarter , federal statistics office destatis said in a statement . that represented an acceleration from the 0.7 percent growth rate in the preceding three months and was the fastest rate of growth since the first quarter of 2001 . data from the eu 's eurostat data agency showed monday that german expansion had helped the euro zone economy to hit its fastest rate of growth in six years in the second quarter . domestic growth stimuli bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup in germany brought in fans - and a few extra euros this time , growth in germany was not solely export-driven , as it had been in previous economic upturns in the country . " growth impulses are coming primarily from inside germany , " destatis said .
" while the momentum of foreign trade has weakened , it was primarily investment in construction and equipment that contributed to the economic pick-up in the second quarter . " over 12 months , growth measured one percent in the second quarter because of differences in the number of working days .
when adjusted for working days , growth was at 2.4 percent . the unseasonably warm weather helped boost activity in outdoor sectors such as the construction industry and companies are investing their record-high profits in new plants and equipment . world cup and upcoming vat increase the world cup soccer championships , held in germany in june and july , also provided a boost to consumer spending , a sector had previously held back the development of a broad-based recovery in germany . furthermore , households are bringing forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the planned rise in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent , which will take effect in january . the ministry of economy in berlin hailed the second-quarter gdp data as proof that the economic gridlock of recent years had finally been lifted . " the recovery has gained in breadth and strength , " said economy minister michael glos .
" the situation on the labor market has improved noticeably .
the outlook for this year is decidedly positive . " the dihk federation of german chambers of commerce agreed . " our forecast for full-year growth of up to two percent is within reach , " dihk president martin wansleben added . growth across the euro zone other euro zone countries , such as france and the netherlands , have similarly beaten growth expectations for the second quarter , suggesting that the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- may have to revise its own growth forecasts for the entire euro area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : value-added tax will jump from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 the euro zone expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter , separate data published by the eu 's statistics office eurostat showed on monday .
the expansion of the euro zone economy added to the arguments for further interest rate hikes by the ecb . the ecb 's benchmark refinancing rate currently stands at 3 percent and is expected to rise to 3.5 percent by the end of this year in order to keep a lid on inflation in the 12 countries that share the euro . " the german gdp data are almost too good to be true , " said bank of america economist holger schmieding .
" in less than two years , germany seems to have turned from the sick man of europe into one of the old continent 's ' wunderkinder . " ' some say euro zone growth to start losing steam however , some analysts were skeptical about whether the german economy would be able to maintain the same momentum during the coming months given the planned rise in vat , which experts believe will put the brakes on consumer demand next year . " the weather-driven rebound in second-quarter construction will not be repeated in the third quarter , " said schmieding at bank of america .
" retail sales may recede after the world cup effect in may and june " and the vat increase will be also provide a temporary hit to activity . the european commission in brussels also predicted that euro zone growth would probably start losing steam soon , with analysts pointing the finger at the stronger euro , slowing global growth , high oil prices , higher interest rates and tighter fiscal policy . in germany , dihk similarly warned that german growth may soon pass its zenith , not least because of the vat hike and the one-off nature of the world cup effect . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european central bank raises rates on inflation fears the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- raised the key euro-zone interest rate by a quarter point to 3.0 percent on thursday , making borrowing costs the highest in three-and-a-half years in order to curb inflation .

so far , it had only been known that the author , best known abroad for his 1959 novel " the tin drum , " was conscripted into the german air defense forces . but in his autobiography he also recounted that he tried to join the third reich 's submarine forces when he was 15 years old but was rejected because he was too young .
he said that he was drafted into the elite waffen ss the following year but denied suggestions that he joined willingly . grass , for many years a prominent leftist and pacifist , was wounded in 1945 and sent to an american prisoner of war camp . " i wanted to make clear once again what happened then and above all things concerning me , " he told the newspaper .
" my silence for all these years is one of the reasons why i wrote this book .
it had to come out . " contemporaries disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter kempowski fellow german author walter kempowski was among the first of his grass 's contemporaries to comment , telling the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that the revelation was " a bit late " while grass biographer michael jürgs said he was " personally disappointed " and lamented " the end of a moral authority . " leading literature critic hellmuth karasek criticized the timing but also agreed there was no reason to reproach grass as he had done much in his career and life since the war to inspire people . " the fact he was in the ss at 17 is by itself a misdemeanor - had grass not been one to throw his weight around as a moral authority so much since then , " karasek told german radio .
" if i were cynical , i would say he did not reveal it sooner at the risk of not winning a nobel prize .
do n't misunderstand me : grass deserved the nobel prize more than any other german writer .
but everything now has to be seen in a new light . " joachim fest , a leading historian , told der spiegel magazine : " after 60 years , this confession comes a bit too late .
i ca n't understand how someone who for decades set himself up as a moral authority , a rather smug one , could pull this off . " michael wolffsohn , a prominent military historian , also faulted grass for waiting so long .
grass 's " moralizing , though not his storytelling , life 's work is devalued by his persistent silence , " wolffsohn wrote in the online netzeitung daily . cdu politician demands return of prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 meanwhile , wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union called for grass to return the nobel prize he won for literature in 1999 .
börnsen told the german daily bild that grass should adhere to his own moral standards and " honorably return the prize . " sections of the german press were equally deflated by the admission . " grass 's confession right before the publication of his autobiography leaves behind a bad taste of book promotion , " wrote bild am sonntag newspaper columnist helmut böger .
" even after his admission , grass remains germany 's most important living author .
but he has lost his standing as a moral authority .
he can not be castigated for being a member of the ss ...
but he can be for lying about it for 60 years . " however , ralph giordano , a leading german-jewish writer , said he would not condemn grass and praised his belated confession . " it 's good what günter grass has now done , " giordano said .
" what 's worse than making a mistake is not coming to terms with it .
his example also shows how seducible young people can be .

so far , it had only been known that the author , best known abroad for his 1959 novel " the tin drum , " was conscripted into the german air defense forces . but in his autobiography he also recounted that he tried to join the third reich 's submarine forces when he was 15 years old but was rejected because he was too young .
he said that he was drafted into the elite waffen ss the following year but denied suggestions that he joined willingly . grass , for many years a prominent leftist and pacifist , was wounded in 1945 and sent to an american prisoner of war camp . " i wanted to make clear once again what happened then and above all things concerning me , " he told the newspaper .
" my silence for all these years is one of the reasons why i wrote this book .
it had to come out . " contemporaries disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter kempowski fellow german author walter kempowski was among the first of his grass 's contemporaries to comment , telling the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that the revelation was " a bit late " while grass biographer michael jürgs said he was " personally disappointed " and lamented " the end of a moral authority . " leading literature critic hellmuth karasek criticized the timing but also agreed there was no reason to reproach grass as he had done much in his career and life since the war to inspire people . " the fact he was in the ss at 17 is by itself a misdemeanor - had grass not been one to throw his weight around as a moral authority so much since then , " karasek told german radio .
" if i were cynical , i would say he did not reveal it sooner at the risk of not winning a nobel prize .
do n't misunderstand me : grass deserved the nobel prize more than any other german writer .
but everything now has to be seen in a new light . " joachim fest , a leading historian , told der spiegel magazine : " after 60 years , this confession comes a bit too late .
i ca n't understand how someone who for decades set himself up as a moral authority , a rather smug one , could pull this off . " michael wolffsohn , a prominent military historian , also faulted grass for waiting so long .
grass 's " moralizing , though not his storytelling , life 's work is devalued by his persistent silence , " wolffsohn wrote in the online netzeitung daily . cdu politician demands return of prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 meanwhile , wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union called for grass to return the nobel prize he won for literature in 1999 .
börnsen told the german daily bild that grass should adhere to his own moral standards and " honorably return the prize . " sections of the german press were equally deflated by the admission . " grass 's confession right before the publication of his autobiography leaves behind a bad taste of book promotion , " wrote bild am sonntag newspaper columnist helmut böger .
" even after his admission , grass remains germany 's most important living author .
but he has lost his standing as a moral authority .
he can not be castigated for being a member of the ss ...
but he can be for lying about it for 60 years . " however , ralph giordano , a leading german-jewish writer , said he would not condemn grass and praised his belated confession . " it 's good what günter grass has now done , " giordano said .
" what 's worse than making a mistake is not coming to terms with it .
his example also shows how seducible young people can be . " the muted reactions outside of germany were mostly of displeasure and disappointment . robert fulford , a columnist with canada 's national post , accused grass of hypocrisy . " during his long career as a public man , grass has never passed up a chance to speak out for outspokenness , " he wrote .
" ' the job of a citizen is to keep his mouth open , ' he liked to say - though not necessarily in all cases , of course . " walesa calls for renouncement of citizenship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel peace prize winner lech walesa former polish president lech walesa took an even harder line by demanding that grass renounce his honorary citizenship of gdansk .
grass , who was born in the baltic port of danzig , now the polish city of gdansk , became an honorary citizen of the city in 1993 . " an uncomfortable situation has developed , " walesa , who is also an honorary citizen of gdansk , said in an interview monday with the bild newspaper .
" i do not feel comfortable in that company .
i do not know whether one should consider revoking the title .
if it had been known he was in the ss , he would never have received the honor .
it would be best if he relinquished it himself . " in his admission , grass said he never fired a shot during his time with the feared elite force whose notoriety he only grasped once his unit had been defeated , when one of his superiors ordered him to get rid of his uniform . nuremberg trials revealed truth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waffen ss was notoriously brutal the feared paramilitary unit was branded a criminal organization at the nuremberg war crimes trials .
only then , grass claimed , did he start to understand . " i was stupid enough to believe that germans would not do such things and took it all for propaganda , " he said .
the revelations of ss brutality at nuremberg trials then caused him " feelings of guilt and shame .

" leading literature critic hellmuth karasek criticized the timing but also agreed there was no reason to reproach grass as he had done much in his career and life since the war to inspire people . " the fact he was in the ss at 17 is by itself a misdemeanor - had grass not been one to throw his weight around as a moral authority so much since then , " karasek told german radio .
" if i were cynical , i would say he did not reveal it sooner at the risk of not winning a nobel prize .
do n't misunderstand me : grass deserved the nobel prize more than any other german writer .
but everything now has to be seen in a new light . " joachim fest , a leading historian , told der spiegel magazine : " after 60 years , this confession comes a bit too late .
i ca n't understand how someone who for decades set himself up as a moral authority , a rather smug one , could pull this off . " michael wolffsohn , a prominent military historian , also faulted grass for waiting so long .
grass 's " moralizing , though not his storytelling , life 's work is devalued by his persistent silence , " wolffsohn wrote in the online netzeitung daily . cdu politician demands return of prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 meanwhile , wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union called for grass to return the nobel prize he won for literature in 1999 .
börnsen told the german daily bild that grass should adhere to his own moral standards and " honorably return the prize . " sections of the german press were equally deflated by the admission . " grass 's confession right before the publication of his autobiography leaves behind a bad taste of book promotion , " wrote bild am sonntag newspaper columnist helmut böger .
" even after his admission , grass remains germany 's most important living author .
but he has lost his standing as a moral authority .
he can not be castigated for being a member of the ss ...
but he can be for lying about it for 60 years . " however , ralph giordano , a leading german-jewish writer , said he would not condemn grass and praised his belated confession . " it 's good what günter grass has now done , " giordano said .
" what 's worse than making a mistake is not coming to terms with it .
his example also shows how seducible young people can be . " the muted reactions outside of germany were mostly of displeasure and disappointment . robert fulford , a columnist with canada 's national post , accused grass of hypocrisy . " during his long career as a public man , grass has never passed up a chance to speak out for outspokenness , " he wrote .
" ' the job of a citizen is to keep his mouth open , ' he liked to say - though not necessarily in all cases , of course . " walesa calls for renouncement of citizenship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel peace prize winner lech walesa former polish president lech walesa took an even harder line by demanding that grass renounce his honorary citizenship of gdansk .
grass , who was born in the baltic port of danzig , now the polish city of gdansk , became an honorary citizen of the city in 1993 . " an uncomfortable situation has developed , " walesa , who is also an honorary citizen of gdansk , said in an interview monday with the bild newspaper .
" i do not feel comfortable in that company .
i do not know whether one should consider revoking the title .

so far , it had only been known that the author , best known abroad for his 1959 novel " the tin drum , " was conscripted into the german air defense forces . but in his autobiography he also recounted that he tried to join the third reich 's submarine forces when he was 15 years old but was rejected because he was too young .
he said that he was drafted into the elite waffen ss the following year but denied suggestions that he joined willingly . grass , for many years a prominent leftist and pacifist , was wounded in 1945 and sent to an american prisoner of war camp . " i wanted to make clear once again what happened then and above all things concerning me , " he told the newspaper .
" my silence for all these years is one of the reasons why i wrote this book .
it had to come out . " contemporaries disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walter kempowski fellow german author walter kempowski was among the first of his grass 's contemporaries to comment , telling the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that the revelation was " a bit late " while grass biographer michael jürgs said he was " personally disappointed " and lamented " the end of a moral authority .

but it 's still a long way to peace , says dw 's peter philipp . after weeks of discussion , the un security council managed to find a formula for a ceasefire in lebanon .
the weapons have been silent since monday morning .
but things are not necessarily that simple : resolution 1701 would not be the first un resolution about the middle east that awakens hopes which it does n't fulfill .
not that the security council had n't tried its best : stopping the recent fighting was significantly more complicated than in other crisis and war situations .
this was no war between two states with regular armed forces , but rather one of those " asymmetrical " conflicts that have started replacing " traditional " wars . the success of the un resolution depends not on the good will of the security council members , but only on the warring parties .
and both parties apparently agreed to it only because they realized that things could n't go on like this any longer . a no-win situation the israeli government does not acknowledge this openly , but it must have realized that it got itself involved in a military adventure that it could n't win at any level : even the strongest army in the region is powerless against the well-equipped and extremely motivated group of local guerillas such as hezbollah .
and it was madness to think that it was possible to defeat or expel hezbollah with air strikes . israel also lost against the people in lebanon who do not support hezbollah : massive israeli attacks on civilians and the infrastructure in the country have cost israel its last bits of sympathy and understanding in lebanon . it was no different internationally .
israel complained that the media reported one-sidedly and that the lebanese suffering was pushed more to the foreground than that of the israelis .
it was pushed to foreground because it was many times bigger and because it was caused by a state whose prime minister only recently claimed that it had the most moral army in the world . hezbollah could n't afford to go on like this but hezbollah must have also begun to realize that it can not afford a war of this kind in the long term .
although they did surprise everybody - the israelis , in particular - with their firmness and endurance , they would have in the long term succumbed to the massive israeli strikes and led lebanon to disaster along the way . even as it is , hezbollah bears the responsibility of having started this war .
but it knew how to present itself as the only resistance group that should be taken seriously .
had the war escalated even further , hezbollah would have probably lost this sympathy bonus from the lebanese people . and now ?
there is a long way from a ceasefire - if it is kept - to permanent peace .
it will surely take several weeks for the lebanese and international forces to replace the israeli troops in southern lebanon .
in the meantime , they will not want to leave the country and hezbollah will also not want to put their arms to rest . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east -lrb- tt -rrb- . peter philipp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates sending soldiers to middle east as a ceasefire to the fighting in lebanon begins to look more likely , the debate over whether germany should take part in international peacekeeping there has divided the country 's politicians .

but it 's still a long way to peace , says dw 's peter philipp . after weeks of discussion , the un security council managed to find a formula for a ceasefire in lebanon .
the weapons have been silent since monday morning .
but things are not necessarily that simple : resolution 1701 would not be the first un resolution about the middle east that awakens hopes which it does n't fulfill .
not that the security council had n't tried its best : stopping the recent fighting was significantly more complicated than in other crisis and war situations .
this was no war between two states with regular armed forces , but rather one of those " asymmetrical " conflicts that have started replacing " traditional " wars . the success of the un resolution depends not on the good will of the security council members , but only on the warring parties .
and both parties apparently agreed to it only because they realized that things could n't go on like this any longer . a no-win situation the israeli government does not acknowledge this openly , but it must have realized that it got itself involved in a military adventure that it could n't win at any level : even the strongest army in the region is powerless against the well-equipped and extremely motivated group of local guerillas such as hezbollah .
and it was madness to think that it was possible to defeat or expel hezbollah with air strikes . israel also lost against the people in lebanon who do not support hezbollah : massive israeli attacks on civilians and the infrastructure in the country have cost israel its last bits of sympathy and understanding in lebanon . it was no different internationally .
israel complained that the media reported one-sidedly and that the lebanese suffering was pushed more to the foreground than that of the israelis .
it was pushed to foreground because it was many times bigger and because it was caused by a state whose prime minister only recently claimed that it had the most moral army in the world . hezbollah could n't afford to go on like this but hezbollah must have also begun to realize that it can not afford a war of this kind in the long term .
although they did surprise everybody - the israelis , in particular - with their firmness and endurance , they would have in the long term succumbed to the massive israeli strikes and led lebanon to disaster along the way . even as it is , hezbollah bears the responsibility of having started this war .
but it knew how to present itself as the only resistance group that should be taken seriously .
had the war escalated even further , hezbollah would have probably lost this sympathy bonus from the lebanese people . and now ?
there is a long way from a ceasefire - if it is kept - to permanent peace .
it will surely take several weeks for the lebanese and international forces to replace the israeli troops in southern lebanon .
in the meantime , they will not want to leave the country and hezbollah will also not want to put their arms to rest . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east -lrb- tt -rrb- . peter philipp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates sending soldiers to middle east as a ceasefire to the fighting in lebanon begins to look more likely , the debate over whether germany should take part in international peacekeeping there has divided the country 's politicians .

but it 's still a long way to peace , says dw 's peter philipp . after weeks of discussion , the un security council managed to find a formula for a ceasefire in lebanon .
the weapons have been silent since monday morning .
but things are not necessarily that simple : resolution 1701 would not be the first un resolution about the middle east that awakens hopes which it does n't fulfill .
not that the security council had n't tried its best : stopping the recent fighting was significantly more complicated than in other crisis and war situations .
this was no war between two states with regular armed forces , but rather one of those " asymmetrical " conflicts that have started replacing " traditional " wars . the success of the un resolution depends not on the good will of the security council members , but only on the warring parties .
and both parties apparently agreed to it only because they realized that things could n't go on like this any longer . a no-win situation the israeli government does not acknowledge this openly , but it must have realized that it got itself involved in a military adventure that it could n't win at any level : even the strongest army in the region is powerless against the well-equipped and extremely motivated group of local guerillas such as hezbollah .
and it was madness to think that it was possible to defeat or expel hezbollah with air strikes . israel also lost against the people in lebanon who do not support hezbollah : massive israeli attacks on civilians and the infrastructure in the country have cost israel its last bits of sympathy and understanding in lebanon . it was no different internationally .
israel complained that the media reported one-sidedly and that the lebanese suffering was pushed more to the foreground than that of the israelis .
it was pushed to foreground because it was many times bigger and because it was caused by a state whose prime minister only recently claimed that it had the most moral army in the world . hezbollah could n't afford to go on like this but hezbollah must have also begun to realize that it can not afford a war of this kind in the long term .
although they did surprise everybody - the israelis , in particular - with their firmness and endurance , they would have in the long term succumbed to the massive israeli strikes and led lebanon to disaster along the way . even as it is , hezbollah bears the responsibility of having started this war .
but it knew how to present itself as the only resistance group that should be taken seriously .
had the war escalated even further , hezbollah would have probably lost this sympathy bonus from the lebanese people . and now ?
there is a long way from a ceasefire - if it is kept - to permanent peace .
it will surely take several weeks for the lebanese and international forces to replace the israeli troops in southern lebanon .
in the meantime , they will not want to leave the country and hezbollah will also not want to put their arms to rest . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east -lrb- tt -rrb- . peter philipp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates sending soldiers to middle east as a ceasefire to the fighting in lebanon begins to look more likely , the debate over whether germany should take part in international peacekeeping there has divided the country 's politicians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.08.2006 growth in germany tops five-year high in second quarter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extra summer sunshine boosted economic growth in outdoor sectors warm weather , the world cup , vat increases in 2007 and swelling corporate profits are a few reasons why germany 's economy reached a record high last quarter .
but experts are n't sure how long the boom can last . the german economy , the biggest in the 12-country euro zone , is growing at its fastest rate since the dot.com boom five years ago , data showed on monday .
the growth can be attributed in part to increased construction spending and booming company profits . germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter of this year compared with the first quarter , federal statistics office destatis said in a statement . that represented an acceleration from the 0.7 percent growth rate in the preceding three months and was the fastest rate of growth since the first quarter of 2001 . data from the eu 's eurostat data agency showed monday that german expansion had helped the euro zone economy to hit its fastest rate of growth in six years in the second quarter . domestic growth stimuli bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup in germany brought in fans - and a few extra euros this time , growth in germany was not solely export-driven , as it had been in previous economic upturns in the country . " growth impulses are coming primarily from inside germany , " destatis said .
" while the momentum of foreign trade has weakened , it was primarily investment in construction and equipment that contributed to the economic pick-up in the second quarter . " over 12 months , growth measured one percent in the second quarter because of differences in the number of working days .
when adjusted for working days , growth was at 2.4 percent . the unseasonably warm weather helped boost activity in outdoor sectors such as the construction industry and companies are investing their record-high profits in new plants and equipment . world cup and upcoming vat increase the world cup soccer championships , held in germany in june and july , also provided a boost to consumer spending , a sector had previously held back the development of a broad-based recovery in germany . furthermore , households are bringing forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the planned rise in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent , which will take effect in january . the ministry of economy in berlin hailed the second-quarter gdp data as proof that the economic gridlock of recent years had finally been lifted . " the recovery has gained in breadth and strength , " said economy minister michael glos .
" the situation on the labor market has improved noticeably .
the outlook for this year is decidedly positive . " the dihk federation of german chambers of commerce agreed . " our forecast for full-year growth of up to two percent is within reach , " dihk president martin wansleben added . growth across the euro zone other euro zone countries , such as france and the netherlands , have similarly beaten growth expectations for the second quarter , suggesting that the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- may have to revise its own growth forecasts for the entire euro area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : value-added tax will jump from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 the euro zone expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter , separate data published by the eu 's statistics office eurostat showed on monday .
the expansion of the euro zone economy added to the arguments for further interest rate hikes by the ecb . the ecb 's benchmark refinancing rate currently stands at 3 percent and is expected to rise to 3.5 percent by the end of this year in order to keep a lid on inflation in the 12 countries that share the euro . " the german gdp data are almost too good to be true , " said bank of america economist holger schmieding .
" in less than two years , germany seems to have turned from the sick man of europe into one of the old continent 's ' wunderkinder . " ' some say euro zone growth to start losing steam however , some analysts were skeptical about whether the german economy would be able to maintain the same momentum during the coming months given the planned rise in vat , which experts believe will put the brakes on consumer demand next year . " the weather-driven rebound in second-quarter construction will not be repeated in the third quarter , " said schmieding at bank of america .
" retail sales may recede after the world cup effect in may and june " and the vat increase will be also provide a temporary hit to activity . the european commission in brussels also predicted that euro zone growth would probably start losing steam soon , with analysts pointing the finger at the stronger euro , slowing global growth , high oil prices , higher interest rates and tighter fiscal policy . in germany , dihk similarly warned that german growth may soon pass its zenith , not least because of the vat hike and the one-off nature of the world cup effect . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european central bank raises rates on inflation fears the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- raised the key euro-zone interest rate by a quarter point to 3.0 percent on thursday , making borrowing costs the highest in three-and-a-half years in order to curb inflation .

the growth can be attributed in part to increased construction spending and booming company profits . germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter of this year compared with the first quarter , federal statistics office destatis said in a statement . that represented an acceleration from the 0.7 percent growth rate in the preceding three months and was the fastest rate of growth since the first quarter of 2001 . data from the eu 's eurostat data agency showed monday that german expansion had helped the euro zone economy to hit its fastest rate of growth in six years in the second quarter . domestic growth stimuli bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup in germany brought in fans - and a few extra euros this time , growth in germany was not solely export-driven , as it had been in previous economic upturns in the country . " growth impulses are coming primarily from inside germany , " destatis said .
" while the momentum of foreign trade has weakened , it was primarily investment in construction and equipment that contributed to the economic pick-up in the second quarter . " over 12 months , growth measured one percent in the second quarter because of differences in the number of working days .
when adjusted for working days , growth was at 2.4 percent . the unseasonably warm weather helped boost activity in outdoor sectors such as the construction industry and companies are investing their record-high profits in new plants and equipment . world cup and upcoming vat increase the world cup soccer championships , held in germany in june and july , also provided a boost to consumer spending , a sector had previously held back the development of a broad-based recovery in germany . furthermore , households are bringing forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the planned rise in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent , which will take effect in january . the ministry of economy in berlin hailed the second-quarter gdp data as proof that the economic gridlock of recent years had finally been lifted . " the recovery has gained in breadth and strength , " said economy minister michael glos .
" the situation on the labor market has improved noticeably .
the outlook for this year is decidedly positive . " the dihk federation of german chambers of commerce agreed . " our forecast for full-year growth of up to two percent is within reach , " dihk president martin wansleben added . growth across the euro zone other euro zone countries , such as france and the netherlands , have similarly beaten growth expectations for the second quarter , suggesting that the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- may have to revise its own growth forecasts for the entire euro area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : value-added tax will jump from 16 to 19 percent in 2007 the euro zone expanded by 0.9 percent in the second quarter , separate data published by the eu 's statistics office eurostat showed on monday .
the expansion of the euro zone economy added to the arguments for further interest rate hikes by the ecb . the ecb 's benchmark refinancing rate currently stands at 3 percent and is expected to rise to 3.5 percent by the end of this year in order to keep a lid on inflation in the 12 countries that share the euro . " the german gdp data are almost too good to be true , " said bank of america economist holger schmieding .
" in less than two years , germany seems to have turned from the sick man of europe into one of the old continent 's ' wunderkinder . " ' some say euro zone growth to start losing steam however , some analysts were skeptical about whether the german economy would be able to maintain the same momentum during the coming months given the planned rise in vat , which experts believe will put the brakes on consumer demand next year . " the weather-driven rebound in second-quarter construction will not be repeated in the third quarter , " said schmieding at bank of america .
" retail sales may recede after the world cup effect in may and june " and the vat increase will be also provide a temporary hit to activity . the european commission in brussels also predicted that euro zone growth would probably start losing steam soon , with analysts pointing the finger at the stronger euro , slowing global growth , high oil prices , higher interest rates and tighter fiscal policy . in germany , dihk similarly warned that german growth may soon pass its zenith , not least because of the vat hike and the one-off nature of the world cup effect . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european central bank raises rates on inflation fears the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- raised the key euro-zone interest rate by a quarter point to 3.0 percent on thursday , making borrowing costs the highest in three-and-a-half years in order to curb inflation .

one homeless association in munich is taking that perception even further by actually turning a corrective facility into a four star establishment . the organization behind biss magazine , a publication sold on the streets of the bavarian city by munich 's homeless , is looking to buy the women 's and young offender 's prison in the neudeck area and turn it into a luxury hotel .
the building is likely to cost biss in the region of 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 638,650 -rrb- . biss is looking to invest between 13 and 14 million euros in the project which will turn the prison into a 66-room establishment with an adjoining complex of 14 senior citizen apartments . city 's homeless to staff hotel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biss hopes to give homeless people a chance to find employment - and accomodation - at the hotel the association hopes to employ between 25 and 40 homeless people as staff in the hotel , providing them with the means to afford their own accommodation . the current prison population will be moved to a new facility in 2008 , leaving the 6,000-square-meter -lrb- 64,500 square feet -rrb- building up for grabs .
if the prison building is not given over to any official state government department , it will be made available on the open public market , leaving the way free for biss to acquire the property . the organization has already hired a design team to draw up plans for the possible make-over .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : celebrating bertolt brecht " bertolt brecht 's influence can not be overestimated " bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere a communist in a city of angels culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2006 brandauer 's betrayal of brecht großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the threepenny opera " has been the most talked-about play in berlin this year berlin is in brecht fever .
as the crowning but ultimately disappointing event of the 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , a star-studded production of " the threepenny opera " opened in berlin . the fact that brecht 's " threepenny opera " opened at the admiralspalast in berlin was a little miracle in itself .
the historic building from the beginning of the 20th century , hastily renovated by entrepreneur falk walter , was not deemed safe for public use until the day before the premiere , when city officials finally gave their seal of approval . the media feverishly followed the will-they-or-wo n't-they drama of the most talked-about production of the year .
in the end , all those wires ominously sticking out of the walls , blotches of paint , mops , buckets and vaguely disguised piles of rubble indicated that the building - originally an ice rink and a luxury spa , which then , in the 1920s , became a theater - was and still is a construction site , an unfinished project .
very much like brecht 's revolutionary dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the admiralspalast is still not fully renovated the scent of undried paint - known to cause either mild headaches or mild hallucinations , depending on your age and social status - mixed well with the perfumes of berlin society ladies , while one toilette sign in the theater foyer still pointed to a hole in the wall , covered by a simple wooden board . this hole in the wall - a real metaphoric nowhere - would have been better suited as backdrop for beckett 's " waiting for godot . "
estragon : " shall we go ? "
vladimir : " let 's go . "
stage directions : " they do n't move . " " at least , the stage is standing , " said a bartender before the saturday night performance , offering a glass of champagne to an elderly lady while performing an acrobatic balancing act over several crates of beer . an anticlimax and while the stage was standing , the performance fell flat .
with all the media hullabaloo leading up to the premiere , one was almost convinced it was going to be something special . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director karl maria brandauer -lrb- left -rrb- and punk rocker campino austrian actor and director klaus maria brandauer assembled a stellar ensemble .
german punk singer campino of the band die toten hosen played the role of mack the knife , king of thieves . gottfried john - known to film buffs from several fassbinder movies and to the rest of the universe as the evil russian general arkadii grigorovich ourumov from james bond 's russian stunt in " golden eye " - played mr. peachum . katrin sass - one of most popular actresses from former east germany , who experienced a pan-german comeback with her touching appearance in the blockbuster hit " good bye , lenin " - added quite a bit of slapstick cheekiness to the role of manipulative alcoholic mrs. peachum . but most of the ensemble appeared helpless in an overly conventional production which lacked both the dramatic gusto and political audacity .
staging the play as an authentic costume drama set in london in the 1920s , brandauer created a sluggish , outdated and all too reverent production which failed to excite let alone provoke . a betrayal of sorts heiner müller said in an interview once that " to use brecht without criticizing him is to betray him . "
turning " the threepenny opera " into a wax museum musical was one such betrayal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit minichmayr -lrb- polly -rrb- and campino -lrb- mack the knife -rrb- the highlight of the evening turned out to be birgit minichmayr 's performance as polly .
the austrian-born actress , who joined berlin 's volksbühne theater in 2004 , after earning her laurels at vienna 's burgtheater , showed once again that she is one of the most exciting young german-speaking actresses today . her polly was both loud and vulnerable , rebellious and scared .
the otherworldly force of her voice , which assumes a subtle huskiness in the higher register , turned her rendering of pirate jenny 's song into a moment of chilling , spectral beauty . sweeping the roads the most contradictory - and most brechtian - moment of the evening happened outside the theater .
the elegant guests were greeted on arrival by a couple of homeless berliners selling a special edition of their newspaper , strassenfeger -lrb- street sweeper -rrb- , entirely dedicated to the new production of " the threepenny opera . "
it is fascinating what kind of advertising a budget of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.5 million -rrb- can get you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katrin sass -lrb- left -rrb- played mrs. peachum with a great sense of humor one after another , the well-off and the extremely well-off couples stopped at the theater entry to buy themselves a copy of strassenfeger .
after all , they all came to watch brecht .
it felt appropriate to get close to the masses .
so they blinded the homeless with their pearly white teeth , and smiled like there was no tomorrow .
it was a spectacle worth of buñuel 's " discreet charm of the bourgeoise . " but those were exactly the kind of people , who - under different , non-theatrical , non-brechtian circumstances - would have looked the other way .
luckily for them , they do n't normally ride the subway that much . brecht in a post-revolutionary age when mack the knife cried out his famous invective - " what is robbing a bank when compared to founding a bank ?

as the crowning but ultimately disappointing event of the 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , a star-studded production of " the threepenny opera " opened in berlin . the fact that brecht 's " threepenny opera " opened at the admiralspalast in berlin was a little miracle in itself .
the historic building from the beginning of the 20th century , hastily renovated by entrepreneur falk walter , was not deemed safe for public use until the day before the premiere , when city officials finally gave their seal of approval . the media feverishly followed the will-they-or-wo n't-they drama of the most talked-about production of the year .
in the end , all those wires ominously sticking out of the walls , blotches of paint , mops , buckets and vaguely disguised piles of rubble indicated that the building - originally an ice rink and a luxury spa , which then , in the 1920s , became a theater - was and still is a construction site , an unfinished project .
very much like brecht 's revolutionary dream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the admiralspalast is still not fully renovated the scent of undried paint - known to cause either mild headaches or mild hallucinations , depending on your age and social status - mixed well with the perfumes of berlin society ladies , while one toilette sign in the theater foyer still pointed to a hole in the wall , covered by a simple wooden board . this hole in the wall - a real metaphoric nowhere - would have been better suited as backdrop for beckett 's " waiting for godot . "
estragon : " shall we go ? "
vladimir : " let 's go . "
stage directions : " they do n't move . " " at least , the stage is standing , " said a bartender before the saturday night performance , offering a glass of champagne to an elderly lady while performing an acrobatic balancing act over several crates of beer . an anticlimax and while the stage was standing , the performance fell flat .
with all the media hullabaloo leading up to the premiere , one was almost convinced it was going to be something special . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director karl maria brandauer -lrb- left -rrb- and punk rocker campino austrian actor and director klaus maria brandauer assembled a stellar ensemble .
german punk singer campino of the band die toten hosen played the role of mack the knife , king of thieves . gottfried john - known to film buffs from several fassbinder movies and to the rest of the universe as the evil russian general arkadii grigorovich ourumov from james bond 's russian stunt in " golden eye " - played mr. peachum . katrin sass - one of most popular actresses from former east germany , who experienced a pan-german comeback with her touching appearance in the blockbuster hit " good bye , lenin " - added quite a bit of slapstick cheekiness to the role of manipulative alcoholic mrs. peachum . but most of the ensemble appeared helpless in an overly conventional production which lacked both the dramatic gusto and political audacity .
staging the play as an authentic costume drama set in london in the 1920s , brandauer created a sluggish , outdated and all too reverent production which failed to excite let alone provoke . a betrayal of sorts heiner müller said in an interview once that " to use brecht without criticizing him is to betray him . "
turning " the threepenny opera " into a wax museum musical was one such betrayal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit minichmayr -lrb- polly -rrb- and campino -lrb- mack the knife -rrb- the highlight of the evening turned out to be birgit minichmayr 's performance as polly .
the austrian-born actress , who joined berlin 's volksbühne theater in 2004 , after earning her laurels at vienna 's burgtheater , showed once again that she is one of the most exciting young german-speaking actresses today . her polly was both loud and vulnerable , rebellious and scared .
the otherworldly force of her voice , which assumes a subtle huskiness in the higher register , turned her rendering of pirate jenny 's song into a moment of chilling , spectral beauty . sweeping the roads the most contradictory - and most brechtian - moment of the evening happened outside the theater .
the elegant guests were greeted on arrival by a couple of homeless berliners selling a special edition of their newspaper , strassenfeger -lrb- street sweeper -rrb- , entirely dedicated to the new production of " the threepenny opera . "
it is fascinating what kind of advertising a budget of 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.5 million -rrb- can get you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katrin sass -lrb- left -rrb- played mrs. peachum with a great sense of humor one after another , the well-off and the extremely well-off couples stopped at the theater entry to buy themselves a copy of strassenfeger .
after all , they all came to watch brecht .
it felt appropriate to get close to the masses .
so they blinded the homeless with their pearly white teeth , and smiled like there was no tomorrow .
it was a spectacle worth of buñuel 's " discreet charm of the bourgeoise . " but those were exactly the kind of people , who - under different , non-theatrical , non-brechtian circumstances - would have looked the other way .
luckily for them , they do n't normally ride the subway that much . brecht in a post-revolutionary age when mack the knife cried out his famous invective - " what is robbing a bank when compared to founding a bank ? " - his words had to come out as petulant rather than subversive , especially to deutsche bank president josef ackermann , one of the most prominent guests at the premiere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandauer 's reading of brecht was too tame and unexciting what 's more , " the threepenny opera " at the admiralspalast was sponsored by deutsche bank - a company that celebrated its record yields of 2.5 billion euros two years ago by firing more than 6,000 people , or every tenth employee . even to brecht - who was himself no stranger to wheelings and dealings of all sorts , and whose austrian passport allowed him to dream his communist dream in east berlin while keeping a bank account in switzerland - the happy artistic collective bringing together a punk rocker and a big banker would have seemed self-defeating . brecht said once that his work was " the swan song of the millennium .

sunday 's opening concert featured alicia keys and the barenaked ladies .
the burst of upbeat music sums up one of the key themes - how hiv affects young people .
this problem does n't just belong to developing countries - there are 1,200 hiv-positive children in the uk .
a london charity which supports young people with the virus is beginning an awareness and fundraising campaign .
i visited the body and soul project , and met crystal , an attractive and chatty 19-year-old .
she was told six years ago that she 'd been born hiv-positive .
" i used to come to this project with my mum , so i just thought it was a youth club .
" when they told me i was hiv-positive , it was a shock .
i felt sick when they told me , to be precise .
" then things started coming into my head - like - oh that 's why i 've been taking medication all these years .
i would like to have my own family - but i 'm dreading it because it could be complicated for me to have kids crystal " at that time i did n't know what hiv was .
i just really thought about death - i thought you get hiv , you get aids and then you die . "
and aids has cast a shadow over the life of this confident young woman - crystal 's parents , who were ugandan , have both died from the disease .
she does not tell college friends that she is hiv-positive , though she tries to spread the word about safe sex .
" i 've got a lot of friends who do n't use condoms - and i 've known a lot of people that have caught infections , " she told me .
" i try to educate my friends to tell them it is important to use a condom because these days you do n't really know anything - it 's better to be safe than sorry . "
crystal is continuing her studies and loves dancing .
she is aware that some difficult decisions lie ahead .
" i would like to have my own family - but i 'm dreading it because it could be complicated for me to have kids .
but i would like to have a big family . "
crystal 's nervousness is understandable - though doctors say that if hiv-positive women take anti-retroviral drugs during their pregnancy and avoid breast-feeding , the chance of their baby carrying the virus is tiny .
scared i also met natasha , who is 17 and first found out she had hiv when she was 12 .
she felt really scared and frightened .
it seems most children with hiv do not learn about their condition until their teens - doctors and other experts generally support this idea , because of the stigma that still surrounds the condition .
and parents often fear that their children will blurt out their secret in the playground - and then get shunned .
like crystal , natasha hides her medication from friends at college .
" it 's hard - they are always asking : ' why are you taking your tablets ?
i make up all these excuses , " said natasha .
crystal and natasha have greatly benefited from the advances in hiv medication , and they should be able to live long lives .
we 're subtly trying to break down hostility , by saying it 's ok to smile , as well as to care for that person rosie turner , of the body and soul project but rosie turner , who helps run the body and soul project , is outraged that ignorance about hiv means these young women shroud their condition in secrecy .
" there is so much hatred towards it - it is very very different to something like cancer where people are surrounded by love , care and support , " she told me .
" within hiv , our families are living in a separate world , and having to lie . "
discretion is hugely important for body and soul - the charity operates from an unmarked building .
it has begun a campaign to say it is ok to smile at someone with hiv .
rosie added : " the smile campaign is trying to put a more positive slant on hiv and aids .

kathy burke , james nesbitt and thierry henry are among the famous names taking part in the campaign .
health needs and it looks as though the charity will try to tie up with special new services being launched by doctors - but covering much more than health needs .
at st mary 's hospital in london , health professionals treat about 200 children with hiv at a family clinic .
but they have realised that the brightly painted walls and children 's toys do not provide the best setting for helping the first generation born with the virus who are now reaching adulthood .
just a few years ago , these youngsters had not been expected to survive .
dr simon portsmouth is starting a clinic for about 75 teenage patients - he admits it 's uncharted territory .
" they 're a very different group of patients to our usual ones , " he explained .
" they have probably only just learned of their diagnosis - perhaps at the age of 12 or 13 .
" they are going to school with their peers who may be becoming sexually active at that age - they have all of those concerns .
" and because the virus can affect the brain , about a third of these young people may have learning difficulties - and so their social needs are going to be quite great in the future . "

sunday 's opening concert featured alicia keys and the barenaked ladies .
the burst of upbeat music sums up one of the key themes - how hiv affects young people .
this problem does n't just belong to developing countries - there are 1,200 hiv-positive children in the uk .
a london charity which supports young people with the virus is beginning an awareness and fundraising campaign .
i visited the body and soul project , and met crystal , an attractive and chatty 19-year-old .
she was told six years ago that she 'd been born hiv-positive .
" i used to come to this project with my mum , so i just thought it was a youth club .
" when they told me i was hiv-positive , it was a shock .
i felt sick when they told me , to be precise .
" then things started coming into my head - like - oh that 's why i 've been taking medication all these years .
i would like to have my own family - but i 'm dreading it because it could be complicated for me to have kids crystal " at that time i did n't know what hiv was .
i just really thought about death - i thought you get hiv , you get aids and then you die . "
and aids has cast a shadow over the life of this confident young woman - crystal 's parents , who were ugandan , have both died from the disease .
she does not tell college friends that she is hiv-positive , though she tries to spread the word about safe sex .
" i 've got a lot of friends who do n't use condoms - and i 've known a lot of people that have caught infections , " she told me .
" i try to educate my friends to tell them it is important to use a condom because these days you do n't really know anything - it 's better to be safe than sorry . "
crystal is continuing her studies and loves dancing .
she is aware that some difficult decisions lie ahead .
" i would like to have my own family - but i 'm dreading it because it could be complicated for me to have kids .
but i would like to have a big family . "
crystal 's nervousness is understandable - though doctors say that if hiv-positive women take anti-retroviral drugs during their pregnancy and avoid breast-feeding , the chance of their baby carrying the virus is tiny .
scared i also met natasha , who is 17 and first found out she had hiv when she was 12 .
she felt really scared and frightened .
it seems most children with hiv do not learn about their condition until their teens - doctors and other experts generally support this idea , because of the stigma that still surrounds the condition .
and parents often fear that their children will blurt out their secret in the playground - and then get shunned .
like crystal , natasha hides her medication from friends at college .
" it 's hard - they are always asking : ' why are you taking your tablets ?
i make up all these excuses , " said natasha .
crystal and natasha have greatly benefited from the advances in hiv medication , and they should be able to live long lives .
we 're subtly trying to break down hostility , by saying it 's ok to smile , as well as to care for that person rosie turner , of the body and soul project but rosie turner , who helps run the body and soul project , is outraged that ignorance about hiv means these young women shroud their condition in secrecy .
" there is so much hatred towards it - it is very very different to something like cancer where people are surrounded by love , care and support , " she told me .
" within hiv , our families are living in a separate world , and having to lie . "
discretion is hugely important for body and soul - the charity operates from an unmarked building .

the trial 's end is still months away but the protesters are increasingly confident of the result .
film , which has since been enhanced , shows police officers beating mark covell the wheels of italian justice turn very slowly but several recent developments have boosted the confidence of mark covell , one of a number of people badly injured during that g8 summit .
in january mr covell flew from his london home to testify at the trial of 29 italian police officers , some of them very senior , who are accused of brutality and perjury following the raid at the diaz school in genoa .
the school , run by the genoa social forum , was being used as a base by peaceful anti-globalisation protesters .
late on the night of 21 july 2001 nearly 300 police officers - most of them dressed in full riot gear - forced their way into the school and assaulted dozens of people inside , many of whom had been sleeping .
intensive care mr covell , who was covering the summit as a journalist with the indymedia network , was attacked outside the school gates , knocked to the ground and beaten unconscious .
he spent 12 days in hospital in intensive care and still faces further surgery on his spine and left hand .
mark covell , from london , spent 12 days in intensive care after the diaz raid the italian police claimed they had come under attack from the protesters inside the school , something which has been rubbished by footage which has since emerged .
they also claimed to have found petrol bombs and a variety of weapons inside the school .
but it has since emerged that these had in fact been planted by the police themselves .
many of those held by police at the diaz school were taken to the bolzaneto detention centre where they were allegedly tortured and abused for several days .
the bolzaneto allegations are the subject of a separate trial which is running parallel to the diaz case .
could face jail if convicted the police officers face being jailed for up to 10 years .
a third trial is also under way , involving rioters accused of attacking the police during disturbances earlier that day .
the defendants in the diaz trial , who include senior commanders such as francesco gratteri and nando dominici , maintain their innocence .
they claim they were unaware of any excessive violence being used and deny approving the planting of evidence .
much of the diaz trial is tied up with video evidence .
footage was taken from the roof of nearby buildings and has since supported the prosecution 's case .
we are trying to get the politics out of the italian police force mark covell independent media consultants at non-profit group undercurrents worked with a firm of british solicitors and have used software and techniques that previously did not exist to enhance existing and some newly discovered video footage .
mr covell said the diaz and bolzaneto trials were extremely important in italy .
he suggested that the verdicts and results of a future parliamentary inquiry would be akin to the macpherson report into the stephen lawrence case in britain , which found the metropolitan police was " institutionally racist " .
he said in general supporters of the right-wing allianza nazionale tended to do well in the italian police and left-wing officers tended to get overlooked for promotion .
" we are trying to get the politics out of the italian police force .
at the moment it is standard practice , when someone is going for promotion , to ask their political views , " he said .
he added that this was why the victory in april 's general election of the left-wing romano prodi was so important .
verdict in 2007 ?
" mr prodi has promised to launch a parliamentary inquiry into the events in genoa in july 2001 and has promised a root-and-branch reform of the police force , mr covell said .
" now that the prodi government is in power the diaz plaintiffs are expecting much more progress .
in the last five years we have faced every obstacle imaginable in trying to obtain justice .
but now we hope that there are going to be less obstacles in our path . "
mark covell -lrb- front row , third left -rrb- has joined the diaz and bolzaneto plaintiffs under the italian system the diaz victims become plaintiffs and their lawyers work closely with the prosecutor , enrico zucca .
mr covell has briefed the british human rights lawyer gareth pierce about the case and she may appear at the trial later this year .
both the diaz and bolzaneto trials are expected to drag on well into 2007 .
mr covell is more confident than ever that he will get justice and said : " it 's five years since the raid and the majority of us have not come to terms with what happened that night and never will do .
our thoughts are to make sure that the diaz raid never happens again . "

mark covell , from london , spent 12 days in intensive care after the diaz raid the italian police claimed they had come under attack from the protesters inside the school , something which has been rubbished by footage which has since emerged .
they also claimed to have found petrol bombs and a variety of weapons inside the school .
but it has since emerged that these had in fact been planted by the police themselves .
many of those held by police at the diaz school were taken to the bolzaneto detention centre where they were allegedly tortured and abused for several days .
the bolzaneto allegations are the subject of a separate trial which is running parallel to the diaz case .
could face jail if convicted the police officers face being jailed for up to 10 years .
a third trial is also under way , involving rioters accused of attacking the police during disturbances earlier that day .
the defendants in the diaz trial , who include senior commanders such as francesco gratteri and nando dominici , maintain their innocence .
they claim they were unaware of any excessive violence being used and deny approving the planting of evidence .
much of the diaz trial is tied up with video evidence .

we are trying to get the politics out of the italian police force mark covell independent media consultants at non-profit group undercurrents worked with a firm of british solicitors and have used software and techniques that previously did not exist to enhance existing and some newly discovered video footage .
mr covell said the diaz and bolzaneto trials were extremely important in italy .
he suggested that the verdicts and results of a future parliamentary inquiry would be akin to the macpherson report into the stephen lawrence case in britain , which found the metropolitan police was " institutionally racist " .
he said in general supporters of the right-wing allianza nazionale tended to do well in the italian police and left-wing officers tended to get overlooked for promotion .
" we are trying to get the politics out of the italian police force .
at the moment it is standard practice , when someone is going for promotion , to ask their political views , " he said .
he added that this was why the victory in april 's general election of the left-wing romano prodi was so important .
verdict in 2007 ?
" mr prodi has promised to launch a parliamentary inquiry into the events in genoa in july 2001 and has promised a root-and-branch reform of the police force , mr covell said .
" now that the prodi government is in power the diaz plaintiffs are expecting much more progress .

mr covell has briefed the british human rights lawyer gareth pierce about the case and she may appear at the trial later this year .
both the diaz and bolzaneto trials are expected to drag on well into 2007 .
mr covell is more confident than ever that he will get justice and said : " it 's five years since the raid and the majority of us have not come to terms with what happened that night and never will do .
our thoughts are to make sure that the diaz raid never happens again . "

the trial 's end is still months away but the protesters are increasingly confident of the result .
film , which has since been enhanced , shows police officers beating mark covell the wheels of italian justice turn very slowly but several recent developments have boosted the confidence of mark covell , one of a number of people badly injured during that g8 summit .
in january mr covell flew from his london home to testify at the trial of 29 italian police officers , some of them very senior , who are accused of brutality and perjury following the raid at the diaz school in genoa .
the school , run by the genoa social forum , was being used as a base by peaceful anti-globalisation protesters .
late on the night of 21 july 2001 nearly 300 police officers - most of them dressed in full riot gear - forced their way into the school and assaulted dozens of people inside , many of whom had been sleeping .

china is working to boost domestic consumer spending so it can rely less on external investment , analysts say .

both urban and rural disposable incomes grew considerably in the first six months of 2006 compared to the year before - rising 10.2 % and 11.9 % respectively .
" china will continue to encourage domestic consumption , " said li mingliang , an economist with haitong securities .
" but it faces tough competition , mainly due to the difficulty of increasing farmers ' incomes and the lack of social welfare system in the rural areas . "
analysts predict consumer spending will rise in the latter part of this year , as the government invests more on health , education and housing , reducing the amount the chinese should have to save to pay for these services .

ten ira and inla inmates died in the protest over political status at the maze prison in county antrim .
hundreds of former republican prisoners and supporters gathered at a rally in the casement park gaa ground off the andersonstown road .
relatives of the hunger strikers were among the platform speakers .
leading figures from the republican movement were also among those at the rally .
there had been some criticism of the gaa in county antrim for allowing the event to take place at one of its sports grounds .
casement park comes under the jurisdiction of the gaa 's antrim county board and it is understood it did not object to the rally .
however , the gaa 's central council in dublin had discussed the matter and agreed that the casement park rally would break the organisation 's rules about staging political events .

the village lies virtually deserted because its residents have been evacuated .
over the past month , mayon has been spewing ash and thick streams of molten lava , raising fears that a major eruption is imminent .
but matanag 's villagers told the bbc news website that some farmers chose to remain behind and many are eager to return home despite the threat posed by the volcano .
" it 's been a tradition for every eruption that the men look after the houses and they only evacuate when the volcano is really dangerous , " said 19-year-old margie aydalla , speaking from an evacuation centre in legazpi city , the capital of albay province .
" my father and the rest of the men in the family are still in the village to look after our livelihoods .
there are those that own poultry and pigs , they have to be home to feed the animals .
" many women also go back to the village to do the laundry . "
evacuation limbo this is not a practice the city authorities wish to encourage , according to marlene manaya , the social welfare and development officer for legazpi city .
" we know the villagers are really inconvenienced by this , but we have to keep them away .
i ca n't say how long this could last for .
the military is guarding the area but we know that some people are successful in sneaking back . "
there are about 1,500 evacuees from matanag at the albay central school evacuation centre , with about 14 families to a classroom .
villagers have complained of overcrowding at evacuation centres " it 's crowded and noisy here , babies are crying and there is no privacy , no comfort .
sanitation and hygiene is a problem , " said margie aydalla .
" but people from our village are very traditional .
we value community spirit at these times .
here you can see people cooking food for the rest of the families in their rooms . "
most frightening mrs manaya says the city authorities are working hard to expand the number of classrooms and evacuation centres to tackle the problem of overcrowding .
matanag 's village chief , antonio alcera , is grateful for the shelter .
" we have been given the best accommodation here .
safety and security are being enforced and we can use a curfew to prevent evacuees from leaving the centre , " he said .
i saw with my own eyes the bodies of my villagers at the foot of mount mayon mary cris " yes , people are very worried about their homes and their livelihoods , but we have in the past experienced the punishment of the volcano 's explosion . "
in 1993 mayon erupted unexpectedly , killing 75 people .
" farmers from our village died because of that eruption , " said mr alcera .
mary cris has experienced four major eruptions while living in matanag but , she says , 1993 was the most frightening occasion .
" we were caught unprepared .
we were taking exams when suddenly we heard a very loud explosion .
the next thing , we were running as fast as we could .
" we lost our slippers and got scars and wounds on our feet .
i saw with my own eyes the bodies of my villagers .
their families could barely recognise them . "
fears for livelihoods pyroclastic flows have come closer to villages those villagers " sneaking back " to matanag are fully aware of the dangers .
molten lava has already devastated large stretches of land at the foot of the mountain outside matanag .
but people are desperately concerned about their livelihoods , and say they can not afford to leave their land unattended .
" just like my family , which has a coconut and vegetable plantation , the biggest fears in the village is losing our livelihoods , " said margie aydalla .
village chief mr alcera says people depend on farming .
" they go back because this is the only source of the family income .
they feel they have no choice , " he says .
despite the perils of living in such close proximity to the mountain , the people who live at its base still hold it close to their heart .
" i dearly love mount mayon , " said mary cris .
" i never felt sorry of living near its foot despite the danger she brought to our lives .
she has given us so much for our living , rich land and water for farming . "
mr alcera says he speaks for the village when he speaks of the mountain .
" the volcano is a natural beauty made by our creator .
it is deeply connected to us and we will continue to live there . "

sutherland has twice been on the man booker prize committee if the members of the 2006 panel need any help wading through the selected titles , they need look no further than john sutherland , chairman of last year 's committee .
under his guidance , the uk 's most prestigious literary prize was controversially awarded to the sea , by irish author john banville .
how the judges came to that decision forms part of his latest work how to read a novel , an instructional tome offering consumers tips on how to gain the most from the wealth of published fiction on offer .
" when i started my reading career books were hard to come by , " the critic and columnist tells the bbc news website .
" now it 's the opposite .
sometimes you feel you 're being crushed by the weight of books available .
" there is so much choice , all of it tempting and much of it good , " he adds .
" what i wanted to do , as much for myself as anyone else , was find strategies to get through this extraordinary thicket . "
' thundering cattle ' to maximise the enjoyment of reading fiction , mr sutherland argues , the reader must develop individual criteria based on personal preferences .
these can be hard to establish when every bookshop 's shelves come groaning with instructions , exhortations and endorsements .
" i get slightly worried when everyone buys the da vinci code , " he says .
" it 's like a herd of thundering cattle , all heading in the same direction .
howard jacobsen 's comic writing may have a booker ' handicap ' " if there is a message in the book , it 's choose for yourself - find out who you are and what fiction works for you . "
prizes like the man booker can prove a valuable pointer for readers , mr sutherland argues .
" some say the booker is only there to stimulate book sales , but i do n't believe that , " he says .
" what will happen is that people will look at the novels that are nominated and say , ' do i agree ? '
" at their best , that is what prizes do - they give people signposts . "
" people do n't necessarily have to follow them .
but if they do , they can get to interesting places , " he adds .
' interesting places ' but one criticism the author has of the man booker is the way it tends to prioritise serious novels over those of a more comical bent .
" there are some terrifically good comic writers around at the moment , such as david lodge and howard jacobson , are in some respect running with a handicap .
" but i know from experience that when you get into that committee room , it 's extremely hard to argue that a trivial book is more important than an earnest one . "
irish author john banville won last year 's man booker with the sea with its playful references to jacqueline susann , jeffrey archer and star trek , earnest is not a word that readily applies to sutherland 's latest work .
but while the book displays an admirable lightness of touch - not least by having a glowing rave from its own author emblazoned on its jacket - the writer has a serious point to convey .
" novels can enlarge your life , " he says .
" the more you read , the more you discover about yourself .
" you ca n't eat or breathe them , and they wo n't solve our problems .
but they do define our problems in a way that makes it easier for us to solve them ourselves . "
how to read a novel : a user 's guide is published by profile books on 17 august , priced £ 9.99 .

sutherland has twice been on the man booker prize committee if the members of the 2006 panel need any help wading through the selected titles , they need look no further than john sutherland , chairman of last year 's committee .

' thundering cattle ' to maximise the enjoyment of reading fiction , mr sutherland argues , the reader must develop individual criteria based on personal preferences .

howard jacobsen 's comic writing may have a booker ' handicap ' " if there is a message in the book , it 's choose for yourself - find out who you are and what fiction works for you . "
prizes like the man booker can prove a valuable pointer for readers , mr sutherland argues .
" some say the booker is only there to stimulate book sales , but i do n't believe that , " he says .
" what will happen is that people will look at the novels that are nominated and say , ' do i agree ? '
" at their best , that is what prizes do - they give people signposts . "
" people do n't necessarily have to follow them .

irish author john banville won last year 's man booker with the sea with its playful references to jacqueline susann , jeffrey archer and star trek , earnest is not a word that readily applies to sutherland 's latest work .
but while the book displays an admirable lightness of touch - not least by having a glowing rave from its own author emblazoned on its jacket - the writer has a serious point to convey .
" novels can enlarge your life , " he says .
" the more you read , the more you discover about yourself .

sutherland has twice been on the man booker prize committee if the members of the 2006 panel need any help wading through the selected titles , they need look no further than john sutherland , chairman of last year 's committee .
under his guidance , the uk 's most prestigious literary prize was controversially awarded to the sea , by irish author john banville .
how the judges came to that decision forms part of his latest work how to read a novel , an instructional tome offering consumers tips on how to gain the most from the wealth of published fiction on offer .
" when i started my reading career books were hard to come by , " the critic and columnist tells the bbc news website .
" now it 's the opposite .
sometimes you feel you 're being crushed by the weight of books available .
" there is so much choice , all of it tempting and much of it good , " he adds .
" what i wanted to do , as much for myself as anyone else , was find strategies to get through this extraordinary thicket . "
' thundering cattle ' to maximise the enjoyment of reading fiction , mr sutherland argues , the reader must develop individual criteria based on personal preferences .
these can be hard to establish when every bookshop 's shelves come groaning with instructions , exhortations and endorsements .
" i get slightly worried when everyone buys the da vinci code , " he says .
" it 's like a herd of thundering cattle , all heading in the same direction .
howard jacobsen 's comic writing may have a booker ' handicap ' " if there is a message in the book , it 's choose for yourself - find out who you are and what fiction works for you . "
prizes like the man booker can prove a valuable pointer for readers , mr sutherland argues .
" some say the booker is only there to stimulate book sales , but i do n't believe that , " he says .
" what will happen is that people will look at the novels that are nominated and say , ' do i agree ? '
" at their best , that is what prizes do - they give people signposts . "
" people do n't necessarily have to follow them .
but if they do , they can get to interesting places , " he adds .
' interesting places ' but one criticism the author has of the man booker is the way it tends to prioritise serious novels over those of a more comical bent .
" there are some terrifically good comic writers around at the moment , such as david lodge and howard jacobson , are in some respect running with a handicap .
" but i know from experience that when you get into that committee room , it 's extremely hard to argue that a trivial book is more important than an earnest one . "
irish author john banville won last year 's man booker with the sea with its playful references to jacqueline susann , jeffrey archer and star trek , earnest is not a word that readily applies to sutherland 's latest work .
but while the book displays an admirable lightness of touch - not least by having a glowing rave from its own author emblazoned on its jacket - the writer has a serious point to convey .
" novels can enlarge your life , " he says .
" the more you read , the more you discover about yourself .
" you ca n't eat or breathe them , and they wo n't solve our problems .
but they do define our problems in a way that makes it easier for us to solve them ourselves . "

a powerful mine exploded near the official residence of president mahinda rajapakse as a convoy , including a pakistani embassy vehicle , went past .
the pakistani ambassador , bashir wali mohamed , was travelling in the convoy but was unhurt in the incident .
there has been fierce fighting between government forces and tamil tigers in the north and east in recent days .
a pakistani official said mr mohamed was returning from a flag-raising ceremony for pakistan 's independence day when the explosion happened .
the blast shook the windows of neighbouring buildings and damaged an embassy vehicle , reports said .
ceasefire ' unravelling ' the blast came after the tamil tigers accused government forces of bombing an orphanage , killing 43 school girls and injuring 60 in the rebel-controlled northern district of mullaituvu .
the military said there had been air raids , but denied any knowledge of the alleged incident .
the government has also denied rebel accusations that its forces killed at least 15 people in an attack on a church in the predominantly tamil village of allaipidddy on an island just west of jaffna .
the tigers have ruled out peace talks with the government while heavy fighting continues between the two sides .
the recent flare-up in fighting has alarmed sri lanka 's key foreign donors - the us , japan , the european union and norway - who have called for an immediate end to the hostilities , which they said was " seriously unravelling " the 2002 ceasefire agreement .
they also expressed serious concern about the humanitarian situation .
the ceasefire aimed to halt more than two decades of war between the government and the rebels , who are fighting for an independent homeland for the country 's minority tamil people in the north and east .
it remains officially in effect , despite months of violence .
