what is the state of affairs in germany today ? luis carlos escobar de pinzon : since anti-retrovirus combination therapies were introduced , people with hiv have better treatment opportunities .

what were your goals when you took over - and how is it going ? my main goal was to once again make hiv and aids an important topic in society .
it is no longer as present in the media as it was in the beginning of the 1990s .

dw-world.de : dr. escobar , the situation surrounding aids education and treatment has changed a great deal in the past decade .
what is the state of affairs in germany today ? luis carlos escobar de pinzon : since anti-retrovirus combination therapies were introduced , people with hiv have better treatment opportunities .
they can live for years symptom-free .
that may have led to the fact that many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly diseases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly , escobar said aids is now often seen as a chronic illness , so people are n't protecting themselves as well as they used to .

" genocide in slow motion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dafur is still unstable and killing of civilians by rebel groups is still rife the united nations has been contemplating sending a larger multilateral contingent to darfur to establish peace in the region under its own command . " if the current african union mandate for darfur were to be transferred into the hands of the united nations , we would not be in a position to ignore such a development , " jung told german public television on thursday . " we could n't just say ' no ' to a un request to contribute troops to a multinational effort to establish peace , " he added . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said a multinational approach should be taken to addressing the violence . " there would be african troops involved in such a mission alongside asian troops and european troops , " she said earlier this week .
" germany would have no right to stand on the sidelines - after all , what we are witnessing in the darfur region is a sort of genocide in slow motion . " other lawmakers from germany 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats , however , have heavily criticized what they call an untimely offer on the part of the defense minister . critics warn germany to not interfere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german politicans want the african region to resolve conflicts itself peter ramsauer of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , lashed out at the defense minister for not coordinating his statements on darfur with parliamentary leaders . in addition to stating his opposition to a larger german deployment in sudan , ramsauer also pointed out there has been no request from the united nations for troops . head of the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party guido westerwelle called jung 's campaign a " grave mistake " that went against germany 's post-world war ii restraint on the foreign policy front . germany currently has 41 military observers stationed with un forces in sudan .
the german cabinet agreed to extend the troops ' mandate on wednesday and set a deployment cap of 200 soldiers . us could step-up pressure karsten voigt , the german government 's coordinator for transatlantic relations , said he is certain members of the us democratic party will try and put more pressure on europe , including germany , to help resolve to darfur conflict . " many us democrats are indeed urging the european union and nato to become active in darfur , " voigt said .
" but right now i do n't sense much willingness on the part of european partners to step into action , nor do i see any majority backing for such a mission in the german parliament .

the law also allows the history of leading officials in sporting bodies to be examined . the original legislation was introduced in 1991 , the year after east and west germany were reunified , but was due to expire in december . there had been a proposal - supported by all parties except the opposition left party , which is composed mainly of east german former communists - not to renew the law and therefore end the process of carrying out background checks . but after protests from groups representing victims of the east german regime , a compromise was struck maintaining the checks until december 2011 . stasi officials working on files bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi data authority employs over 50 former stasi members the authorities who manage the archives containing millions of files compiled by agents regarding their fellow citizens confirmed press reports on thursday that it employs 52 former stasi officials . marianne birthler , the head of the stasi data authority , said it was necessary to employ stasi officials because of their knowledge of the files , though she said she could understand the suspicion it would cast on the authority 's work . " i would have wished that this decision was made differently in view of the symbolic level involved , " she said , adding that german employment law kept her from being able to make significant changes to the office 's personnel . of the 52 people involved 41 are reported to be employed as the building 's watchmen , while the others are involved in the authority 's administration . no group of people from the former communist bloc were as highly monitored as the east germans .

" genocide in slow motion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dafur is still unstable and killing of civilians by rebel groups is still rife the united nations has been contemplating sending a larger multilateral contingent to darfur to establish peace in the region under its own command . " if the current african union mandate for darfur were to be transferred into the hands of the united nations , we would not be in a position to ignore such a development , " jung told german public television on thursday . " we could n't just say ' no ' to a un request to contribute troops to a multinational effort to establish peace , " he added . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said a multinational approach should be taken to addressing the violence . " there would be african troops involved in such a mission alongside asian troops and european troops , " she said earlier this week .
" germany would have no right to stand on the sidelines - after all , what we are witnessing in the darfur region is a sort of genocide in slow motion . " other lawmakers from germany 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats , however , have heavily criticized what they call an untimely offer on the part of the defense minister . critics warn germany to not interfere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german politicans want the african region to resolve conflicts itself peter ramsauer of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , lashed out at the defense minister for not coordinating his statements on darfur with parliamentary leaders . in addition to stating his opposition to a larger german deployment in sudan , ramsauer also pointed out there has been no request from the united nations for troops . head of the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party guido westerwelle called jung 's campaign a " grave mistake " that went against germany 's post-world war ii restraint on the foreign policy front . germany currently has 41 military observers stationed with un forces in sudan .
the german cabinet agreed to extend the troops ' mandate on wednesday and set a deployment cap of 200 soldiers . us could step-up pressure karsten voigt , the german government 's coordinator for transatlantic relations , said he is certain members of the us democratic party will try and put more pressure on europe , including germany , to help resolve to darfur conflict . " many us democrats are indeed urging the european union and nato to become active in darfur , " voigt said .
" but right now i do n't sense much willingness on the part of european partners to step into action , nor do i see any majority backing for such a mission in the german parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : benedict 's birthday from a small bavarian town to the papacy " he must finally take some action " pope leads easter celebrations , announces first book the pope in bavaria religion -pipe- 01.12.2006 pope heads for home after weathering turkish storm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's visit turned into a fence-mending mission after his quoted remarks on islam pope benedict xvi left turkey on friday after a momentous visit in which he reached out to muslims and orthodox christians while standing firm on key issues such as papal authority and europe 's christian roots . coming a mere 10 weeks after the leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics outraged muslims by appearing to equate islam with violence , the four-day trip - pope benedict 's first to a muslim country - turned into a fence-mending mission . adding drama to diplomacy , the 79-year-old pope made a stunning conciliatory gesture on thursday when he assumed an attitude of muslim prayer while facing mecca in istanbul 's blue mosque . the moment was " even more meaningful than an apology " for the remarks in september , said the mufti of istanbul , mustafa cagrici , who was the pope 's guide during the mosque visit . the two men , clad in long white robes , stood motionless for about two minutes , their hands crossed on their stomachs in a classic muslim prayer attitude known as " the posture of tranquility .

on world aids day , dw asked him about the issues facing his organization . luis carlos escobar pinzon was named executive director of deutsche aidshilfe , a 120-member umbrella organization for community-based health organizations , last january . born in columbia , escobar has lived in germany for the past 14 years , working in public health research .
dw-world.de : dr. escobar , the situation surrounding aids education and treatment has changed a great deal in the past decade .
what is the state of affairs in germany today ? luis carlos escobar de pinzon : since anti-retrovirus combination therapies were introduced , people with hiv have better treatment opportunities .
they can live for years symptom-free .
that may have led to the fact that many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly diseases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly , escobar said aids is now often seen as a chronic illness , so people are n't protecting themselves as well as they used to .
that 's been our experience , and we are really sorry to see it .
it is a huge new challenge in primary prevention . currently in germany , according to estimates by the robert koch institute , there are 56,000 people in germany living with hiv / aids .
the biggest group is what we call msm - men who have sex with men .
then a big second group is intravenous drug users .
a third group , that is catching up with the second group , is immigrants , especially from high-prevalence countries . you stepped into this job a year ago .
what were your goals when you took over - and how is it going ? my main goal was to once again make hiv and aids an important topic in society .
it is no longer as present in the media as it was in the beginning of the 1990s .
especially in local politics , the relevance of hiv and aids has faded . ...
we see this in budget cuts for prevention and sex education .
there are budget cuts of up to 30 percent in some regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she showed them the money : german health minister ulla schmidt but we 're really glad that on the federal level , we found someone like german health minister ulla schmidt , who is dedicated to putting the topics hiv / aids strongly on the political agenda .
she has seen to it that we get more federal funding to fight hiv and aids . there is still a lot of work left to be done , especially because in the context of this disease , we just ca n't deal with it regionally - it is a global challenge .
we will need to take stronger action ... especially with our neighbors in eastern europe . what are the biggest issues facing aids-related community health organizations today ? prevention , prevention , and more prevention .
since 2001 , we have noticed that the number of new diagnosis is growing again .
we have to find the reasons for this increase , and take appropriate action . in 2007 , dah is starting an interesting research project that should shed more light on the context and influences of new infections better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : needle-using drug addicts are the second-largest group of hiv / aids carriers in addition , we are also fighting the discrimination and stigmatization of people with hiv / aids .
where hiv / aids are taboo topics , prevention ca n't take hold .
we 're not talking just about solidarity with people who have hiv and aids .
this is about anti-discrimination work that is urgently needed to create a protected space for all people with chronic illnesses . how is the increasing prevalence of hiv / aids among immigrants and asylum seekers affecting germany , and aids policy here ? as a person who came here as an immigrant myself , i see it as a very important topic .
asylum seekers are especially threatened and endangered from hiv infection here . it is important to point up the difficult situation for immigrants in germany , especially those who are also are infected with hiv .
they do n't only have to fight the usual problems like racism , legal status , and financial difficulties .
they have an infection that is strongly taboo within their own community .
and naturally , because of cultural and language differences , they have difficulty accessing sex-education and prevention material . has the german regime under angela merkel been supportive of hiv / aids health organizations ?
what is your relationship with her administration ? we work tightly together with the government . ...
we 're really happy that the german health minister schmidt recently promised 3 million additional euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- for funding for primary prevention in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany said it plans to put aids at the top of its eu presidency health agenda beyond that , she announced that when germany holds the eu presidency -lrb- starting in 2007 -rrb- it wants to put the topic hiv / aids very high up on its political agenda . in germany we have a very privileged situation .
the numbers of new infections has n't risen as much as in other countries , even within europe .
but we need to help our neighbors , especially those from eastern europe , to do better and more intensive work on prevention .
we are all equally responsible for containing this disease . you 've had an exciting tenure so far at the head of the dah - what are your targets for this year ? above all , we want to lead a very important discussion on the role of civil society in primary prevention .
the catchword will be " responsibility . "
dah believes responsibility is not divisible .
everybody has equal responsibility for containing the spread of new infection in our country .
hiv positive people have responsibility to not pass the infection along .
but non-tested people and hiv-negative people have exactly as much responsibility to protect themselves from becoming infected . we need to have a discussion about this , in terms of medical ethics , and then develop concrete measures toward primary prevention in germany . jennifer abramsohn interviewed luis carlos escobar pinzon send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de apathy and false security lead to rise in german hiv cases as experts attend the international aids conference in toronto this week , german organizations are working hard to stop the worrying increase in hiv cases at home .

" genocide in slow motion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dafur is still unstable and killing of civilians by rebel groups is still rife the united nations has been contemplating sending a larger multilateral contingent to darfur to establish peace in the region under its own command . " if the current african union mandate for darfur were to be transferred into the hands of the united nations , we would not be in a position to ignore such a development , " jung told german public television on thursday . " we could n't just say ' no ' to a un request to contribute troops to a multinational effort to establish peace , " he added . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said a multinational approach should be taken to addressing the violence . " there would be african troops involved in such a mission alongside asian troops and european troops , " she said earlier this week .
" germany would have no right to stand on the sidelines - after all , what we are witnessing in the darfur region is a sort of genocide in slow motion . " other lawmakers from germany 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats , however , have heavily criticized what they call an untimely offer on the part of the defense minister . critics warn germany to not interfere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german politicans want the african region to resolve conflicts itself peter ramsauer of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , lashed out at the defense minister for not coordinating his statements on darfur with parliamentary leaders . in addition to stating his opposition to a larger german deployment in sudan , ramsauer also pointed out there has been no request from the united nations for troops . head of the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party guido westerwelle called jung 's campaign a " grave mistake " that went against germany 's post-world war ii restraint on the foreign policy front . germany currently has 41 military observers stationed with un forces in sudan .
the german cabinet agreed to extend the troops ' mandate on wednesday and set a deployment cap of 200 soldiers . us could step-up pressure karsten voigt , the german government 's coordinator for transatlantic relations , said he is certain members of the us democratic party will try and put more pressure on europe , including germany , to help resolve to darfur conflict . " many us democrats are indeed urging the european union and nato to become active in darfur , " voigt said .
" but right now i do n't sense much willingness on the part of european partners to step into action , nor do i see any majority backing for such a mission in the german parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 01.12.2006 " we are all equally responsible for containing this disease " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dah would like to see hiv / aids issues back in the public consciousness dr. luis carlos escobar pinzon is nearing his first anniversary at the head of german umbrella group deutsche aidshilfe -lrb- dah -rrb- .
on world aids day , dw asked him about the issues facing his organization . luis carlos escobar pinzon was named executive director of deutsche aidshilfe , a 120-member umbrella organization for community-based health organizations , last january . born in columbia , escobar has lived in germany for the past 14 years , working in public health research .
dw-world.de : dr. escobar , the situation surrounding aids education and treatment has changed a great deal in the past decade .
what is the state of affairs in germany today ? luis carlos escobar de pinzon : since anti-retrovirus combination therapies were introduced , people with hiv have better treatment opportunities .
they can live for years symptom-free .
that may have led to the fact that many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly diseases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly , escobar said aids is now often seen as a chronic illness , so people are n't protecting themselves as well as they used to .
that 's been our experience , and we are really sorry to see it .
it is a huge new challenge in primary prevention . currently in germany , according to estimates by the robert koch institute , there are 56,000 people in germany living with hiv / aids .
the biggest group is what we call msm - men who have sex with men .
then a big second group is intravenous drug users .
a third group , that is catching up with the second group , is immigrants , especially from high-prevalence countries . you stepped into this job a year ago .
what were your goals when you took over - and how is it going ? my main goal was to once again make hiv and aids an important topic in society .
it is no longer as present in the media as it was in the beginning of the 1990s .
especially in local politics , the relevance of hiv and aids has faded . ...
we see this in budget cuts for prevention and sex education .
there are budget cuts of up to 30 percent in some regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she showed them the money : german health minister ulla schmidt but we 're really glad that on the federal level , we found someone like german health minister ulla schmidt , who is dedicated to putting the topics hiv / aids strongly on the political agenda .
she has seen to it that we get more federal funding to fight hiv and aids . there is still a lot of work left to be done , especially because in the context of this disease , we just ca n't deal with it regionally - it is a global challenge .

on world aids day , dw asked him about the issues facing his organization . luis carlos escobar pinzon was named executive director of deutsche aidshilfe , a 120-member umbrella organization for community-based health organizations , last january . born in columbia , escobar has lived in germany for the past 14 years , working in public health research .
dw-world.de : dr. escobar , the situation surrounding aids education and treatment has changed a great deal in the past decade .
what is the state of affairs in germany today ? luis carlos escobar de pinzon : since anti-retrovirus combination therapies were introduced , people with hiv have better treatment opportunities .
they can live for years symptom-free .
that may have led to the fact that many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly diseases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly , escobar said aids is now often seen as a chronic illness , so people are n't protecting themselves as well as they used to .
that 's been our experience , and we are really sorry to see it .
it is a huge new challenge in primary prevention . currently in germany , according to estimates by the robert koch institute , there are 56,000 people in germany living with hiv / aids .
the biggest group is what we call msm - men who have sex with men .
then a big second group is intravenous drug users .
a third group , that is catching up with the second group , is immigrants , especially from high-prevalence countries . you stepped into this job a year ago .
what were your goals when you took over - and how is it going ? my main goal was to once again make hiv and aids an important topic in society .
it is no longer as present in the media as it was in the beginning of the 1990s .
especially in local politics , the relevance of hiv and aids has faded . ...
we see this in budget cuts for prevention and sex education .
there are budget cuts of up to 30 percent in some regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she showed them the money : german health minister ulla schmidt but we 're really glad that on the federal level , we found someone like german health minister ulla schmidt , who is dedicated to putting the topics hiv / aids strongly on the political agenda .
she has seen to it that we get more federal funding to fight hiv and aids . there is still a lot of work left to be done , especially because in the context of this disease , we just ca n't deal with it regionally - it is a global challenge .
we will need to take stronger action ... especially with our neighbors in eastern europe . what are the biggest issues facing aids-related community health organizations today ? prevention , prevention , and more prevention .

on world aids day , dw asked him about the issues facing his organization . luis carlos escobar pinzon was named executive director of deutsche aidshilfe , a 120-member umbrella organization for community-based health organizations , last january . born in columbia , escobar has lived in germany for the past 14 years , working in public health research .
dw-world.de : dr. escobar , the situation surrounding aids education and treatment has changed a great deal in the past decade .
what is the state of affairs in germany today ? luis carlos escobar de pinzon : since anti-retrovirus combination therapies were introduced , people with hiv have better treatment opportunities .
they can live for years symptom-free .
that may have led to the fact that many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly diseases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly , escobar said aids is now often seen as a chronic illness , so people are n't protecting themselves as well as they used to .
that 's been our experience , and we are really sorry to see it .
it is a huge new challenge in primary prevention . currently in germany , according to estimates by the robert koch institute , there are 56,000 people in germany living with hiv / aids .
the biggest group is what we call msm - men who have sex with men .
then a big second group is intravenous drug users .
a third group , that is catching up with the second group , is immigrants , especially from high-prevalence countries . you stepped into this job a year ago .
what were your goals when you took over - and how is it going ? my main goal was to once again make hiv and aids an important topic in society .
it is no longer as present in the media as it was in the beginning of the 1990s .
especially in local politics , the relevance of hiv and aids has faded . ...
we see this in budget cuts for prevention and sex education .
there are budget cuts of up to 30 percent in some regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she showed them the money : german health minister ulla schmidt but we 're really glad that on the federal level , we found someone like german health minister ulla schmidt , who is dedicated to putting the topics hiv / aids strongly on the political agenda .
she has seen to it that we get more federal funding to fight hiv and aids . there is still a lot of work left to be done , especially because in the context of this disease , we just ca n't deal with it regionally - it is a global challenge .
we will need to take stronger action ... especially with our neighbors in eastern europe . what are the biggest issues facing aids-related community health organizations today ? prevention , prevention , and more prevention .
since 2001 , we have noticed that the number of new diagnosis is growing again .
we have to find the reasons for this increase , and take appropriate action . in 2007 , dah is starting an interesting research project that should shed more light on the context and influences of new infections better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : needle-using drug addicts are the second-largest group of hiv / aids carriers in addition , we are also fighting the discrimination and stigmatization of people with hiv / aids .
where hiv / aids are taboo topics , prevention ca n't take hold .
we 're not talking just about solidarity with people who have hiv and aids .
this is about anti-discrimination work that is urgently needed to create a protected space for all people with chronic illnesses . how is the increasing prevalence of hiv / aids among immigrants and asylum seekers affecting germany , and aids policy here ? as a person who came here as an immigrant myself , i see it as a very important topic .
asylum seekers are especially threatened and endangered from hiv infection here . it is important to point up the difficult situation for immigrants in germany , especially those who are also are infected with hiv .
they do n't only have to fight the usual problems like racism , legal status , and financial difficulties .
they have an infection that is strongly taboo within their own community .
and naturally , because of cultural and language differences , they have difficulty accessing sex-education and prevention material . has the german regime under angela merkel been supportive of hiv / aids health organizations ?
what is your relationship with her administration ? we work tightly together with the government . ...
we 're really happy that the german health minister schmidt recently promised 3 million additional euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- for funding for primary prevention in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany said it plans to put aids at the top of its eu presidency health agenda beyond that , she announced that when germany holds the eu presidency -lrb- starting in 2007 -rrb- it wants to put the topic hiv / aids very high up on its political agenda . in germany we have a very privileged situation .
the numbers of new infections has n't risen as much as in other countries , even within europe .

we are all equally responsible for containing this disease . you 've had an exciting tenure so far at the head of the dah - what are your targets for this year ? above all , we want to lead a very important discussion on the role of civil society in primary prevention .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 01.12.2006 mysterious turnaround in gelsenkirchen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four straight wins have schalke celebrating again a month ago squabbling schalke were in complete turmoil .
now they 're grinding out wins and leading the league .
the funny thing is : no one seems to know exactly what put them back on track . october was not a happy month for schalke .
the team had crashed out of the both the uefa cup and the german cup , players were feuding , and many were calling for coach mirko slomka 's head .
schalke 's ever-passionate fans were so disgusted that they treated the team to 19 minutes and 4 seconds of the silent treatment at their home match to bayern . then something happened - schalke started winning and took over the top of the table . so what 's the key to the club 's sudden run of good form ?
part of the reason may be something schalke did n't do . " for the past four weeks , the players have been forbidden from talking to the press , " lars gartenschläger , a sports editor for the daily die welt newspaper told dw-world.de.
" that seems to have helped . " lowly opponents help schalke rack up points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke have had an easy time getting past lesser opponents lately another reason is schalke have suddenly discovered ability to grind out tight wins against inferior opponents .
their current four-game winning streak has come against a run of relegation candidates . " they 're now able to concentrate completely on the bundesliga , " explained wolfgang kerkhoff , a sports reporter who covers schalke for the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" a series of successes against relatively easy opponents has restored their self-confidence . " schalke 's 2-1 victory over lowly bochum last friday was nothing to write home about , but it kept them on top .
schalke seem to be applying the adage that championships are won not by beating bayern , but by picking up the points against teams like mainz and cottbus . the turnaround has even left fans shaking their heads in wonder . " i ca n't explain it , " rolf rojek , chairman of schalke 's association of fan clubs , told dw-world.de.
" we did n't know why things did n't work earlier , and we do n't really understand why they 've gotten better now .
that 's just the way soccer is . " like a marriage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka kept his cool and made some key personnel decisions a lot of credit should go to schalke coach slomka , who has shown both perseverance and courage this season .
his most daring move came in the bayern match in early november , when he benched long-time goalkeeper frank rost in favor of youngster manuel neuer .
schalke have n't lost since . " with hindsight , it was the right move , " said kerkhoff .
" after the same number of games , neuer 's statistics are better than rost 's . " an injury to forward gerald asamoah has also helped sort out personnel conflicts .
asamoah was at the center of schalke 's early-season squabbling when he demanded more playing time at the expense of twins halil and hamit altintop .
but ever since the german national broke his leg in late september , that disagreement has been moot . " slomka made a statement with rost , " gartenschläger said .
" maybe it 's not such a bad thing if one or two sources of discontent are put on ice .

" after the same number of games , neuer 's statistics are better than rost 's . " an injury to forward gerald asamoah has also helped sort out personnel conflicts .
asamoah was at the center of schalke 's early-season squabbling when he demanded more playing time at the expense of twins halil and hamit altintop .
but ever since the german national broke his leg in late september , that disagreement has been moot . " slomka made a statement with rost , " gartenschläger said .
" maybe it 's not such a bad thing if one or two sources of discontent are put on ice . " and perhaps the fans ' visible displays of dissatisfaction provided the bit of extra motivation needed to get the team to the very top , rojek added . " we showed that the basic connection between supporters and the club should never be undermined , " he said .
" it 's like a marriage . " the right stuff ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 5 goals and 4 assists , striker kevin kuranyi is back in schalke 's good graces whatever the reason , schalke are winning back fans ' affection .
much-maligned striker kevin kuranyi has started to find the goal again , and workhorses like midfielders levan kobiashvili and gustavo varela , or defender rafinha , have come up with big performances in tight matches to help schalke get the results . " our squad has as much quality as bayern munich 's , " slomka said this week in an interview with the german soccer magazine kicker . it would be ironic indeed if a season that began so acrimoniously ended with schalke winning its first league title since 1958 .
no one 's getting over-confident yet , but experts and fans agree that the team should be able to mount a sustained challenge . " with the other top teams playing like they are , anything is possible , " kerkhoff said .
" they have to worry about other competitions , so schalke should be able to compete for the title . " gartenschläger concurred : " it 's too early to say who 'll win , but schalke are certainly one of the three or four teams with a chance to take the title . " even schalke 's long-suffering , once-bitten-twice-shy supporters are feeling optimistic . " we hope and we believe that the team has the stuff to win a championship , " rojek said .
" but whether it will be enough in the end … that we do n't know .

11 .
critics continue to voice concerns about threats to civil liberties . after years of heated debate , the german bundestag agreed friday on the creation of a new anti-terror bill that is designed to promote communication and sharing of information between federal and state security services .
it will also include the creation of a controversial national security database and increased surveillance powers for the police and intelligence agencies . the proposal cleared the lower house of parliament with the support of chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats .
if the bill is approved by germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , in discussions on dec .
15 , it will become law effective jan .
1 . rejecting opposition concerns that the new bill would turn germany into a police state , minister of the interior wolfgang schäuble said no one could guarantee 100 percent security in these times but the government had the responsibility to do all it could to protect its citizens from the threat of international terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble said that no-one could guarantee total security schäuble maintained that the anti-terror database would create the right conditions for the police and the secret services to collaborate more efficiently and offer the highest level of security possible . though the grand coalition agreed on setting up a central anti-terrorism database last year , the two parties had differed on its exact shape and reach until friday . the idea is that all police and intelligence agencies , both at the federal and national level , would gather information about terror suspects and terrorist organizations in a central database that would be accessible to all crime-fighting agencies . fears about infringements on civil liberties at present , germany 's 37 agencies do that separately .
the central anti-terrorism database would also contain information about banking , telecommunication and internet information regarding the suspects . in addition to problems stemming from germany 's federal structure , critics had feared the database would create more bureaucracy as well as erode people 's privacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics fear anti-terror info could lead to legal problems some members of the social democrats as well as members of the opposition greens and the left party have expressed concerns that easily accessible information on terrorism suspects could be misused as well as create legal problems given the differing information-gathering methods of the police and intelligence agencies are allowed to employ . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany , given abuses under both the nazis and by communist east germany . there have also been fears that innocent people may become wrongly labeled as terrorists once they are included in the database as part of an investigation .
" whoever gets entered into that database will become a terrorist suspect , " greens politician wolfgang wieland said . in-depth information released on request only in a bid to limit this risk , the bill states that only the most basic information of people identified as a suspect in the initial investigations of the state police or federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- should be included in the database 's first level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal possession of firearms would be included in the files should an investigation continue and become more concrete , more detailed information on suspects would only be released after an official request .
these details would include religious affiliation , records pertaining to weapons possession or knowledge or possession of explosives and any affiliation with terror organizations . other information such as occupation , travel habits , bank and telecommunication data would also only be released on official request . post 9/11 terror laws expanded as well as approving the creation of the anti-terror database , the bundestag agreed to expand and extend the anti-terror laws that came into being in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states . the existing laws , which went into effect in early 2002 , allow police and secret services to use telephone communications , e-mails , faxes , bank accounts and travel data as sources of information .
under the proposed revisions , access to the same would be expanded .
in addition , germany 's foreign intelligence service , bnd , would have wider access to domestic police databases . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : new anti-terror tool comes way too late german security officials have ended a long deadlock by agreeing on a centralized database for terrorism suspects .

on world aids day , dw asked him about the issues facing his organization . luis carlos escobar pinzon was named executive director of deutsche aidshilfe , a 120-member umbrella organization for community-based health organizations , last january . born in columbia , escobar has lived in germany for the past 14 years , working in public health research .
dw-world.de : dr. escobar , the situation surrounding aids education and treatment has changed a great deal in the past decade .
what is the state of affairs in germany today ? luis carlos escobar de pinzon : since anti-retrovirus combination therapies were introduced , people with hiv have better treatment opportunities .
they can live for years symptom-free .
that may have led to the fact that many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly diseases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly , escobar said aids is now often seen as a chronic illness , so people are n't protecting themselves as well as they used to .
that 's been our experience , and we are really sorry to see it .
it is a huge new challenge in primary prevention . currently in germany , according to estimates by the robert koch institute , there are 56,000 people in germany living with hiv / aids .
the biggest group is what we call msm - men who have sex with men .
then a big second group is intravenous drug users .
a third group , that is catching up with the second group , is immigrants , especially from high-prevalence countries . you stepped into this job a year ago .
what were your goals when you took over - and how is it going ? my main goal was to once again make hiv and aids an important topic in society .
it is no longer as present in the media as it was in the beginning of the 1990s .
especially in local politics , the relevance of hiv and aids has faded . ...
we see this in budget cuts for prevention and sex education .
there are budget cuts of up to 30 percent in some regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she showed them the money : german health minister ulla schmidt but we 're really glad that on the federal level , we found someone like german health minister ulla schmidt , who is dedicated to putting the topics hiv / aids strongly on the political agenda .
she has seen to it that we get more federal funding to fight hiv and aids . there is still a lot of work left to be done , especially because in the context of this disease , we just ca n't deal with it regionally - it is a global challenge .
we will need to take stronger action ... especially with our neighbors in eastern europe . what are the biggest issues facing aids-related community health organizations today ? prevention , prevention , and more prevention .
since 2001 , we have noticed that the number of new diagnosis is growing again .
we have to find the reasons for this increase , and take appropriate action . in 2007 , dah is starting an interesting research project that should shed more light on the context and influences of new infections better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : needle-using drug addicts are the second-largest group of hiv / aids carriers in addition , we are also fighting the discrimination and stigmatization of people with hiv / aids .
where hiv / aids are taboo topics , prevention ca n't take hold .
we 're not talking just about solidarity with people who have hiv and aids .
this is about anti-discrimination work that is urgently needed to create a protected space for all people with chronic illnesses . how is the increasing prevalence of hiv / aids among immigrants and asylum seekers affecting germany , and aids policy here ? as a person who came here as an immigrant myself , i see it as a very important topic .
asylum seekers are especially threatened and endangered from hiv infection here . it is important to point up the difficult situation for immigrants in germany , especially those who are also are infected with hiv .
they do n't only have to fight the usual problems like racism , legal status , and financial difficulties .
they have an infection that is strongly taboo within their own community .
and naturally , because of cultural and language differences , they have difficulty accessing sex-education and prevention material . has the german regime under angela merkel been supportive of hiv / aids health organizations ?
what is your relationship with her administration ? we work tightly together with the government . ...
we 're really happy that the german health minister schmidt recently promised 3 million additional euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- for funding for primary prevention in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany said it plans to put aids at the top of its eu presidency health agenda beyond that , she announced that when germany holds the eu presidency -lrb- starting in 2007 -rrb- it wants to put the topic hiv / aids very high up on its political agenda . in germany we have a very privileged situation .
the numbers of new infections has n't risen as much as in other countries , even within europe .
but we need to help our neighbors , especially those from eastern europe , to do better and more intensive work on prevention .
we are all equally responsible for containing this disease . you 've had an exciting tenure so far at the head of the dah - what are your targets for this year ? above all , we want to lead a very important discussion on the role of civil society in primary prevention .
the catchword will be " responsibility . "
dah believes responsibility is not divisible .
everybody has equal responsibility for containing the spread of new infection in our country .
hiv positive people have responsibility to not pass the infection along .
but non-tested people and hiv-negative people have exactly as much responsibility to protect themselves from becoming infected . we need to have a discussion about this , in terms of medical ethics , and then develop concrete measures toward primary prevention in germany . jennifer abramsohn interviewed luis carlos escobar pinzon send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de apathy and false security lead to rise in german hiv cases as experts attend the international aids conference in toronto this week , german organizations are working hard to stop the worrying increase in hiv cases at home .
-lrb- 18.08.2006 -rrb- german minister promises millions in fight against aids at the largest-ever international aids conference that currently takes place in toronto , germany 's development minister brought good news on increased funding from germany .
-lrb- 14.08.2006 -rrb- africa untouched by west 's success in battling aids as the un general assembly convenes a special conference on aids , the rapid progress made in germany and the west in preventing the infection passing from mother to child has n't been repeated in places like africa .

" " it was something beautiful , a gesture on his part , " cagrici told the turkish daily sabah . mosque visit and gesture welcomed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's gesture at the blue mosque was appreciated in entering the mosque , pope benedict became only the second roman catholic pope to do so since the groundbreaking visit of his predecessor john paul ii to the great ummayad mosque in damascus in 2001 . the pontiff said before his departure that he hoped his visit would contribute to a " better understanding " between religions . the visit saw unprecedented security measures - even tighter than those laid on for us president george w. bush in 2004 - with large swathes of istanbul closed as the routes taken by the pope 's motorcade were kept secret . even before the controversy over his remarks on islam , pope benedict faced an uphill struggle to win over the turks , having been considered the " anti-turkish pope " for opposing ankara 's bid to join the european union . u-turn on eu stance but provisos remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict 's eu stance prompted criticism turkey in the eu , he had said while still cardinal joseph ratzinger , would be " a grave error ... against the tide of history . " he dealt with this by making a complete turnaround on the issue moments after descending from his plane on his arrival in ankara on tuesday , offering his support for the troubled candidacy in remarks to prime minister recep tayyip erdogan . but he added two provisos on thursday , saying respect for religious freedom must be a criterion for entry into the eu and calling on the bloc to ensure that its members respect the rights of their religious minorities . it was a clear reference to complaints by the orthodox patriarchate of restrictions imposed on it by turkey , including the closure of a seminary and the confiscation of a number of properties from christian foundations . pope benedict also returned to a familiar position when he called for a renewal of " europe 's awareness of its christian roots , traditions and values . " a quest to heal a splintered religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope discussed the schism with bartholomew the main purpose of the long-planned trip and a priority of pope benedict 's papacy - seeking reconciliation between the western and eastern rites of christianity - was symbolized by a saint andrew 's day mass on thursday . saint andrew is the orthodox church 's patron saint , was a disciple of jesus and the brother of saint peter , considered the first catholic pope . after meetings with bartholomew i , spiritual leader of some 150 million orthodox faithful , the pope described the schism between the feuding christian branches dating back nearly a millennium as a " scandal to the world .

" genocide in slow motion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dafur is still unstable and killing of civilians by rebel groups is still rife the united nations has been contemplating sending a larger multilateral contingent to darfur to establish peace in the region under its own command . " if the current african union mandate for darfur were to be transferred into the hands of the united nations , we would not be in a position to ignore such a development , " jung told german public television on thursday . " we could n't just say ' no ' to a un request to contribute troops to a multinational effort to establish peace , " he added . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said a multinational approach should be taken to addressing the violence . " there would be african troops involved in such a mission alongside asian troops and european troops , " she said earlier this week .
" germany would have no right to stand on the sidelines - after all , what we are witnessing in the darfur region is a sort of genocide in slow motion . " other lawmakers from germany 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats , however , have heavily criticized what they call an untimely offer on the part of the defense minister . critics warn germany to not interfere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german politicans want the african region to resolve conflicts itself peter ramsauer of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , lashed out at the defense minister for not coordinating his statements on darfur with parliamentary leaders . in addition to stating his opposition to a larger german deployment in sudan , ramsauer also pointed out there has been no request from the united nations for troops . head of the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party guido westerwelle called jung 's campaign a " grave mistake " that went against germany 's post-world war ii restraint on the foreign policy front . germany currently has 41 military observers stationed with un forces in sudan .
the german cabinet agreed to extend the troops ' mandate on wednesday and set a deployment cap of 200 soldiers . us could step-up pressure karsten voigt , the german government 's coordinator for transatlantic relations , said he is certain members of the us democratic party will try and put more pressure on europe , including germany , to help resolve to darfur conflict . " many us democrats are indeed urging the european union and nato to become active in darfur , " voigt said .
" but right now i do n't sense much willingness on the part of european partners to step into action , nor do i see any majority backing for such a mission in the german parliament .

" " it was something beautiful , a gesture on his part , " cagrici told the turkish daily sabah . mosque visit and gesture welcomed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's gesture at the blue mosque was appreciated in entering the mosque , pope benedict became only the second roman catholic pope to do so since the groundbreaking visit of his predecessor john paul ii to the great ummayad mosque in damascus in 2001 . the pontiff said before his departure that he hoped his visit would contribute to a " better understanding " between religions . the visit saw unprecedented security measures - even tighter than those laid on for us president george w. bush in 2004 - with large swathes of istanbul closed as the routes taken by the pope 's motorcade were kept secret . even before the controversy over his remarks on islam , pope benedict faced an uphill struggle to win over the turks , having been considered the " anti-turkish pope " for opposing ankara 's bid to join the european union . u-turn on eu stance but provisos remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict 's eu stance prompted criticism turkey in the eu , he had said while still cardinal joseph ratzinger , would be " a grave error ... against the tide of history . " he dealt with this by making a complete turnaround on the issue moments after descending from his plane on his arrival in ankara on tuesday , offering his support for the troubled candidacy in remarks to prime minister recep tayyip erdogan . but he added two provisos on thursday , saying respect for religious freedom must be a criterion for entry into the eu and calling on the bloc to ensure that its members respect the rights of their religious minorities . it was a clear reference to complaints by the orthodox patriarchate of restrictions imposed on it by turkey , including the closure of a seminary and the confiscation of a number of properties from christian foundations . pope benedict also returned to a familiar position when he called for a renewal of " europe 's awareness of its christian roots , traditions and values . " a quest to heal a splintered religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope discussed the schism with bartholomew the main purpose of the long-planned trip and a priority of pope benedict 's papacy - seeking reconciliation between the western and eastern rites of christianity - was symbolized by a saint andrew 's day mass on thursday . saint andrew is the orthodox church 's patron saint , was a disciple of jesus and the brother of saint peter , considered the first catholic pope . after meetings with bartholomew i , spiritual leader of some 150 million orthodox faithful , the pope described the schism between the feuding christian branches dating back nearly a millennium as a " scandal to the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 01.12.2006 " we are all equally responsible for containing this disease " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dah would like to see hiv / aids issues back in the public consciousness dr. luis carlos escobar pinzon is nearing his first anniversary at the head of german umbrella group deutsche aidshilfe -lrb- dah -rrb- .
on world aids day , dw asked him about the issues facing his organization . luis carlos escobar pinzon was named executive director of deutsche aidshilfe , a 120-member umbrella organization for community-based health organizations , last january . born in columbia , escobar has lived in germany for the past 14 years , working in public health research .
dw-world.de : dr. escobar , the situation surrounding aids education and treatment has changed a great deal in the past decade .
what is the state of affairs in germany today ? luis carlos escobar de pinzon : since anti-retrovirus combination therapies were introduced , people with hiv have better treatment opportunities .
they can live for years symptom-free .
that may have led to the fact that many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly diseases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly , escobar said aids is now often seen as a chronic illness , so people are n't protecting themselves as well as they used to .
that 's been our experience , and we are really sorry to see it .
it is a huge new challenge in primary prevention . currently in germany , according to estimates by the robert koch institute , there are 56,000 people in germany living with hiv / aids .
the biggest group is what we call msm - men who have sex with men .
then a big second group is intravenous drug users .
a third group , that is catching up with the second group , is immigrants , especially from high-prevalence countries . you stepped into this job a year ago .
what were your goals when you took over - and how is it going ? my main goal was to once again make hiv and aids an important topic in society .
it is no longer as present in the media as it was in the beginning of the 1990s .
especially in local politics , the relevance of hiv and aids has faded . ...
we see this in budget cuts for prevention and sex education .
there are budget cuts of up to 30 percent in some regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she showed them the money : german health minister ulla schmidt but we 're really glad that on the federal level , we found someone like german health minister ulla schmidt , who is dedicated to putting the topics hiv / aids strongly on the political agenda .
she has seen to it that we get more federal funding to fight hiv and aids . there is still a lot of work left to be done , especially because in the context of this disease , we just ca n't deal with it regionally - it is a global challenge .
we will need to take stronger action ... especially with our neighbors in eastern europe . what are the biggest issues facing aids-related community health organizations today ? prevention , prevention , and more prevention .
since 2001 , we have noticed that the number of new diagnosis is growing again .
we have to find the reasons for this increase , and take appropriate action . in 2007 , dah is starting an interesting research project that should shed more light on the context and influences of new infections better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : needle-using drug addicts are the second-largest group of hiv / aids carriers in addition , we are also fighting the discrimination and stigmatization of people with hiv / aids .
where hiv / aids are taboo topics , prevention ca n't take hold .
we 're not talking just about solidarity with people who have hiv and aids .
this is about anti-discrimination work that is urgently needed to create a protected space for all people with chronic illnesses . how is the increasing prevalence of hiv / aids among immigrants and asylum seekers affecting germany , and aids policy here ? as a person who came here as an immigrant myself , i see it as a very important topic .
asylum seekers are especially threatened and endangered from hiv infection here . it is important to point up the difficult situation for immigrants in germany , especially those who are also are infected with hiv .
they do n't only have to fight the usual problems like racism , legal status , and financial difficulties .
they have an infection that is strongly taboo within their own community .
and naturally , because of cultural and language differences , they have difficulty accessing sex-education and prevention material . has the german regime under angela merkel been supportive of hiv / aids health organizations ?
what is your relationship with her administration ? we work tightly together with the government . ...
we 're really happy that the german health minister schmidt recently promised 3 million additional euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- for funding for primary prevention in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany said it plans to put aids at the top of its eu presidency health agenda beyond that , she announced that when germany holds the eu presidency -lrb- starting in 2007 -rrb- it wants to put the topic hiv / aids very high up on its political agenda . in germany we have a very privileged situation .
the numbers of new infections has n't risen as much as in other countries , even within europe .
but we need to help our neighbors , especially those from eastern europe , to do better and more intensive work on prevention .
we are all equally responsible for containing this disease . you 've had an exciting tenure so far at the head of the dah - what are your targets for this year ? above all , we want to lead a very important discussion on the role of civil society in primary prevention .
the catchword will be " responsibility . "
dah believes responsibility is not divisible .
everybody has equal responsibility for containing the spread of new infection in our country .
hiv positive people have responsibility to not pass the infection along .
but non-tested people and hiv-negative people have exactly as much responsibility to protect themselves from becoming infected . we need to have a discussion about this , in terms of medical ethics , and then develop concrete measures toward primary prevention in germany . jennifer abramsohn interviewed luis carlos escobar pinzon send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de apathy and false security lead to rise in german hiv cases as experts attend the international aids conference in toronto this week , german organizations are working hard to stop the worrying increase in hiv cases at home .
-lrb- 18.08.2006 -rrb- german minister promises millions in fight against aids at the largest-ever international aids conference that currently takes place in toronto , germany 's development minister brought good news on increased funding from germany .

on world aids day , dw asked him about the issues facing his organization . luis carlos escobar pinzon was named executive director of deutsche aidshilfe , a 120-member umbrella organization for community-based health organizations , last january . born in columbia , escobar has lived in germany for the past 14 years , working in public health research .
dw-world.de : dr. escobar , the situation surrounding aids education and treatment has changed a great deal in the past decade .
what is the state of affairs in germany today ? luis carlos escobar de pinzon : since anti-retrovirus combination therapies were introduced , people with hiv have better treatment opportunities .
they can live for years symptom-free .
that may have led to the fact that many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly diseases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly , escobar said aids is now often seen as a chronic illness , so people are n't protecting themselves as well as they used to .
that 's been our experience , and we are really sorry to see it .
it is a huge new challenge in primary prevention . currently in germany , according to estimates by the robert koch institute , there are 56,000 people in germany living with hiv / aids .
the biggest group is what we call msm - men who have sex with men .
then a big second group is intravenous drug users .
a third group , that is catching up with the second group , is immigrants , especially from high-prevalence countries . you stepped into this job a year ago .
what were your goals when you took over - and how is it going ? my main goal was to once again make hiv and aids an important topic in society .
it is no longer as present in the media as it was in the beginning of the 1990s .
especially in local politics , the relevance of hiv and aids has faded . ...
we see this in budget cuts for prevention and sex education .
there are budget cuts of up to 30 percent in some regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she showed them the money : german health minister ulla schmidt but we 're really glad that on the federal level , we found someone like german health minister ulla schmidt , who is dedicated to putting the topics hiv / aids strongly on the political agenda .
she has seen to it that we get more federal funding to fight hiv and aids . there is still a lot of work left to be done , especially because in the context of this disease , we just ca n't deal with it regionally - it is a global challenge .
we will need to take stronger action ... especially with our neighbors in eastern europe . what are the biggest issues facing aids-related community health organizations today ? prevention , prevention , and more prevention .
since 2001 , we have noticed that the number of new diagnosis is growing again .
we have to find the reasons for this increase , and take appropriate action . in 2007 , dah is starting an interesting research project that should shed more light on the context and influences of new infections better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : needle-using drug addicts are the second-largest group of hiv / aids carriers in addition , we are also fighting the discrimination and stigmatization of people with hiv / aids .
where hiv / aids are taboo topics , prevention ca n't take hold .
we 're not talking just about solidarity with people who have hiv and aids .
this is about anti-discrimination work that is urgently needed to create a protected space for all people with chronic illnesses . how is the increasing prevalence of hiv / aids among immigrants and asylum seekers affecting germany , and aids policy here ? as a person who came here as an immigrant myself , i see it as a very important topic .
asylum seekers are especially threatened and endangered from hiv infection here . it is important to point up the difficult situation for immigrants in germany , especially those who are also are infected with hiv .
they do n't only have to fight the usual problems like racism , legal status , and financial difficulties .
they have an infection that is strongly taboo within their own community .
and naturally , because of cultural and language differences , they have difficulty accessing sex-education and prevention material . has the german regime under angela merkel been supportive of hiv / aids health organizations ?
what is your relationship with her administration ? we work tightly together with the government . ...
we 're really happy that the german health minister schmidt recently promised 3 million additional euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- for funding for primary prevention in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany said it plans to put aids at the top of its eu presidency health agenda beyond that , she announced that when germany holds the eu presidency -lrb- starting in 2007 -rrb- it wants to put the topic hiv / aids very high up on its political agenda . in germany we have a very privileged situation .
the numbers of new infections has n't risen as much as in other countries , even within europe .
but we need to help our neighbors , especially those from eastern europe , to do better and more intensive work on prevention .
we are all equally responsible for containing this disease . you 've had an exciting tenure so far at the head of the dah - what are your targets for this year ? above all , we want to lead a very important discussion on the role of civil society in primary prevention .
the catchword will be " responsibility . "
dah believes responsibility is not divisible .
everybody has equal responsibility for containing the spread of new infection in our country .
hiv positive people have responsibility to not pass the infection along .
but non-tested people and hiv-negative people have exactly as much responsibility to protect themselves from becoming infected . we need to have a discussion about this , in terms of medical ethics , and then develop concrete measures toward primary prevention in germany . jennifer abramsohn interviewed luis carlos escobar pinzon send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de apathy and false security lead to rise in german hiv cases as experts attend the international aids conference in toronto this week , german organizations are working hard to stop the worrying increase in hiv cases at home .

the law also allows the history of leading officials in sporting bodies to be examined . the original legislation was introduced in 1991 , the year after east and west germany were reunified , but was due to expire in december . there had been a proposal - supported by all parties except the opposition left party , which is composed mainly of east german former communists - not to renew the law and therefore end the process of carrying out background checks . but after protests from groups representing victims of the east german regime , a compromise was struck maintaining the checks until december 2011 . stasi officials working on files bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi data authority employs over 50 former stasi members the authorities who manage the archives containing millions of files compiled by agents regarding their fellow citizens confirmed press reports on thursday that it employs 52 former stasi officials . marianne birthler , the head of the stasi data authority , said it was necessary to employ stasi officials because of their knowledge of the files , though she said she could understand the suspicion it would cast on the authority 's work . " i would have wished that this decision was made differently in view of the symbolic level involved , " she said , adding that german employment law kept her from being able to make significant changes to the office 's personnel . of the 52 people involved 41 are reported to be employed as the building 's watchmen , while the others are involved in the authority 's administration . no group of people from the former communist bloc were as highly monitored as the east germans .

" " it was something beautiful , a gesture on his part , " cagrici told the turkish daily sabah . mosque visit and gesture welcomed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's gesture at the blue mosque was appreciated in entering the mosque , pope benedict became only the second roman catholic pope to do so since the groundbreaking visit of his predecessor john paul ii to the great ummayad mosque in damascus in 2001 . the pontiff said before his departure that he hoped his visit would contribute to a " better understanding " between religions . the visit saw unprecedented security measures - even tighter than those laid on for us president george w. bush in 2004 - with large swathes of istanbul closed as the routes taken by the pope 's motorcade were kept secret . even before the controversy over his remarks on islam , pope benedict faced an uphill struggle to win over the turks , having been considered the " anti-turkish pope " for opposing ankara 's bid to join the european union . u-turn on eu stance but provisos remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict 's eu stance prompted criticism turkey in the eu , he had said while still cardinal joseph ratzinger , would be " a grave error ... against the tide of history . " he dealt with this by making a complete turnaround on the issue moments after descending from his plane on his arrival in ankara on tuesday , offering his support for the troubled candidacy in remarks to prime minister recep tayyip erdogan . but he added two provisos on thursday , saying respect for religious freedom must be a criterion for entry into the eu and calling on the bloc to ensure that its members respect the rights of their religious minorities . it was a clear reference to complaints by the orthodox patriarchate of restrictions imposed on it by turkey , including the closure of a seminary and the confiscation of a number of properties from christian foundations . pope benedict also returned to a familiar position when he called for a renewal of " europe 's awareness of its christian roots , traditions and values . " a quest to heal a splintered religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope discussed the schism with bartholomew the main purpose of the long-planned trip and a priority of pope benedict 's papacy - seeking reconciliation between the western and eastern rites of christianity - was symbolized by a saint andrew 's day mass on thursday . saint andrew is the orthodox church 's patron saint , was a disciple of jesus and the brother of saint peter , considered the first catholic pope . after meetings with bartholomew i , spiritual leader of some 150 million orthodox faithful , the pope described the schism between the feuding christian branches dating back nearly a millennium as a " scandal to the world .

" genocide in slow motion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dafur is still unstable and killing of civilians by rebel groups is still rife the united nations has been contemplating sending a larger multilateral contingent to darfur to establish peace in the region under its own command . " if the current african union mandate for darfur were to be transferred into the hands of the united nations , we would not be in a position to ignore such a development , " jung told german public television on thursday . " we could n't just say ' no ' to a un request to contribute troops to a multinational effort to establish peace , " he added . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said a multinational approach should be taken to addressing the violence . " there would be african troops involved in such a mission alongside asian troops and european troops , " she said earlier this week .
" germany would have no right to stand on the sidelines - after all , what we are witnessing in the darfur region is a sort of genocide in slow motion . " other lawmakers from germany 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats , however , have heavily criticized what they call an untimely offer on the part of the defense minister . critics warn germany to not interfere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german politicans want the african region to resolve conflicts itself peter ramsauer of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , lashed out at the defense minister for not coordinating his statements on darfur with parliamentary leaders . in addition to stating his opposition to a larger german deployment in sudan , ramsauer also pointed out there has been no request from the united nations for troops . head of the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party guido westerwelle called jung 's campaign a " grave mistake " that went against germany 's post-world war ii restraint on the foreign policy front . germany currently has 41 military observers stationed with un forces in sudan .
the german cabinet agreed to extend the troops ' mandate on wednesday and set a deployment cap of 200 soldiers . us could step-up pressure karsten voigt , the german government 's coordinator for transatlantic relations , said he is certain members of the us democratic party will try and put more pressure on europe , including germany , to help resolve to darfur conflict . " many us democrats are indeed urging the european union and nato to become active in darfur , " voigt said .

" genocide in slow motion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dafur is still unstable and killing of civilians by rebel groups is still rife the united nations has been contemplating sending a larger multilateral contingent to darfur to establish peace in the region under its own command . " if the current african union mandate for darfur were to be transferred into the hands of the united nations , we would not be in a position to ignore such a development , " jung told german public television on thursday . " we could n't just say ' no ' to a un request to contribute troops to a multinational effort to establish peace , " he added . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said a multinational approach should be taken to addressing the violence . " there would be african troops involved in such a mission alongside asian troops and european troops , " she said earlier this week .
" germany would have no right to stand on the sidelines - after all , what we are witnessing in the darfur region is a sort of genocide in slow motion . " other lawmakers from germany 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats , however , have heavily criticized what they call an untimely offer on the part of the defense minister . critics warn germany to not interfere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german politicans want the african region to resolve conflicts itself peter ramsauer of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , lashed out at the defense minister for not coordinating his statements on darfur with parliamentary leaders . in addition to stating his opposition to a larger german deployment in sudan , ramsauer also pointed out there has been no request from the united nations for troops . head of the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party guido westerwelle called jung 's campaign a " grave mistake " that went against germany 's post-world war ii restraint on the foreign policy front . germany currently has 41 military observers stationed with un forces in sudan .
the german cabinet agreed to extend the troops ' mandate on wednesday and set a deployment cap of 200 soldiers . us could step-up pressure karsten voigt , the german government 's coordinator for transatlantic relations , said he is certain members of the us democratic party will try and put more pressure on europe , including germany , to help resolve to darfur conflict . " many us democrats are indeed urging the european union and nato to become active in darfur , " voigt said .
" but right now i do n't sense much willingness on the part of european partners to step into action , nor do i see any majority backing for such a mission in the german parliament .

now they 're grinding out wins and leading the league .
the funny thing is : no one seems to know exactly what put them back on track . october was not a happy month for schalke .
the team had crashed out of the both the uefa cup and the german cup , players were feuding , and many were calling for coach mirko slomka 's head .
schalke 's ever-passionate fans were so disgusted that they treated the team to 19 minutes and 4 seconds of the silent treatment at their home match to bayern . then something happened - schalke started winning and took over the top of the table . so what 's the key to the club 's sudden run of good form ?
part of the reason may be something schalke did n't do . " for the past four weeks , the players have been forbidden from talking to the press , " lars gartenschläger , a sports editor for the daily die welt newspaper told dw-world.de.
" that seems to have helped . " lowly opponents help schalke rack up points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke have had an easy time getting past lesser opponents lately another reason is schalke have suddenly discovered ability to grind out tight wins against inferior opponents .
their current four-game winning streak has come against a run of relegation candidates . " they 're now able to concentrate completely on the bundesliga , " explained wolfgang kerkhoff , a sports reporter who covers schalke for the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" a series of successes against relatively easy opponents has restored their self-confidence . " schalke 's 2-1 victory over lowly bochum last friday was nothing to write home about , but it kept them on top .
schalke seem to be applying the adage that championships are won not by beating bayern , but by picking up the points against teams like mainz and cottbus . the turnaround has even left fans shaking their heads in wonder . " i ca n't explain it , " rolf rojek , chairman of schalke 's association of fan clubs , told dw-world.de.
" we did n't know why things did n't work earlier , and we do n't really understand why they 've gotten better now .
that 's just the way soccer is . " like a marriage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka kept his cool and made some key personnel decisions a lot of credit should go to schalke coach slomka , who has shown both perseverance and courage this season .
his most daring move came in the bayern match in early november , when he benched long-time goalkeeper frank rost in favor of youngster manuel neuer .
schalke have n't lost since . " with hindsight , it was the right move , " said kerkhoff .
" after the same number of games , neuer 's statistics are better than rost 's . " an injury to forward gerald asamoah has also helped sort out personnel conflicts .
asamoah was at the center of schalke 's early-season squabbling when he demanded more playing time at the expense of twins halil and hamit altintop .
but ever since the german national broke his leg in late september , that disagreement has been moot . " slomka made a statement with rost , " gartenschläger said .
" maybe it 's not such a bad thing if one or two sources of discontent are put on ice . " and perhaps the fans ' visible displays of dissatisfaction provided the bit of extra motivation needed to get the team to the very top , rojek added . " we showed that the basic connection between supporters and the club should never be undermined , " he said .
" it 's like a marriage . " the right stuff ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 5 goals and 4 assists , striker kevin kuranyi is back in schalke 's good graces whatever the reason , schalke are winning back fans ' affection .
much-maligned striker kevin kuranyi has started to find the goal again , and workhorses like midfielders levan kobiashvili and gustavo varela , or defender rafinha , have come up with big performances in tight matches to help schalke get the results . " our squad has as much quality as bayern munich 's , " slomka said this week in an interview with the german soccer magazine kicker . it would be ironic indeed if a season that began so acrimoniously ended with schalke winning its first league title since 1958 .
no one 's getting over-confident yet , but experts and fans agree that the team should be able to mount a sustained challenge . " with the other top teams playing like they are , anything is possible , " kerkhoff said .
" they have to worry about other competitions , so schalke should be able to compete for the title . " gartenschläger concurred : " it 's too early to say who 'll win , but schalke are certainly one of the three or four teams with a chance to take the title . " even schalke 's long-suffering , once-bitten-twice-shy supporters are feeling optimistic . " we hope and we believe that the team has the stuff to win a championship , " rojek said .

part of the reason may be something schalke did n't do . " for the past four weeks , the players have been forbidden from talking to the press , " lars gartenschläger , a sports editor for the daily die welt newspaper told dw-world.de.
" that seems to have helped . " lowly opponents help schalke rack up points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke have had an easy time getting past lesser opponents lately another reason is schalke have suddenly discovered ability to grind out tight wins against inferior opponents .
their current four-game winning streak has come against a run of relegation candidates . " they 're now able to concentrate completely on the bundesliga , " explained wolfgang kerkhoff , a sports reporter who covers schalke for the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" a series of successes against relatively easy opponents has restored their self-confidence . " schalke 's 2-1 victory over lowly bochum last friday was nothing to write home about , but it kept them on top .
schalke seem to be applying the adage that championships are won not by beating bayern , but by picking up the points against teams like mainz and cottbus . the turnaround has even left fans shaking their heads in wonder . " i ca n't explain it , " rolf rojek , chairman of schalke 's association of fan clubs , told dw-world.de.
" we did n't know why things did n't work earlier , and we do n't really understand why they 've gotten better now .
that 's just the way soccer is . " like a marriage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka kept his cool and made some key personnel decisions a lot of credit should go to schalke coach slomka , who has shown both perseverance and courage this season .
his most daring move came in the bayern match in early november , when he benched long-time goalkeeper frank rost in favor of youngster manuel neuer .
schalke have n't lost since . " with hindsight , it was the right move , " said kerkhoff .
" after the same number of games , neuer 's statistics are better than rost 's . " an injury to forward gerald asamoah has also helped sort out personnel conflicts .
asamoah was at the center of schalke 's early-season squabbling when he demanded more playing time at the expense of twins halil and hamit altintop .
but ever since the german national broke his leg in late september , that disagreement has been moot . " slomka made a statement with rost , " gartenschläger said .
" maybe it 's not such a bad thing if one or two sources of discontent are put on ice . " and perhaps the fans ' visible displays of dissatisfaction provided the bit of extra motivation needed to get the team to the very top , rojek added . " we showed that the basic connection between supporters and the club should never be undermined , " he said .
" it 's like a marriage . " the right stuff ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 5 goals and 4 assists , striker kevin kuranyi is back in schalke 's good graces whatever the reason , schalke are winning back fans ' affection .
much-maligned striker kevin kuranyi has started to find the goal again , and workhorses like midfielders levan kobiashvili and gustavo varela , or defender rafinha , have come up with big performances in tight matches to help schalke get the results . " our squad has as much quality as bayern munich 's , " slomka said this week in an interview with the german soccer magazine kicker . it would be ironic indeed if a season that began so acrimoniously ended with schalke winning its first league title since 1958 .
no one 's getting over-confident yet , but experts and fans agree that the team should be able to mount a sustained challenge . " with the other top teams playing like they are , anything is possible , " kerkhoff said .
" they have to worry about other competitions , so schalke should be able to compete for the title . " gartenschläger concurred : " it 's too early to say who 'll win , but schalke are certainly one of the three or four teams with a chance to take the title . " even schalke 's long-suffering , once-bitten-twice-shy supporters are feeling optimistic . " we hope and we believe that the team has the stuff to win a championship , " rojek said .
" but whether it will be enough in the end … that we do n't know .

" genocide in slow motion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dafur is still unstable and killing of civilians by rebel groups is still rife the united nations has been contemplating sending a larger multilateral contingent to darfur to establish peace in the region under its own command . " if the current african union mandate for darfur were to be transferred into the hands of the united nations , we would not be in a position to ignore such a development , " jung told german public television on thursday . " we could n't just say ' no ' to a un request to contribute troops to a multinational effort to establish peace , " he added . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said a multinational approach should be taken to addressing the violence .

the law also allows the history of leading officials in sporting bodies to be examined . the original legislation was introduced in 1991 , the year after east and west germany were reunified , but was due to expire in december . there had been a proposal - supported by all parties except the opposition left party , which is composed mainly of east german former communists - not to renew the law and therefore end the process of carrying out background checks . but after protests from groups representing victims of the east german regime , a compromise was struck maintaining the checks until december 2011 . stasi officials working on files bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi data authority employs over 50 former stasi members the authorities who manage the archives containing millions of files compiled by agents regarding their fellow citizens confirmed press reports on thursday that it employs 52 former stasi officials . marianne birthler , the head of the stasi data authority , said it was necessary to employ stasi officials because of their knowledge of the files , though she said she could understand the suspicion it would cast on the authority 's work . " i would have wished that this decision was made differently in view of the symbolic level involved , " she said , adding that german employment law kept her from being able to make significant changes to the office 's personnel . of the 52 people involved 41 are reported to be employed as the building 's watchmen , while the others are involved in the authority 's administration . no group of people from the former communist bloc were as highly monitored as the east germans .

now they 're grinding out wins and leading the league .
the funny thing is : no one seems to know exactly what put them back on track . october was not a happy month for schalke .
the team had crashed out of the both the uefa cup and the german cup , players were feuding , and many were calling for coach mirko slomka 's head .
schalke 's ever-passionate fans were so disgusted that they treated the team to 19 minutes and 4 seconds of the silent treatment at their home match to bayern . then something happened - schalke started winning and took over the top of the table . so what 's the key to the club 's sudden run of good form ?
part of the reason may be something schalke did n't do . " for the past four weeks , the players have been forbidden from talking to the press , " lars gartenschläger , a sports editor for the daily die welt newspaper told dw-world.de.
" that seems to have helped . " lowly opponents help schalke rack up points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke have had an easy time getting past lesser opponents lately another reason is schalke have suddenly discovered ability to grind out tight wins against inferior opponents .
their current four-game winning streak has come against a run of relegation candidates . " they 're now able to concentrate completely on the bundesliga , " explained wolfgang kerkhoff , a sports reporter who covers schalke for the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" a series of successes against relatively easy opponents has restored their self-confidence . " schalke 's 2-1 victory over lowly bochum last friday was nothing to write home about , but it kept them on top .
schalke seem to be applying the adage that championships are won not by beating bayern , but by picking up the points against teams like mainz and cottbus . the turnaround has even left fans shaking their heads in wonder . " i ca n't explain it , " rolf rojek , chairman of schalke 's association of fan clubs , told dw-world.de.
" we did n't know why things did n't work earlier , and we do n't really understand why they 've gotten better now .
that 's just the way soccer is . " like a marriage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka kept his cool and made some key personnel decisions a lot of credit should go to schalke coach slomka , who has shown both perseverance and courage this season .
his most daring move came in the bayern match in early november , when he benched long-time goalkeeper frank rost in favor of youngster manuel neuer .
schalke have n't lost since . " with hindsight , it was the right move , " said kerkhoff .
" after the same number of games , neuer 's statistics are better than rost 's . " an injury to forward gerald asamoah has also helped sort out personnel conflicts .
asamoah was at the center of schalke 's early-season squabbling when he demanded more playing time at the expense of twins halil and hamit altintop .
but ever since the german national broke his leg in late september , that disagreement has been moot . " slomka made a statement with rost , " gartenschläger said .
" maybe it 's not such a bad thing if one or two sources of discontent are put on ice . " and perhaps the fans ' visible displays of dissatisfaction provided the bit of extra motivation needed to get the team to the very top , rojek added . " we showed that the basic connection between supporters and the club should never be undermined , " he said .
" it 's like a marriage . " the right stuff ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 5 goals and 4 assists , striker kevin kuranyi is back in schalke 's good graces whatever the reason , schalke are winning back fans ' affection .
much-maligned striker kevin kuranyi has started to find the goal again , and workhorses like midfielders levan kobiashvili and gustavo varela , or defender rafinha , have come up with big performances in tight matches to help schalke get the results . " our squad has as much quality as bayern munich 's , " slomka said this week in an interview with the german soccer magazine kicker . it would be ironic indeed if a season that began so acrimoniously ended with schalke winning its first league title since 1958 .
no one 's getting over-confident yet , but experts and fans agree that the team should be able to mount a sustained challenge . " with the other top teams playing like they are , anything is possible , " kerkhoff said .
" they have to worry about other competitions , so schalke should be able to compete for the title . " gartenschläger concurred : " it 's too early to say who 'll win , but schalke are certainly one of the three or four teams with a chance to take the title . " even schalke 's long-suffering , once-bitten-twice-shy supporters are feeling optimistic . " we hope and we believe that the team has the stuff to win a championship , " rojek said .

the funny thing is : no one seems to know exactly what put them back on track . october was not a happy month for schalke .
the team had crashed out of the both the uefa cup and the german cup , players were feuding , and many were calling for coach mirko slomka 's head .
schalke 's ever-passionate fans were so disgusted that they treated the team to 19 minutes and 4 seconds of the silent treatment at their home match to bayern . then something happened - schalke started winning and took over the top of the table . so what 's the key to the club 's sudden run of good form ?

" " it was something beautiful , a gesture on his part , " cagrici told the turkish daily sabah . mosque visit and gesture welcomed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's gesture at the blue mosque was appreciated in entering the mosque , pope benedict became only the second roman catholic pope to do so since the groundbreaking visit of his predecessor john paul ii to the great ummayad mosque in damascus in 2001 . the pontiff said before his departure that he hoped his visit would contribute to a " better understanding " between religions . the visit saw unprecedented security measures - even tighter than those laid on for us president george w. bush in 2004 - with large swathes of istanbul closed as the routes taken by the pope 's motorcade were kept secret . even before the controversy over his remarks on islam , pope benedict faced an uphill struggle to win over the turks , having been considered the " anti-turkish pope " for opposing ankara 's bid to join the european union . u-turn on eu stance but provisos remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict 's eu stance prompted criticism turkey in the eu , he had said while still cardinal joseph ratzinger , would be " a grave error ... against the tide of history . " he dealt with this by making a complete turnaround on the issue moments after descending from his plane on his arrival in ankara on tuesday , offering his support for the troubled candidacy in remarks to prime minister recep tayyip erdogan . but he added two provisos on thursday , saying respect for religious freedom must be a criterion for entry into the eu and calling on the bloc to ensure that its members respect the rights of their religious minorities . it was a clear reference to complaints by the orthodox patriarchate of restrictions imposed on it by turkey , including the closure of a seminary and the confiscation of a number of properties from christian foundations . pope benedict also returned to a familiar position when he called for a renewal of " europe 's awareness of its christian roots , traditions and values . " a quest to heal a splintered religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope discussed the schism with bartholomew the main purpose of the long-planned trip and a priority of pope benedict 's papacy - seeking reconciliation between the western and eastern rites of christianity - was symbolized by a saint andrew 's day mass on thursday . saint andrew is the orthodox church 's patron saint , was a disciple of jesus and the brother of saint peter , considered the first catholic pope . after meetings with bartholomew i , spiritual leader of some 150 million orthodox faithful , the pope described the schism between the feuding christian branches dating back nearly a millennium as a " scandal to the world .

on world aids day , dw asked him about the issues facing his organization . luis carlos escobar pinzon was named executive director of deutsche aidshilfe , a 120-member umbrella organization for community-based health organizations , last january . born in columbia , escobar has lived in germany for the past 14 years , working in public health research .
dw-world.de : dr. escobar , the situation surrounding aids education and treatment has changed a great deal in the past decade .
what is the state of affairs in germany today ? luis carlos escobar de pinzon : since anti-retrovirus combination therapies were introduced , people with hiv have better treatment opportunities .
they can live for years symptom-free .
that may have led to the fact that many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly diseases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly , escobar said aids is now often seen as a chronic illness , so people are n't protecting themselves as well as they used to .
that 's been our experience , and we are really sorry to see it .
it is a huge new challenge in primary prevention . currently in germany , according to estimates by the robert koch institute , there are 56,000 people in germany living with hiv / aids .
the biggest group is what we call msm - men who have sex with men .
then a big second group is intravenous drug users .
a third group , that is catching up with the second group , is immigrants , especially from high-prevalence countries . you stepped into this job a year ago .
what were your goals when you took over - and how is it going ? my main goal was to once again make hiv and aids an important topic in society .
it is no longer as present in the media as it was in the beginning of the 1990s .
especially in local politics , the relevance of hiv and aids has faded . ...
we see this in budget cuts for prevention and sex education .
there are budget cuts of up to 30 percent in some regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she showed them the money : german health minister ulla schmidt but we 're really glad that on the federal level , we found someone like german health minister ulla schmidt , who is dedicated to putting the topics hiv / aids strongly on the political agenda .
she has seen to it that we get more federal funding to fight hiv and aids . there is still a lot of work left to be done , especially because in the context of this disease , we just ca n't deal with it regionally - it is a global challenge .
we will need to take stronger action ... especially with our neighbors in eastern europe . what are the biggest issues facing aids-related community health organizations today ? prevention , prevention , and more prevention .
since 2001 , we have noticed that the number of new diagnosis is growing again .
we have to find the reasons for this increase , and take appropriate action . in 2007 , dah is starting an interesting research project that should shed more light on the context and influences of new infections better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : needle-using drug addicts are the second-largest group of hiv / aids carriers in addition , we are also fighting the discrimination and stigmatization of people with hiv / aids .
where hiv / aids are taboo topics , prevention ca n't take hold .
we 're not talking just about solidarity with people who have hiv and aids .
this is about anti-discrimination work that is urgently needed to create a protected space for all people with chronic illnesses . how is the increasing prevalence of hiv / aids among immigrants and asylum seekers affecting germany , and aids policy here ? as a person who came here as an immigrant myself , i see it as a very important topic .
asylum seekers are especially threatened and endangered from hiv infection here . it is important to point up the difficult situation for immigrants in germany , especially those who are also are infected with hiv .
they do n't only have to fight the usual problems like racism , legal status , and financial difficulties .
they have an infection that is strongly taboo within their own community .
and naturally , because of cultural and language differences , they have difficulty accessing sex-education and prevention material . has the german regime under angela merkel been supportive of hiv / aids health organizations ?
what is your relationship with her administration ? we work tightly together with the government . ...
we 're really happy that the german health minister schmidt recently promised 3 million additional euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- for funding for primary prevention in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany said it plans to put aids at the top of its eu presidency health agenda beyond that , she announced that when germany holds the eu presidency -lrb- starting in 2007 -rrb- it wants to put the topic hiv / aids very high up on its political agenda . in germany we have a very privileged situation .
the numbers of new infections has n't risen as much as in other countries , even within europe .
but we need to help our neighbors , especially those from eastern europe , to do better and more intensive work on prevention .
we are all equally responsible for containing this disease . you 've had an exciting tenure so far at the head of the dah - what are your targets for this year ? above all , we want to lead a very important discussion on the role of civil society in primary prevention .
the catchword will be " responsibility . "
dah believes responsibility is not divisible .
everybody has equal responsibility for containing the spread of new infection in our country .
hiv positive people have responsibility to not pass the infection along .
but non-tested people and hiv-negative people have exactly as much responsibility to protect themselves from becoming infected . we need to have a discussion about this , in terms of medical ethics , and then develop concrete measures toward primary prevention in germany . jennifer abramsohn interviewed luis carlos escobar pinzon send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de apathy and false security lead to rise in german hiv cases as experts attend the international aids conference in toronto this week , german organizations are working hard to stop the worrying increase in hiv cases at home .
-lrb- 18.08.2006 -rrb- german minister promises millions in fight against aids at the largest-ever international aids conference that currently takes place in toronto , germany 's development minister brought good news on increased funding from germany .

11 .
critics continue to voice concerns about threats to civil liberties . after years of heated debate , the german bundestag agreed friday on the creation of a new anti-terror bill that is designed to promote communication and sharing of information between federal and state security services .
it will also include the creation of a controversial national security database and increased surveillance powers for the police and intelligence agencies . the proposal cleared the lower house of parliament with the support of chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats .
if the bill is approved by germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , in discussions on dec .
15 , it will become law effective jan .
1 . rejecting opposition concerns that the new bill would turn germany into a police state , minister of the interior wolfgang schäuble said no one could guarantee 100 percent security in these times but the government had the responsibility to do all it could to protect its citizens from the threat of international terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble said that no-one could guarantee total security schäuble maintained that the anti-terror database would create the right conditions for the police and the secret services to collaborate more efficiently and offer the highest level of security possible . though the grand coalition agreed on setting up a central anti-terrorism database last year , the two parties had differed on its exact shape and reach until friday . the idea is that all police and intelligence agencies , both at the federal and national level , would gather information about terror suspects and terrorist organizations in a central database that would be accessible to all crime-fighting agencies . fears about infringements on civil liberties at present , germany 's 37 agencies do that separately .
the central anti-terrorism database would also contain information about banking , telecommunication and internet information regarding the suspects . in addition to problems stemming from germany 's federal structure , critics had feared the database would create more bureaucracy as well as erode people 's privacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics fear anti-terror info could lead to legal problems some members of the social democrats as well as members of the opposition greens and the left party have expressed concerns that easily accessible information on terrorism suspects could be misused as well as create legal problems given the differing information-gathering methods of the police and intelligence agencies are allowed to employ . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany , given abuses under both the nazis and by communist east germany . there have also been fears that innocent people may become wrongly labeled as terrorists once they are included in the database as part of an investigation .
" whoever gets entered into that database will become a terrorist suspect , " greens politician wolfgang wieland said . in-depth information released on request only in a bid to limit this risk , the bill states that only the most basic information of people identified as a suspect in the initial investigations of the state police or federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- should be included in the database 's first level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal possession of firearms would be included in the files should an investigation continue and become more concrete , more detailed information on suspects would only be released after an official request .
these details would include religious affiliation , records pertaining to weapons possession or knowledge or possession of explosives and any affiliation with terror organizations . other information such as occupation , travel habits , bank and telecommunication data would also only be released on official request . post 9/11 terror laws expanded as well as approving the creation of the anti-terror database , the bundestag agreed to expand and extend the anti-terror laws that came into being in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states . the existing laws , which went into effect in early 2002 , allow police and secret services to use telephone communications , e-mails , faxes , bank accounts and travel data as sources of information .
under the proposed revisions , access to the same would be expanded .
in addition , germany 's foreign intelligence service , bnd , would have wider access to domestic police databases . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : new anti-terror tool comes way too late german security officials have ended a long deadlock by agreeing on a centralized database for terrorism suspects .

schalke 's ever-passionate fans were so disgusted that they treated the team to 19 minutes and 4 seconds of the silent treatment at their home match to bayern . then something happened - schalke started winning and took over the top of the table . so what 's the key to the club 's sudden run of good form ?
part of the reason may be something schalke did n't do . " for the past four weeks , the players have been forbidden from talking to the press , " lars gartenschläger , a sports editor for the daily die welt newspaper told dw-world.de.
" that seems to have helped . " lowly opponents help schalke rack up points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke have had an easy time getting past lesser opponents lately another reason is schalke have suddenly discovered ability to grind out tight wins against inferior opponents .
their current four-game winning streak has come against a run of relegation candidates . " they 're now able to concentrate completely on the bundesliga , " explained wolfgang kerkhoff , a sports reporter who covers schalke for the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" a series of successes against relatively easy opponents has restored their self-confidence . " schalke 's 2-1 victory over lowly bochum last friday was nothing to write home about , but it kept them on top .
schalke seem to be applying the adage that championships are won not by beating bayern , but by picking up the points against teams like mainz and cottbus . the turnaround has even left fans shaking their heads in wonder . " i ca n't explain it , " rolf rojek , chairman of schalke 's association of fan clubs , told dw-world.de.
" we did n't know why things did n't work earlier , and we do n't really understand why they 've gotten better now .
that 's just the way soccer is . " like a marriage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka kept his cool and made some key personnel decisions a lot of credit should go to schalke coach slomka , who has shown both perseverance and courage this season .
his most daring move came in the bayern match in early november , when he benched long-time goalkeeper frank rost in favor of youngster manuel neuer .
schalke have n't lost since . " with hindsight , it was the right move , " said kerkhoff .
" after the same number of games , neuer 's statistics are better than rost 's . " an injury to forward gerald asamoah has also helped sort out personnel conflicts .
asamoah was at the center of schalke 's early-season squabbling when he demanded more playing time at the expense of twins halil and hamit altintop .
but ever since the german national broke his leg in late september , that disagreement has been moot . " slomka made a statement with rost , " gartenschläger said .
" maybe it 's not such a bad thing if one or two sources of discontent are put on ice . " and perhaps the fans ' visible displays of dissatisfaction provided the bit of extra motivation needed to get the team to the very top , rojek added . " we showed that the basic connection between supporters and the club should never be undermined , " he said .
" it 's like a marriage . " the right stuff ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 5 goals and 4 assists , striker kevin kuranyi is back in schalke 's good graces whatever the reason , schalke are winning back fans ' affection .
much-maligned striker kevin kuranyi has started to find the goal again , and workhorses like midfielders levan kobiashvili and gustavo varela , or defender rafinha , have come up with big performances in tight matches to help schalke get the results . " our squad has as much quality as bayern munich 's , " slomka said this week in an interview with the german soccer magazine kicker . it would be ironic indeed if a season that began so acrimoniously ended with schalke winning its first league title since 1958 .
no one 's getting over-confident yet , but experts and fans agree that the team should be able to mount a sustained challenge . " with the other top teams playing like they are , anything is possible , " kerkhoff said .
" they have to worry about other competitions , so schalke should be able to compete for the title . " gartenschläger concurred : " it 's too early to say who 'll win , but schalke are certainly one of the three or four teams with a chance to take the title . " even schalke 's long-suffering , once-bitten-twice-shy supporters are feeling optimistic . " we hope and we believe that the team has the stuff to win a championship , " rojek said .
" but whether it will be enough in the end … that we do n't know .

11 .
critics continue to voice concerns about threats to civil liberties . after years of heated debate , the german bundestag agreed friday on the creation of a new anti-terror bill that is designed to promote communication and sharing of information between federal and state security services .
it will also include the creation of a controversial national security database and increased surveillance powers for the police and intelligence agencies . the proposal cleared the lower house of parliament with the support of chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats .
if the bill is approved by germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , in discussions on dec .
15 , it will become law effective jan .
1 . rejecting opposition concerns that the new bill would turn germany into a police state , minister of the interior wolfgang schäuble said no one could guarantee 100 percent security in these times but the government had the responsibility to do all it could to protect its citizens from the threat of international terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble said that no-one could guarantee total security schäuble maintained that the anti-terror database would create the right conditions for the police and the secret services to collaborate more efficiently and offer the highest level of security possible . though the grand coalition agreed on setting up a central anti-terrorism database last year , the two parties had differed on its exact shape and reach until friday . the idea is that all police and intelligence agencies , both at the federal and national level , would gather information about terror suspects and terrorist organizations in a central database that would be accessible to all crime-fighting agencies . fears about infringements on civil liberties at present , germany 's 37 agencies do that separately .
the central anti-terrorism database would also contain information about banking , telecommunication and internet information regarding the suspects . in addition to problems stemming from germany 's federal structure , critics had feared the database would create more bureaucracy as well as erode people 's privacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics fear anti-terror info could lead to legal problems some members of the social democrats as well as members of the opposition greens and the left party have expressed concerns that easily accessible information on terrorism suspects could be misused as well as create legal problems given the differing information-gathering methods of the police and intelligence agencies are allowed to employ . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany , given abuses under both the nazis and by communist east germany . there have also been fears that innocent people may become wrongly labeled as terrorists once they are included in the database as part of an investigation .
" whoever gets entered into that database will become a terrorist suspect , " greens politician wolfgang wieland said . in-depth information released on request only in a bid to limit this risk , the bill states that only the most basic information of people identified as a suspect in the initial investigations of the state police or federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- should be included in the database 's first level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal possession of firearms would be included in the files should an investigation continue and become more concrete , more detailed information on suspects would only be released after an official request .
these details would include religious affiliation , records pertaining to weapons possession or knowledge or possession of explosives and any affiliation with terror organizations . other information such as occupation , travel habits , bank and telecommunication data would also only be released on official request . post 9/11 terror laws expanded as well as approving the creation of the anti-terror database , the bundestag agreed to expand and extend the anti-terror laws that came into being in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states . the existing laws , which went into effect in early 2002 , allow police and secret services to use telephone communications , e-mails , faxes , bank accounts and travel data as sources of information .
under the proposed revisions , access to the same would be expanded .
in addition , germany 's foreign intelligence service , bnd , would have wider access to domestic police databases . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : new anti-terror tool comes way too late german security officials have ended a long deadlock by agreeing on a centralized database for terrorism suspects .

11 .
critics continue to voice concerns about threats to civil liberties . after years of heated debate , the german bundestag agreed friday on the creation of a new anti-terror bill that is designed to promote communication and sharing of information between federal and state security services .
it will also include the creation of a controversial national security database and increased surveillance powers for the police and intelligence agencies . the proposal cleared the lower house of parliament with the support of chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats .
if the bill is approved by germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , in discussions on dec .
15 , it will become law effective jan .
1 . rejecting opposition concerns that the new bill would turn germany into a police state , minister of the interior wolfgang schäuble said no one could guarantee 100 percent security in these times but the government had the responsibility to do all it could to protect its citizens from the threat of international terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble said that no-one could guarantee total security schäuble maintained that the anti-terror database would create the right conditions for the police and the secret services to collaborate more efficiently and offer the highest level of security possible . though the grand coalition agreed on setting up a central anti-terrorism database last year , the two parties had differed on its exact shape and reach until friday . the idea is that all police and intelligence agencies , both at the federal and national level , would gather information about terror suspects and terrorist organizations in a central database that would be accessible to all crime-fighting agencies . fears about infringements on civil liberties at present , germany 's 37 agencies do that separately .
the central anti-terrorism database would also contain information about banking , telecommunication and internet information regarding the suspects . in addition to problems stemming from germany 's federal structure , critics had feared the database would create more bureaucracy as well as erode people 's privacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics fear anti-terror info could lead to legal problems some members of the social democrats as well as members of the opposition greens and the left party have expressed concerns that easily accessible information on terrorism suspects could be misused as well as create legal problems given the differing information-gathering methods of the police and intelligence agencies are allowed to employ . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany , given abuses under both the nazis and by communist east germany . there have also been fears that innocent people may become wrongly labeled as terrorists once they are included in the database as part of an investigation .
" whoever gets entered into that database will become a terrorist suspect , " greens politician wolfgang wieland said . in-depth information released on request only in a bid to limit this risk , the bill states that only the most basic information of people identified as a suspect in the initial investigations of the state police or federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- should be included in the database 's first level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal possession of firearms would be included in the files should an investigation continue and become more concrete , more detailed information on suspects would only be released after an official request .
these details would include religious affiliation , records pertaining to weapons possession or knowledge or possession of explosives and any affiliation with terror organizations . other information such as occupation , travel habits , bank and telecommunication data would also only be released on official request . post 9/11 terror laws expanded as well as approving the creation of the anti-terror database , the bundestag agreed to expand and extend the anti-terror laws that came into being in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states . the existing laws , which went into effect in early 2002 , allow police and secret services to use telephone communications , e-mails , faxes , bank accounts and travel data as sources of information .
under the proposed revisions , access to the same would be expanded .
in addition , germany 's foreign intelligence service , bnd , would have wider access to domestic police databases . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : new anti-terror tool comes way too late german security officials have ended a long deadlock by agreeing on a centralized database for terrorism suspects .
the measure comes at the wrong time and does little to make people feel safe , says dw 's marcel fürstenau .

now they 're grinding out wins and leading the league .
the funny thing is : no one seems to know exactly what put them back on track . october was not a happy month for schalke .
the team had crashed out of the both the uefa cup and the german cup , players were feuding , and many were calling for coach mirko slomka 's head .
schalke 's ever-passionate fans were so disgusted that they treated the team to 19 minutes and 4 seconds of the silent treatment at their home match to bayern . then something happened - schalke started winning and took over the top of the table . so what 's the key to the club 's sudden run of good form ?
part of the reason may be something schalke did n't do . " for the past four weeks , the players have been forbidden from talking to the press , " lars gartenschläger , a sports editor for the daily die welt newspaper told dw-world.de.
" that seems to have helped . " lowly opponents help schalke rack up points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke have had an easy time getting past lesser opponents lately another reason is schalke have suddenly discovered ability to grind out tight wins against inferior opponents .
their current four-game winning streak has come against a run of relegation candidates . " they 're now able to concentrate completely on the bundesliga , " explained wolfgang kerkhoff , a sports reporter who covers schalke for the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" a series of successes against relatively easy opponents has restored their self-confidence . " schalke 's 2-1 victory over lowly bochum last friday was nothing to write home about , but it kept them on top .
schalke seem to be applying the adage that championships are won not by beating bayern , but by picking up the points against teams like mainz and cottbus . the turnaround has even left fans shaking their heads in wonder . " i ca n't explain it , " rolf rojek , chairman of schalke 's association of fan clubs , told dw-world.de.
" we did n't know why things did n't work earlier , and we do n't really understand why they 've gotten better now .
that 's just the way soccer is . " like a marriage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka kept his cool and made some key personnel decisions a lot of credit should go to schalke coach slomka , who has shown both perseverance and courage this season .
his most daring move came in the bayern match in early november , when he benched long-time goalkeeper frank rost in favor of youngster manuel neuer .
schalke have n't lost since . " with hindsight , it was the right move , " said kerkhoff .
" after the same number of games , neuer 's statistics are better than rost 's . " an injury to forward gerald asamoah has also helped sort out personnel conflicts .
asamoah was at the center of schalke 's early-season squabbling when he demanded more playing time at the expense of twins halil and hamit altintop .
but ever since the german national broke his leg in late september , that disagreement has been moot . " slomka made a statement with rost , " gartenschläger said .
" maybe it 's not such a bad thing if one or two sources of discontent are put on ice . " and perhaps the fans ' visible displays of dissatisfaction provided the bit of extra motivation needed to get the team to the very top , rojek added . " we showed that the basic connection between supporters and the club should never be undermined , " he said .
" it 's like a marriage . " the right stuff ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 5 goals and 4 assists , striker kevin kuranyi is back in schalke 's good graces whatever the reason , schalke are winning back fans ' affection .
much-maligned striker kevin kuranyi has started to find the goal again , and workhorses like midfielders levan kobiashvili and gustavo varela , or defender rafinha , have come up with big performances in tight matches to help schalke get the results . " our squad has as much quality as bayern munich 's , " slomka said this week in an interview with the german soccer magazine kicker . it would be ironic indeed if a season that began so acrimoniously ended with schalke winning its first league title since 1958 .
no one 's getting over-confident yet , but experts and fans agree that the team should be able to mount a sustained challenge . " with the other top teams playing like they are , anything is possible , " kerkhoff said .
" they have to worry about other competitions , so schalke should be able to compete for the title . " gartenschläger concurred : " it 's too early to say who 'll win , but schalke are certainly one of the three or four teams with a chance to take the title . " even schalke 's long-suffering , once-bitten-twice-shy supporters are feeling optimistic . " we hope and we believe that the team has the stuff to win a championship , " rojek said .

critics continue to voice concerns about threats to civil liberties . after years of heated debate , the german bundestag agreed friday on the creation of a new anti-terror bill that is designed to promote communication and sharing of information between federal and state security services .
it will also include the creation of a controversial national security database and increased surveillance powers for the police and intelligence agencies . the proposal cleared the lower house of parliament with the support of chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats .

11 .
critics continue to voice concerns about threats to civil liberties . after years of heated debate , the german bundestag agreed friday on the creation of a new anti-terror bill that is designed to promote communication and sharing of information between federal and state security services .
it will also include the creation of a controversial national security database and increased surveillance powers for the police and intelligence agencies . the proposal cleared the lower house of parliament with the support of chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats .
if the bill is approved by germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , in discussions on dec .
15 , it will become law effective jan .
1 . rejecting opposition concerns that the new bill would turn germany into a police state , minister of the interior wolfgang schäuble said no one could guarantee 100 percent security in these times but the government had the responsibility to do all it could to protect its citizens from the threat of international terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble said that no-one could guarantee total security schäuble maintained that the anti-terror database would create the right conditions for the police and the secret services to collaborate more efficiently and offer the highest level of security possible . though the grand coalition agreed on setting up a central anti-terrorism database last year , the two parties had differed on its exact shape and reach until friday . the idea is that all police and intelligence agencies , both at the federal and national level , would gather information about terror suspects and terrorist organizations in a central database that would be accessible to all crime-fighting agencies . fears about infringements on civil liberties at present , germany 's 37 agencies do that separately .
the central anti-terrorism database would also contain information about banking , telecommunication and internet information regarding the suspects . in addition to problems stemming from germany 's federal structure , critics had feared the database would create more bureaucracy as well as erode people 's privacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics fear anti-terror info could lead to legal problems some members of the social democrats as well as members of the opposition greens and the left party have expressed concerns that easily accessible information on terrorism suspects could be misused as well as create legal problems given the differing information-gathering methods of the police and intelligence agencies are allowed to employ . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany , given abuses under both the nazis and by communist east germany . there have also been fears that innocent people may become wrongly labeled as terrorists once they are included in the database as part of an investigation .

" i would have wished that this decision was made differently in view of the symbolic level involved , " she said , adding that german employment law kept her from being able to make significant changes to the office 's personnel . of the 52 people involved 41 are reported to be employed as the building 's watchmen , while the others are involved in the authority 's administration . no group of people from the former communist bloc were as highly monitored as the east germans .

" many us democrats are indeed urging the european union and nato to become active in darfur , " voigt said .

on world aids day , dw asked him about the issues facing his organization . luis carlos escobar pinzon was named executive director of deutsche aidshilfe , a 120-member umbrella organization for community-based health organizations , last january . born in columbia , escobar has lived in germany for the past 14 years , working in public health research .
dw-world.de : dr. escobar , the situation surrounding aids education and treatment has changed a great deal in the past decade .
what is the state of affairs in germany today ? luis carlos escobar de pinzon : since anti-retrovirus combination therapies were introduced , people with hiv have better treatment opportunities .
they can live for years symptom-free .
that may have led to the fact that many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly diseases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly , escobar said aids is now often seen as a chronic illness , so people are n't protecting themselves as well as they used to .
that 's been our experience , and we are really sorry to see it .
it is a huge new challenge in primary prevention . currently in germany , according to estimates by the robert koch institute , there are 56,000 people in germany living with hiv / aids .
the biggest group is what we call msm - men who have sex with men .
then a big second group is intravenous drug users .
a third group , that is catching up with the second group , is immigrants , especially from high-prevalence countries . you stepped into this job a year ago .
what were your goals when you took over - and how is it going ? my main goal was to once again make hiv and aids an important topic in society .
it is no longer as present in the media as it was in the beginning of the 1990s .
especially in local politics , the relevance of hiv and aids has faded . ...
we see this in budget cuts for prevention and sex education .
there are budget cuts of up to 30 percent in some regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she showed them the money : german health minister ulla schmidt but we 're really glad that on the federal level , we found someone like german health minister ulla schmidt , who is dedicated to putting the topics hiv / aids strongly on the political agenda .
she has seen to it that we get more federal funding to fight hiv and aids . there is still a lot of work left to be done , especially because in the context of this disease , we just ca n't deal with it regionally - it is a global challenge .
we will need to take stronger action ... especially with our neighbors in eastern europe . what are the biggest issues facing aids-related community health organizations today ? prevention , prevention , and more prevention .
since 2001 , we have noticed that the number of new diagnosis is growing again .
we have to find the reasons for this increase , and take appropriate action . in 2007 , dah is starting an interesting research project that should shed more light on the context and influences of new infections better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : needle-using drug addicts are the second-largest group of hiv / aids carriers in addition , we are also fighting the discrimination and stigmatization of people with hiv / aids .
where hiv / aids are taboo topics , prevention ca n't take hold .
we 're not talking just about solidarity with people who have hiv and aids .
this is about anti-discrimination work that is urgently needed to create a protected space for all people with chronic illnesses . how is the increasing prevalence of hiv / aids among immigrants and asylum seekers affecting germany , and aids policy here ? as a person who came here as an immigrant myself , i see it as a very important topic .
asylum seekers are especially threatened and endangered from hiv infection here . it is important to point up the difficult situation for immigrants in germany , especially those who are also are infected with hiv .
they do n't only have to fight the usual problems like racism , legal status , and financial difficulties .
they have an infection that is strongly taboo within their own community .
and naturally , because of cultural and language differences , they have difficulty accessing sex-education and prevention material . has the german regime under angela merkel been supportive of hiv / aids health organizations ?
what is your relationship with her administration ? we work tightly together with the government . ...
we 're really happy that the german health minister schmidt recently promised 3 million additional euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- for funding for primary prevention in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany said it plans to put aids at the top of its eu presidency health agenda beyond that , she announced that when germany holds the eu presidency -lrb- starting in 2007 -rrb- it wants to put the topic hiv / aids very high up on its political agenda . in germany we have a very privileged situation .
the numbers of new infections has n't risen as much as in other countries , even within europe .
but we need to help our neighbors , especially those from eastern europe , to do better and more intensive work on prevention .
we are all equally responsible for containing this disease . you 've had an exciting tenure so far at the head of the dah - what are your targets for this year ? above all , we want to lead a very important discussion on the role of civil society in primary prevention .
the catchword will be " responsibility . "
dah believes responsibility is not divisible .
everybody has equal responsibility for containing the spread of new infection in our country .
hiv positive people have responsibility to not pass the infection along .
but non-tested people and hiv-negative people have exactly as much responsibility to protect themselves from becoming infected . we need to have a discussion about this , in terms of medical ethics , and then develop concrete measures toward primary prevention in germany . jennifer abramsohn interviewed luis carlos escobar pinzon send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de apathy and false security lead to rise in german hiv cases as experts attend the international aids conference in toronto this week , german organizations are working hard to stop the worrying increase in hiv cases at home .

dw-world.de : dr. escobar , the situation surrounding aids education and treatment has changed a great deal in the past decade .
what is the state of affairs in germany today ? luis carlos escobar de pinzon : since anti-retrovirus combination therapies were introduced , people with hiv have better treatment opportunities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 01.12.2006 mysterious turnaround in gelsenkirchen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four straight wins have schalke celebrating again a month ago squabbling schalke were in complete turmoil .
now they 're grinding out wins and leading the league .
the funny thing is : no one seems to know exactly what put them back on track . october was not a happy month for schalke .
the team had crashed out of the both the uefa cup and the german cup , players were feuding , and many were calling for coach mirko slomka 's head .
schalke 's ever-passionate fans were so disgusted that they treated the team to 19 minutes and 4 seconds of the silent treatment at their home match to bayern . then something happened - schalke started winning and took over the top of the table . so what 's the key to the club 's sudden run of good form ?
part of the reason may be something schalke did n't do . " for the past four weeks , the players have been forbidden from talking to the press , " lars gartenschläger , a sports editor for the daily die welt newspaper told dw-world.de.
" that seems to have helped . " lowly opponents help schalke rack up points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke have had an easy time getting past lesser opponents lately another reason is schalke have suddenly discovered ability to grind out tight wins against inferior opponents .
their current four-game winning streak has come against a run of relegation candidates . " they 're now able to concentrate completely on the bundesliga , " explained wolfgang kerkhoff , a sports reporter who covers schalke for the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" a series of successes against relatively easy opponents has restored their self-confidence . " schalke 's 2-1 victory over lowly bochum last friday was nothing to write home about , but it kept them on top .
schalke seem to be applying the adage that championships are won not by beating bayern , but by picking up the points against teams like mainz and cottbus . the turnaround has even left fans shaking their heads in wonder . " i ca n't explain it , " rolf rojek , chairman of schalke 's association of fan clubs , told dw-world.de.
" we did n't know why things did n't work earlier , and we do n't really understand why they 've gotten better now .
that 's just the way soccer is . " like a marriage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka kept his cool and made some key personnel decisions a lot of credit should go to schalke coach slomka , who has shown both perseverance and courage this season .
his most daring move came in the bayern match in early november , when he benched long-time goalkeeper frank rost in favor of youngster manuel neuer .
schalke have n't lost since . " with hindsight , it was the right move , " said kerkhoff .
" after the same number of games , neuer 's statistics are better than rost 's . " an injury to forward gerald asamoah has also helped sort out personnel conflicts .
asamoah was at the center of schalke 's early-season squabbling when he demanded more playing time at the expense of twins halil and hamit altintop .
but ever since the german national broke his leg in late september , that disagreement has been moot . " slomka made a statement with rost , " gartenschläger said .
" maybe it 's not such a bad thing if one or two sources of discontent are put on ice . " and perhaps the fans ' visible displays of dissatisfaction provided the bit of extra motivation needed to get the team to the very top , rojek added . " we showed that the basic connection between supporters and the club should never be undermined , " he said .
" it 's like a marriage . " the right stuff ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 5 goals and 4 assists , striker kevin kuranyi is back in schalke 's good graces whatever the reason , schalke are winning back fans ' affection .
much-maligned striker kevin kuranyi has started to find the goal again , and workhorses like midfielders levan kobiashvili and gustavo varela , or defender rafinha , have come up with big performances in tight matches to help schalke get the results . " our squad has as much quality as bayern munich 's , " slomka said this week in an interview with the german soccer magazine kicker . it would be ironic indeed if a season that began so acrimoniously ended with schalke winning its first league title since 1958 .
no one 's getting over-confident yet , but experts and fans agree that the team should be able to mount a sustained challenge . " with the other top teams playing like they are , anything is possible , " kerkhoff said .
" they have to worry about other competitions , so schalke should be able to compete for the title . " gartenschläger concurred : " it 's too early to say who 'll win , but schalke are certainly one of the three or four teams with a chance to take the title . " even schalke 's long-suffering , once-bitten-twice-shy supporters are feeling optimistic . " we hope and we believe that the team has the stuff to win a championship , " rojek said .
" but whether it will be enough in the end … that we do n't know .

the biggest group is what we call msm - men who have sex with men .
then a big second group is intravenous drug users .
a third group , that is catching up with the second group , is immigrants , especially from high-prevalence countries . you stepped into this job a year ago .
what were your goals when you took over - and how is it going ? my main goal was to once again make hiv and aids an important topic in society .
it is no longer as present in the media as it was in the beginning of the 1990s .
especially in local politics , the relevance of hiv and aids has faded . ...
we see this in budget cuts for prevention and sex education .
there are budget cuts of up to 30 percent in some regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she showed them the money : german health minister ulla schmidt but we 're really glad that on the federal level , we found someone like german health minister ulla schmidt , who is dedicated to putting the topics hiv / aids strongly on the political agenda .
she has seen to it that we get more federal funding to fight hiv and aids . there is still a lot of work left to be done , especially because in the context of this disease , we just ca n't deal with it regionally - it is a global challenge .
we will need to take stronger action ... especially with our neighbors in eastern europe . what are the biggest issues facing aids-related community health organizations today ? prevention , prevention , and more prevention .
since 2001 , we have noticed that the number of new diagnosis is growing again .
we have to find the reasons for this increase , and take appropriate action . in 2007 , dah is starting an interesting research project that should shed more light on the context and influences of new infections better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : needle-using drug addicts are the second-largest group of hiv / aids carriers in addition , we are also fighting the discrimination and stigmatization of people with hiv / aids .
where hiv / aids are taboo topics , prevention ca n't take hold .
we 're not talking just about solidarity with people who have hiv and aids .
this is about anti-discrimination work that is urgently needed to create a protected space for all people with chronic illnesses . how is the increasing prevalence of hiv / aids among immigrants and asylum seekers affecting germany , and aids policy here ? as a person who came here as an immigrant myself , i see it as a very important topic .
asylum seekers are especially threatened and endangered from hiv infection here . it is important to point up the difficult situation for immigrants in germany , especially those who are also are infected with hiv .
they do n't only have to fight the usual problems like racism , legal status , and financial difficulties .
they have an infection that is strongly taboo within their own community .
and naturally , because of cultural and language differences , they have difficulty accessing sex-education and prevention material . has the german regime under angela merkel been supportive of hiv / aids health organizations ?
what is your relationship with her administration ? we work tightly together with the government . ...
we 're really happy that the german health minister schmidt recently promised 3 million additional euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- for funding for primary prevention in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany said it plans to put aids at the top of its eu presidency health agenda beyond that , she announced that when germany holds the eu presidency -lrb- starting in 2007 -rrb- it wants to put the topic hiv / aids very high up on its political agenda . in germany we have a very privileged situation .
the numbers of new infections has n't risen as much as in other countries , even within europe .
but we need to help our neighbors , especially those from eastern europe , to do better and more intensive work on prevention .
we are all equally responsible for containing this disease . you 've had an exciting tenure so far at the head of the dah - what are your targets for this year ? above all , we want to lead a very important discussion on the role of civil society in primary prevention .
the catchword will be " responsibility . "
dah believes responsibility is not divisible .
everybody has equal responsibility for containing the spread of new infection in our country .
hiv positive people have responsibility to not pass the infection along .
but non-tested people and hiv-negative people have exactly as much responsibility to protect themselves from becoming infected . we need to have a discussion about this , in terms of medical ethics , and then develop concrete measures toward primary prevention in germany . jennifer abramsohn interviewed luis carlos escobar pinzon send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de apathy and false security lead to rise in german hiv cases as experts attend the international aids conference in toronto this week , german organizations are working hard to stop the worrying increase in hiv cases at home .
-lrb- 18.08.2006 -rrb- german minister promises millions in fight against aids at the largest-ever international aids conference that currently takes place in toronto , germany 's development minister brought good news on increased funding from germany .
-lrb- 14.08.2006 -rrb- africa untouched by west 's success in battling aids as the un general assembly convenes a special conference on aids , the rapid progress made in germany and the west in preventing the infection passing from mother to child has n't been repeated in places like africa .

on world aids day , dw asked him about the issues facing his organization . luis carlos escobar pinzon was named executive director of deutsche aidshilfe , a 120-member umbrella organization for community-based health organizations , last january . born in columbia , escobar has lived in germany for the past 14 years , working in public health research .
dw-world.de : dr. escobar , the situation surrounding aids education and treatment has changed a great deal in the past decade .
what is the state of affairs in germany today ? luis carlos escobar de pinzon : since anti-retrovirus combination therapies were introduced , people with hiv have better treatment opportunities .
they can live for years symptom-free .
that may have led to the fact that many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly diseases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly , escobar said aids is now often seen as a chronic illness , so people are n't protecting themselves as well as they used to .

" genocide in slow motion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dafur is still unstable and killing of civilians by rebel groups is still rife the united nations has been contemplating sending a larger multilateral contingent to darfur to establish peace in the region under its own command . " if the current african union mandate for darfur were to be transferred into the hands of the united nations , we would not be in a position to ignore such a development , " jung told german public television on thursday . " we could n't just say ' no ' to a un request to contribute troops to a multinational effort to establish peace , " he added . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said a multinational approach should be taken to addressing the violence . " there would be african troops involved in such a mission alongside asian troops and european troops , " she said earlier this week .
" germany would have no right to stand on the sidelines - after all , what we are witnessing in the darfur region is a sort of genocide in slow motion . " other lawmakers from germany 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats , however , have heavily criticized what they call an untimely offer on the part of the defense minister . critics warn germany to not interfere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german politicans want the african region to resolve conflicts itself peter ramsauer of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , lashed out at the defense minister for not coordinating his statements on darfur with parliamentary leaders . in addition to stating his opposition to a larger german deployment in sudan , ramsauer also pointed out there has been no request from the united nations for troops . head of the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party guido westerwelle called jung 's campaign a " grave mistake " that went against germany 's post-world war ii restraint on the foreign policy front . germany currently has 41 military observers stationed with un forces in sudan .
the german cabinet agreed to extend the troops ' mandate on wednesday and set a deployment cap of 200 soldiers . us could step-up pressure karsten voigt , the german government 's coordinator for transatlantic relations , said he is certain members of the us democratic party will try and put more pressure on europe , including germany , to help resolve to darfur conflict . " many us democrats are indeed urging the european union and nato to become active in darfur , " voigt said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 01.12.2006 " we are all equally responsible for containing this disease " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dah would like to see hiv / aids issues back in the public consciousness dr. luis carlos escobar pinzon is nearing his first anniversary at the head of german umbrella group deutsche aidshilfe -lrb- dah -rrb- .
on world aids day , dw asked him about the issues facing his organization . luis carlos escobar pinzon was named executive director of deutsche aidshilfe , a 120-member umbrella organization for community-based health organizations , last january . born in columbia , escobar has lived in germany for the past 14 years , working in public health research .
dw-world.de : dr. escobar , the situation surrounding aids education and treatment has changed a great deal in the past decade .
what is the state of affairs in germany today ? luis carlos escobar de pinzon : since anti-retrovirus combination therapies were introduced , people with hiv have better treatment opportunities .
they can live for years symptom-free .
that may have led to the fact that many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly diseases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly , escobar said aids is now often seen as a chronic illness , so people are n't protecting themselves as well as they used to .
that 's been our experience , and we are really sorry to see it .
it is a huge new challenge in primary prevention . currently in germany , according to estimates by the robert koch institute , there are 56,000 people in germany living with hiv / aids .
the biggest group is what we call msm - men who have sex with men .
then a big second group is intravenous drug users .
a third group , that is catching up with the second group , is immigrants , especially from high-prevalence countries . you stepped into this job a year ago .
what were your goals when you took over - and how is it going ? my main goal was to once again make hiv and aids an important topic in society .
it is no longer as present in the media as it was in the beginning of the 1990s .
especially in local politics , the relevance of hiv and aids has faded . ...
we see this in budget cuts for prevention and sex education .
there are budget cuts of up to 30 percent in some regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she showed them the money : german health minister ulla schmidt but we 're really glad that on the federal level , we found someone like german health minister ulla schmidt , who is dedicated to putting the topics hiv / aids strongly on the political agenda .
she has seen to it that we get more federal funding to fight hiv and aids . there is still a lot of work left to be done , especially because in the context of this disease , we just ca n't deal with it regionally - it is a global challenge .
we will need to take stronger action ... especially with our neighbors in eastern europe . what are the biggest issues facing aids-related community health organizations today ? prevention , prevention , and more prevention .
since 2001 , we have noticed that the number of new diagnosis is growing again .
we have to find the reasons for this increase , and take appropriate action . in 2007 , dah is starting an interesting research project that should shed more light on the context and influences of new infections better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : needle-using drug addicts are the second-largest group of hiv / aids carriers in addition , we are also fighting the discrimination and stigmatization of people with hiv / aids .
where hiv / aids are taboo topics , prevention ca n't take hold .
we 're not talking just about solidarity with people who have hiv and aids .
this is about anti-discrimination work that is urgently needed to create a protected space for all people with chronic illnesses . how is the increasing prevalence of hiv / aids among immigrants and asylum seekers affecting germany , and aids policy here ? as a person who came here as an immigrant myself , i see it as a very important topic .
asylum seekers are especially threatened and endangered from hiv infection here . it is important to point up the difficult situation for immigrants in germany , especially those who are also are infected with hiv .
they do n't only have to fight the usual problems like racism , legal status , and financial difficulties .
they have an infection that is strongly taboo within their own community .
and naturally , because of cultural and language differences , they have difficulty accessing sex-education and prevention material . has the german regime under angela merkel been supportive of hiv / aids health organizations ?
what is your relationship with her administration ? we work tightly together with the government . ...
we 're really happy that the german health minister schmidt recently promised 3 million additional euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- for funding for primary prevention in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany said it plans to put aids at the top of its eu presidency health agenda beyond that , she announced that when germany holds the eu presidency -lrb- starting in 2007 -rrb- it wants to put the topic hiv / aids very high up on its political agenda . in germany we have a very privileged situation .
the numbers of new infections has n't risen as much as in other countries , even within europe .
but we need to help our neighbors , especially those from eastern europe , to do better and more intensive work on prevention .
we are all equally responsible for containing this disease . you 've had an exciting tenure so far at the head of the dah - what are your targets for this year ? above all , we want to lead a very important discussion on the role of civil society in primary prevention .
the catchword will be " responsibility . "
dah believes responsibility is not divisible .
everybody has equal responsibility for containing the spread of new infection in our country .
hiv positive people have responsibility to not pass the infection along .
but non-tested people and hiv-negative people have exactly as much responsibility to protect themselves from becoming infected . we need to have a discussion about this , in terms of medical ethics , and then develop concrete measures toward primary prevention in germany . jennifer abramsohn interviewed luis carlos escobar pinzon send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de apathy and false security lead to rise in german hiv cases as experts attend the international aids conference in toronto this week , german organizations are working hard to stop the worrying increase in hiv cases at home .

on world aids day , dw asked him about the issues facing his organization . luis carlos escobar pinzon was named executive director of deutsche aidshilfe , a 120-member umbrella organization for community-based health organizations , last january . born in columbia , escobar has lived in germany for the past 14 years , working in public health research .
dw-world.de : dr. escobar , the situation surrounding aids education and treatment has changed a great deal in the past decade .
what is the state of affairs in germany today ? luis carlos escobar de pinzon : since anti-retrovirus combination therapies were introduced , people with hiv have better treatment opportunities .
they can live for years symptom-free .
that may have led to the fact that many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly diseases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly , escobar said aids is now often seen as a chronic illness , so people are n't protecting themselves as well as they used to .
that 's been our experience , and we are really sorry to see it .
it is a huge new challenge in primary prevention . currently in germany , according to estimates by the robert koch institute , there are 56,000 people in germany living with hiv / aids .
the biggest group is what we call msm - men who have sex with men .
then a big second group is intravenous drug users .
a third group , that is catching up with the second group , is immigrants , especially from high-prevalence countries . you stepped into this job a year ago .
what were your goals when you took over - and how is it going ? my main goal was to once again make hiv and aids an important topic in society .
it is no longer as present in the media as it was in the beginning of the 1990s .
especially in local politics , the relevance of hiv and aids has faded . ...
we see this in budget cuts for prevention and sex education .
there are budget cuts of up to 30 percent in some regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she showed them the money : german health minister ulla schmidt but we 're really glad that on the federal level , we found someone like german health minister ulla schmidt , who is dedicated to putting the topics hiv / aids strongly on the political agenda .
she has seen to it that we get more federal funding to fight hiv and aids . there is still a lot of work left to be done , especially because in the context of this disease , we just ca n't deal with it regionally - it is a global challenge .
we will need to take stronger action ... especially with our neighbors in eastern europe . what are the biggest issues facing aids-related community health organizations today ? prevention , prevention , and more prevention .
since 2001 , we have noticed that the number of new diagnosis is growing again .
we have to find the reasons for this increase , and take appropriate action . in 2007 , dah is starting an interesting research project that should shed more light on the context and influences of new infections better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : needle-using drug addicts are the second-largest group of hiv / aids carriers in addition , we are also fighting the discrimination and stigmatization of people with hiv / aids .
where hiv / aids are taboo topics , prevention ca n't take hold .
we 're not talking just about solidarity with people who have hiv and aids .
this is about anti-discrimination work that is urgently needed to create a protected space for all people with chronic illnesses . how is the increasing prevalence of hiv / aids among immigrants and asylum seekers affecting germany , and aids policy here ? as a person who came here as an immigrant myself , i see it as a very important topic .
asylum seekers are especially threatened and endangered from hiv infection here . it is important to point up the difficult situation for immigrants in germany , especially those who are also are infected with hiv .
they do n't only have to fight the usual problems like racism , legal status , and financial difficulties .
they have an infection that is strongly taboo within their own community .
and naturally , because of cultural and language differences , they have difficulty accessing sex-education and prevention material . has the german regime under angela merkel been supportive of hiv / aids health organizations ?
what is your relationship with her administration ? we work tightly together with the government . ...
we 're really happy that the german health minister schmidt recently promised 3 million additional euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- for funding for primary prevention in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany said it plans to put aids at the top of its eu presidency health agenda beyond that , she announced that when germany holds the eu presidency -lrb- starting in 2007 -rrb- it wants to put the topic hiv / aids very high up on its political agenda . in germany we have a very privileged situation .
the numbers of new infections has n't risen as much as in other countries , even within europe .
but we need to help our neighbors , especially those from eastern europe , to do better and more intensive work on prevention .
we are all equally responsible for containing this disease . you 've had an exciting tenure so far at the head of the dah - what are your targets for this year ? above all , we want to lead a very important discussion on the role of civil society in primary prevention .
the catchword will be " responsibility . "
dah believes responsibility is not divisible .
everybody has equal responsibility for containing the spread of new infection in our country .
hiv positive people have responsibility to not pass the infection along .
but non-tested people and hiv-negative people have exactly as much responsibility to protect themselves from becoming infected . we need to have a discussion about this , in terms of medical ethics , and then develop concrete measures toward primary prevention in germany . jennifer abramsohn interviewed luis carlos escobar pinzon send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de apathy and false security lead to rise in german hiv cases as experts attend the international aids conference in toronto this week , german organizations are working hard to stop the worrying increase in hiv cases at home .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 01.12.2006 mysterious turnaround in gelsenkirchen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four straight wins have schalke celebrating again a month ago squabbling schalke were in complete turmoil .
now they 're grinding out wins and leading the league .
the funny thing is : no one seems to know exactly what put them back on track . october was not a happy month for schalke .
the team had crashed out of the both the uefa cup and the german cup , players were feuding , and many were calling for coach mirko slomka 's head .
schalke 's ever-passionate fans were so disgusted that they treated the team to 19 minutes and 4 seconds of the silent treatment at their home match to bayern . then something happened - schalke started winning and took over the top of the table . so what 's the key to the club 's sudden run of good form ?
part of the reason may be something schalke did n't do . " for the past four weeks , the players have been forbidden from talking to the press , " lars gartenschläger , a sports editor for the daily die welt newspaper told dw-world.de.
" that seems to have helped . " lowly opponents help schalke rack up points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke have had an easy time getting past lesser opponents lately another reason is schalke have suddenly discovered ability to grind out tight wins against inferior opponents .
their current four-game winning streak has come against a run of relegation candidates . " they 're now able to concentrate completely on the bundesliga , " explained wolfgang kerkhoff , a sports reporter who covers schalke for the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" a series of successes against relatively easy opponents has restored their self-confidence . " schalke 's 2-1 victory over lowly bochum last friday was nothing to write home about , but it kept them on top .
schalke seem to be applying the adage that championships are won not by beating bayern , but by picking up the points against teams like mainz and cottbus . the turnaround has even left fans shaking their heads in wonder . " i ca n't explain it , " rolf rojek , chairman of schalke 's association of fan clubs , told dw-world.de.
" we did n't know why things did n't work earlier , and we do n't really understand why they 've gotten better now .
that 's just the way soccer is . " like a marriage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka kept his cool and made some key personnel decisions a lot of credit should go to schalke coach slomka , who has shown both perseverance and courage this season .
his most daring move came in the bayern match in early november , when he benched long-time goalkeeper frank rost in favor of youngster manuel neuer .
schalke have n't lost since . " with hindsight , it was the right move , " said kerkhoff .
" after the same number of games , neuer 's statistics are better than rost 's . " an injury to forward gerald asamoah has also helped sort out personnel conflicts .
asamoah was at the center of schalke 's early-season squabbling when he demanded more playing time at the expense of twins halil and hamit altintop .
but ever since the german national broke his leg in late september , that disagreement has been moot . " slomka made a statement with rost , " gartenschläger said .
" maybe it 's not such a bad thing if one or two sources of discontent are put on ice . " and perhaps the fans ' visible displays of dissatisfaction provided the bit of extra motivation needed to get the team to the very top , rojek added . " we showed that the basic connection between supporters and the club should never be undermined , " he said .
" it 's like a marriage . " the right stuff ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 5 goals and 4 assists , striker kevin kuranyi is back in schalke 's good graces whatever the reason , schalke are winning back fans ' affection .
much-maligned striker kevin kuranyi has started to find the goal again , and workhorses like midfielders levan kobiashvili and gustavo varela , or defender rafinha , have come up with big performances in tight matches to help schalke get the results . " our squad has as much quality as bayern munich 's , " slomka said this week in an interview with the german soccer magazine kicker . it would be ironic indeed if a season that began so acrimoniously ended with schalke winning its first league title since 1958 .
no one 's getting over-confident yet , but experts and fans agree that the team should be able to mount a sustained challenge . " with the other top teams playing like they are , anything is possible , " kerkhoff said .
" they have to worry about other competitions , so schalke should be able to compete for the title . " gartenschläger concurred : " it 's too early to say who 'll win , but schalke are certainly one of the three or four teams with a chance to take the title . " even schalke 's long-suffering , once-bitten-twice-shy supporters are feeling optimistic . " we hope and we believe that the team has the stuff to win a championship , " rojek said .

the funny thing is : no one seems to know exactly what put them back on track . october was not a happy month for schalke .
the team had crashed out of the both the uefa cup and the german cup , players were feuding , and many were calling for coach mirko slomka 's head .
schalke 's ever-passionate fans were so disgusted that they treated the team to 19 minutes and 4 seconds of the silent treatment at their home match to bayern . then something happened - schalke started winning and took over the top of the table . so what 's the key to the club 's sudden run of good form ?

" a series of successes against relatively easy opponents has restored their self-confidence . " schalke 's 2-1 victory over lowly bochum last friday was nothing to write home about , but it kept them on top .
schalke seem to be applying the adage that championships are won not by beating bayern , but by picking up the points against teams like mainz and cottbus . the turnaround has even left fans shaking their heads in wonder .

schalke have n't lost since . " with hindsight , it was the right move , " said kerkhoff .
" after the same number of games , neuer 's statistics are better than rost 's . " an injury to forward gerald asamoah has also helped sort out personnel conflicts .

" " it was something beautiful , a gesture on his part , " cagrici told the turkish daily sabah . mosque visit and gesture welcomed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's gesture at the blue mosque was appreciated in entering the mosque , pope benedict became only the second roman catholic pope to do so since the groundbreaking visit of his predecessor john paul ii to the great ummayad mosque in damascus in 2001 . the pontiff said before his departure that he hoped his visit would contribute to a " better understanding " between religions . the visit saw unprecedented security measures - even tighter than those laid on for us president george w. bush in 2004 - with large swathes of istanbul closed as the routes taken by the pope 's motorcade were kept secret . even before the controversy over his remarks on islam , pope benedict faced an uphill struggle to win over the turks , having been considered the " anti-turkish pope " for opposing ankara 's bid to join the european union . u-turn on eu stance but provisos remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict 's eu stance prompted criticism turkey in the eu , he had said while still cardinal joseph ratzinger , would be " a grave error ... against the tide of history . " he dealt with this by making a complete turnaround on the issue moments after descending from his plane on his arrival in ankara on tuesday , offering his support for the troubled candidacy in remarks to prime minister recep tayyip erdogan . but he added two provisos on thursday , saying respect for religious freedom must be a criterion for entry into the eu and calling on the bloc to ensure that its members respect the rights of their religious minorities . it was a clear reference to complaints by the orthodox patriarchate of restrictions imposed on it by turkey , including the closure of a seminary and the confiscation of a number of properties from christian foundations . pope benedict also returned to a familiar position when he called for a renewal of " europe 's awareness of its christian roots , traditions and values . " a quest to heal a splintered religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope discussed the schism with bartholomew the main purpose of the long-planned trip and a priority of pope benedict 's papacy - seeking reconciliation between the western and eastern rites of christianity - was symbolized by a saint andrew 's day mass on thursday . saint andrew is the orthodox church 's patron saint , was a disciple of jesus and the brother of saint peter , considered the first catholic pope . after meetings with bartholomew i , spiritual leader of some 150 million orthodox faithful , the pope described the schism between the feuding christian branches dating back nearly a millennium as a " scandal to the world .

" i would have wished that this decision was made differently in view of the symbolic level involved , " she said , adding that german employment law kept her from being able to make significant changes to the office 's personnel . of the 52 people involved 41 are reported to be employed as the building 's watchmen , while the others are involved in the authority 's administration . no group of people from the former communist bloc were as highly monitored as the east germans .

on world aids day , dw asked him about the issues facing his organization . luis carlos escobar pinzon was named executive director of deutsche aidshilfe , a 120-member umbrella organization for community-based health organizations , last january . born in columbia , escobar has lived in germany for the past 14 years , working in public health research .
dw-world.de : dr. escobar , the situation surrounding aids education and treatment has changed a great deal in the past decade .
what is the state of affairs in germany today ? luis carlos escobar de pinzon : since anti-retrovirus combination therapies were introduced , people with hiv have better treatment opportunities .
they can live for years symptom-free .
that may have led to the fact that many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly diseases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly , escobar said aids is now often seen as a chronic illness , so people are n't protecting themselves as well as they used to .
that 's been our experience , and we are really sorry to see it .
it is a huge new challenge in primary prevention . currently in germany , according to estimates by the robert koch institute , there are 56,000 people in germany living with hiv / aids .
the biggest group is what we call msm - men who have sex with men .
then a big second group is intravenous drug users .
a third group , that is catching up with the second group , is immigrants , especially from high-prevalence countries . you stepped into this job a year ago .
what were your goals when you took over - and how is it going ? my main goal was to once again make hiv and aids an important topic in society .
it is no longer as present in the media as it was in the beginning of the 1990s .
especially in local politics , the relevance of hiv and aids has faded . ...
we see this in budget cuts for prevention and sex education .
there are budget cuts of up to 30 percent in some regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she showed them the money : german health minister ulla schmidt but we 're really glad that on the federal level , we found someone like german health minister ulla schmidt , who is dedicated to putting the topics hiv / aids strongly on the political agenda .
she has seen to it that we get more federal funding to fight hiv and aids . there is still a lot of work left to be done , especially because in the context of this disease , we just ca n't deal with it regionally - it is a global challenge .
we will need to take stronger action ... especially with our neighbors in eastern europe . what are the biggest issues facing aids-related community health organizations today ? prevention , prevention , and more prevention .
since 2001 , we have noticed that the number of new diagnosis is growing again .
we have to find the reasons for this increase , and take appropriate action . in 2007 , dah is starting an interesting research project that should shed more light on the context and influences of new infections better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : needle-using drug addicts are the second-largest group of hiv / aids carriers in addition , we are also fighting the discrimination and stigmatization of people with hiv / aids .
where hiv / aids are taboo topics , prevention ca n't take hold .
we 're not talking just about solidarity with people who have hiv and aids .
this is about anti-discrimination work that is urgently needed to create a protected space for all people with chronic illnesses . how is the increasing prevalence of hiv / aids among immigrants and asylum seekers affecting germany , and aids policy here ? as a person who came here as an immigrant myself , i see it as a very important topic .
asylum seekers are especially threatened and endangered from hiv infection here . it is important to point up the difficult situation for immigrants in germany , especially those who are also are infected with hiv .
they do n't only have to fight the usual problems like racism , legal status , and financial difficulties .
they have an infection that is strongly taboo within their own community .
and naturally , because of cultural and language differences , they have difficulty accessing sex-education and prevention material . has the german regime under angela merkel been supportive of hiv / aids health organizations ?
what is your relationship with her administration ? we work tightly together with the government . ...
we 're really happy that the german health minister schmidt recently promised 3 million additional euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- for funding for primary prevention in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany said it plans to put aids at the top of its eu presidency health agenda beyond that , she announced that when germany holds the eu presidency -lrb- starting in 2007 -rrb- it wants to put the topic hiv / aids very high up on its political agenda . in germany we have a very privileged situation .
the numbers of new infections has n't risen as much as in other countries , even within europe .
but we need to help our neighbors , especially those from eastern europe , to do better and more intensive work on prevention .
we are all equally responsible for containing this disease . you 've had an exciting tenure so far at the head of the dah - what are your targets for this year ? above all , we want to lead a very important discussion on the role of civil society in primary prevention .
the catchword will be " responsibility . "
dah believes responsibility is not divisible .
everybody has equal responsibility for containing the spread of new infection in our country .
hiv positive people have responsibility to not pass the infection along .
but non-tested people and hiv-negative people have exactly as much responsibility to protect themselves from becoming infected . we need to have a discussion about this , in terms of medical ethics , and then develop concrete measures toward primary prevention in germany . jennifer abramsohn interviewed luis carlos escobar pinzon send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de apathy and false security lead to rise in german hiv cases as experts attend the international aids conference in toronto this week , german organizations are working hard to stop the worrying increase in hiv cases at home .

11 .
critics continue to voice concerns about threats to civil liberties . after years of heated debate , the german bundestag agreed friday on the creation of a new anti-terror bill that is designed to promote communication and sharing of information between federal and state security services .
it will also include the creation of a controversial national security database and increased surveillance powers for the police and intelligence agencies . the proposal cleared the lower house of parliament with the support of chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats .
if the bill is approved by germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , in discussions on dec .
15 , it will become law effective jan .
1 . rejecting opposition concerns that the new bill would turn germany into a police state , minister of the interior wolfgang schäuble said no one could guarantee 100 percent security in these times but the government had the responsibility to do all it could to protect its citizens from the threat of international terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble said that no-one could guarantee total security schäuble maintained that the anti-terror database would create the right conditions for the police and the secret services to collaborate more efficiently and offer the highest level of security possible . though the grand coalition agreed on setting up a central anti-terrorism database last year , the two parties had differed on its exact shape and reach until friday . the idea is that all police and intelligence agencies , both at the federal and national level , would gather information about terror suspects and terrorist organizations in a central database that would be accessible to all crime-fighting agencies . fears about infringements on civil liberties at present , germany 's 37 agencies do that separately .
the central anti-terrorism database would also contain information about banking , telecommunication and internet information regarding the suspects . in addition to problems stemming from germany 's federal structure , critics had feared the database would create more bureaucracy as well as erode people 's privacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics fear anti-terror info could lead to legal problems some members of the social democrats as well as members of the opposition greens and the left party have expressed concerns that easily accessible information on terrorism suspects could be misused as well as create legal problems given the differing information-gathering methods of the police and intelligence agencies are allowed to employ . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany , given abuses under both the nazis and by communist east germany . there have also been fears that innocent people may become wrongly labeled as terrorists once they are included in the database as part of an investigation .
" whoever gets entered into that database will become a terrorist suspect , " greens politician wolfgang wieland said . in-depth information released on request only in a bid to limit this risk , the bill states that only the most basic information of people identified as a suspect in the initial investigations of the state police or federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- should be included in the database 's first level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal possession of firearms would be included in the files should an investigation continue and become more concrete , more detailed information on suspects would only be released after an official request .
these details would include religious affiliation , records pertaining to weapons possession or knowledge or possession of explosives and any affiliation with terror organizations . other information such as occupation , travel habits , bank and telecommunication data would also only be released on official request . post 9/11 terror laws expanded as well as approving the creation of the anti-terror database , the bundestag agreed to expand and extend the anti-terror laws that came into being in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states . the existing laws , which went into effect in early 2002 , allow police and secret services to use telephone communications , e-mails , faxes , bank accounts and travel data as sources of information .
under the proposed revisions , access to the same would be expanded .
in addition , germany 's foreign intelligence service , bnd , would have wider access to domestic police databases . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : new anti-terror tool comes way too late german security officials have ended a long deadlock by agreeing on a centralized database for terrorism suspects .

11 .
critics continue to voice concerns about threats to civil liberties . after years of heated debate , the german bundestag agreed friday on the creation of a new anti-terror bill that is designed to promote communication and sharing of information between federal and state security services .
it will also include the creation of a controversial national security database and increased surveillance powers for the police and intelligence agencies . the proposal cleared the lower house of parliament with the support of chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats .
if the bill is approved by germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , in discussions on dec .
15 , it will become law effective jan .
1 . rejecting opposition concerns that the new bill would turn germany into a police state , minister of the interior wolfgang schäuble said no one could guarantee 100 percent security in these times but the government had the responsibility to do all it could to protect its citizens from the threat of international terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble said that no-one could guarantee total security schäuble maintained that the anti-terror database would create the right conditions for the police and the secret services to collaborate more efficiently and offer the highest level of security possible . though the grand coalition agreed on setting up a central anti-terrorism database last year , the two parties had differed on its exact shape and reach until friday . the idea is that all police and intelligence agencies , both at the federal and national level , would gather information about terror suspects and terrorist organizations in a central database that would be accessible to all crime-fighting agencies . fears about infringements on civil liberties at present , germany 's 37 agencies do that separately .
the central anti-terrorism database would also contain information about banking , telecommunication and internet information regarding the suspects . in addition to problems stemming from germany 's federal structure , critics had feared the database would create more bureaucracy as well as erode people 's privacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics fear anti-terror info could lead to legal problems some members of the social democrats as well as members of the opposition greens and the left party have expressed concerns that easily accessible information on terrorism suspects could be misused as well as create legal problems given the differing information-gathering methods of the police and intelligence agencies are allowed to employ . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany , given abuses under both the nazis and by communist east germany . there have also been fears that innocent people may become wrongly labeled as terrorists once they are included in the database as part of an investigation .
" whoever gets entered into that database will become a terrorist suspect , " greens politician wolfgang wieland said . in-depth information released on request only in a bid to limit this risk , the bill states that only the most basic information of people identified as a suspect in the initial investigations of the state police or federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- should be included in the database 's first level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal possession of firearms would be included in the files should an investigation continue and become more concrete , more detailed information on suspects would only be released after an official request .
these details would include religious affiliation , records pertaining to weapons possession or knowledge or possession of explosives and any affiliation with terror organizations . other information such as occupation , travel habits , bank and telecommunication data would also only be released on official request . post 9/11 terror laws expanded as well as approving the creation of the anti-terror database , the bundestag agreed to expand and extend the anti-terror laws that came into being in the wake of the sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 01.12.2006 mysterious turnaround in gelsenkirchen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four straight wins have schalke celebrating again a month ago squabbling schalke were in complete turmoil .
now they 're grinding out wins and leading the league .
the funny thing is : no one seems to know exactly what put them back on track . october was not a happy month for schalke .
the team had crashed out of the both the uefa cup and the german cup , players were feuding , and many were calling for coach mirko slomka 's head .
schalke 's ever-passionate fans were so disgusted that they treated the team to 19 minutes and 4 seconds of the silent treatment at their home match to bayern . then something happened - schalke started winning and took over the top of the table . so what 's the key to the club 's sudden run of good form ?
part of the reason may be something schalke did n't do . " for the past four weeks , the players have been forbidden from talking to the press , " lars gartenschläger , a sports editor for the daily die welt newspaper told dw-world.de.
" that seems to have helped . " lowly opponents help schalke rack up points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke have had an easy time getting past lesser opponents lately another reason is schalke have suddenly discovered ability to grind out tight wins against inferior opponents .
their current four-game winning streak has come against a run of relegation candidates . " they 're now able to concentrate completely on the bundesliga , " explained wolfgang kerkhoff , a sports reporter who covers schalke for the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" a series of successes against relatively easy opponents has restored their self-confidence . " schalke 's 2-1 victory over lowly bochum last friday was nothing to write home about , but it kept them on top .
schalke seem to be applying the adage that championships are won not by beating bayern , but by picking up the points against teams like mainz and cottbus . the turnaround has even left fans shaking their heads in wonder . " i ca n't explain it , " rolf rojek , chairman of schalke 's association of fan clubs , told dw-world.de.
" we did n't know why things did n't work earlier , and we do n't really understand why they 've gotten better now .
that 's just the way soccer is . " like a marriage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka kept his cool and made some key personnel decisions a lot of credit should go to schalke coach slomka , who has shown both perseverance and courage this season .
his most daring move came in the bayern match in early november , when he benched long-time goalkeeper frank rost in favor of youngster manuel neuer .
schalke have n't lost since . " with hindsight , it was the right move , " said kerkhoff .
" after the same number of games , neuer 's statistics are better than rost 's . " an injury to forward gerald asamoah has also helped sort out personnel conflicts .
asamoah was at the center of schalke 's early-season squabbling when he demanded more playing time at the expense of twins halil and hamit altintop .
but ever since the german national broke his leg in late september , that disagreement has been moot . " slomka made a statement with rost , " gartenschläger said .
" maybe it 's not such a bad thing if one or two sources of discontent are put on ice . " and perhaps the fans ' visible displays of dissatisfaction provided the bit of extra motivation needed to get the team to the very top , rojek added . " we showed that the basic connection between supporters and the club should never be undermined , " he said .
" it 's like a marriage . " the right stuff ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 5 goals and 4 assists , striker kevin kuranyi is back in schalke 's good graces whatever the reason , schalke are winning back fans ' affection .
much-maligned striker kevin kuranyi has started to find the goal again , and workhorses like midfielders levan kobiashvili and gustavo varela , or defender rafinha , have come up with big performances in tight matches to help schalke get the results . " our squad has as much quality as bayern munich 's , " slomka said this week in an interview with the german soccer magazine kicker . it would be ironic indeed if a season that began so acrimoniously ended with schalke winning its first league title since 1958 .
no one 's getting over-confident yet , but experts and fans agree that the team should be able to mount a sustained challenge . " with the other top teams playing like they are , anything is possible , " kerkhoff said .
" they have to worry about other competitions , so schalke should be able to compete for the title . " gartenschläger concurred : " it 's too early to say who 'll win , but schalke are certainly one of the three or four teams with a chance to take the title . " even schalke 's long-suffering , once-bitten-twice-shy supporters are feeling optimistic . " we hope and we believe that the team has the stuff to win a championship , " rojek said .

on world aids day , dw asked him about the issues facing his organization . luis carlos escobar pinzon was named executive director of deutsche aidshilfe , a 120-member umbrella organization for community-based health organizations , last january . born in columbia , escobar has lived in germany for the past 14 years , working in public health research .
dw-world.de : dr. escobar , the situation surrounding aids education and treatment has changed a great deal in the past decade .
what is the state of affairs in germany today ? luis carlos escobar de pinzon : since anti-retrovirus combination therapies were introduced , people with hiv have better treatment opportunities .
they can live for years symptom-free .
that may have led to the fact that many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly diseases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly , escobar said aids is now often seen as a chronic illness , so people are n't protecting themselves as well as they used to .
that 's been our experience , and we are really sorry to see it .
it is a huge new challenge in primary prevention . currently in germany , according to estimates by the robert koch institute , there are 56,000 people in germany living with hiv / aids .
the biggest group is what we call msm - men who have sex with men .
then a big second group is intravenous drug users .
a third group , that is catching up with the second group , is immigrants , especially from high-prevalence countries . you stepped into this job a year ago .
what were your goals when you took over - and how is it going ? my main goal was to once again make hiv and aids an important topic in society .
it is no longer as present in the media as it was in the beginning of the 1990s .
especially in local politics , the relevance of hiv and aids has faded . ...
we see this in budget cuts for prevention and sex education .
there are budget cuts of up to 30 percent in some regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she showed them the money : german health minister ulla schmidt but we 're really glad that on the federal level , we found someone like german health minister ulla schmidt , who is dedicated to putting the topics hiv / aids strongly on the political agenda .
she has seen to it that we get more federal funding to fight hiv and aids . there is still a lot of work left to be done , especially because in the context of this disease , we just ca n't deal with it regionally - it is a global challenge .
we will need to take stronger action ... especially with our neighbors in eastern europe . what are the biggest issues facing aids-related community health organizations today ? prevention , prevention , and more prevention .
since 2001 , we have noticed that the number of new diagnosis is growing again .
we have to find the reasons for this increase , and take appropriate action . in 2007 , dah is starting an interesting research project that should shed more light on the context and influences of new infections better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : needle-using drug addicts are the second-largest group of hiv / aids carriers in addition , we are also fighting the discrimination and stigmatization of people with hiv / aids .
where hiv / aids are taboo topics , prevention ca n't take hold .
we 're not talking just about solidarity with people who have hiv and aids .
this is about anti-discrimination work that is urgently needed to create a protected space for all people with chronic illnesses . how is the increasing prevalence of hiv / aids among immigrants and asylum seekers affecting germany , and aids policy here ? as a person who came here as an immigrant myself , i see it as a very important topic .
asylum seekers are especially threatened and endangered from hiv infection here . it is important to point up the difficult situation for immigrants in germany , especially those who are also are infected with hiv .
they do n't only have to fight the usual problems like racism , legal status , and financial difficulties .
they have an infection that is strongly taboo within their own community .
and naturally , because of cultural and language differences , they have difficulty accessing sex-education and prevention material . has the german regime under angela merkel been supportive of hiv / aids health organizations ?
what is your relationship with her administration ? we work tightly together with the government . ...
we 're really happy that the german health minister schmidt recently promised 3 million additional euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- for funding for primary prevention in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany said it plans to put aids at the top of its eu presidency health agenda beyond that , she announced that when germany holds the eu presidency -lrb- starting in 2007 -rrb- it wants to put the topic hiv / aids very high up on its political agenda . in germany we have a very privileged situation .
the numbers of new infections has n't risen as much as in other countries , even within europe .
but we need to help our neighbors , especially those from eastern europe , to do better and more intensive work on prevention .
we are all equally responsible for containing this disease . you 've had an exciting tenure so far at the head of the dah - what are your targets for this year ? above all , we want to lead a very important discussion on the role of civil society in primary prevention .
the catchword will be " responsibility . "
dah believes responsibility is not divisible .
everybody has equal responsibility for containing the spread of new infection in our country .
hiv positive people have responsibility to not pass the infection along .
but non-tested people and hiv-negative people have exactly as much responsibility to protect themselves from becoming infected . we need to have a discussion about this , in terms of medical ethics , and then develop concrete measures toward primary prevention in germany . jennifer abramsohn interviewed luis carlos escobar pinzon send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de apathy and false security lead to rise in german hiv cases as experts attend the international aids conference in toronto this week , german organizations are working hard to stop the worrying increase in hiv cases at home .

critics continue to voice concerns about threats to civil liberties . after years of heated debate , the german bundestag agreed friday on the creation of a new anti-terror bill that is designed to promote communication and sharing of information between federal and state security services .
it will also include the creation of a controversial national security database and increased surveillance powers for the police and intelligence agencies . the proposal cleared the lower house of parliament with the support of chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats .

" genocide in slow motion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dafur is still unstable and killing of civilians by rebel groups is still rife the united nations has been contemplating sending a larger multilateral contingent to darfur to establish peace in the region under its own command . " if the current african union mandate for darfur were to be transferred into the hands of the united nations , we would not be in a position to ignore such a development , " jung told german public television on thursday . " we could n't just say ' no ' to a un request to contribute troops to a multinational effort to establish peace , " he added . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said a multinational approach should be taken to addressing the violence . " there would be african troops involved in such a mission alongside asian troops and european troops , " she said earlier this week .
" germany would have no right to stand on the sidelines - after all , what we are witnessing in the darfur region is a sort of genocide in slow motion . " other lawmakers from germany 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats , however , have heavily criticized what they call an untimely offer on the part of the defense minister . critics warn germany to not interfere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german politicans want the african region to resolve conflicts itself peter ramsauer of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , lashed out at the defense minister for not coordinating his statements on darfur with parliamentary leaders . in addition to stating his opposition to a larger german deployment in sudan , ramsauer also pointed out there has been no request from the united nations for troops . head of the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party guido westerwelle called jung 's campaign a " grave mistake " that went against germany 's post-world war ii restraint on the foreign policy front . germany currently has 41 military observers stationed with un forces in sudan .
the german cabinet agreed to extend the troops ' mandate on wednesday and set a deployment cap of 200 soldiers . us could step-up pressure karsten voigt , the german government 's coordinator for transatlantic relations , said he is certain members of the us democratic party will try and put more pressure on europe , including germany , to help resolve to darfur conflict . " many us democrats are indeed urging the european union and nato to become active in darfur , " voigt said .
" but right now i do n't sense much willingness on the part of european partners to step into action , nor do i see any majority backing for such a mission in the german parliament .

now they 're grinding out wins and leading the league .
the funny thing is : no one seems to know exactly what put them back on track . october was not a happy month for schalke .
the team had crashed out of the both the uefa cup and the german cup , players were feuding , and many were calling for coach mirko slomka 's head .
schalke 's ever-passionate fans were so disgusted that they treated the team to 19 minutes and 4 seconds of the silent treatment at their home match to bayern . then something happened - schalke started winning and took over the top of the table . so what 's the key to the club 's sudden run of good form ?
part of the reason may be something schalke did n't do . " for the past four weeks , the players have been forbidden from talking to the press , " lars gartenschläger , a sports editor for the daily die welt newspaper told dw-world.de.
" that seems to have helped . " lowly opponents help schalke rack up points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke have had an easy time getting past lesser opponents lately another reason is schalke have suddenly discovered ability to grind out tight wins against inferior opponents .
their current four-game winning streak has come against a run of relegation candidates . " they 're now able to concentrate completely on the bundesliga , " explained wolfgang kerkhoff , a sports reporter who covers schalke for the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" a series of successes against relatively easy opponents has restored their self-confidence . " schalke 's 2-1 victory over lowly bochum last friday was nothing to write home about , but it kept them on top .
schalke seem to be applying the adage that championships are won not by beating bayern , but by picking up the points against teams like mainz and cottbus . the turnaround has even left fans shaking their heads in wonder . " i ca n't explain it , " rolf rojek , chairman of schalke 's association of fan clubs , told dw-world.de.
" we did n't know why things did n't work earlier , and we do n't really understand why they 've gotten better now .
that 's just the way soccer is . " like a marriage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka kept his cool and made some key personnel decisions a lot of credit should go to schalke coach slomka , who has shown both perseverance and courage this season .
his most daring move came in the bayern match in early november , when he benched long-time goalkeeper frank rost in favor of youngster manuel neuer .
schalke have n't lost since . " with hindsight , it was the right move , " said kerkhoff .
" after the same number of games , neuer 's statistics are better than rost 's . " an injury to forward gerald asamoah has also helped sort out personnel conflicts .
asamoah was at the center of schalke 's early-season squabbling when he demanded more playing time at the expense of twins halil and hamit altintop .
but ever since the german national broke his leg in late september , that disagreement has been moot . " slomka made a statement with rost , " gartenschläger said .
" maybe it 's not such a bad thing if one or two sources of discontent are put on ice . " and perhaps the fans ' visible displays of dissatisfaction provided the bit of extra motivation needed to get the team to the very top , rojek added . " we showed that the basic connection between supporters and the club should never be undermined , " he said .
" it 's like a marriage . " the right stuff ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 5 goals and 4 assists , striker kevin kuranyi is back in schalke 's good graces whatever the reason , schalke are winning back fans ' affection .
much-maligned striker kevin kuranyi has started to find the goal again , and workhorses like midfielders levan kobiashvili and gustavo varela , or defender rafinha , have come up with big performances in tight matches to help schalke get the results . " our squad has as much quality as bayern munich 's , " slomka said this week in an interview with the german soccer magazine kicker . it would be ironic indeed if a season that began so acrimoniously ended with schalke winning its first league title since 1958 .
no one 's getting over-confident yet , but experts and fans agree that the team should be able to mount a sustained challenge . " with the other top teams playing like they are , anything is possible , " kerkhoff said .
" they have to worry about other competitions , so schalke should be able to compete for the title . " gartenschläger concurred : " it 's too early to say who 'll win , but schalke are certainly one of the three or four teams with a chance to take the title . " even schalke 's long-suffering , once-bitten-twice-shy supporters are feeling optimistic . " we hope and we believe that the team has the stuff to win a championship , " rojek said .
" but whether it will be enough in the end … that we do n't know .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 01.12.2006 germany approves anti-terror database großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the bill say germany should do everything in its power to protect its citizens the german parliament has agreed on the creation of a much-debated anti-terror database and the expansion of laws brought into effect after sept .
11 .
critics continue to voice concerns about threats to civil liberties . after years of heated debate , the german bundestag agreed friday on the creation of a new anti-terror bill that is designed to promote communication and sharing of information between federal and state security services .
it will also include the creation of a controversial national security database and increased surveillance powers for the police and intelligence agencies . the proposal cleared the lower house of parliament with the support of chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats .
if the bill is approved by germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , in discussions on dec .
15 , it will become law effective jan .
1 . rejecting opposition concerns that the new bill would turn germany into a police state , minister of the interior wolfgang schäuble said no one could guarantee 100 percent security in these times but the government had the responsibility to do all it could to protect its citizens from the threat of international terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble said that no-one could guarantee total security schäuble maintained that the anti-terror database would create the right conditions for the police and the secret services to collaborate more efficiently and offer the highest level of security possible . though the grand coalition agreed on setting up a central anti-terrorism database last year , the two parties had differed on its exact shape and reach until friday . the idea is that all police and intelligence agencies , both at the federal and national level , would gather information about terror suspects and terrorist organizations in a central database that would be accessible to all crime-fighting agencies . fears about infringements on civil liberties at present , germany 's 37 agencies do that separately .
the central anti-terrorism database would also contain information about banking , telecommunication and internet information regarding the suspects . in addition to problems stemming from germany 's federal structure , critics had feared the database would create more bureaucracy as well as erode people 's privacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics fear anti-terror info could lead to legal problems some members of the social democrats as well as members of the opposition greens and the left party have expressed concerns that easily accessible information on terrorism suspects could be misused as well as create legal problems given the differing information-gathering methods of the police and intelligence agencies are allowed to employ . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany , given abuses under both the nazis and by communist east germany . there have also been fears that innocent people may become wrongly labeled as terrorists once they are included in the database as part of an investigation .
" whoever gets entered into that database will become a terrorist suspect , " greens politician wolfgang wieland said . in-depth information released on request only in a bid to limit this risk , the bill states that only the most basic information of people identified as a suspect in the initial investigations of the state police or federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- should be included in the database 's first level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal possession of firearms would be included in the files should an investigation continue and become more concrete , more detailed information on suspects would only be released after an official request .
these details would include religious affiliation , records pertaining to weapons possession or knowledge or possession of explosives and any affiliation with terror organizations . other information such as occupation , travel habits , bank and telecommunication data would also only be released on official request . post 9/11 terror laws expanded as well as approving the creation of the anti-terror database , the bundestag agreed to expand and extend the anti-terror laws that came into being in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states . the existing laws , which went into effect in early 2002 , allow police and secret services to use telephone communications , e-mails , faxes , bank accounts and travel data as sources of information .
under the proposed revisions , access to the same would be expanded .
in addition , germany 's foreign intelligence service , bnd , would have wider access to domestic police databases . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : new anti-terror tool comes way too late german security officials have ended a long deadlock by agreeing on a centralized database for terrorism suspects .
the measure comes at the wrong time and does little to make people feel safe , says dw 's marcel fürstenau .

critics continue to voice concerns about threats to civil liberties . after years of heated debate , the german bundestag agreed friday on the creation of a new anti-terror bill that is designed to promote communication and sharing of information between federal and state security services .
it will also include the creation of a controversial national security database and increased surveillance powers for the police and intelligence agencies . the proposal cleared the lower house of parliament with the support of chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 01.12.2006 mysterious turnaround in gelsenkirchen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four straight wins have schalke celebrating again a month ago squabbling schalke were in complete turmoil .
now they 're grinding out wins and leading the league .
the funny thing is : no one seems to know exactly what put them back on track . october was not a happy month for schalke .
the team had crashed out of the both the uefa cup and the german cup , players were feuding , and many were calling for coach mirko slomka 's head .
schalke 's ever-passionate fans were so disgusted that they treated the team to 19 minutes and 4 seconds of the silent treatment at their home match to bayern . then something happened - schalke started winning and took over the top of the table . so what 's the key to the club 's sudden run of good form ?
part of the reason may be something schalke did n't do . " for the past four weeks , the players have been forbidden from talking to the press , " lars gartenschläger , a sports editor for the daily die welt newspaper told dw-world.de.
" that seems to have helped . " lowly opponents help schalke rack up points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke have had an easy time getting past lesser opponents lately another reason is schalke have suddenly discovered ability to grind out tight wins against inferior opponents .
their current four-game winning streak has come against a run of relegation candidates . " they 're now able to concentrate completely on the bundesliga , " explained wolfgang kerkhoff , a sports reporter who covers schalke for the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" a series of successes against relatively easy opponents has restored their self-confidence . " schalke 's 2-1 victory over lowly bochum last friday was nothing to write home about , but it kept them on top .
schalke seem to be applying the adage that championships are won not by beating bayern , but by picking up the points against teams like mainz and cottbus . the turnaround has even left fans shaking their heads in wonder . " i ca n't explain it , " rolf rojek , chairman of schalke 's association of fan clubs , told dw-world.de.
" we did n't know why things did n't work earlier , and we do n't really understand why they 've gotten better now .
that 's just the way soccer is . " like a marriage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka kept his cool and made some key personnel decisions a lot of credit should go to schalke coach slomka , who has shown both perseverance and courage this season .
his most daring move came in the bayern match in early november , when he benched long-time goalkeeper frank rost in favor of youngster manuel neuer .
schalke have n't lost since . " with hindsight , it was the right move , " said kerkhoff .
" after the same number of games , neuer 's statistics are better than rost 's . " an injury to forward gerald asamoah has also helped sort out personnel conflicts .
asamoah was at the center of schalke 's early-season squabbling when he demanded more playing time at the expense of twins halil and hamit altintop .
but ever since the german national broke his leg in late september , that disagreement has been moot . " slomka made a statement with rost , " gartenschläger said .
" maybe it 's not such a bad thing if one or two sources of discontent are put on ice . " and perhaps the fans ' visible displays of dissatisfaction provided the bit of extra motivation needed to get the team to the very top , rojek added . " we showed that the basic connection between supporters and the club should never be undermined , " he said .
" it 's like a marriage . " the right stuff ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 5 goals and 4 assists , striker kevin kuranyi is back in schalke 's good graces whatever the reason , schalke are winning back fans ' affection .
much-maligned striker kevin kuranyi has started to find the goal again , and workhorses like midfielders levan kobiashvili and gustavo varela , or defender rafinha , have come up with big performances in tight matches to help schalke get the results . " our squad has as much quality as bayern munich 's , " slomka said this week in an interview with the german soccer magazine kicker . it would be ironic indeed if a season that began so acrimoniously ended with schalke winning its first league title since 1958 .
no one 's getting over-confident yet , but experts and fans agree that the team should be able to mount a sustained challenge . " with the other top teams playing like they are , anything is possible , " kerkhoff said .
" they have to worry about other competitions , so schalke should be able to compete for the title . " gartenschläger concurred : " it 's too early to say who 'll win , but schalke are certainly one of the three or four teams with a chance to take the title . " even schalke 's long-suffering , once-bitten-twice-shy supporters are feeling optimistic . " we hope and we believe that the team has the stuff to win a championship , " rojek said .
" but whether it will be enough in the end … that we do n't know .

on world aids day , dw asked him about the issues facing his organization . luis carlos escobar pinzon was named executive director of deutsche aidshilfe , a 120-member umbrella organization for community-based health organizations , last january . born in columbia , escobar has lived in germany for the past 14 years , working in public health research .
dw-world.de : dr. escobar , the situation surrounding aids education and treatment has changed a great deal in the past decade .
what is the state of affairs in germany today ? luis carlos escobar de pinzon : since anti-retrovirus combination therapies were introduced , people with hiv have better treatment opportunities .
they can live for years symptom-free .
that may have led to the fact that many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly diseases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly , escobar said aids is now often seen as a chronic illness , so people are n't protecting themselves as well as they used to .
that 's been our experience , and we are really sorry to see it .
it is a huge new challenge in primary prevention . currently in germany , according to estimates by the robert koch institute , there are 56,000 people in germany living with hiv / aids .
the biggest group is what we call msm - men who have sex with men .
then a big second group is intravenous drug users .
a third group , that is catching up with the second group , is immigrants , especially from high-prevalence countries . you stepped into this job a year ago .
what were your goals when you took over - and how is it going ? my main goal was to once again make hiv and aids an important topic in society .
it is no longer as present in the media as it was in the beginning of the 1990s .
especially in local politics , the relevance of hiv and aids has faded . ...
we see this in budget cuts for prevention and sex education .
there are budget cuts of up to 30 percent in some regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she showed them the money : german health minister ulla schmidt but we 're really glad that on the federal level , we found someone like german health minister ulla schmidt , who is dedicated to putting the topics hiv / aids strongly on the political agenda .
she has seen to it that we get more federal funding to fight hiv and aids . there is still a lot of work left to be done , especially because in the context of this disease , we just ca n't deal with it regionally - it is a global challenge .
we will need to take stronger action ... especially with our neighbors in eastern europe . what are the biggest issues facing aids-related community health organizations today ? prevention , prevention , and more prevention .
since 2001 , we have noticed that the number of new diagnosis is growing again .
we have to find the reasons for this increase , and take appropriate action . in 2007 , dah is starting an interesting research project that should shed more light on the context and influences of new infections better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : needle-using drug addicts are the second-largest group of hiv / aids carriers in addition , we are also fighting the discrimination and stigmatization of people with hiv / aids .
where hiv / aids are taboo topics , prevention ca n't take hold .
we 're not talking just about solidarity with people who have hiv and aids .
this is about anti-discrimination work that is urgently needed to create a protected space for all people with chronic illnesses . how is the increasing prevalence of hiv / aids among immigrants and asylum seekers affecting germany , and aids policy here ? as a person who came here as an immigrant myself , i see it as a very important topic .
asylum seekers are especially threatened and endangered from hiv infection here . it is important to point up the difficult situation for immigrants in germany , especially those who are also are infected with hiv .
they do n't only have to fight the usual problems like racism , legal status , and financial difficulties .
they have an infection that is strongly taboo within their own community .
and naturally , because of cultural and language differences , they have difficulty accessing sex-education and prevention material . has the german regime under angela merkel been supportive of hiv / aids health organizations ?
what is your relationship with her administration ? we work tightly together with the government . ...
we 're really happy that the german health minister schmidt recently promised 3 million additional euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- for funding for primary prevention in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany said it plans to put aids at the top of its eu presidency health agenda beyond that , she announced that when germany holds the eu presidency -lrb- starting in 2007 -rrb- it wants to put the topic hiv / aids very high up on its political agenda . in germany we have a very privileged situation .
the numbers of new infections has n't risen as much as in other countries , even within europe .
but we need to help our neighbors , especially those from eastern europe , to do better and more intensive work on prevention .
we are all equally responsible for containing this disease . you 've had an exciting tenure so far at the head of the dah - what are your targets for this year ? above all , we want to lead a very important discussion on the role of civil society in primary prevention .
the catchword will be " responsibility . "
dah believes responsibility is not divisible .
everybody has equal responsibility for containing the spread of new infection in our country .
hiv positive people have responsibility to not pass the infection along .
but non-tested people and hiv-negative people have exactly as much responsibility to protect themselves from becoming infected . we need to have a discussion about this , in terms of medical ethics , and then develop concrete measures toward primary prevention in germany . jennifer abramsohn interviewed luis carlos escobar pinzon send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de apathy and false security lead to rise in german hiv cases as experts attend the international aids conference in toronto this week , german organizations are working hard to stop the worrying increase in hiv cases at home .

on world aids day , dw asked him about the issues facing his organization . luis carlos escobar pinzon was named executive director of deutsche aidshilfe , a 120-member umbrella organization for community-based health organizations , last january . born in columbia , escobar has lived in germany for the past 14 years , working in public health research .
dw-world.de : dr. escobar , the situation surrounding aids education and treatment has changed a great deal in the past decade .
what is the state of affairs in germany today ? luis carlos escobar de pinzon : since anti-retrovirus combination therapies were introduced , people with hiv have better treatment opportunities .
they can live for years symptom-free .
that may have led to the fact that many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly diseases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people no longer think of hiv and aids as deadly , escobar said aids is now often seen as a chronic illness , so people are n't protecting themselves as well as they used to .
that 's been our experience , and we are really sorry to see it .
it is a huge new challenge in primary prevention . currently in germany , according to estimates by the robert koch institute , there are 56,000 people in germany living with hiv / aids .
the biggest group is what we call msm - men who have sex with men .
then a big second group is intravenous drug users .
a third group , that is catching up with the second group , is immigrants , especially from high-prevalence countries . you stepped into this job a year ago .
what were your goals when you took over - and how is it going ? my main goal was to once again make hiv and aids an important topic in society .
it is no longer as present in the media as it was in the beginning of the 1990s .
especially in local politics , the relevance of hiv and aids has faded . ...
we see this in budget cuts for prevention and sex education .
there are budget cuts of up to 30 percent in some regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she showed them the money : german health minister ulla schmidt but we 're really glad that on the federal level , we found someone like german health minister ulla schmidt , who is dedicated to putting the topics hiv / aids strongly on the political agenda .
she has seen to it that we get more federal funding to fight hiv and aids . there is still a lot of work left to be done , especially because in the context of this disease , we just ca n't deal with it regionally - it is a global challenge .
we will need to take stronger action ... especially with our neighbors in eastern europe . what are the biggest issues facing aids-related community health organizations today ? prevention , prevention , and more prevention .
since 2001 , we have noticed that the number of new diagnosis is growing again .
we have to find the reasons for this increase , and take appropriate action . in 2007 , dah is starting an interesting research project that should shed more light on the context and influences of new infections better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : needle-using drug addicts are the second-largest group of hiv / aids carriers in addition , we are also fighting the discrimination and stigmatization of people with hiv / aids .
where hiv / aids are taboo topics , prevention ca n't take hold .
we 're not talking just about solidarity with people who have hiv and aids .
this is about anti-discrimination work that is urgently needed to create a protected space for all people with chronic illnesses . how is the increasing prevalence of hiv / aids among immigrants and asylum seekers affecting germany , and aids policy here ? as a person who came here as an immigrant myself , i see it as a very important topic .
asylum seekers are especially threatened and endangered from hiv infection here . it is important to point up the difficult situation for immigrants in germany , especially those who are also are infected with hiv .
they do n't only have to fight the usual problems like racism , legal status , and financial difficulties .
they have an infection that is strongly taboo within their own community .
and naturally , because of cultural and language differences , they have difficulty accessing sex-education and prevention material . has the german regime under angela merkel been supportive of hiv / aids health organizations ?
what is your relationship with her administration ? we work tightly together with the government . ...
we 're really happy that the german health minister schmidt recently promised 3 million additional euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- for funding for primary prevention in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany said it plans to put aids at the top of its eu presidency health agenda beyond that , she announced that when germany holds the eu presidency -lrb- starting in 2007 -rrb- it wants to put the topic hiv / aids very high up on its political agenda . in germany we have a very privileged situation .
the numbers of new infections has n't risen as much as in other countries , even within europe .
but we need to help our neighbors , especially those from eastern europe , to do better and more intensive work on prevention .
we are all equally responsible for containing this disease . you 've had an exciting tenure so far at the head of the dah - what are your targets for this year ? above all , we want to lead a very important discussion on the role of civil society in primary prevention .
the catchword will be " responsibility . "
dah believes responsibility is not divisible .
everybody has equal responsibility for containing the spread of new infection in our country .
hiv positive people have responsibility to not pass the infection along .
but non-tested people and hiv-negative people have exactly as much responsibility to protect themselves from becoming infected . we need to have a discussion about this , in terms of medical ethics , and then develop concrete measures toward primary prevention in germany . jennifer abramsohn interviewed luis carlos escobar pinzon send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de apathy and false security lead to rise in german hiv cases as experts attend the international aids conference in toronto this week , german organizations are working hard to stop the worrying increase in hiv cases at home .

11 .
critics continue to voice concerns about threats to civil liberties . after years of heated debate , the german bundestag agreed friday on the creation of a new anti-terror bill that is designed to promote communication and sharing of information between federal and state security services .
it will also include the creation of a controversial national security database and increased surveillance powers for the police and intelligence agencies . the proposal cleared the lower house of parliament with the support of chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats .

the central anti-terrorism database would also contain information about banking , telecommunication and internet information regarding the suspects . in addition to problems stemming from germany 's federal structure , critics had feared the database would create more bureaucracy as well as erode people 's privacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics fear anti-terror info could lead to legal problems some members of the social democrats as well as members of the opposition greens and the left party have expressed concerns that easily accessible information on terrorism suspects could be misused as well as create legal problems given the differing information-gathering methods of the police and intelligence agencies are allowed to employ . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany , given abuses under both the nazis and by communist east germany . there have also been fears that innocent people may become wrongly labeled as terrorists once they are included in the database as part of an investigation .
" whoever gets entered into that database will become a terrorist suspect , " greens politician wolfgang wieland said . in-depth information released on request only in a bid to limit this risk , the bill states that only the most basic information of people identified as a suspect in the initial investigations of the state police or federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- should be included in the database 's first level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal possession of firearms would be included in the files should an investigation continue and become more concrete , more detailed information on suspects would only be released after an official request .

" genocide in slow motion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dafur is still unstable and killing of civilians by rebel groups is still rife the united nations has been contemplating sending a larger multilateral contingent to darfur to establish peace in the region under its own command . " if the current african union mandate for darfur were to be transferred into the hands of the united nations , we would not be in a position to ignore such a development , " jung told german public television on thursday . " we could n't just say ' no ' to a un request to contribute troops to a multinational effort to establish peace , " he added . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said a multinational approach should be taken to addressing the violence . " there would be african troops involved in such a mission alongside asian troops and european troops , " she said earlier this week .
" germany would have no right to stand on the sidelines - after all , what we are witnessing in the darfur region is a sort of genocide in slow motion . " other lawmakers from germany 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats , however , have heavily criticized what they call an untimely offer on the part of the defense minister . critics warn germany to not interfere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german politicans want the african region to resolve conflicts itself peter ramsauer of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , lashed out at the defense minister for not coordinating his statements on darfur with parliamentary leaders . in addition to stating his opposition to a larger german deployment in sudan , ramsauer also pointed out there has been no request from the united nations for troops . head of the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party guido westerwelle called jung 's campaign a " grave mistake " that went against germany 's post-world war ii restraint on the foreign policy front . germany currently has 41 military observers stationed with un forces in sudan .
the german cabinet agreed to extend the troops ' mandate on wednesday and set a deployment cap of 200 soldiers . us could step-up pressure karsten voigt , the german government 's coordinator for transatlantic relations , said he is certain members of the us democratic party will try and put more pressure on europe , including germany , to help resolve to darfur conflict . " many us democrats are indeed urging the european union and nato to become active in darfur , " voigt said .

now they 're grinding out wins and leading the league .
the funny thing is : no one seems to know exactly what put them back on track . october was not a happy month for schalke .
the team had crashed out of the both the uefa cup and the german cup , players were feuding , and many were calling for coach mirko slomka 's head .
schalke 's ever-passionate fans were so disgusted that they treated the team to 19 minutes and 4 seconds of the silent treatment at their home match to bayern . then something happened - schalke started winning and took over the top of the table . so what 's the key to the club 's sudden run of good form ?
part of the reason may be something schalke did n't do . " for the past four weeks , the players have been forbidden from talking to the press , " lars gartenschläger , a sports editor for the daily die welt newspaper told dw-world.de.

their current four-game winning streak has come against a run of relegation candidates . " they 're now able to concentrate completely on the bundesliga , " explained wolfgang kerkhoff , a sports reporter who covers schalke for the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" a series of successes against relatively easy opponents has restored their self-confidence . " schalke 's 2-1 victory over lowly bochum last friday was nothing to write home about , but it kept them on top .
schalke seem to be applying the adage that championships are won not by beating bayern , but by picking up the points against teams like mainz and cottbus . the turnaround has even left fans shaking their heads in wonder . " i ca n't explain it , " rolf rojek , chairman of schalke 's association of fan clubs , told dw-world.de.

schalke have n't lost since . " with hindsight , it was the right move , " said kerkhoff .
" after the same number of games , neuer 's statistics are better than rost 's . " an injury to forward gerald asamoah has also helped sort out personnel conflicts .
asamoah was at the center of schalke 's early-season squabbling when he demanded more playing time at the expense of twins halil and hamit altintop .
but ever since the german national broke his leg in late september , that disagreement has been moot . " slomka made a statement with rost , " gartenschläger said .
" maybe it 's not such a bad thing if one or two sources of discontent are put on ice . " and perhaps the fans ' visible displays of dissatisfaction provided the bit of extra motivation needed to get the team to the very top , rojek added . " we showed that the basic connection between supporters and the club should never be undermined , " he said .
" it 's like a marriage . " the right stuff ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 5 goals and 4 assists , striker kevin kuranyi is back in schalke 's good graces whatever the reason , schalke are winning back fans ' affection .
much-maligned striker kevin kuranyi has started to find the goal again , and workhorses like midfielders levan kobiashvili and gustavo varela , or defender rafinha , have come up with big performances in tight matches to help schalke get the results . " our squad has as much quality as bayern munich 's , " slomka said this week in an interview with the german soccer magazine kicker . it would be ironic indeed if a season that began so acrimoniously ended with schalke winning its first league title since 1958 .
no one 's getting over-confident yet , but experts and fans agree that the team should be able to mount a sustained challenge . " with the other top teams playing like they are , anything is possible , " kerkhoff said .
" they have to worry about other competitions , so schalke should be able to compete for the title . " gartenschläger concurred : " it 's too early to say who 'll win , but schalke are certainly one of the three or four teams with a chance to take the title .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 01.12.2006 mysterious turnaround in gelsenkirchen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four straight wins have schalke celebrating again a month ago squabbling schalke were in complete turmoil .
now they 're grinding out wins and leading the league .
the funny thing is : no one seems to know exactly what put them back on track . october was not a happy month for schalke .
the team had crashed out of the both the uefa cup and the german cup , players were feuding , and many were calling for coach mirko slomka 's head .
schalke 's ever-passionate fans were so disgusted that they treated the team to 19 minutes and 4 seconds of the silent treatment at their home match to bayern . then something happened - schalke started winning and took over the top of the table . so what 's the key to the club 's sudden run of good form ?
part of the reason may be something schalke did n't do . " for the past four weeks , the players have been forbidden from talking to the press , " lars gartenschläger , a sports editor for the daily die welt newspaper told dw-world.de.
" that seems to have helped . " lowly opponents help schalke rack up points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke have had an easy time getting past lesser opponents lately another reason is schalke have suddenly discovered ability to grind out tight wins against inferior opponents .
their current four-game winning streak has come against a run of relegation candidates . " they 're now able to concentrate completely on the bundesliga , " explained wolfgang kerkhoff , a sports reporter who covers schalke for the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" a series of successes against relatively easy opponents has restored their self-confidence . " schalke 's 2-1 victory over lowly bochum last friday was nothing to write home about , but it kept them on top .
schalke seem to be applying the adage that championships are won not by beating bayern , but by picking up the points against teams like mainz and cottbus . the turnaround has even left fans shaking their heads in wonder . " i ca n't explain it , " rolf rojek , chairman of schalke 's association of fan clubs , told dw-world.de.
" we did n't know why things did n't work earlier , and we do n't really understand why they 've gotten better now .
that 's just the way soccer is . " like a marriage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka kept his cool and made some key personnel decisions a lot of credit should go to schalke coach slomka , who has shown both perseverance and courage this season .
his most daring move came in the bayern match in early november , when he benched long-time goalkeeper frank rost in favor of youngster manuel neuer .
schalke have n't lost since . " with hindsight , it was the right move , " said kerkhoff .
" after the same number of games , neuer 's statistics are better than rost 's . " an injury to forward gerald asamoah has also helped sort out personnel conflicts .
asamoah was at the center of schalke 's early-season squabbling when he demanded more playing time at the expense of twins halil and hamit altintop .
but ever since the german national broke his leg in late september , that disagreement has been moot . " slomka made a statement with rost , " gartenschläger said .
" maybe it 's not such a bad thing if one or two sources of discontent are put on ice . " and perhaps the fans ' visible displays of dissatisfaction provided the bit of extra motivation needed to get the team to the very top , rojek added . " we showed that the basic connection between supporters and the club should never be undermined , " he said .
" it 's like a marriage . " the right stuff ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 5 goals and 4 assists , striker kevin kuranyi is back in schalke 's good graces whatever the reason , schalke are winning back fans ' affection .

the ban covers virtually all enclosed public places including offices , factories , pubs and bars , but not outdoors or in private homes .
it follows similar bans in the irish republic and scotland - a ban in wales starts on 2 april .
ministers say it will protect everyone from passive smoking , but opponents say the total ban is " draconian " .
from 1 july pubs and restaurants will have to display prominent " no smoking " signs around their premises .
health secretary patricia hewitt said the ban was a " huge step forward " which would save thousands of people 's lives .
the cost of implementing the ban has been estimated at about £ 50m .
medical evidence ms hewitt said the ban would protect everyone from second-hand smoke , while making it easier for smokers to quit .
" the scientific and medical evidence is clear - second-hand smoke kills , causing a range of serious medical conditions including lung cancer , heart disease , and sudden infant death syndrome , " she said .
" this legislation will help to prevent the unnecessary deaths caused every year from second-hand smoke , and recognises that there is absolutely no safe level of exposure . "
smoking bans irish republic : march 2004 scotland : march 2006 northern ireland : april 2007 wales : april 2007 england : july 2007 the government predicts about 600,000 people will give up smoking as a result of the law change .
the news was welcomed by health campaigners .
dame helena shovelton , chief executive of the british lung foundation , said : " this is a victory for all those of us who have campaigned so vigorously to improve public health . "
she said it would reduce the death toll linked to smoking and that tens of thousands of people with lung disease would once again be able to visit pubs and restaurants .
cancer research uk chief , prof alex markham , said 1 july would be an " historic day " .
" making workplaces and enclosed public places smoke free will bring about some of the most significant health improvements the country has seen in decades , " he said . "
-lsb- it 's -rsb- typical of a government that seems determined to interfere in every aspect of our daily lives " simon clark , forest lobby group send us your comments british beer and pub association boss , rob hayward , welcomed the announcement , saying it gave businesses " greater clarity " and would allow them to prepare their customers for the changes .
the cabinet originally proposed prohibiting smoking only in pubs serving food , in line with labour 's election manifesto - but mps eventually backed a total ban in enclosed public spaces in a free vote .
simon clark , director of the smokers ' lobby group forest , said that decision had been " draconian " .
" from july next year it will not only be illegal to smoke in every pub , club and bar in the country , it will also be impossible to set up a private club run by smokers for smokers , " he said .
" that 's an amazing state of affairs but typical of a government that seems determined to interfere in every aspect of our daily lives . "
the health secretary is also launching a smokefree england campaign , to advise england 's 3.7m businesses to prepare for the ban .

the ban covers virtually all enclosed public places including offices , factories , pubs and bars , but not outdoors or in private homes .
it follows similar bans in the irish republic and scotland - a ban in wales starts on 2 april .
ministers say it will protect everyone from passive smoking , but opponents say the total ban is " draconian " .
from 1 july pubs and restaurants will have to display prominent " no smoking " signs around their premises .
health secretary patricia hewitt said the ban was a " huge step forward " which would save thousands of people 's lives .
the cost of implementing the ban has been estimated at about £ 50m .
medical evidence ms hewitt said the ban would protect everyone from second-hand smoke , while making it easier for smokers to quit .
" the scientific and medical evidence is clear - second-hand smoke kills , causing a range of serious medical conditions including lung cancer , heart disease , and sudden infant death syndrome , " she said .
" this legislation will help to prevent the unnecessary deaths caused every year from second-hand smoke , and recognises that there is absolutely no safe level of exposure . "

france 's constitutional court has approved a bill privatising gdf , but says that 1 july 2007 is the earliest it can go ahead .
opposition parties have criticised the 80bn euro -lrb- £ 53.7bn ; $ 105.6bn -rrb- deal , saying it would push up energy prices .
but the government says the merger will make gdf stronger across europe .
' european leader ' a merged company would make gdf less likely to be the subject of a takeover and ensure greater security of supply for france , the government argues .
but unions fear it could lead to job losses , echoing opposition fears that lack of competition would raise energy prices .
the privatisation of gdf means the french government will still have a significant stake in the firm - 34 % - but considerably less that its existing 80 % share .
" this decision allows gaz de france to go forward with its merger plan with suez , that will create a european energy leader , " said a gdf spokesperson .
but the earliest date for the merger now comes after presidential elections , which could impact the deal .
" this puts the future of the gdf in the hands of the french people , " said jean-marc ayrault , floor leader of the opposition socialist party .

france 's constitutional court has approved a bill privatising gdf , but says that 1 july 2007 is the earliest it can go ahead .
opposition parties have criticised the 80bn euro -lrb- £ 53.7bn ; $ 105.6bn -rrb- deal , saying it would push up energy prices .
but the government says the merger will make gdf stronger across europe .
' european leader ' a merged company would make gdf less likely to be the subject of a takeover and ensure greater security of supply for france , the government argues .
but unions fear it could lead to job losses , echoing opposition fears that lack of competition would raise energy prices .
the privatisation of gdf means the french government will still have a significant stake in the firm - 34 % - but considerably less that its existing 80 % share .
" this decision allows gaz de france to go forward with its merger plan with suez , that will create a european energy leader , " said a gdf spokesperson .
but the earliest date for the merger now comes after presidential elections , which could impact the deal .
" this puts the future of the gdf in the hands of the french people , " said jean-marc ayrault , floor leader of the opposition socialist party .

the company , which owns over 2,400 pubs , also announced that it was changing its name to marstons , after its most popular beer brand .
profit growth was driven by its pubs business - earnings at its 1,900-strong union pub company arm rose 23.3 % .
beer profits were flat , in line with a 2 % decline in the overall uk market .
the company said that trading in the first eight weeks of the new financial year , to 25 november , had been strong .
wolverhampton & dudley has adopted an aggressive growth strategy in recent years , buying burtonwood , jennings brothers and celtic inns in the past eighteen months .
although it had been looking at further acquisitions , it said that continued consolidation in the brewing and pub sector had pushed prices to very high levels .
to combat the decline seen in the uk beer market last year , wolverhampton & dudley said it was concentrating on premium cask-condition ales , including its marston 's pedigree and jennings cumberland ale brands .

in a letter to the health service 's chief executive , andrew lansley , the shadow health secretary , has questioned the evidence for the proposed changes .
they would see services concentrated in big regional centres , while local a & e units are downgraded or closed .
he has identified 29 a & e units which are under threat .
mr lansley said the exercise was being driven by the need to save money .
but the government said it will make services safer and more up-to-date .
can these changes can ever be delivered without provoking local fury ? "
i think we 'd be better off living on one of the scottish islands " joss mahon it is more than five years since richard taylor shook the political establishment by leading a revolt in kidderminster over the closure of hospital services , including the a & e. his election showed just how politically sensitive these decisions can be .
now emergency services across england are being overhauled .
richard taylor is worried that important lessons have been forgotten .
he said : " everybody will travel for high-powered difficult surgery , difficult cancer-care , major trauma .
" but they want on their doorstep facilities to see a doctor who can cope with the bread and butter , run of the mill emergencies , which are usually medical things .
" the heart attacks , the strokes the pneumonias , which come out of the blue without any warning . "
acceptable compromise he said it is about finding an acceptable compromise .
he thinks it can be done , and he gives the example of hexham in northumberland . "
there is a growing range of skills that paramedics have that are enabling treatment to take place either in peoples ' homes , or at the roadside " darrell jackson community paramedic the emergency care unit in hexham general hospital has doctor-led care round the clock , backed up by experienced , highly trained nurses .
it is all pristine and new , with ten beds off a central corridor , resuscitation rooms at one end , minor injuries at the other .
it is part of a £ 28 million pfi scheme , that replaced the old world war two nissan huts .
the hospital serves a small largely-rural population .
places much bigger than this are in danger of losing their a & e , so how does hexham manage ?
dr chris townsend-rose is the senior doctor in charge here .
" it is a very small hospital and if it was trying to stand alone it would n't be viable .
" it survives because it 's part of a much bigger trust .
we have two bigger sister general hospitals not too far away . "
that means it can rota in senior doctors from other hospitals , while the nurses here take on tasks previously carried out by with junior doctors .
bigger role darrell jackson , a community paramedic with the north east ambulance service , said they were also taking on a bigger role .
" there is a growing range of skills that paramedics have that are enabling treatment to take place either in peoples ' homes , or at the roadside .
" a good example is chest decompression .
we can now do that .
it avoids the problems of a collapsed lung for a patient which is life-threatening .
" previously , we either have to call a doctor out to put a chest drain in , or we 'd have to try and get the patient to the hospital as fast as we could so that they go to surgery for a drain to be fitted . "
so , emergency care is changing , but not everyone here is happy about it .
three-and-a-half years ago joss mahon broke her elbow after coming off a bike .
she had an emergency operation in hexham .
two years later she fell off a horse and broke her other arm .
hexham hospital no longer carried out emergency surgery , so she was transferred on to ashington in north tyneside .
" i think we 'd be better off living on one of the scottish islands i know , where they take you up in a helicopter , it 's a lot quicker .
it 's just ridiculous to have to travel so far . "
for joss , it meant a round trip of more than 100 miles for treatment .
lives at risk another big concern here , and in many other rural areas , is that travelling further to the bigger hospitals may take too long , putting lives at risk .
but the government 's emergency access tsar , professor sir george alberti , said the longer trip is well worth it for the right specialist care .
" i have no trouble with that concept at all because for example if my aorta is beginning to rupture i want to see a vascular surgeon , who is experienced at doing that operation .
" now if it takes 20 minutes longer to get there so be it .
and the same goes now for heart attacks , for strokes , you need to be at a specialist unit . "
he insisted the changes in emergency care are about improving safety , rather than saving money .
but the conservatives have compiled of list of 29 hospitals where they say a & e services are under threat .
they say seven out of ten trusts proposing downgrades were in deficit last year , and conclude that the process is being financially driven .
they have called for a fresh start to the process , with open consultations that point out where optimum services ca n't be paid for or staffed .

now emergency services across england are being overhauled .
richard taylor is worried that important lessons have been forgotten .
he said : " everybody will travel for high-powered difficult surgery , difficult cancer-care , major trauma .
" but they want on their doorstep facilities to see a doctor who can cope with the bread and butter , run of the mill emergencies , which are usually medical things .
" the heart attacks , the strokes the pneumonias , which come out of the blue without any warning . "
acceptable compromise he said it is about finding an acceptable compromise .
he thinks it can be done , and he gives the example of hexham in northumberland .
there is a growing range of skills that paramedics have that are enabling treatment to take place either in peoples ' homes , or at the roadside darrell jackson community paramedic the emergency care unit in hexham general hospital has doctor-led care round the clock , backed up by experienced , highly trained nurses .
it is all pristine and new , with ten beds off a central corridor , resuscitation rooms at one end , minor injuries at the other .
it is part of a £ 28 million pfi scheme , that replaced the old world war two nissan huts .
the hospital serves a small largely-rural population .
places much bigger than this are in danger of losing their a & e , so how does hexham manage ?
dr chris townsend-rose is the senior doctor in charge here .
" it is a very small hospital and if it was trying to stand alone it would n't be viable .
" it survives because it 's part of a much bigger trust .
we have two bigger sister general hospitals not too far away . "
that means it can rota in senior doctors from other hospitals , while the nurses here take on tasks previously carried out by with junior doctors .
bigger role darrell jackson , a community paramedic with the north east ambulance service , said they were also taking on a bigger role .
" there is a growing range of skills that paramedics have that are enabling treatment to take place either in peoples ' homes , or at the roadside .
" a good example is chest decompression .
we can now do that .
it avoids the problems of a collapsed lung for a patient which is life-threatening .
" previously , we either have to call a doctor out to put a chest drain in , or we 'd have to try and get the patient to the hospital as fast as we could so that they go to surgery for a drain to be fitted . "
so , emergency care is changing , but not everyone here is happy about it .
three-and-a-half years ago joss mahon broke her elbow after coming off a bike .
she had an emergency operation in hexham .
two years later she fell off a horse and broke her other arm .
hexham hospital no longer carried out emergency surgery , so she was transferred on to ashington in north tyneside .
" i think we 'd be better off living on one of the scottish islands i know , where they take you up in a helicopter , it 's a lot quicker .
it 's just ridiculous to have to travel so far . "
for joss , it meant a round trip of more than 100 miles for treatment .
lives at risk another big concern here , and in many other rural areas , is that travelling further to the bigger hospitals may take too long , putting lives at risk .
but the government 's emergency access tsar , professor sir george alberti , said the longer trip is well worth it for the right specialist care .
" i have no trouble with that concept at all because for example if my aorta is beginning to rupture i want to see a vascular surgeon , who is experienced at doing that operation .
" now if it takes 20 minutes longer to get there so be it .
and the same goes now for heart attacks , for strokes , you need to be at a specialist unit . "
he insisted the changes in emergency care are about improving safety , rather than saving money .
but the conservatives have compiled of list of 29 hospitals where they say a & e services are under threat .
they say seven out of ten trusts proposing downgrades were in deficit last year , and conclude that the process is being financially driven .
they have called for a fresh start to the process , with open consultations that point out where optimum services ca n't be paid for or staffed .

lady mccartney said she feared for her personal safety and claimed she had little money to pay for security to protect her .
" i 've felt severely upset and severely depressed through these six months , but when i lost my leg i did n't , " she said .
animal rights lady mccartney claimed her personal trainer , ben amigoni , who she insisted was " not my lover " was helping to protect her .
she gave the interview during a trip to the european parliament in brussels to deliver a petition backing calls to stop the import of cat and dog fur into the eu .
she denied that by campaigning for animal rights she was just following the lead set by sir paul 's first wife linda .

she has refused to comment on those claims and sir paul issued a statement through his lawyers stating he planned to " vigorously " contest the allegations .
lady mccartney has also announced plans to sue two newspapers over " false , damaging and immensely upsetting " claims surrounding the divorce .

what were the issues involved ?
where will smoking be banned ?
smoking in all public places like pubs , cinemas , offices , factories , public transport and so on will be banned .
when will the ban come into force ?
health secretary patricia hewitt announced the ban would be enforced from 1 july 2007 .
where will you be able to smoke ?
people will still be able to smoke outdoors , and in private homes , plus places that ms hewitt says are " like homes " , such as care institutions , army barracks , and prisons .
what about private clubs ?
the ban will apply there too .
calls for the private clubs and pubs serving food to be exempt from a ban were rejected .
what health benefits do the government expect ?
ms hewitt said the ban would protect everyone from second-hand smoke , while making it easier for smokers to quit .
the government predicts about 600,000 people will give up smoking as a result of the law change .
why did n't the government stick to its manifesto pledge to restrict the ban to pubs serving food ?
the post-election consultation on the plans for a partial ban raised enough questions - such as how you define pub food or enforce a one metre exclusion zone from a bar - that the new health secretary felt it was impractical .
there was then a well-publicised row in cabinet with ms hewitt pushing for a wider ban and former health secretary , john reid , demanding ministers stuck to the original policy of a partial ban , which he won .
the prime minister was clearly facing the prospect of a continuing row and decided it was such a controversial issue it warranted a free vote in the commons and we have ended up with the health secretary essentially opposing her own policy .
what were the winning arguments for a full ban ?
those demanding a total ban argued it was a matter of public health , particularly protecting people working in pubs and private clubs from the effects of passive smoking .
they said that having a partial ban would give private clubs an unfair economic advantage against nearby pubs .
they also said that allowing smoking in pubs which do not serve food would widen health inequalities , on the basis that many pubs in less well off areas would choose not to serve food , so their clientele and staff would suffer the effects of passive smoking .
what about those who opposed a ban ?
those wanting a partial ban claimed a full ban could hit clubs and pubs hard and was unnecessary .
they said the government was infringing civil liberties , and could lead to places such as , for example , regulars at the royal british legion being unable to smoke .
many said that it should be up to the pubs and clubs themselves to decide whether to allow smoking .
mps got a free vote - what 's that ?
a free vote is where mps are not under orders from their party leader to vote a particular way .
it is normally only on issues of conscience such as abortion or the age of consent .
tony blair argued that smoking was now in that same category .
what was the choice facing mps ?
option 1 : essentially this was labour 's manifesto pledge to introduce a ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in england , except pubs which do not serve food , and private members ' clubs .
it was the option agreed last autumn by cabinet after protracted debate .
championed by ex-health secretary john reid .
option 2 : a complete ban on smoking in all enclosed public places , including all pubs and private clubs .
this was the option the current health secretary patricia hewitt voted in favour of , after a consultation suggested option 1 might be unworkable and make health inequalities worse .
championed by health minister caroline flint .
option 3 : a complete ban on smoking in all enclosed public places , except for private clubs .
this offered another option to mps facing anger from private clubs , such as labour / conservative clubs , working men 's and golf clubs at having a ban imposed on them .
see how your mp voted how did key figures vote ?
tony blair , gordon brown and health secretary patricia hewitt all voted against the party 's manifesto pledge and supported a total ban .
the health minister responsible for smoking , caroline flint , also supported a total ban .
for the tories , sir george young , john bercow , peter bottomley and robert key were among those who voted for a total ban while party leader david cameron missed the vote because of the birth of his child but he was expected to oppose any ban on the grounds it should be a matter of personal choice .
for the liberal democrats , charles kennedy , sir menzies campbell and chris huhne voted for an outright ban , while mark oaten and lembit opik voted to oppose a ban .
what will the political fallout be for the government ?
by making it a free vote , the prime minister avoided the possibility of a government defeat but he may still face charges of presiding over a shambles and going back on manifesto pledges .
any long-term or significant political damage is unlikely .

they also said that allowing smoking in pubs which do not serve food would widen health inequalities , on the basis that many pubs in less well off areas would choose not to serve food , so their clientele and staff would suffer the effects of passive smoking .
what about those who opposed a ban ?
those wanting a partial ban claimed a full ban could hit clubs and pubs hard and was unnecessary .
they said the government was infringing civil liberties , and could lead to places such as , for example , regulars at the royal british legion being unable to smoke .
many said that it should be up to the pubs and clubs themselves to decide whether to allow smoking .
mps got a free vote - what 's that ?
a free vote is where mps are not under orders from their party leader to vote a particular way .
it is normally only on issues of conscience such as abortion or the age of consent .
tony blair argued that smoking was now in that same category .
what was the choice facing mps ?
option 1 : essentially this was labour 's manifesto pledge to introduce a ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in england , except pubs which do not serve food , and private members ' clubs .
it was the option agreed last autumn by cabinet after protracted debate .
championed by ex-health secretary john reid .
option 2 : a complete ban on smoking in all enclosed public places , including all pubs and private clubs .
this was the option the current health secretary patricia hewitt voted in favour of , after a consultation suggested option 1 might be unworkable and make health inequalities worse .
championed by health minister caroline flint .
option 3 : a complete ban on smoking in all enclosed public places , except for private clubs .
this offered another option to mps facing anger from private clubs , such as labour / conservative clubs , working men 's and golf clubs at having a ban imposed on them .
see how your mp voted how did key figures vote ?
tony blair , gordon brown and health secretary patricia hewitt all voted against the party 's manifesto pledge and supported a total ban .
the health minister responsible for smoking , caroline flint , also supported a total ban .
for the tories , sir george young , john bercow , peter bottomley and robert key were among those who voted for a total ban while party leader david cameron missed the vote because of the birth of his child but he was expected to oppose any ban on the grounds it should be a matter of personal choice .
for the liberal democrats , charles kennedy , sir menzies campbell and chris huhne voted for an outright ban , while mark oaten and lembit opik voted to oppose a ban .
what will the political fallout be for the government ?
by making it a free vote , the prime minister avoided the possibility of a government defeat but he may still face charges of presiding over a shambles and going back on manifesto pledges .
any long-term or significant political damage is unlikely .

what were the issues involved ?
where will smoking be banned ?
smoking in all public places like pubs , cinemas , offices , factories , public transport and so on will be banned .
when will the ban come into force ?
health secretary patricia hewitt announced the ban would be enforced from 1 july 2007 .
where will you be able to smoke ?
people will still be able to smoke outdoors , and in private homes , plus places that ms hewitt says are " like homes " , such as care institutions , army barracks , and prisons .
what about private clubs ?
the ban will apply there too .
calls for the private clubs and pubs serving food to be exempt from a ban were rejected .
what health benefits do the government expect ?
ms hewitt said the ban would protect everyone from second-hand smoke , while making it easier for smokers to quit .
the government predicts about 600,000 people will give up smoking as a result of the law change .
why did n't the government stick to its manifesto pledge to restrict the ban to pubs serving food ?
the post-election consultation on the plans for a partial ban raised enough questions - such as how you define pub food or enforce a one metre exclusion zone from a bar - that the new health secretary felt it was impractical .
there was then a well-publicised row in cabinet with ms hewitt pushing for a wider ban and former health secretary , john reid , demanding ministers stuck to the original policy of a partial ban , which he won .
the prime minister was clearly facing the prospect of a continuing row and decided it was such a controversial issue it warranted a free vote in the commons and we have ended up with the health secretary essentially opposing her own policy .
what were the winning arguments for a full ban ?
those demanding a total ban argued it was a matter of public health , particularly protecting people working in pubs and private clubs from the effects of passive smoking .
they said that having a partial ban would give private clubs an unfair economic advantage against nearby pubs .
they also said that allowing smoking in pubs which do not serve food would widen health inequalities , on the basis that many pubs in less well off areas would choose not to serve food , so their clientele and staff would suffer the effects of passive smoking .

what were the issues involved ?
where will smoking be banned ?
smoking in all public places like pubs , cinemas , offices , factories , public transport and so on will be banned .
when will the ban come into force ?
health secretary patricia hewitt announced the ban would be enforced from 1 july 2007 .
where will you be able to smoke ?
people will still be able to smoke outdoors , and in private homes , plus places that ms hewitt says are " like homes " , such as care institutions , army barracks , and prisons .
what about private clubs ?
the ban will apply there too .
calls for the private clubs and pubs serving food to be exempt from a ban were rejected .
what health benefits do the government expect ?
ms hewitt said the ban would protect everyone from second-hand smoke , while making it easier for smokers to quit .
the government predicts about 600,000 people will give up smoking as a result of the law change .
why did n't the government stick to its manifesto pledge to restrict the ban to pubs serving food ?
the post-election consultation on the plans for a partial ban raised enough questions - such as how you define pub food or enforce a one metre exclusion zone from a bar - that the new health secretary felt it was impractical .
there was then a well-publicised row in cabinet with ms hewitt pushing for a wider ban and former health secretary , john reid , demanding ministers stuck to the original policy of a partial ban , which he won .
the prime minister was clearly facing the prospect of a continuing row and decided it was such a controversial issue it warranted a free vote in the commons and we have ended up with the health secretary essentially opposing her own policy .
what were the winning arguments for a full ban ?
those demanding a total ban argued it was a matter of public health , particularly protecting people working in pubs and private clubs from the effects of passive smoking .
they said that having a partial ban would give private clubs an unfair economic advantage against nearby pubs .
they also said that allowing smoking in pubs which do not serve food would widen health inequalities , on the basis that many pubs in less well off areas would choose not to serve food , so their clientele and staff would suffer the effects of passive smoking .
what about those who opposed a ban ?
those wanting a partial ban claimed a full ban could hit clubs and pubs hard and was unnecessary .
they said the government was infringing civil liberties , and could lead to places such as , for example , regulars at the royal british legion being unable to smoke .
many said that it should be up to the pubs and clubs themselves to decide whether to allow smoking .
mps got a free vote - what 's that ?
a free vote is where mps are not under orders from their party leader to vote a particular way .
it is normally only on issues of conscience such as abortion or the age of consent .
tony blair argued that smoking was now in that same category .
what was the choice facing mps ?
option 1 : essentially this was labour 's manifesto pledge to introduce a ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in england , except pubs which do not serve food , and private members ' clubs .
it was the option agreed last autumn by cabinet after protracted debate .
championed by ex-health secretary john reid .
option 2 : a complete ban on smoking in all enclosed public places , including all pubs and private clubs .
this was the option the current health secretary patricia hewitt voted in favour of , after a consultation suggested option 1 might be unworkable and make health inequalities worse .
championed by health minister caroline flint .
option 3 : a complete ban on smoking in all enclosed public places , except for private clubs .
this offered another option to mps facing anger from private clubs , such as labour / conservative clubs , working men 's and golf clubs at having a ban imposed on them .
see how your mp voted how did key figures vote ?
tony blair , gordon brown and health secretary patricia hewitt all voted against the party 's manifesto pledge and supported a total ban .
the health minister responsible for smoking , caroline flint , also supported a total ban .
for the tories , sir george young , john bercow , peter bottomley and robert key were among those who voted for a total ban while party leader david cameron missed the vote because of the birth of his child but he was expected to oppose any ban on the grounds it should be a matter of personal choice .
for the liberal democrats , charles kennedy , sir menzies campbell and chris huhne voted for an outright ban , while mark oaten and lembit opik voted to oppose a ban .
what will the political fallout be for the government ?
by making it a free vote , the prime minister avoided the possibility of a government defeat but he may still face charges of presiding over a shambles and going back on manifesto pledges .
any long-term or significant political damage is unlikely .

by mark kinver science and nature reporter , bbc news mobile phones may be one of our smaller electronic possessions , but the environmental issues surrounding them are proving to be a sizeable challenge .
the sheer number of the devices sold around the globe is startling .
david mcqueen , principal analyst for handsets at informa telecoms and media , says that an estimated 940-980 million phones will be sold this year .
" next year , if growth in the market continues at about the current rate , there will be more than a billion brand new handsets sold around the world - it is a massive market , " he observes .
" if you take these figures over the years since the late 80s , when phones first came on the market , there has got to be at least five billion handsets in existence . "
global challenge dylan gwynn jones , of university of wales , aberystwyth , oversaw some preliminary research into the environmental impacts from mobile phones .
" the findings were that the ecological footprint of creating a mobile phone may be small , but the cumulative effect is quite significant on a global scale , " he told bbc news .
eco-impacts of mobiles hazardous substances energy consumption disposal as with all electronic equipment , mobile phones contain a range of substances that are harmful if the devices are not disposed of properly .
heavy metals such as mercury , lead and cadmium are present within mobile phones , especially older models , as well as brominated flame retardants in the devices ' printed circuit boards and casings .
these substances have been linked to cancers and other disorders in humans , and can have a devastating impact if they are released into the environment .
mobiles , especially older models , can contain potentially harmful substances , including : 1 & 2 .
cover and key pad - chromium , pvc , brominated flame retardants 3 .
lcd screen - liquid crystals 4 .
circuit board - lead , brominated flame retardants -lrb- pbb , pbde -rrb- , mercury 5 .
battery - cadmium , nickel , lithium problems begin if the handsets end up in landfill sites or if they are dumped illegally because this could lead to toxic substances seeping into the soil and groundwater .
the un environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- estimates that up to 50 million tonnes of waste from discarded electronic goods is generated annually , with the majority being shipped from the west to developing nations .
traditionally , much of the waste found its way to asian countries such as china and india , but tighter regulations means more and more is ending up in africa where there are few facilities to safely deal with it .
the issue was the main focus of a recent conference on the un basel convention , designed to regulate international trade in toxic waste .
walking the talk although mobile phones only make up a small percentage of the e-waste mountain , manufacturers are aware of the need to address the issue .
leading makers , including motorola , lg , sony ericsson and philips , have all implemented eco-design aspects into their production lines , including reducing the amount of hazardous substances used in their products .
nokia , the world 's largest mobile phone manufacturer , produces a handset every nine seconds .
it has decided to implement requirements set out in the eu restriction of hazardous substances -lrb- rohs -rrb- directive in all 10 of its factories around the globe . "
the first mobile phone weighed almost a kilogramme , like a brick , and you could talk for about 15 minutes " markus terho , nokia the rohs directive bans six substances -lrb- lead , cadmium , mercury , hexavalent chromium , pbb and pdbe -rrb- from products that are either made or sold in the eu .
" we have models that sell well in china or brazil that still meet the most stringent criteria set up in the eu , " says markus terho , nokia 's environmental affairs director .
" it gives us flexibility ; if there is a product that sells well in brazil and we think that it would sell well in europe , we can start selling it in europe .
" we also felt that when we saw the pieces of regulation from the eu it was quite clear that some of the other major markets would follow , so it was easier for us to implement it globally , " he told bbc news .
waste not , want not another eu law that is being rolled out across the 25-nation bloc is the waste electrical and electronic equipment -lrb- weee -rrb- directive .
it requires producers to bear the cost of the collection , recovery and disposal of the so-called " e-waste " arising from their products .
the aim is to make manufacturers design devices with fewer impacts on the environment .
nec says it has developed the first handset that uses plant-derived bioplastics .
the japanese electronics firm says the phone 's manufacturing process also emits 50 % less carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- than conventional approaches because of a shift away from fossil fuel-based power generation .
the technological evolution of the mobile handset since it first emerged on the market has led to a reduction in both materials and energy consumption , says markus terho .
" the first mobile phone weighed almost a kilogram , like a brick , and you could talk for about 15 minutes , " he recalls .
" now , we have devices that are under 100g and you can talk for eight or nine hours , while standby time is weeks , " he adds .
while the energy performance of phones has increased dramatically , the sheer number of phones has led to another problem - chargers being left plugged in sockets when not in use .
nokia chargers are still drawing about 0.1-0.5 watts when a phone is not connected , mr terho says .
although , individually , this appears to be a drop in the ocean , he admits that when there are millions of chargers being left plugged in the wall each day , it does become a big issue .
" from next year , when fully charged , the phones will no longer just say it is charged , it will say ' please unplug the charger ' , " he reveals .
all-in-one mr terho says that early nokia phones consumed tens of watts of power to make a call , whereas today 's devices are using about one watt , allowing mobiles to be more than just phones .
" if the energy efficiency of the device is much higher , then you can do so much more than just talk .
you can send e-mail , send texts , listen to music , take pictures and so forth . "
the preliminary research carried out by the university of wales , aberystwyth , seemed to confirm that there was an appetite for an ever increasing number of phone-based gadgets .
the study , commissioned by the uk 's department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- , found that about 90 % of the people questioned said that they did or would use a camera on a mobile , and 60 % would use its mp3 player .
however , the rush to get new technology on to shops ' shelves does have an impact .
in 2001 , some gains made in energy efficiency were lost .
" the reason for this is that it was the first year we were introducing 3g -lrb- third generation -rrb- phones , " explains mr terho .
" the first 3g models were not as efficient as the previous gsm ones . "
but , he added , the new technology had merged numerous functions into one phone , meaning that less energy and raw materials were consumed by manufacturers .
" convergence is a good thing from an environmental point of view because you do not need to buy a separate camera or music player ; you can have it all in one device . "
but analyst david mcqueen suggests that these developments are used by manufacturers to keep people wanting brand new phones , adding to the e-waste cycle .
" that is what the vendors want ; they want to create this market to stimulate demand for new handsets through developments in design , features and functionality , " he told bbc news .
" i do n't think there is any other consumer electronic device that is generally replaced every 12 months . "

one billion new mobiles are set to be sold in 2007 mobile phones may be one of our smaller electronic possessions , but the environmental issues surrounding them are proving to be a sizeable challenge .
the sheer number of the devices sold around the globe is startling .
david mcqueen , principal analyst for handsets at informa telecoms and media , says that an estimated 940-980 million phones will be sold this year .
" next year , if growth in the market continues at about the current rate , there will be more than a billion brand new handsets sold around the world - it is a massive market , " he observes .
" if you take these figures over the years since the late 80s , when phones first came on the market , there has got to be at least five billion handsets in existence . "
global challenge dylan gwynn jones , of university of wales , aberystwyth , oversaw some preliminary research into the environmental impacts from mobile phones .
" the findings were that the ecological footprint of creating a mobile phone may be small , but the cumulative effect is quite significant on a global scale , " he told bbc news .
eco-impacts of mobiles hazardous substances energy consumption disposal as with all electronic equipment , mobile phones contain a range of substances that are harmful if the devices are not disposed of properly .
heavy metals such as mercury , lead and cadmium are present within mobile phones , especially older models , as well as brominated flame retardants in the devices ' printed circuit boards and casings .
these substances have been linked to cancers and other disorders in humans , and can have a devastating impact if they are released into the environment .
mobiles , especially older models , can contain potentially harmful substances , including : 1 & 2 .
cover and key pad - chromium , pvc , brominated flame retardants 3 .
lcd screen - liquid crystals 4 .
circuit board - lead , brominated flame retardants -lrb- pbb , pbde -rrb- , mercury 5 .
battery - cadmium , nickel , lithium problems begin if the handsets end up in landfill sites or if they are dumped illegally because this could lead to toxic substances seeping into the soil and groundwater .
the un environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- estimates that up to 50 million tonnes of waste from discarded electronic goods is generated annually , with the majority being shipped from the west to developing nations .
traditionally , much of the waste found its way to asian countries such as china and india , but tighter regulations means more and more is ending up in africa where there are few facilities to safely deal with it .
the issue was the main focus of a recent conference on the un basel convention , designed to regulate international trade in toxic waste .
walking the talk although mobile phones only make up a small percentage of the e-waste mountain , manufacturers are aware of the need to address the issue .
leading makers , including motorola , lg , sony ericsson and philips , have all implemented eco-design aspects into their production lines , including reducing the amount of hazardous substances used in their products .
nokia , the world 's largest mobile phone manufacturer , produces a handset every nine seconds .
it has decided to implement requirements set out in the eu restriction of hazardous substances -lrb- rohs -rrb- directive in all 10 of its factories around the globe .
the first mobile phone weighed almost a kilogramme , like a brick , and you could talk for about 15 minutes markus terho , nokia the rohs directive bans six substances -lrb- lead , cadmium , mercury , hexavalent chromium , pbb and pdbe -rrb- from products that are either made or sold in the eu .
" we have models that sell well in china or brazil that still meet the most stringent criteria set up in the eu , " says markus terho , nokia 's environmental affairs director .
" it gives us flexibility ; if there is a product that sells well in brazil and we think that it would sell well in europe , we can start selling it in europe .
" we also felt that when we saw the pieces of regulation from the eu it was quite clear that some of the other major markets would follow , so it was easier for us to implement it globally , " he told bbc news .
waste not , want not another eu law that is being rolled out across the 25-nation bloc is the waste electrical and electronic equipment -lrb- weee -rrb- directive .
it requires producers to bear the cost of the collection , recovery and disposal of the so-called " e-waste " arising from their products .
the aim is to make manufacturers design devices with fewer impacts on the environment .
nec says it has developed the first handset that uses plant-derived bioplastics .
the japanese electronics firm says the phone 's manufacturing process also emits 50 % less carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- than conventional approaches because of a shift away from fossil fuel-based power generation .
the technological evolution of the mobile handset since it first emerged on the market has led to a reduction in both materials and energy consumption , says markus terho .
" the first mobile phone weighed almost a kilogram , like a brick , and you could talk for about 15 minutes , " he recalls .
" now , we have devices that are under 100g and you can talk for eight or nine hours , while standby time is weeks , " he adds .
while the energy performance of phones has increased dramatically , the sheer number of phones has led to another problem - chargers being left plugged in sockets when not in use .
nokia chargers are still drawing about 0.1-0.5 watts when a phone is not connected , mr terho says .
although , individually , this appears to be a drop in the ocean , he admits that when there are millions of chargers being left plugged in the wall each day , it does become a big issue .
" from next year , when fully charged , the phones will no longer just say it is charged , it will say ' please unplug the charger ' , " he reveals .
all-in-one mr terho says that early nokia phones consumed tens of watts of power to make a call , whereas today 's devices are using about one watt , allowing mobiles to be more than just phones .
" if the energy efficiency of the device is much higher , then you can do so much more than just talk .
you can send e-mail , send texts , listen to music , take pictures and so forth . "
mobiles have become essential for 21st century lifestyles the preliminary research carried out by the university of wales , aberystwyth , seemed to confirm that there was an appetite for an ever increasing number of phone-based gadgets .
the study , commissioned by the uk 's department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- , found that about 90 % of the people questioned said that they did or would use a camera on a mobile , and 60 % would use its mp3 player .
however , the rush to get new technology on to shops ' shelves does have an impact .
in 2001 , some gains made in energy efficiency were lost .
" the reason for this is that it was the first year we were introducing 3g -lrb- third generation -rrb- phones , " explains mr terho .
" the first 3g models were not as efficient as the previous gsm ones . "
but , he added , the new technology had merged numerous functions into one phone , meaning that less energy and raw materials were consumed by manufacturers .
" convergence is a good thing from an environmental point of view because you do not need to buy a separate camera or music player ; you can have it all in one device . "
but analyst david mcqueen suggests that these developments are used by manufacturers to keep people wanting brand new phones , adding to the e-waste cycle .
" that is what the vendors want ; they want to create this market to stimulate demand for new handsets through developments in design , features and functionality , " he told bbc news .
" i do n't think there is any other consumer electronic device that is generally replaced every 12 months . "

workmen dug up adamant -lrb- left -rrb- , 64 years after a rival froze him he survived his ordeal - so it was ironic that the one thing which eventually silenced adam adamant was poor filing .
one episode of the bbc 's answer to the avengers , which ran for two series in 1966 and 1967 , was thought lost forever - until it was discovered in 2003 , in a wrongly-labelled case .
moments like these are cherished by dick fiddy , an archivist who co-ordinates missing believed wiped at london 's national film theatre .
the project seeks out classic tv programmes which " disappeared " during an era when material was rarely recorded and tapes were often discarded .
' odd places ' " there are private collectors who buy and sell film , and because tv programmes are often on 16mm film , they 'll turn up at fairs all over the world , " explains mr fiddy .
" there are people who used to work on the shows and kept a copy .
there are foreign archives which were supposed to wipe or destroy them .
stars cilla black and bruce forsyth will be reunited with their tv past " some of them just turn up in very odd places .
there 's a well-known story of doctor who episodes turning up in a mormon church , and to this day , no-one knows how they got there .
" material is held in the wrong archive - for instance , both america and the uk had a television company called abc , and canadian television returned material from abc in the uk to abc in the us instead . "
most broadcast archives are now being digitised , and this " spring-cleaning " has yielded even more material , he says .
prosecution fears a " general amnesty " by the british film institute aims to protect people who may have made illicit copies of material over the years .
" a lot of people with material were worried about handing it back to the bbc or itv .
they were worried about prosecution .
" we will make a copy and give the original tape back to the owner - that was our deal . "
out of the trees was feared lost for almost three decades sometimes restoration is tricky , mr fiddy says , picking a programme which was screened on saturday as an example .
" out of the trees was a pilot - intended to go to a series - written by douglas adams and graham chapman , starring many of the people that would go on to be in the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy .
" it went out , but was junked almost immediately afterwards .
" it had been recorded by chapman at home on a very old-fashioned , primitive video machine .
" recently , his long-term partner , david sherlock , mentioned to me that he had this old tape , and could we play it . "
it took two years to transfer because a customised player had to be built , mr fiddy says , with the entire process filmed in case the tape " dissolves after one play " .
itv initiative another " very important find " has been a whole evening of itv 's output from 1964 - and now mr fiddy and the british film institute are also involved with itv 's raiders of the lost archive .
" stars are reunited with their tv past .
so you get bruce forsyth and you show him a bit of television that he thought was lost or he could never find , and you do the same with michael parkinson , cilla black and so on .

one episode of the bbc 's answer to the avengers , which ran for two series in 1966 and 1967 , was thought lost forever - until it was discovered in 2003 , in a wrongly-labelled case .
moments like these are cherished by dick fiddy , an archivist who co-ordinates missing believed wiped at london 's national film theatre .
the project seeks out classic tv programmes which " disappeared " during an era when material was rarely recorded and tapes were often discarded .
' odd places ' " there are private collectors who buy and sell film , and because tv programmes are often on 16mm film , they 'll turn up at fairs all over the world , " explains mr fiddy .
" there are people who used to work on the shows and kept a copy .

" material is held in the wrong archive - for instance , both america and the uk had a television company called abc , and canadian television returned material from abc in the uk to abc in the us instead . "
most broadcast archives are now being digitised , and this " spring-cleaning " has yielded even more material , he says .
prosecution fears a " general amnesty " by the british film institute aims to protect people who may have made illicit copies of material over the years .
" a lot of people with material were worried about handing it back to the bbc or itv .
they were worried about prosecution .
" we will make a copy and give the original tape back to the owner - that was our deal . "

" out of the trees was a pilot - intended to go to a series - written by douglas adams and graham chapman , starring many of the people that would go on to be in the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy .
" it went out , but was junked almost immediately afterwards .
" it had been recorded by chapman at home on a very old-fashioned , primitive video machine .
" recently , his long-term partner , david sherlock , mentioned to me that he had this old tape , and could we play it . "
it took two years to transfer because a customised player had to be built , mr fiddy says , with the entire process filmed in case the tape " dissolves after one play " .
itv initiative another " very important find " has been a whole evening of itv 's output from 1964 - and now mr fiddy and the british film institute are also involved with itv 's raiders of the lost archive .

the verdict against zhao yan was upheld by the beijing high court , defence lawyer guan anping said .
in august , zhao yan was convicted of defrauding a rural official of $ 2,500 in 2001 - a charges he denies .
he was unexpectedly acquitted of the more serious charge of leaking state secrets after the court decided there was insufficient evidence .
mr guan said the outcome of the appeal was " very regrettable " , adding that the defence team were not allowed to present witnesses or evidence .
" this case has not been handled in accordance with the law ... they did not respect the criminal law , " he added .
strained relations prosecutors had claimed mr zhao , 44 , demanded the money on the false promise he could use his connections to help a man avoid labour camp .
mr zhao 's lawyers say he was convicted solely on the testimony of one man , and say a witness who could testify on his behalf was not allowed to give evidence .
zhao yan : timeline sept 2004 : zhao yan arrested in shanghai dec 2005 : charged with leaking state secrets and fraud mar 06 : charges dropped ahead of hu jintao 's us visit may 06 : beijing prosecutors reinstate charges aug 06 : jailed for three years for fraud the case has caused tensions between china and the us , analysts say .
washington has repeatedly calling on beijing to release mr zhao , who has been held by the chinese authorities since september 2004 .
mr zhao is thought to have originally been detained in connection with a new york times report about plans by ex-president jiang zemin to retire from his top military post .
at the time , mr jiang 's intention would have been a closely guarded secret , and any leak regarded as a serious offence .

analysis by robert peston bbc business editor the eddington report on how to modernise the uk 's transport network is palpably the work of a businessman rather than an economist or a policy wonk .
business wants rapid action on transport send us your comments rod eddington 's approach is pretty practical , treating the united kingdom as if it was a giant business .
this former ba chief executive 's methodology is basically to ask what kind of returns , what kind of profits , are generated by different kinds of transport investments .
now he has absolutely no doubt that investing in transport brings significant returns .
he says , for example , that unless we tackle congestion , it will cost an extra £ 22bn in wasted time for all of us , especially business , by 2025 .
which is one of the reasons that he is such a powerful advocate of road pricing - or charging us each time we use a busy road .
benefits now , it is probably worth spelling out in more detail what he says about the financial benefits of a national scheme of pricing the use of busy roads .
read the findings eddington transport study : sir rod eddington 's advice to government -lsb- 2.1mb -rsb- most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need adobe reader download the reader here in his study , he assumes there would be a maximum charge of 80p per kilometre to travel at the busiest times .
he estimates that such a scheme would reduce congestion by 50 % below what it would otherwise have be in 2025 and would therefore reduce the requirement of big new investment in road capacity by 80 % .
and from there he deduces there would be benefits of £ 28bn every year in 2025 .
these are basically the benefits of being able to get from a to b quicker for those for whom it is most economically important .
and he says that these benefits are so big that they ca n't be ignored - although he also acknowledges the policy challenge of ensuring that poorer people are not discriminated against as and when it becomes more expensive to get around .
priorities he also makes what i would call two very general and sweeping points about where money should be directed .
first he identifies three strategic priorities : to invest in congested and growing city areas to spend money on improving links between important urban areas and to invest in improving gateways , or links between the uk and the countries with which we trade and do vital business .
ba 's former chief executive is in favour of expanding heathrow second , he says there are - on the whole - diminishing returns to investing in ever-larger projects .
the best returns , he says , come from relatively small investments designed to make our existing transport network and system function better .
things like increasing capacity on existing railway lines or bus routes .
almost the biggest possible project in his report which he specifically endorses , for example , is so-called mixed mode at heathrow - which would allow runways to be used for take off and landing .
funny that a former ba chief executive should like that .
general principles i think some people were expecting clearer recommendations from him about specific projects .
in fact , there are n't many of those .
thus in the main 60-odd page report , i could find no reference to cross rail , the new line linking east and west london so favoured by business in general .
as it happens , i think he 's mildly in favour , but that 's not explicit .
britain 's transport networks are " inefficient and disjointed " and you have to deduce that he 's in favour of heathrow and gatwick expansion from his saying that a -rrb- they are terribly important to the economic success of this country ; and b -rrb- delays to flights at both of them are the worst in the european union .
but nowhere is there a detailed grand plan for fixing heathrow .
going green the other really important point about this report is that eddington is very much a stern acolyte .
he 's totally bought into the government-commissioned report on how to reverse climate change prepared by sir nicholas stern - who gave him a bit of help with this report , as it happens .
so he says that the costs of damage to the environment , the costs of climate change , must be fully factored in to any assessment of specific transport schemes .
and he says that cars , planes , trains and so on must be charged for their relative emissions of carbon , their relative contributions to climate change .
as such , he 's another influential voice endorsing more green taxation of transport or the rationing and trading of carbon emissions from the transport sector .
which , if implemented of course , would make it more expensive for all of us to get around - the more so if it combined with congestion charging on the roads .

benefits now , it is probably worth spelling out in more detail what he says about the financial benefits of a national scheme of pricing the use of busy roads .
read the findings most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need adobe reader in his study , he assumes there would be a maximum charge of 80p per kilometre to travel at the busiest times .
he estimates that such a scheme would reduce congestion by 50 % below what it would otherwise have be in 2025 and would therefore reduce the requirement of big new investment in road capacity by 80 % .
and from there he deduces there would be benefits of £ 28bn every year in 2025 .
these are basically the benefits of being able to get from a to b quicker for those for whom it is most economically important .
and he says that these benefits are so big that they ca n't be ignored - although he also acknowledges the policy challenge of ensuring that poorer people are not discriminated against as and when it becomes more expensive to get around .
priorities he also makes what i would call two very general and sweeping points about where money should be directed .
first he identifies three strategic priorities : to invest in congested and growing city areas to spend money on improving links between important urban areas and to invest in improving gateways , or links between the uk and the countries with which we trade and do vital business .
second , he says there are - on the whole - diminishing returns to investing in ever-larger projects .
the best returns , he says , come from relatively small investments designed to make our existing transport network and system function better .
things like increasing capacity on existing railway lines or bus routes .
almost the biggest possible project in his report which he specifically endorses , for example , is so-called mixed mode at heathrow - which would allow runways to be used for take off and landing .
funny that a former ba chief executive should like that .
general principles i think some people were expecting clearer recommendations from him about specific projects .
in fact , there are n't many of those .
thus in the main 60-odd page report , i could find no reference to cross rail , the new line linking east and west london so favoured by business in general .
as it happens , i think he 's mildly in favour , but that 's not explicit .
and you have to deduce that he 's in favour of heathrow and gatwick expansion from his saying that a -rrb- they are terribly important to the economic success of this country ; and b -rrb- delays to flights at both of them are the worst in the european union .
but nowhere is there a detailed grand plan for fixing heathrow .
going green the other really important point about this report is that eddington is very much a stern acolyte .
he 's totally bought into the government-commissioned report on how to reverse climate change prepared by sir nicholas stern - who gave him a bit of help with this report , as it happens .
so he says that the costs of damage to the environment , the costs of climate change , must be fully factored in to any assessment of specific transport schemes .
and he says that cars , planes , trains and so on must be charged for their relative emissions of carbon , their relative contributions to climate change .
as such , he 's another influential voice endorsing more green taxation of transport or the rationing and trading of carbon emissions from the transport sector .
which , if implemented of course , would make it more expensive for all of us to get around - the more so if it combined with congestion charging on the roads .

breaking home ties by the us artist was first sold to cartoonist donald trachte in 1960 for $ 900 when the two were neighbours in vermont .
but mr trachte made a replica of the painting and hid the genuine piece in a cavity in his studio .
the original was discovered by mr trachte 's sons after he died last year and sold at sotheby 's in new york .
in april , david and donald trachte jnr noticed a strange gap in the wall of a room in their late father 's house .
secret switch they gave it a shove and the wall slid open to reveal the real rockwell along with other paintings .
mr trachte apparently kept the switch a secret , and his sons believe he made the copy to prevent his wife - whom he divorced in the early 1970s - from claiming the 1954 work .
" i think he just wanted to tuck these in the wall for his kids , " donald trachte jnr said at the time of the discovery .
experts and mr trachte 's family were confused by apparent inconsistencies between a version of the painting which appeared on the cover of the saturday evening post in 1954 , and the canvas they assumed was the original .
poor preservation and sloppy restoration work were blamed until the discovery of the real painting solved the mystery .
rockwell 's paintings are popular in the us .
the most paid for a piece before thursday 's auction was $ 9.2m -lrb- £ 4.7m -rrb- - in may this year .

msps , who have been conducting a review of the mccrone agreement on teaching , said it was difficult to tell if the scheme had delivered value for money .
the scheme offers higher pay , a more flexible way of working and the chance to take up extra training .
hugh henry called for a review after concerns were raised about how its impact was being measured .
holyrood 's audit committee also highlighted poor take-up of the scheme .
introduced as part of the 2001 agreement , it aims to encourage good teachers to stay in the classroom on a salary of £ 38,000 and not seek better pay in a promoted post . "
the main objective must remain to keep our best teachers in the classroom and to recognise their contribution " charlie gray cosla spokesman committee convener brian monteith told bbc radio scotland 's good morning scotland programme : " we are happy with the teachers ' agreement that came out of the mccrone report in as much as it has clearly improved working relationships in the classroom .
" what we 're saying is that this was more than just a pay deal , this was about the modernisation of teaching in the schools and we expected to be able to put , with the £ 2bn that 's been invested in it , some measure of output , some way of seeing what improvements had happened in the classroom with that investment . "
the independent msp said the committee would await a report from hm inspectors later this month and would be asking the auditor general about further work on " benchmarks " which could be introduced to rectify the situation .
mr henry , who succeeded peter peacock as minister last month , said the mccrone agreement was delivering improvements in education .
" we now see a transformed teaching profession in the last few years , " he said .
one the issue of the low take-up of the chartered teaching scheme , mr henry told bbc radio scotland : " i 'm pleased that the audit committee has identified that as an issue .
" i concluded that it was right to review the chartered teaching scheme , not to abandon it , but is it attracting the right people ?
" we need to look at how many we 're attracting in , i need to look at whether they 're coming in for the right reasons .
" is it doing what it was intended to achieve , i want that reviewed , i will have a look at it and i will be discussing it with stakeholders in the coming weeks . "
the educational institute of scotland teaching union said it would welcome improvements to the scheme .
however , a spokesman warned : " any move to dilute the chartered teacher scheme - by introducing any sort of quota on ct numbers or by moving to a situation where local authorities , rather than teachers themselves , determine the career paths for experienced teachers - would be absolutely counter to the spirit of the 21st century teaching agreement . "
charlie gray , education spokesman with the convention of scottish local authorities , said : " the main objective must remain to keep our best teachers in the classroom and to recognise their contribution , but we must also try and attract more people of this calibre and use their skills effectively to improve both learning and teaching .

msps , who have been conducting a review of the mccrone agreement on teaching , said it was difficult to tell if the scheme had delivered value for money .
the scheme offers higher pay , a more flexible way of working and the chance to take up extra training .
hugh henry called for a review after concerns were raised about how its impact was being measured .
holyrood 's audit committee also highlighted poor take-up of the scheme .
introduced as part of the 2001 agreement , it aims to encourage good teachers to stay in the classroom on a salary of £ 38,000 and not seek better pay in a promoted post .
the main objective must remain to keep our best teachers in the classroom and to recognise their contribution charlie gray cosla spokesman committee convener brian monteith told bbc radio scotland 's good morning scotland programme : " we are happy with the teachers ' agreement that came out of the mccrone report in as much as it has clearly improved working relationships in the classroom .
" what we 're saying is that this was more than just a pay deal , this was about the modernisation of teaching in the schools and we expected to be able to put , with the £ 2bn that 's been invested in it , some measure of output , some way of seeing what improvements had happened in the classroom with that investment . "
the independent msp said the committee would await a report from hm inspectors later this month and would be asking the auditor general about further work on " benchmarks " which could be introduced to rectify the situation .
mr henry , who succeeded peter peacock as minister last month , said the mccrone agreement was delivering improvements in education .
hugh henry said the mccrone deal had delivered improvements " we now see a transformed teaching profession in the last few years , " he said .
one the issue of the low take-up of the chartered teaching scheme , mr henry told bbc radio scotland : " i 'm pleased that the audit committee has identified that as an issue .
" i concluded that it was right to review the chartered teaching scheme , not to abandon it , but is it attracting the right people ?
" we need to look at how many we 're attracting in , i need to look at whether they 're coming in for the right reasons .
" is it doing what it was intended to achieve , i want that reviewed , i will have a look at it and i will be discussing it with stakeholders in the coming weeks . "
the educational institute of scotland teaching union said it would welcome improvements to the scheme .
however , a spokesman warned : " any move to dilute the chartered teacher scheme - by introducing any sort of quota on ct numbers or by moving to a situation where local authorities , rather than teachers themselves , determine the career paths for experienced teachers - would be absolutely counter to the spirit of the 21st century teaching agreement . "
charlie gray , education spokesman with the convention of scottish local authorities , said : " the main objective must remain to keep our best teachers in the classroom and to recognise their contribution , but we must also try and attract more people of this calibre and use their skills effectively to improve both learning and teaching .

sarah reid 's sister mari was fatally stabbed at her home by her estranged husband on st david 's day in 1998 .
the spotlight on the suspect campaign focuses on repeat offenders , with police saying domestic abuse was a crime which would not be tolerated .
officers will now make arrests even if victims do not want to press charges .
ms reid welcomed the campaign launched on friday as it would send " a strong message that it 's unacceptable to abuse your partner and that the police do take action " .
mari reid , 29 , a university secretary and school friend of singer cerys matthews , was stabbed to death with a kitchen knife in march 1998 , shortly after her marriage broke up .
' greatest concern ' her estranged husband was jailed for life after a murder trial .
" when my sister was harassed and threatened by her husband my automatic reaction was - you must get an injunction to stop this , " said ms reid .
" her response was - you have no idea what that would do .
" often the woman will be the only person who is unprotected , " she added .
now police are saying - we know this is happening elen pierce , welsh women 's aid " support is the key for any woman considering making the break . "
according to south wales police the reporting of domestic abuse incidents has increased over the past four years .
during 2001/2002 in swansea h division police received reports of 1,429 incidents .
that rose to 2,515 in 2004/2005 .
officers said this 57 % increase can be put down to an increase of public awareness , confidence in reporting incidents and the success of police response and multi-agency working .
chief superintendent mel jehu said : " this campaign shows the police and the overall safer swansea partnership 's commitment to tackling domestic abuse in our city .
" domestic abuse is a crime and will not be tolerated .
we will do all we can to ensure those individuals who cause the greatest concern in our society are held accountable for their actions . "
elen pierce , director of welsh women 's aid said that much had been done since the 2004 domestic violence act but a multi agency campaign was key to reducing domestic abuse .
" partnership is very much the world of today , " ms pierce added .
" if the police have an overwhelming amount of evidence collected , in the past it would be necessary for victims to press charges .
but now police are saying - we know this is happening . "
a series of posters aimed at perpetrators have been produced and a new poster with a different message will be seen in the city each month .
