" security and military measures have not managed to put islamist terrorist networks out of business , " beckstein said while presenting the twice-yearly security report put out by bavaria 's domestic intelligence agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are worried the conflict could inflame passions among muslims in europe beckstein said the current conflict between israel and hezbollah guerillas had no impact on the security of the state of bavaria , but added that the crisis could inflame people who reject the basic principle of freedom in the first place . his fears were echoed by gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister , who said he was worried about the country 's arab community reacting emotionally to events in the middle east , where israeli forces are bombing lebanon in retaliation for the seizure of two israeli soldiers by the group and the firing of rockets at northern israel .
the month-old conflict has killed more than a 1,000 people so far . " i share the huge concern that if we do n't manage to come to a solution -lrb- to the conflict -rrb- , we 're going to face a wave of radicalization , " erler said in a radio interview . no concrete threat last month , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble also warned of a hardening of radical tendencies in germany in light of the conflict . " the longer the conflict continues , the greater becomes the danger of terror actions in other countries .
that applies to germany too , " schäuble told german daily bild .
german security services are " intensively " observing an estimated 900 hezbollah supporters in the country , as well as some 300 supporters of the palestinian militant group hamas , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamist terrorists attacked london 's public transport system last year german officials have said they have not detected any concrete threat but are concerned about how the situation may develop . a german counter-terrorism official told the reuters news agency recently that the perceived threat was not limited to hezbollah , a militant shiite group , but could also come from other radicals keen to exploit the heightened tension . " it may be a motivating factor for both hezbollah supporters in europe and the general jihadi scene , which - while it is usually quite distinct from hezbollah , and they do n't actually like each other very much - might just try to get mileage out of this and exploit the general outrage of the arab street , " he said . " threat remains high " western european leaders have been on edge ever since individual militants and al qaeda leaders have cited what they see as oppression of muslims in the palestinian territories , iraq and afghanistan as justification for previous attacks on the west , including last year 's london bombings , the attacks on madrid in 2004 and the suicide hijackings in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 . beckstein pointed out on monday that though there had been no terrorist attacks in europe this year , bavaria and the rest of germany may not just provide safe harbor for terrorists but could also be potential targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorists involved in the sept .
11 attacks lived in hamburg " the threat remains unchanged and high , " beckstein said . the minister warned in particular about the threat of homegrown terrorist networks providing a " reservoir of potential suicide bombers . " germany has tightened its anti-terrorism laws and boosted surveillance of militant islamists since the sept .
11 attacks , in which three of the suicide pilots were arab students who had been living in hamburg . " islamist terror does n't stop at national borders " germany has not suffered terrorist attacks in recent years , but authorities said they have thwarted a number of plots and arrested suspects , including people they accuse of recruiting suicide bombers to carry out attacks in iraq . the head of germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- , ernst uhrlau , said recently that the thwarted attack against then iraqi prime minister ayad allawi in berlin in december 2004 showed that " in the moment where a target in germany shows up , islamist terrorists try to strike here too .

although this message will not self destruct , there is a chance you will . aachen entered the winter break in thirteenth place , and the club 's management and fans would be more than happy if that 's where they finished the season .
avoiding relegation would be more than a triumph for a team that spent 36 years in the second division . some reinforcements would help .
unfortunately , aachen spent most of the winter fruitlessly pursuing attacking midfielder mikkel thygesen from denmark , who opted for rivals mönchengladbach .
that means aachen will have to get by with the squad they have . star striker jan schlaudraff is going to bayern munich next season , and it remains to be seen how motivated he will be in aachen 's relegation .
and they also have to solve their goalkeeping problem after youngster kristian nicht failed to pull his weight .
aachen have a shot at staying up , but it wo n't be easy . the roster goal : marcus hesse , kristian nicht , stephan straub defense : mirko casper , sascha dum , nico herzig , alexander klitzpera , jeffrey leiwakabessy , moses sichon , thomas stehle midfield : yunus balaban , matthias lehmann , cristian fiel , matthias heidrich , sergio pinto , reiner plaßhenrich , laurentiu a. reghecampf strikers : marius ebbers , vedad ibisevic , szilárd nemeth , emmanuel krontiris , sascha rösler , jan schlaudraff -lrb- as of january 2007 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sports get all the news from the bundesliga the teams of the bundesliga back to the bundesliga teams overview feedback send us an e-mail .

you guessed it : they all come from the language of goethe , thomas mann and rammstein .
you know more german words than you think you do . as many parts of the world are trying to pluck out the bits of english that snuck their way into the local language , the thousands of german words that managed to do some literal traveling of their own seem safe abroad . kindergarten , for example , is one of many german words that have gotten around and been warmly received in far off places . " germans introduced kindergartens and so the word was adopted as well , " said peter lucko , a professor at the institute for anglo-american studies at the humboldt university in berlin .
" it 's kind of cute that in australia the word is shortened to just ' kinder . " ' german philosophy and science color foreign languages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kindergarten : both the word and the idea were exported from germany for a long time , german was considered the language of culture , philosophy and science , and ideas as well as the german inventions often maintained their german name when implemented abroad . the nazi period , however , tarnished the language 's reputation , particularly in the english-speaking parts of the world , leading to words of war and destruction being taken from nazi propaganda - and associated with germany . blitzkrieg is among the adopted german words that stem from the nazi period , lucko said . " the verb ' to blitz ' comes from it , which means something like ' suddenly ' or ' to ambush . '
it can be transferred to other contexts , like football or even tennis : ' he blitzed him in the first set ' or something like that , " lucko added . was ist das ?
a skylight , of course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't forget the " what do you call it " the negative overtones of the german language seem to have faded over the last half a century , though a contest sponsored by the goethe institute and the german language council showed just how popular the language of heinrich heine and günter grass has become beyond the german-swiss-austrian triangle . participants were asked to submit german words or expressions used in their language and to explain the meaning the foreign term may have taken .
some 850 , mainly positive , entries have been submitted during the contest 's first month . the most frequently submission so far is not a word but a group of words : w asistdas . " not was ist das ? , " cem dalaman enunciated , referring to the german expression " what is that ? " which has been modified in his native turkish .
" it 's said together and very quickly .
wasistdas .
that 's the turkish word for ' skylight . " ' connections made through language bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " habseligkeiten " -lrb- property -rrb- was deemed the most beautiful german word in 2004 " first of all , the contest is interesting for germans because they get to see where and how their language is used .
on the other hand , we also want to make people abroad aware that there are elements of their language that come from ours , and we can establish a connection in this way , " said katharina von ruckteschell from the goethe institute . two years ago , the goethe institute called for nominations for the most beautiful german word .
of the 40,000 submissions , half came from abroad . hamburgers : a tasty misunderstanding german words particularly tend to pop up in regions where german immigrants have settled , such as north america , eastern europe , and russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frikadell 's ideal side dish does n't come from france , but that 's a different story one of the world 's most common german words is hamburger - though in german it 's actually a misnomer .

staying up is the team 's only goal this season , but coach petrik sander knows it wo n't be easy . " we 're not strong enough to stay in the first division on our own , " sander said .
" we 'll need help from other clubs . cottbus ' strategy thus far has been to disrupt the flow of play in midfield , turning games into wrestling matches .
that 's a good way to pick up draws against stronger opposition , but it does n't bring the wins a team ultimately needs to survive in the top flight . in an effort to improve on their 17 points in 17 games , cottbus brought in creative midfielder ervin skela during the winter break , but he 's out until at least mid-february with an undisclosed blood ailment . cottbus will put up a fight , but most observers predict them to drift down into the bottom three . the roster goal : andré thoms , tomislav piplica , gerhard tremmel defense : sidney , kevin mckenna , mariusz kukielka , vragel da silva , zoltan szelesi , benjamin schöckel , mario cvitanovic midfield : timo rost , lawrence aidoo , sebastian schuppan , daniel ziebig , tomasz bandrowski , daniel gunkel , vlad munteanu , ervin skela strikers : steffen baumgart , francis kioyo , jiayi shao , stiven rivic , lars jungnickel , christof neumann , sergiu radu , marco küntzel -lrb- as of january 2007 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sports get all the news from the bundesliga the teams of the bundesliga back to the bundesliga teams overview feedback send us an e-mail .

although this message will not self destruct , there is a chance you will . aachen entered the winter break in thirteenth place , and the club 's management and fans would be more than happy if that 's where they finished the season .
avoiding relegation would be more than a triumph for a team that spent 36 years in the second division . some reinforcements would help .
unfortunately , aachen spent most of the winter fruitlessly pursuing attacking midfielder mikkel thygesen from denmark , who opted for rivals mönchengladbach .
that means aachen will have to get by with the squad they have . star striker jan schlaudraff is going to bayern munich next season , and it remains to be seen how motivated he will be in aachen 's relegation .
and they also have to solve their goalkeeping problem after youngster kristian nicht failed to pull his weight .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.08.2006 changes proposed to immigration law for skilled workers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if they 've got the skills , germany should open its doors , say politicians german politicians are demanding amendments to the country ’ s immigration law , which came into effect last year , in order to make it easier for skilled foreign workers to come to germany . when germany 's first ever immigration law came into effect in 2005 , there was widespread acknowledgement that it was far from perfect and would require amendments in the future . while german lawmakers may not be able to agree on amending the law to allow the naturalization of long-term refugees or illegal immigrants , there is considerably more consensus when it comes to improving conditions for skilled immigrants . under the current regulations , qualified potential immigrants seeking residency permits in germany often face substantial hurdles .
as a consequence , only around 900 skilled workers gained permanent residency in the country last year . " we have to make it clear who we want to have -lrb- come to germany -rrb- , " brandenburg 's interior minister and christian democratic union member jörg schönbohm told rbb-inforadio , adding that there needed to be more of an incentive for skilled workers to come to the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter wiefelspütz social democrat interior affairs spokesman dieter wiefelspütz said it was wrong , for example , to insist that applicants must earn the equivalent of at least 84,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- a year in their home countries or be turned away . " a top-notch young scientist may not yet earn more than 80,000 euros , but it should be possible to find him a job in germany , if his skills are needed , " wiefelspütz said .
" we 're thinking about lowering the threshold as far as compulsory annual earnings are concerned . " there are reports of agreement to lower the income bar to 64,000 euros in annual earnings for applicants under 35 years old. representatives from german industry said they believe it should not be any higher than 35,000 euros .
they also said they want to see other conditions for self-employed foreigners eased . investment requirements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a points system would be more flexiable , wansleben said at present , foreign entrepreneurs have to invest at least 1 million euros and create 10 new jobs in order to be entitled to stay in germany . martin wansleben , head of the german chamber of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , said as long as new jobs are created , there 's no need to be too specific about the level of investment .
wansleben said he favors a points system to help regulate the influx of skilled workers . " it could be done along the lines that already exist in canada or australia , " he said .
" points would be awarded to applicants according to their qualifications , job experience and language skills .
this would be a very flexible system that could be adapted to suit the real needs of the country .
such a system could be implemented swiftly and with no red tape at all .

now they 're calling for far-reaching policy reform to bring more skilled workers into the country .
-lrb- july 6 , 2006 -rrb- illegals in germany face similar problems as those in us with the status and protests of illegal immigrants in the united states making the headlines over the past days and weeks , the same question can be posed for germany : how do illegal immigrants fare in this country ?

although this message will not self destruct , there is a chance you will . aachen entered the winter break in thirteenth place , and the club 's management and fans would be more than happy if that 's where they finished the season .
avoiding relegation would be more than a triumph for a team that spent 36 years in the second division . some reinforcements would help .
unfortunately , aachen spent most of the winter fruitlessly pursuing attacking midfielder mikkel thygesen from denmark , who opted for rivals mönchengladbach .
that means aachen will have to get by with the squad they have . star striker jan schlaudraff is going to bayern munich next season , and it remains to be seen how motivated he will be in aachen 's relegation .
and they also have to solve their goalkeeping problem after youngster kristian nicht failed to pull his weight .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.08.2006 calls to hold children responsible for unemployed parents großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the kids have to support their parents if the latter lose their jobs ?
christian democrat secretary general ronald pofalla wants to extend children 's financial responsibility for their unemployed parents .
parents ' benefits should be reduced , he said , even if their children live elsewhere . currently , the german government assumes that young people who earn their own income , but still live at home , must help support their unemployed parents .
this is the case if a separation of finances within one household has not been clearly defined . if the parents and children share one household and financial division has not been laid out , then the parents ' unemployment payments are reduced according to the income and assets of their children . eve n u n employed n o n -relatives are affected the law even goes one step further : it also applies to unemployed siblings , uncles , aunts and non-relatives living in one household .
the age of the " child " earning the income does not matter .
even if the employed young person is younger than 25 , unemployment payments to parents or other household members are still reduced if the working " child " is living at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young working people already have a lot to juggle , critics said now , secretary general of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , ronald pofalla , said he wants to extend the law for parents and children not sharing the same household .
pofalla said that just as a working father supports his son under 25 , so should " a 30-something son support his unemployed father over 50 if he is financially able to do so . " proposal reaps criticism pofalla 's fellow cdu members , however , have criticized his demands .
marco wanderwitz , chair of the youth wing of the cdu parliamentary group , told the german daily ha n delsblatt that pofalla 's suggestion will make an entire -lrb- younger -rrb- generation think twice about whether it is worth it trying to make a living in germany . social affairs associations are also against pofalla 's proposal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.08.2006 germany on guard for terrorism linked to mideast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in berlin voice their protest to israeli attacks in lebanon and gaza german politicians have warned that the middle east crisis could inflame the muslim community in germany and increase the risk of militant islamist attacks . islamist terror remains the biggest security threat to germany and western europe , bavarian interior minister günther beckstein said monday . " security and military measures have not managed to put islamist terrorist networks out of business , " beckstein said while presenting the twice-yearly security report put out by bavaria 's domestic intelligence agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are worried the conflict could inflame passions among muslims in europe beckstein said the current conflict between israel and hezbollah guerillas had no impact on the security of the state of bavaria , but added that the crisis could inflame people who reject the basic principle of freedom in the first place . his fears were echoed by gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister , who said he was worried about the country 's arab community reacting emotionally to events in the middle east , where israeli forces are bombing lebanon in retaliation for the seizure of two israeli soldiers by the group and the firing of rockets at northern israel .
the month-old conflict has killed more than a 1,000 people so far . " i share the huge concern that if we do n't manage to come to a solution -lrb- to the conflict -rrb- , we 're going to face a wave of radicalization , " erler said in a radio interview . no concrete threat last month , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble also warned of a hardening of radical tendencies in germany in light of the conflict . " the longer the conflict continues , the greater becomes the danger of terror actions in other countries .
that applies to germany too , " schäuble told german daily bild .
german security services are " intensively " observing an estimated 900 hezbollah supporters in the country , as well as some 300 supporters of the palestinian militant group hamas , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamist terrorists attacked london 's public transport system last year german officials have said they have not detected any concrete threat but are concerned about how the situation may develop . a german counter-terrorism official told the reuters news agency recently that the perceived threat was not limited to hezbollah , a militant shiite group , but could also come from other radicals keen to exploit the heightened tension . " it may be a motivating factor for both hezbollah supporters in europe and the general jihadi scene , which - while it is usually quite distinct from hezbollah , and they do n't actually like each other very much - might just try to get mileage out of this and exploit the general outrage of the arab street , " he said . " threat remains high " western european leaders have been on edge ever since individual militants and al qaeda leaders have cited what they see as oppression of muslims in the palestinian territories , iraq and afghanistan as justification for previous attacks on the west , including last year 's london bombings , the attacks on madrid in 2004 and the suicide hijackings in the united states on sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.08.2006 calls to hold children responsible for unemployed parents großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the kids have to support their parents if the latter lose their jobs ?
christian democrat secretary general ronald pofalla wants to extend children 's financial responsibility for their unemployed parents .
parents ' benefits should be reduced , he said , even if their children live elsewhere . currently , the german government assumes that young people who earn their own income , but still live at home , must help support their unemployed parents .
this is the case if a separation of finances within one household has not been clearly defined . if the parents and children share one household and financial division has not been laid out , then the parents ' unemployment payments are reduced according to the income and assets of their children . eve n u n employed n o n -relatives are affected the law even goes one step further : it also applies to unemployed siblings , uncles , aunts and non-relatives living in one household .
the age of the " child " earning the income does not matter .
even if the employed young person is younger than 25 , unemployment payments to parents or other household members are still reduced if the working " child " is living at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young working people already have a lot to juggle , critics said now , secretary general of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , ronald pofalla , said he wants to extend the law for parents and children not sharing the same household .
pofalla said that just as a working father supports his son under 25 , so should " a 30-something son support his unemployed father over 50 if he is financially able to do so . " proposal reaps criticism pofalla 's fellow cdu members , however , have criticized his demands .
marco wanderwitz , chair of the youth wing of the cdu parliamentary group , told the german daily ha n delsblatt that pofalla 's suggestion will make an entire -lrb- younger -rrb- generation think twice about whether it is worth it trying to make a living in germany . social affairs associations are also against pofalla 's proposal . " thirty-year-olds can not begin their careers , start families , support their parents and still save for retirement , " said adolf bauer , president of the german association for social affairs .
bauer added that germany 's social welfare system , and not the family , if responsible for supporting the unemployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive protests against social welfare reforms in eastern germany in 2004 olaf scholz , managing director of the parliamentary party of the social democrats , with whom pofalla 's cdu governs in coalition , added that his party will not agree to such a change . " ... proposal must sou n d like a threat " saxony 's cdu secretary general michael kretschmer also criticized pofalla 's proposal . " given the high unemployment in this country , such a proposal must sound like a threat , especially to people in the eastern german states -lrb- where unemployment is even higher -rrb- , " he said .
kretschmer added the cdu should not demand too much of people . " the number of millionaire sons with fathers receiving unemployment benefits seems to me to be quite minimal , " kretschmer said .
he said most people in germany are stretched thin enough in trying to support their children and save more money for retirement at the same time . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german job seekers find life-changing opportunities abroad architect daniel lambart worked in africa for four years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.08.2006 germany on guard for terrorism linked to mideast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in berlin voice their protest to israeli attacks in lebanon and gaza german politicians have warned that the middle east crisis could inflame the muslim community in germany and increase the risk of militant islamist attacks . islamist terror remains the biggest security threat to germany and western europe , bavarian interior minister günther beckstein said monday . " security and military measures have not managed to put islamist terrorist networks out of business , " beckstein said while presenting the twice-yearly security report put out by bavaria 's domestic intelligence agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are worried the conflict could inflame passions among muslims in europe beckstein said the current conflict between israel and hezbollah guerillas had no impact on the security of the state of bavaria , but added that the crisis could inflame people who reject the basic principle of freedom in the first place . his fears were echoed by gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister , who said he was worried about the country 's arab community reacting emotionally to events in the middle east , where israeli forces are bombing lebanon in retaliation for the seizure of two israeli soldiers by the group and the firing of rockets at northern israel .
the month-old conflict has killed more than a 1,000 people so far . " i share the huge concern that if we do n't manage to come to a solution -lrb- to the conflict -rrb- , we 're going to face a wave of radicalization , " erler said in a radio interview . no concrete threat last month , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble also warned of a hardening of radical tendencies in germany in light of the conflict . " the longer the conflict continues , the greater becomes the danger of terror actions in other countries .
that applies to germany too , " schäuble told german daily bild .
german security services are " intensively " observing an estimated 900 hezbollah supporters in the country , as well as some 300 supporters of the palestinian militant group hamas , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamist terrorists attacked london 's public transport system last year german officials have said they have not detected any concrete threat but are concerned about how the situation may develop . a german counter-terrorism official told the reuters news agency recently that the perceived threat was not limited to hezbollah , a militant shiite group , but could also come from other radicals keen to exploit the heightened tension . " it may be a motivating factor for both hezbollah supporters in europe and the general jihadi scene , which - while it is usually quite distinct from hezbollah , and they do n't actually like each other very much - might just try to get mileage out of this and exploit the general outrage of the arab street , " he said . " threat remains high " western european leaders have been on edge ever since individual militants and al qaeda leaders have cited what they see as oppression of muslims in the palestinian territories , iraq and afghanistan as justification for previous attacks on the west , including last year 's london bombings , the attacks on madrid in 2004 and the suicide hijackings in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 . beckstein pointed out on monday that though there had been no terrorist attacks in europe this year , bavaria and the rest of germany may not just provide safe harbor for terrorists but could also be potential targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorists involved in the sept .
11 attacks lived in hamburg " the threat remains unchanged and high , " beckstein said . the minister warned in particular about the threat of homegrown terrorist networks providing a " reservoir of potential suicide bombers . " germany has tightened its anti-terrorism laws and boosted surveillance of militant islamists since the sept .
11 attacks , in which three of the suicide pilots were arab students who had been living in hamburg . " islamist terror does n't stop at national borders " germany has not suffered terrorist attacks in recent years , but authorities said they have thwarted a number of plots and arrested suspects , including people they accuse of recruiting suicide bombers to carry out attacks in iraq . the head of germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- , ernst uhrlau , said recently that the thwarted attack against then iraqi prime minister ayad allawi in berlin in december 2004 showed that " in the moment where a target in germany shows up , islamist terrorists try to strike here too . " speaking in an interview with german daily die welt , uhrlau said germany could n't afford to let down its guard when it came to the threat of terrorism . " the fact that germany did n't take part in the war against iraq plays no role , " uhrlau said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.08.2006 calls to hold children responsible for unemployed parents großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the kids have to support their parents if the latter lose their jobs ?
christian democrat secretary general ronald pofalla wants to extend children 's financial responsibility for their unemployed parents .
parents ' benefits should be reduced , he said , even if their children live elsewhere . currently , the german government assumes that young people who earn their own income , but still live at home , must help support their unemployed parents .
this is the case if a separation of finances within one household has not been clearly defined . if the parents and children share one household and financial division has not been laid out , then the parents ' unemployment payments are reduced according to the income and assets of their children . eve n u n employed n o n -relatives are affected the law even goes one step further : it also applies to unemployed siblings , uncles , aunts and non-relatives living in one household .
the age of the " child " earning the income does not matter .
even if the employed young person is younger than 25 , unemployment payments to parents or other household members are still reduced if the working " child " is living at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young working people already have a lot to juggle , critics said now , secretary general of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , ronald pofalla , said he wants to extend the law for parents and children not sharing the same household .
pofalla said that just as a working father supports his son under 25 , so should " a 30-something son support his unemployed father over 50 if he is financially able to do so . " proposal reaps criticism pofalla 's fellow cdu members , however , have criticized his demands .
marco wanderwitz , chair of the youth wing of the cdu parliamentary group , told the german daily ha n delsblatt that pofalla 's suggestion will make an entire -lrb- younger -rrb- generation think twice about whether it is worth it trying to make a living in germany . social affairs associations are also against pofalla 's proposal . " thirty-year-olds can not begin their careers , start families , support their parents and still save for retirement , " said adolf bauer , president of the german association for social affairs .
bauer added that germany 's social welfare system , and not the family , if responsible for supporting the unemployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive protests against social welfare reforms in eastern germany in 2004 olaf scholz , managing director of the parliamentary party of the social democrats , with whom pofalla 's cdu governs in coalition , added that his party will not agree to such a change . " ... proposal must sou n d like a threat " saxony 's cdu secretary general michael kretschmer also criticized pofalla 's proposal . " given the high unemployment in this country , such a proposal must sound like a threat , especially to people in the eastern german states -lrb- where unemployment is even higher -rrb- , " he said .
kretschmer added the cdu should not demand too much of people . " the number of millionaire sons with fathers receiving unemployment benefits seems to me to be quite minimal , " kretschmer said .
he said most people in germany are stretched thin enough in trying to support their children and save more money for retirement at the same time . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german job seekers find life-changing opportunities abroad architect daniel lambart worked in africa for four years .

got that ? " a hamburger originally meant a steak cooked in the traditional hamburg way , " locko said .
" in berlin it 's called bulette , in hamburg frikadelle - a fried meatball in a bun . " when americans first saw the filling treats brought over by german immigrants , they probably confused ham from hamburger with the english meat type and assumed burger referred to the rest of the meal , locko added . historical anecdotes often accompany adopted foreign words , whether they are misunderstood or their original meaning is maintained .

christian democrat secretary general ronald pofalla wants to extend children 's financial responsibility for their unemployed parents .
parents ' benefits should be reduced , he said , even if their children live elsewhere . currently , the german government assumes that young people who earn their own income , but still live at home , must help support their unemployed parents .
this is the case if a separation of finances within one household has not been clearly defined . if the parents and children share one household and financial division has not been laid out , then the parents ' unemployment payments are reduced according to the income and assets of their children . eve n u n employed n o n -relatives are affected the law even goes one step further : it also applies to unemployed siblings , uncles , aunts and non-relatives living in one household .
the age of the " child " earning the income does not matter .
even if the employed young person is younger than 25 , unemployment payments to parents or other household members are still reduced if the working " child " is living at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young working people already have a lot to juggle , critics said now , secretary general of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , ronald pofalla , said he wants to extend the law for parents and children not sharing the same household .
pofalla said that just as a working father supports his son under 25 , so should " a 30-something son support his unemployed father over 50 if he is financially able to do so . " proposal reaps criticism pofalla 's fellow cdu members , however , have criticized his demands .
marco wanderwitz , chair of the youth wing of the cdu parliamentary group , told the german daily ha n delsblatt that pofalla 's suggestion will make an entire -lrb- younger -rrb- generation think twice about whether it is worth it trying to make a living in germany . social affairs associations are also against pofalla 's proposal . " thirty-year-olds can not begin their careers , start families , support their parents and still save for retirement , " said adolf bauer , president of the german association for social affairs .
bauer added that germany 's social welfare system , and not the family , if responsible for supporting the unemployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive protests against social welfare reforms in eastern germany in 2004 olaf scholz , managing director of the parliamentary party of the social democrats , with whom pofalla 's cdu governs in coalition , added that his party will not agree to such a change . " ... proposal must sou n d like a threat " saxony 's cdu secretary general michael kretschmer also criticized pofalla 's proposal . " given the high unemployment in this country , such a proposal must sound like a threat , especially to people in the eastern german states -lrb- where unemployment is even higher -rrb- , " he said .
kretschmer added the cdu should not demand too much of people . " the number of millionaire sons with fathers receiving unemployment benefits seems to me to be quite minimal , " kretschmer said .

but are they one to bring home silverware ?
bremen top the league and have by far and away the best goal difference .
they 've hammered opponents thus far , making it look all so elegantly easy in the process .
so is there any reason not to like werder for the title ? maybe .
with mohamed zidan off to mainz and ivan klasnic undergoing a kidney transplant , bremen suddenly look uncharacteristically thin up front .
time will tell whether sweden 's markus rosenberg is an adequate replacement . top scorer miroslav klose and superlative playmaker diego should be able to pick up much of the slack .

fc nuremberg arminia bielefeld alemannia aachen bayer leverkusen sports -pipe- 08.08.2006 fsv mainz 05 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : down and out ?
mainz ended the first half of the season rock bottom of the bundesliga bottom-of-the-table mainz did the only rational thing they could in the winter break , going on a shopping spree and giving their roster a face-lift . they 've brought back mohamed zidan , who scored 9 goals for the team last year while out on loan from bremen .
he 'll join romanian marius niculae in trying to revive mainz 's toothless attack . but scoring goals is n't the club 's only problem .

fc nuremberg arminia bielefeld alemannia aachen bayer leverkusen sports -pipe- 08.08.2006 hamburg sv großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael van der vaart has not been the only one who has barely been able to look from the top three to the bottom three , that was the dismal story in hamburg in the first half of the season .
the team is the bundesliga 's biggest disappointment , and after spending the winter in 17th place , they still have loads of work to do to avoid relegation humiliation . the team has made a couple of major personel changes , firstly signing keeper frank rost away from schalke to take over from the unsatisfactory duo of stefan wächter and sascha kirschstein . secondly , they shipped luckless striker benny lauth to stuttgart and brought in ivica olic from zska moscow . otherwise hamburg are sticking with the players they have and their popular coach , thomas doll .
hamburg achieved mixed results in their january friendlies , and expect an emergency shake-up , if they fail to get out of the blocks early in 2007 . most observers think hamburg have the quality to stay up , but until they start picking up some wins , the team is facing the most serious crisis in its bundesliga history . the roster goal : frank rost , stefan wächter , sascha kirschstein defense : thimothée atouba , bastian reinhardt , mehdi mahdavikia , vincent kompany , rené klingbeil , guy demel , joris mathijsen midfield : collin benjami , nigel de jong , raphael wicky , markus karl , mario fillinger , david jarolim , piotr trochowski , oliver hampel , rafael van der vaart , alexander laas , benny feilhaber , oliver hampel strikers : paolo guerrero , ivica olic , daniel ljuboja , boubacar sanogo , besart berisha -lrb- as of january 2007 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the teams of the bundesliga back to the bundesliga overview sports get all the news from the bundesliga 9801 dw-tv europe live journal - news with in depth we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

fc nuremberg arminia bielefeld alemannia aachen bayer leverkusen sports -pipe- 08.08.2006 schalke 04 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi and co. are riding high but few think they can go the distance schalke entered the winter break at the very top of the table , tied with league-leaders bremen on points , so it 's no surprise they 've made few changes .
but why does n't anyone think they can win the league ? the answer is history .
schalke have n't won a league title in almost half a century , and along with the leverkusen , they 've developed a reputation for being often the bridesmaids but never the brides .
as bayern president franz beckenbauer put it , " they always trip themselves up . " there 's no objective reason why schalke ca n't end up on top .
they 're well-staffed at all positions and have shown this year that they can win without playing particularly well .
in addition , by shipping disgruntled keeper frank rost to hamburg , they 've gotten rid of their main personnel conflict . skepticism , of course , remains - particularly among their long-suffering fans .
but even if schalke fail once again to take home the silverware , it would take a mighty collapse to deny them a champions league spot . the roster goal : manuel neuer , dennis lamczyk defense : mathias abel , marcelo bordon , mladen krstajic , darío rodriguez , rafinha , christian pander , tim hoogland , sebastian boenisch midfield : fabian ernst , lincoln , levan kobiashvili , hamit altintop , gustavo varela , zlatan bajramovic , mesut özil , timo kunert , markus heppke strikers : gerald asamoah , halil altintop , kevin kuranyi , sören larsen , peter lövenkrands -lrb- as of january 2007 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the teams of the bundesliga back to the bundesliga teams overview sports get all the news from the bundesliga 9801 dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit tagesthema we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

fc nuremberg großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan polak and teammate ivica banovic are part of a multinational team at nuremberg nuremburg head into the season 's second half in a very respectable seventh place - they look certain to avoid relegation and could challenge for a uefa cup place . coach hans meyer has put together a disciplined team with a stingy defense that has only lost twice thus far .
the nine-time german champs ' main weakness has been in putting games away . they had a league-leading 11 draws in the latter half of 2006 . if they can convert results like that into a few more wins , nuremberg could be a darh horse to crack the league 's top five .
but coach hans meyer is preaching caution . " i 've been around long enough to know how fast things can turn around , " meyer said .
despite being 64 years old , meyer said he could imagine " hanging around for another one or two years . " meyer has a contract for life so job security is n't a problem .
but he does have one new hurdle to overcome .
starting goalkeeper raphael schäfer has decided to move to stuttgart next season , which could be a distraction as the team looks to improve on its good start . the roster goal : raphael schäfer , daniel klewer , alexander stephan defense : michael beauchamp , honorato glauber , andreas wolf , marek nikl , dean heffernan , javier horacio pinola , dominik reinhardt , thomas paulus , vratislav gresko , matthew spiranovic midfield : tomas galasek , jan polak , ivica banovic , marek mintal , jan kristiansen , marco engelhardt , jaouhar mnari , sebastian huber , petar jelic , sebastian szikal strikers : markus schroth , ivan saenko , robert vittek , chhunly pagenburg , joshua kennedy , christoph weber , leon benko , gerald sibon -lrb- as of january 2007 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the teams of the bundesliga back to the bundesliga teams overview sports get all the news from the bundesliga 9801 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

mainz ended the first half of the season rock bottom of the bundesliga bottom-of-the-table mainz did the only rational thing they could in the winter break , going on a shopping spree and giving their roster a face-lift . they 've brought back mohamed zidan , who scored 9 goals for the team last year while out on loan from bremen .
he 'll join romanian marius niculae in trying to revive mainz 's toothless attack . but scoring goals is n't the club 's only problem .
their horrendous defense , which conceded 30 goals , has led jürgen klopp to bring in a psychiatrist to toughen up his players mentally .
" we 're willing to try anything , " klopp said , " including this voluntary offer to the players . " but mainz may have dug themselves too deep a hole .
after earning only eleven points in the season 's first half , nothing short of a miraculous comeback is needed , if mainz is to spend a fourth season in germany 's top flight . the roster goal : dimo wache , daniel ischdonat , christian wetklo , jonas sela defense : nikolce noveski , christian demirtas , manuel friedrich , marco rose , nassim banouas , benjamin weigelt , ralph gunesch , leon andreasen midfield : du-ri cha , fatmir pupalovic , henning lichte , otto addo , markus feulner , fabian gerber , mimoun azaouagh , milorad pekovic , damir vrancic , mario vrancic , elkin soto strikers : petr ruman , ranisav jovanovic , conor casey , chadli amri , marius niculae , mohamed zidan -lrb- as of january 2007 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the teams of the bundesliga back to the bundesliga teams overview sports get all the news from the bundesliga 9801 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

" i 'm trying to achieve some short-term success , " röber said .
" it 's all right if -lsb- current bielefeld coach -rsb- thomas von heesen takes over in the summer . dortmund limped to ninth place in december amidst a series of squabbles between players management and the coaching staff .
röber has to change that . " i 've heard that there are some cliques , " röber said .
" they do n't have to go out for coffee with each other , but they do need to support each other on the field . " as if to illustrate how difficult röber 's job will be , striker ebi smolarek complained this january about having to take a seat on the bench for a friendly in favor of his luckless teammate nelson valdez . röber worked wonders a few years back at hertha berlin , but it 's unlikely he will be able to lead dortmund anywhere near back to its past glory . the roster goal : roman weidenfeller , bernd meier defense : christoph metzelder , markus brzenska , philipp degen , christian wörns , marc-andré kruska , dede , uwe hünemeier , marc heitmeier midfield : lars ricken , florian kringe , sebastian kehl , mehmet akgün , nuri sahin , sascha rammel , steven pienaar , martin amedick strikers : ebi smolarek , matthew amoah , sebastian tyrala , alexander frei , nelson valdez -lrb- as of january 2007 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the teams of the bundesliga back to the bundesliga teams overview sports get all the news from the bundesliga 9801 dw-tv europe live tomorrow today we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

fc nuremberg arminia bielefeld alemannia aachen bayer leverkusen sports -pipe- 08.08.2006 bayern munich großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern have not had it all their own way this season bayern begin 2007 in what 's for them a " lowly " third-place in the standings .
still , in a poll of bundesliga coaches this winter , they were the only team beside bremen given a shot of winning the league championship . bayern have yet to fully compensate fort he departure of michael ballack who left munich for english side chelsea in the summer .
nonetheless , the players think the squad is capable of earning some silverware .
" our team is strong enough to defend the league title and beat real madrid in knock-out phase of the champions league . " the team will be bolstered by players returning from injury like defender andreas görlitz .
but the squad suffered another blow in the winter break when former german national midfielder sebastian deisler announced that he was quitting the sport entirely . bayern have left the door open for him to return , but it 's highly unlikely deisler will take to the field again this season .
without him , bayern face an uphill struggle to win a title , as they have already crashed out of the german cup . and a year without a title would mean lots of squabbling in munich and the perhaps the end of coach felix magath . the roster goal : oliver kahn , michael rensing , bernd dreher defense : willy sagnol , lucio , daniel van buyten , christian lell , andreas görlitz , philipp lahm , valerien ismael midfield : martin demichelis , mehmet scholl , ali karimi , stephan fürstner , hasan salihamidzic , owen hargreaves , bastian schweinsteiger , andreas ottl , mark van bommel strikers : roy makaay , lukas podolski , claudio pizarro , roque santa cruz -lrb- as of january 2007 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the teams of the bundesliga back to the bundesliga teams overview sports get all the news from the bundesliga 9801 dw-tv europe live euromaxx - leben und kultur in europa we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

but are they one to bring home silverware ?
bremen top the league and have by far and away the best goal difference .
they 've hammered opponents thus far , making it look all so elegantly easy in the process .
so is there any reason not to like werder for the title ? maybe .
with mohamed zidan off to mainz and ivan klasnic undergoing a kidney transplant , bremen suddenly look uncharacteristically thin up front .
time will tell whether sweden 's markus rosenberg is an adequate replacement . top scorer miroslav klose and superlative playmaker diego should be able to pick up much of the slack .
but injuries to either one of them could dramatically stall werder 's goal-scoring machine . what 's more , given the amount of goals they 've notch up , they should be much further ahead in the standings .
if they can get more out of players like tim borowski , who disappointed early on , and learn how to win the close games as well as the blow-outs , there 's no reason bremen ca n't pick up their fifth league championship .
but they may regret not doing more to improve during the winter break . the roster goal : andreas reinke , tim wiese , kasper jensen , christian vander defense : petri pasanen , naldo , pierre wome , clemens fritz , patrick owomoyela , florian mohr , christian schulz midfield : frank baumann , jurica vranjes , diego , daniel jensen , torsten frings , tim borowski , peter niemeyer , strikers : miroslav klose , aaron hunt , ivan klasnic , hugo almeida , jerome polenz , markus rosenberg -lrb- as of january 2007 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the teams of the bundesliga back to the bundesliga teams overview .

" i 'm trying to achieve some short-term success , " röber said .
" it 's all right if -lsb- current bielefeld coach -rsb- thomas von heesen takes over in the summer . dortmund limped to ninth place in december amidst a series of squabbles between players management and the coaching staff .
röber has to change that . " i 've heard that there are some cliques , " röber said .
" they do n't have to go out for coffee with each other , but they do need to support each other on the field . " as if to illustrate how difficult röber 's job will be , striker ebi smolarek complained this january about having to take a seat on the bench for a friendly in favor of his luckless teammate nelson valdez . röber worked wonders a few years back at hertha berlin , but it 's unlikely he will be able to lead dortmund anywhere near back to its past glory . the roster goal : roman weidenfeller , bernd meier defense : christoph metzelder , markus brzenska , philipp degen , christian wörns , marc-andré kruska , dede , uwe hünemeier , marc heitmeier midfield : lars ricken , florian kringe , sebastian kehl , mehmet akgün , nuri sahin , sascha rammel , steven pienaar , martin amedick strikers : ebi smolarek , matthew amoah , sebastian tyrala , alexander frei , nelson valdez -lrb- as of january 2007 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the teams of the bundesliga back to the bundesliga teams overview sports get all the news from the bundesliga 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

they did that and more in 2006 , ending the year in 5th place . youngsters kevin prince-boateng and ashkan dejagah were regulars in the starting line-up , while patrick ebert and chinedu ede also made contributions .
their development , together with an excellent first season half by striker marko pantelic , has berlin dreaming of a champions league spot . playmaker yildiray bastürk is returning from injury .
if he stays fit , hertha could go on an extended run .
but hertha have a history of not living up to expectations , when the pressure is on , and their teenagers will have to prove they can keep their form over the course of a whole season .
they also need to improve on the road . having remained largely dormant on the winter transfer market , the squad is a bit too thin to crack the top three .
but with a bit of luck , this team on the rise should be able to defend its position among the bundesliga 's five best clubs . the roster goal : christian fiedler , kevin stuhr-ellegaard defense : robert müller , amadeus wallschläger , arne friedrich , dick van burik , josip simunic , dennis cagara , sofian chahed , malik fathi , christopher samba midfield : patrick ebert , gilberto , yildiray bastürk , pál dardai , andreas neuendorf , kevin-prince boateng , christian müller , patrick ebert , mineiro strikers : marko pantelic , christian gimenez , srdjan lakic , ellery cairo , ashkan dejagah , chinedu ede -lrb- as of january 2007 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the teams of the bundesliga back to the bundesliga teams overview sports get all the news from the bundesliga 9800 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

fc nuremberg arminia bielefeld alemannia aachen bayer leverkusen sports -pipe- 08.08.2006 vfl wolfsburg großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho may not see eye-to-eye with wolfsburg coach klaus augenthaler the league 's top defense was enough to secure wolfsburg twelfth place at the end of 2006 , but the offense clearly needed help after scoring a measly twelve goals . the club responded by signing julio dos santos from bayern , but he promptly got hurt and wo n't play again this season .
so the wolves turned round and took a chance on marcelinho , one of the league 's best , but most eccentric players during the past five years . the question is : which marcelinho are they getting ?
the one who was consistently among the bundesliga 's top scorers for hertha ?
or the one who was hustled out of berlin this summer for discipline problems and who failed to make a mark during a brief stint in turkey ? if marcelinho shows anything like his old form , expect the wolves to move up the table .
if not , they 'll regret the 2.7 million euro transfer fee they dished out to acquire him . the roster goal : simon jentzsch , andré lenz , patrick platins defense : alex , kevin hofland , christopher lamprecht , facundo quiroga , peter van der heyden , michael stegmayer , uwe möhrle , alexander madlung midfield : marian hristov , miroslav karhan , cedrick makiadi , hans sarpei , pablo thiam , tom van der leegte , jacek krzynowek , jonathan santana , sergej evljuskin , steve müller , kamani hill , julio dos santos , marcelinho strikers : mike hanke , rick hoogendorp , diego klimowicz , juan carlos menseguez , isaac boakye , emre öztürk , valdet rama -lrb- as of january 2007 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the teams of the bundesliga back to the bundesliga teams overview sports get all the news from the bundesliga 9800 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

schalke have n't won a league title in almost half a century , and along with the leverkusen , they 've developed a reputation for being often the bridesmaids but never the brides .

still , in a poll of bundesliga coaches this winter , they were the only team beside bremen given a shot of winning the league championship . bayern have yet to fully compensate fort he departure of michael ballack who left munich for english side chelsea in the summer .
nonetheless , the players think the squad is capable of earning some silverware .
" our team is strong enough to defend the league title and beat real madrid in knock-out phase of the champions league . " the team will be bolstered by players returning from injury like defender andreas görlitz .
but the squad suffered another blow in the winter break when former german national midfielder sebastian deisler announced that he was quitting the sport entirely . bayern have left the door open for him to return , but it 's highly unlikely deisler will take to the field again this season .
without him , bayern face an uphill struggle to win a title , as they have already crashed out of the german cup . and a year without a title would mean lots of squabbling in munich and the perhaps the end of coach felix magath . the roster goal : oliver kahn , michael rensing , bernd dreher defense : willy sagnol , lucio , daniel van buyten , christian lell , andreas görlitz , philipp lahm , valerien ismael midfield : martin demichelis , mehmet scholl , ali karimi , stephan fürstner , hasan salihamidzic , owen hargreaves , bastian schweinsteiger , andreas ottl , mark van bommel strikers : roy makaay , lukas podolski , claudio pizarro , roque santa cruz -lrb- as of january 2007 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the teams of the bundesliga back to the bundesliga teams overview sports get all the news from the bundesliga 9797 dw-tv europe live euromaxx we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

fc nuremberg arminia bielefeld alemannia aachen bayer leverkusen sports -pipe- 08.08.2006 hertha bsc berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian gimenez points the way for berlin - to fifth place at the winter break having rid themselves of primadona playmaker marcelinho last summer , all that hertha 's management asked of their young squad was to play attractive soccer .
they did that and more in 2006 , ending the year in 5th place . youngsters kevin prince-boateng and ashkan dejagah were regulars in the starting line-up , while patrick ebert and chinedu ede also made contributions .
their development , together with an excellent first season half by striker marko pantelic , has berlin dreaming of a champions league spot . playmaker yildiray bastürk is returning from injury .
if he stays fit , hertha could go on an extended run .
but hertha have a history of not living up to expectations , when the pressure is on , and their teenagers will have to prove they can keep their form over the course of a whole season .
they also need to improve on the road . having remained largely dormant on the winter transfer market , the squad is a bit too thin to crack the top three .
but with a bit of luck , this team on the rise should be able to defend its position among the bundesliga 's five best clubs . the roster goal : christian fiedler , kevin stuhr-ellegaard defense : robert müller , amadeus wallschläger , arne friedrich , dick van burik , josip simunic , dennis cagara , sofian chahed , malik fathi , christopher samba midfield : patrick ebert , gilberto , yildiray bastürk , pál dardai , andreas neuendorf , kevin-prince boateng , christian müller , patrick ebert , mineiro strikers : marko pantelic , christian gimenez , srdjan lakic , ellery cairo , ashkan dejagah , chinedu ede -lrb- as of january 2007 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the teams of the bundesliga back to the bundesliga teams overview sports get all the news from the bundesliga 9797 dw-tv europe live euromaxx we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

mainz ended the first half of the season rock bottom of the bundesliga bottom-of-the-table mainz did the only rational thing they could in the winter break , going on a shopping spree and giving their roster a face-lift . they 've brought back mohamed zidan , who scored 9 goals for the team last year while out on loan from bremen .
he 'll join romanian marius niculae in trying to revive mainz 's toothless attack . but scoring goals is n't the club 's only problem .
their horrendous defense , which conceded 30 goals , has led jürgen klopp to bring in a psychiatrist to toughen up his players mentally .
" we 're willing to try anything , " klopp said , " including this voluntary offer to the players . " but mainz may have dug themselves too deep a hole .
after earning only eleven points in the season 's first half , nothing short of a miraculous comeback is needed , if mainz is to spend a fourth season in germany 's top flight . the roster goal : dimo wache , daniel ischdonat , christian wetklo , jonas sela defense : nikolce noveski , christian demirtas , manuel friedrich , marco rose , nassim banouas , benjamin weigelt , ralph gunesch , leon andreasen midfield : du-ri cha , fatmir pupalovic , henning lichte , otto addo , markus feulner , fabian gerber , mimoun azaouagh , milorad pekovic , damir vrancic , mario vrancic , elkin soto strikers : petr ruman , ranisav jovanovic , conor casey , chadli amri , marius niculae , mohamed zidan -lrb- as of january 2007 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the teams of the bundesliga back to the bundesliga teams overview sports get all the news from the bundesliga dw-tv europe live in good shape we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

schalke have n't won a league title in almost half a century , and along with the leverkusen , they 've developed a reputation for being often the bridesmaids but never the brides .

they 're well-staffed at all positions and have shown this year that they can win without playing particularly well .
in addition , by shipping disgruntled keeper frank rost to hamburg , they 've gotten rid of their main personnel conflict . skepticism , of course , remains - particularly among their long-suffering fans .

fc nuremberg arminia bielefeld alemannia aachen bayern munich sports -pipe- 08.08.2006 bayer leverkusen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen are one of germany 's biggest teams but have struggled in recent seasons although leverkusen hibernated in sixth place , no one 's been particularly happy with this season . newly acquired strikers stefan kießling and sergej barbarez have n't lived up to expectations , and a team many tipped to contend for a champions league spot will struggle to crack the top five . bayer 's problem has been that they 're great one week and terrible the next .
in an attempt to provide more solidity , team bosses have extended the contracts of coach michael skibbe and commercial manager rüdi völler . leverkusen did n't make any major changes in the winter break .
and if they are to make a run at the top , they 'll have to do it without stopper carsten ramelow , who starts 2007 injured after a knee operation .
" he wo n't be with us for a while , " said skibbe , " and when he 's healthy , he 's a guaranteed starter . " but leverkusen were only in twelfth at this point last season and still qualified for the uefa cup so there 's no reason to count them out . the roster goal : jörg butt , rene adler , benedikt fernandez defense : juan , athirson , roque junior , fredrik stenman , ahmed madouni , jan-ingwer callsen-bracker , alexander meyer midfield : tranquillo barnetta , simon rolfes , gonzalo castro , pierre de wit , paul freier , bernd schneider , carsten ramelow , marko babic , pirmin schwegler strikers : andrej voronin , michal papadopulos , stefan kießling , sergej barbarez -lrb- as of january 2007 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the teams of the bundesliga back to the bundesliga teams overview sports get all the news from the bundesliga dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

fc nuremberg arminia bielefeld alemannia aachen bayern munich sports -pipe- 08.08.2006 bayer leverkusen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen are one of germany 's biggest teams but have struggled in recent seasons although leverkusen hibernated in sixth place , no one 's been particularly happy with this season . newly acquired strikers stefan kießling and sergej barbarez have n't lived up to expectations , and a team many tipped to contend for a champions league spot will struggle to crack the top five . bayer 's problem has been that they 're great one week and terrible the next .
in an attempt to provide more solidity , team bosses have extended the contracts of coach michael skibbe and commercial manager rüdi völler . leverkusen did n't make any major changes in the winter break .
and if they are to make a run at the top , they 'll have to do it without stopper carsten ramelow , who starts 2007 injured after a knee operation .
" he wo n't be with us for a while , " said skibbe , " and when he 's healthy , he 's a guaranteed starter . " but leverkusen were only in twelfth at this point last season and still qualified for the uefa cup so there 's no reason to count them out . the roster goal : jörg butt , rene adler , benedikt fernandez defense : juan , athirson , roque junior , fredrik stenman , ahmed madouni , jan-ingwer callsen-bracker , alexander meyer midfield : tranquillo barnetta , simon rolfes , gonzalo castro , pierre de wit , paul freier , bernd schneider , carsten ramelow , marko babic , pirmin schwegler strikers : andrej voronin , michal papadopulos , stefan kießling , sergej barbarez -lrb- as of january 2007 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the teams of the bundesliga back to the bundesliga teams overview sports get all the news from the bundesliga dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

fc nuremberg arminia bielefeld alemannia aachen bayer leverkusen sports -pipe- 08.08.2006 schalke 04 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi and co. are riding high but few think they can go the distance schalke entered the winter break at the very top of the table , tied with league-leaders bremen on points , so it 's no surprise they 've made few changes .
but why does n't anyone think they can win the league ? the answer is history .
schalke have n't won a league title in almost half a century , and along with the leverkusen , they 've developed a reputation for being often the bridesmaids but never the brides .
as bayern president franz beckenbauer put it , " they always trip themselves up . " there 's no objective reason why schalke ca n't end up on top .
they 're well-staffed at all positions and have shown this year that they can win without playing particularly well .
in addition , by shipping disgruntled keeper frank rost to hamburg , they 've gotten rid of their main personnel conflict . skepticism , of course , remains - particularly among their long-suffering fans .
but even if schalke fail once again to take home the silverware , it would take a mighty collapse to deny them a champions league spot . the roster goal : manuel neuer , dennis lamczyk defense : mathias abel , marcelo bordon , mladen krstajic , darío rodriguez , rafinha , christian pander , tim hoogland , sebastian boenisch midfield : fabian ernst , lincoln , levan kobiashvili , hamit altintop , gustavo varela , zlatan bajramovic , mesut özil , timo kunert , markus heppke strikers : gerald asamoah , halil altintop , kevin kuranyi , sören larsen , peter lövenkrands -lrb- as of january 2007 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the teams of the bundesliga back to the bundesliga teams overview sports get all the news from the bundesliga 9798 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

still , in a poll of bundesliga coaches this winter , they were the only team beside bremen given a shot of winning the league championship . bayern have yet to fully compensate fort he departure of michael ballack who left munich for english side chelsea in the summer .
nonetheless , the players think the squad is capable of earning some silverware .
" our team is strong enough to defend the league title and beat real madrid in knock-out phase of the champions league . " the team will be bolstered by players returning from injury like defender andreas görlitz .
but the squad suffered another blow in the winter break when former german national midfielder sebastian deisler announced that he was quitting the sport entirely . bayern have left the door open for him to return , but it 's highly unlikely deisler will take to the field again this season .
without him , bayern face an uphill struggle to win a title , as they have already crashed out of the german cup . and a year without a title would mean lots of squabbling in munich and the perhaps the end of coach felix magath . the roster goal : oliver kahn , michael rensing , bernd dreher defense : willy sagnol , lucio , daniel van buyten , christian lell , andreas görlitz , philipp lahm , valerien ismael midfield : martin demichelis , mehmet scholl , ali karimi , stephan fürstner , hasan salihamidzic , owen hargreaves , bastian schweinsteiger , andreas ottl , mark van bommel strikers : roy makaay , lukas podolski , claudio pizarro , roque santa cruz -lrb- as of january 2007 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the teams of the bundesliga back to the bundesliga teams overview sports get all the news from the bundesliga 9798 dw-tv europe live journal - news with business we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

fc nuremberg arminia bielefeld alemannia aachen bayer leverkusen sports -pipe- 08.08.2006 borussia dortmund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ebi smolarek has been typical of dortmund 's stop-start season after a mediocre first half , dortmund are hoping new coach jürgen röber can breath some life into a promising , but inexperienced squad . röber , whose contract only runs until the end of the season , claims he does n't mind being a stop-gap measure .
" i 'm trying to achieve some short-term success , " röber said .
" it 's all right if -lsb- current bielefeld coach -rsb- thomas von heesen takes over in the summer . dortmund limped to ninth place in december amidst a series of squabbles between players management and the coaching staff .

still , in a poll of bundesliga coaches this winter , they were the only team beside bremen given a shot of winning the league championship . bayern have yet to fully compensate fort he departure of michael ballack who left munich for english side chelsea in the summer .
nonetheless , the players think the squad is capable of earning some silverware .
" our team is strong enough to defend the league title and beat real madrid in knock-out phase of the champions league . " the team will be bolstered by players returning from injury like defender andreas görlitz .
but the squad suffered another blow in the winter break when former german national midfielder sebastian deisler announced that he was quitting the sport entirely . bayern have left the door open for him to return , but it 's highly unlikely deisler will take to the field again this season .
without him , bayern face an uphill struggle to win a title , as they have already crashed out of the german cup . and a year without a title would mean lots of squabbling in munich and the perhaps the end of coach felix magath . the roster goal : oliver kahn , michael rensing , bernd dreher defense : willy sagnol , lucio , daniel van buyten , christian lell , andreas görlitz , philipp lahm , valerien ismael midfield : martin demichelis , mehmet scholl , ali karimi , stephan fürstner , hasan salihamidzic , owen hargreaves , bastian schweinsteiger , andreas ottl , mark van bommel strikers : roy makaay , lukas podolski , claudio pizarro , roque santa cruz -lrb- as of january 2007 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the teams of the bundesliga back to the bundesliga teams overview sports get all the news from the bundesliga 9799 dw-tv europe live popxport - the german music magazine we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

mainz ended the first half of the season rock bottom of the bundesliga bottom-of-the-table mainz did the only rational thing they could in the winter break , going on a shopping spree and giving their roster a face-lift . they 've brought back mohamed zidan , who scored 9 goals for the team last year while out on loan from bremen .
he 'll join romanian marius niculae in trying to revive mainz 's toothless attack . but scoring goals is n't the club 's only problem .
their horrendous defense , which conceded 30 goals , has led jürgen klopp to bring in a psychiatrist to toughen up his players mentally .
" we 're willing to try anything , " klopp said , " including this voluntary offer to the players . " but mainz may have dug themselves too deep a hole .
after earning only eleven points in the season 's first half , nothing short of a miraculous comeback is needed , if mainz is to spend a fourth season in germany 's top flight . the roster goal : dimo wache , daniel ischdonat , christian wetklo , jonas sela defense : nikolce noveski , christian demirtas , manuel friedrich , marco rose , nassim banouas , benjamin weigelt , ralph gunesch , leon andreasen midfield : du-ri cha , fatmir pupalovic , henning lichte , otto addo , markus feulner , fabian gerber , mimoun azaouagh , milorad pekovic , damir vrancic , mario vrancic , elkin soto strikers : petr ruman , ranisav jovanovic , conor casey , chadli amri , marius niculae , mohamed zidan -lrb- as of january 2007 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the teams of the bundesliga back to the bundesliga teams overview sports get all the news from the bundesliga 9799 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

fc nuremberg arminia bielefeld alemannia aachen bayer leverkusen sports -pipe- 08.08.2006 vfl wolfsburg großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho may not see eye-to-eye with wolfsburg coach klaus augenthaler the league 's top defense was enough to secure wolfsburg twelfth place at the end of 2006 , but the offense clearly needed help after scoring a measly twelve goals . the club responded by signing julio dos santos from bayern , but he promptly got hurt and wo n't play again this season .
so the wolves turned round and took a chance on marcelinho , one of the league 's best , but most eccentric players during the past five years . the question is : which marcelinho are they getting ?

as a consequence , only around 900 skilled workers gained permanent residency in the country last year . " we have to make it clear who we want to have -lrb- come to germany -rrb- , " brandenburg 's interior minister and christian democratic union member jörg schönbohm told rbb-inforadio , adding that there needed to be more of an incentive for skilled workers to come to the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter wiefelspütz social democrat interior affairs spokesman dieter wiefelspütz said it was wrong , for example , to insist that applicants must earn the equivalent of at least 84,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- a year in their home countries or be turned away . " a top-notch young scientist may not yet earn more than 80,000 euros , but it should be possible to find him a job in germany , if his skills are needed , " wiefelspütz said .
" we 're thinking about lowering the threshold as far as compulsory annual earnings are concerned . " there are reports of agreement to lower the income bar to 64,000 euros in annual earnings for applicants under 35 years old. representatives from german industry said they believe it should not be any higher than 35,000 euros .
they also said they want to see other conditions for self-employed foreigners eased . investment requirements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a points system would be more flexiable , wansleben said at present , foreign entrepreneurs have to invest at least 1 million euros and create 10 new jobs in order to be entitled to stay in germany . martin wansleben , head of the german chamber of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , said as long as new jobs are created , there 's no need to be too specific about the level of investment .
wansleben said he favors a points system to help regulate the influx of skilled workers . " it could be done along the lines that already exist in canada or australia , " he said .
" points would be awarded to applicants according to their qualifications , job experience and language skills .
this would be a very flexible system that could be adapted to suit the real needs of the country .
such a system could be implemented swiftly and with no red tape at all .

" after the movement in the last hours i have become more confident that there can be an agreement in the course of this week and i hope that this will form the basis for a ceasefire , " he said on tuesday .
" i see a chance that we will come to a ceasefire ... and it is urgent . " upon leaving berlin on monday , steinmeier added that " the members of the un security council now appear to have agreed " on the text . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and salloukh in beirut he added that such a resolution would present a real chance to bring about a ceasefire in the region , where hundreds have been killed in the conflict over the past month . lebanon has asked for major changes to the draft because it fails to call explicitly for an immediate israeli withdrawal from south lebanon . but steinmeier said since germany was not a member of the security council , it was not in a position to make suggestions to the council in order to change the text . " the final text must be agreed by the un security council members and i think that it would not be right if a country that is not a member of the security council makes instructions in this respect . " steinmeier 's trip is scheduled to continue with a visit to jerusalem on wednesday for talks with israeli prime minister ehud olmert , foreign minister tzipi livni and defense minister amir peretz . lebanon unhappy with un resolution peretz said on monday that israel was entering " one of the most decisive stages of this war " and was determined to put an end to the hezbollah rockets being shot into israel by either military or political means , adding that " the two paths are going on in parallel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's offensive against hezbollah has lasted nearly a month the lebanese government on monday decided to send 15,000 of its troops to the south as israeli forces pull out of the territory .
beirut hoped the move would pave the way for changes to a draft un security council resolution to end the fighting . lebanon has said it was unhappy with the us-french draft resolution , demanding that it include a call for the immediate withdrawal of israel 's 10,000 troops from southern lebanon . though israel has not formally commented on the draft , a senior government official said the jewish state viewed it favourably , partly because it allowed soldiers to remain in south lebanon until an international force arrived to take over . influencing syria though steinmeier 's trip will not bring him to damascus , german foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner said the foreign minister was hoping to persuade syria , which israel accuses of arming hezbollah , to contribute to peace efforts in the region . " we should try to convince syria to show a more positive attitude , " plötner said .
" we do not know whether this is possible but it is worth trying . " syria denies arming hezbollah , saying it merely offers moral support to the radical shiite movement which israel is trying to rout from lebanon in a massive offensive launched on july 12 . steinmeier 's last visit to the region took place in late july , when a two-day trip took him to egypt , israel and the palestinian territories . un resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel gave her support to a french-us resolution on monday , merkel had a telephone conversation with siniora in which both leaders agreed that the priority now was to get a proposed united nations ' resolution on the middle east passed by the security council as quickly as possible , government spokesman thomas steg said . however , disagreements about the wording of the resolution remain . on the weekend , france and the united states agreed on a proposed text for the resolution calling for a " full cessation of hostilities " between israel and hezbollah . merkel welcomed the proposal as an important step towards ending the almost month-long conflict in lebanon . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans still reticent about involvement in mideast mission they may not have rejected outright israeli leader olmert 's wish to see german peacekeepers in the middle east , but german politicians harbor deep reservations about the controversial proposal .

" upon leaving berlin on monday , steinmeier added that " the members of the un security council now appear to have agreed " on the text . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and salloukh in beirut he added that such a resolution would present a real chance to bring about a ceasefire in the region , where hundreds have been killed in the conflict over the past month . lebanon has asked for major changes to the draft because it fails to call explicitly for an immediate israeli withdrawal from south lebanon . but steinmeier said since germany was not a member of the security council , it was not in a position to make suggestions to the council in order to change the text . " the final text must be agreed by the un security council members and i think that it would not be right if a country that is not a member of the security council makes instructions in this respect . " steinmeier 's trip is scheduled to continue with a visit to jerusalem on wednesday for talks with israeli prime minister ehud olmert , foreign minister tzipi livni and defense minister amir peretz . lebanon unhappy with un resolution peretz said on monday that israel was entering " one of the most decisive stages of this war " and was determined to put an end to the hezbollah rockets being shot into israel by either military or political means , adding that " the two paths are going on in parallel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's offensive against hezbollah has lasted nearly a month the lebanese government on monday decided to send 15,000 of its troops to the south as israeli forces pull out of the territory .
beirut hoped the move would pave the way for changes to a draft un security council resolution to end the fighting . lebanon has said it was unhappy with the us-french draft resolution , demanding that it include a call for the immediate withdrawal of israel 's 10,000 troops from southern lebanon . though israel has not formally commented on the draft , a senior government official said the jewish state viewed it favourably , partly because it allowed soldiers to remain in south lebanon until an international force arrived to take over . influencing syria though steinmeier 's trip will not bring him to damascus , german foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner said the foreign minister was hoping to persuade syria , which israel accuses of arming hezbollah , to contribute to peace efforts in the region . " we should try to convince syria to show a more positive attitude , " plötner said .
" we do not know whether this is possible but it is worth trying . " syria denies arming hezbollah , saying it merely offers moral support to the radical shiite movement which israel is trying to rout from lebanon in a massive offensive launched on july 12 . steinmeier 's last visit to the region took place in late july , when a two-day trip took him to egypt , israel and the palestinian territories . un resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel gave her support to a french-us resolution on monday , merkel had a telephone conversation with siniora in which both leaders agreed that the priority now was to get a proposed united nations ' resolution on the middle east passed by the security council as quickly as possible , government spokesman thomas steg said . however , disagreements about the wording of the resolution remain . on the weekend , france and the united states agreed on a proposed text for the resolution calling for a " full cessation of hostilities " between israel and hezbollah . merkel welcomed the proposal as an important step towards ending the almost month-long conflict in lebanon . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans still reticent about involvement in mideast mission they may not have rejected outright israeli leader olmert 's wish to see german peacekeepers in the middle east , but german politicians harbor deep reservations about the controversial proposal .

" security and military measures have not managed to put islamist terrorist networks out of business , " beckstein said while presenting the twice-yearly security report put out by bavaria 's domestic intelligence agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are worried the conflict could inflame passions among muslims in europe beckstein said the current conflict between israel and hezbollah guerillas had no impact on the security of the state of bavaria , but added that the crisis could inflame people who reject the basic principle of freedom in the first place . his fears were echoed by gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister , who said he was worried about the country 's arab community reacting emotionally to events in the middle east , where israeli forces are bombing lebanon in retaliation for the seizure of two israeli soldiers by the group and the firing of rockets at northern israel .
the month-old conflict has killed more than a 1,000 people so far . " i share the huge concern that if we do n't manage to come to a solution -lrb- to the conflict -rrb- , we 're going to face a wave of radicalization , " erler said in a radio interview . no concrete threat last month , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble also warned of a hardening of radical tendencies in germany in light of the conflict . " the longer the conflict continues , the greater becomes the danger of terror actions in other countries .
that applies to germany too , " schäuble told german daily bild .
german security services are " intensively " observing an estimated 900 hezbollah supporters in the country , as well as some 300 supporters of the palestinian militant group hamas , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamist terrorists attacked london 's public transport system last year german officials have said they have not detected any concrete threat but are concerned about how the situation may develop . a german counter-terrorism official told the reuters news agency recently that the perceived threat was not limited to hezbollah , a militant shiite group , but could also come from other radicals keen to exploit the heightened tension . " it may be a motivating factor for both hezbollah supporters in europe and the general jihadi scene , which - while it is usually quite distinct from hezbollah , and they do n't actually like each other very much - might just try to get mileage out of this and exploit the general outrage of the arab street , " he said . " threat remains high " western european leaders have been on edge ever since individual militants and al qaeda leaders have cited what they see as oppression of muslims in the palestinian territories , iraq and afghanistan as justification for previous attacks on the west , including last year 's london bombings , the attacks on madrid in 2004 and the suicide hijackings in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 . beckstein pointed out on monday that though there had been no terrorist attacks in europe this year , bavaria and the rest of germany may not just provide safe harbor for terrorists but could also be potential targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorists involved in the sept .
11 attacks lived in hamburg " the threat remains unchanged and high , " beckstein said . the minister warned in particular about the threat of homegrown terrorist networks providing a " reservoir of potential suicide bombers . " germany has tightened its anti-terrorism laws and boosted surveillance of militant islamists since the sept .
11 attacks , in which three of the suicide pilots were arab students who had been living in hamburg . " islamist terror does n't stop at national borders " germany has not suffered terrorist attacks in recent years , but authorities said they have thwarted a number of plots and arrested suspects , including people they accuse of recruiting suicide bombers to carry out attacks in iraq . the head of germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- , ernst uhrlau , said recently that the thwarted attack against then iraqi prime minister ayad allawi in berlin in december 2004 showed that " in the moment where a target in germany shows up , islamist terrorists try to strike here too . " speaking in an interview with german daily die welt , uhrlau said germany could n't afford to let down its guard when it came to the threat of terrorism . " the fact that germany did n't take part in the war against iraq plays no role , " uhrlau said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.08.2006 calls to hold children responsible for unemployed parents großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the kids have to support their parents if the latter lose their jobs ?
christian democrat secretary general ronald pofalla wants to extend children 's financial responsibility for their unemployed parents .
parents ' benefits should be reduced , he said , even if their children live elsewhere . currently , the german government assumes that young people who earn their own income , but still live at home , must help support their unemployed parents .
this is the case if a separation of finances within one household has not been clearly defined . if the parents and children share one household and financial division has not been laid out , then the parents ' unemployment payments are reduced according to the income and assets of their children . eve n u n employed n o n -relatives are affected the law even goes one step further : it also applies to unemployed siblings , uncles , aunts and non-relatives living in one household .
the age of the " child " earning the income does not matter .
even if the employed young person is younger than 25 , unemployment payments to parents or other household members are still reduced if the working " child " is living at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young working people already have a lot to juggle , critics said now , secretary general of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , ronald pofalla , said he wants to extend the law for parents and children not sharing the same household .
pofalla said that just as a working father supports his son under 25 , so should " a 30-something son support his unemployed father over 50 if he is financially able to do so . " proposal reaps criticism pofalla 's fellow cdu members , however , have criticized his demands .
marco wanderwitz , chair of the youth wing of the cdu parliamentary group , told the german daily ha n delsblatt that pofalla 's suggestion will make an entire -lrb- younger -rrb- generation think twice about whether it is worth it trying to make a living in germany . social affairs associations are also against pofalla 's proposal . " thirty-year-olds can not begin their careers , start families , support their parents and still save for retirement , " said adolf bauer , president of the german association for social affairs .
bauer added that germany 's social welfare system , and not the family , if responsible for supporting the unemployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive protests against social welfare reforms in eastern germany in 2004 olaf scholz , managing director of the parliamentary party of the social democrats , with whom pofalla 's cdu governs in coalition , added that his party will not agree to such a change . " ... proposal must sou n d like a threat " saxony 's cdu secretary general michael kretschmer also criticized pofalla 's proposal . " given the high unemployment in this country , such a proposal must sound like a threat , especially to people in the eastern german states -lrb- where unemployment is even higher -rrb- , " he said .
kretschmer added the cdu should not demand too much of people . " the number of millionaire sons with fathers receiving unemployment benefits seems to me to be quite minimal , " kretschmer said .
he said most people in germany are stretched thin enough in trying to support their children and save more money for retirement at the same time . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german job seekers find life-changing opportunities abroad architect daniel lambart worked in africa for four years .

christian democrat secretary general ronald pofalla wants to extend children 's financial responsibility for their unemployed parents .
parents ' benefits should be reduced , he said , even if their children live elsewhere . currently , the german government assumes that young people who earn their own income , but still live at home , must help support their unemployed parents .
this is the case if a separation of finances within one household has not been clearly defined . if the parents and children share one household and financial division has not been laid out , then the parents ' unemployment payments are reduced according to the income and assets of their children . eve n u n employed n o n -relatives are affected the law even goes one step further : it also applies to unemployed siblings , uncles , aunts and non-relatives living in one household .
the age of the " child " earning the income does not matter .
even if the employed young person is younger than 25 , unemployment payments to parents or other household members are still reduced if the working " child " is living at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young working people already have a lot to juggle , critics said now , secretary general of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , ronald pofalla , said he wants to extend the law for parents and children not sharing the same household .
pofalla said that just as a working father supports his son under 25 , so should " a 30-something son support his unemployed father over 50 if he is financially able to do so . " proposal reaps criticism pofalla 's fellow cdu members , however , have criticized his demands .
marco wanderwitz , chair of the youth wing of the cdu parliamentary group , told the german daily ha n delsblatt that pofalla 's suggestion will make an entire -lrb- younger -rrb- generation think twice about whether it is worth it trying to make a living in germany . social affairs associations are also against pofalla 's proposal . " thirty-year-olds can not begin their careers , start families , support their parents and still save for retirement , " said adolf bauer , president of the german association for social affairs .
bauer added that germany 's social welfare system , and not the family , if responsible for supporting the unemployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive protests against social welfare reforms in eastern germany in 2004 olaf scholz , managing director of the parliamentary party of the social democrats , with whom pofalla 's cdu governs in coalition , added that his party will not agree to such a change . " ... proposal must sou n d like a threat " saxony 's cdu secretary general michael kretschmer also criticized pofalla 's proposal . " given the high unemployment in this country , such a proposal must sound like a threat , especially to people in the eastern german states -lrb- where unemployment is even higher -rrb- , " he said .
kretschmer added the cdu should not demand too much of people . " the number of millionaire sons with fathers receiving unemployment benefits seems to me to be quite minimal , " kretschmer said .

although this message will not self destruct , there is a chance you will . aachen entered the winter break in thirteenth place , and the club 's management and fans would be more than happy if that 's where they finished the season .
avoiding relegation would be more than a triumph for a team that spent 36 years in the second division . some reinforcements would help .
unfortunately , aachen spent most of the winter fruitlessly pursuing attacking midfielder mikkel thygesen from denmark , who opted for rivals mönchengladbach .
that means aachen will have to get by with the squad they have . star striker jan schlaudraff is going to bayern munich next season , and it remains to be seen how motivated he will be in aachen 's relegation .
and they also have to solve their goalkeeping problem after youngster kristian nicht failed to pull his weight .
aachen have a shot at staying up , but it wo n't be easy . the roster goal : marcus hesse , kristian nicht , stephan straub defense : mirko casper , sascha dum , nico herzig , alexander klitzpera , jeffrey leiwakabessy , moses sichon , thomas stehle midfield : yunus balaban , matthias lehmann , cristian fiel , matthias heidrich , sergio pinto , reiner plaßhenrich , laurentiu a. reghecampf strikers : marius ebbers , vedad ibisevic , szilárd nemeth , emmanuel krontiris , sascha rösler , jan schlaudraff -lrb- as of january 2007 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sports get all the news from the bundesliga the teams of the bundesliga back to the bundesliga teams overview feedback send us an e-mail .

some 850 , mainly positive , entries have been submitted during the contest 's first month . the most frequently submission so far is not a word but a group of words : w asistdas . " not was ist das ? , " cem dalaman enunciated , referring to the german expression " what is that ? " which has been modified in his native turkish .

" in berlin it 's called bulette , in hamburg frikadelle - a fried meatball in a bun . " when americans first saw the filling treats brought over by german immigrants , they probably confused ham from hamburger with the english meat type and assumed burger referred to the rest of the meal , locko added . historical anecdotes often accompany adopted foreign words , whether they are misunderstood or their original meaning is maintained .

11 attacks lived in hamburg " the threat remains unchanged and high , " beckstein said . the minister warned in particular about the threat of homegrown terrorist networks providing a " reservoir of potential suicide bombers . " germany has tightened its anti-terrorism laws and boosted surveillance of militant islamists since the sept .

" islamist terror does n't stop at national borders " germany has not suffered terrorist attacks in recent years , but authorities said they have thwarted a number of plots and arrested suspects , including people they accuse of recruiting suicide bombers to carry out attacks in iraq . the head of germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- , ernst uhrlau , said recently that the thwarted attack against then iraqi prime minister ayad allawi in berlin in december 2004 showed that " in the moment where a target in germany shows up , islamist terrorists try to strike here too . " speaking in an interview with german daily die welt , uhrlau said germany could n't afford to let down its guard when it came to the threat of terrorism . " the fact that germany did n't take part in the war against iraq plays no role , " uhrlau said .

as a consequence , only around 900 skilled workers gained permanent residency in the country last year . " we have to make it clear who we want to have -lrb- come to germany -rrb- , " brandenburg 's interior minister and christian democratic union member jörg schönbohm told rbb-inforadio , adding that there needed to be more of an incentive for skilled workers to come to the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter wiefelspütz social democrat interior affairs spokesman dieter wiefelspütz said it was wrong , for example , to insist that applicants must earn the equivalent of at least 84,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- a year in their home countries or be turned away . " a top-notch young scientist may not yet earn more than 80,000 euros , but it should be possible to find him a job in germany , if his skills are needed , " wiefelspütz said .
" we 're thinking about lowering the threshold as far as compulsory annual earnings are concerned . " there are reports of agreement to lower the income bar to 64,000 euros in annual earnings for applicants under 35 years old. representatives from german industry said they believe it should not be any higher than 35,000 euros .
they also said they want to see other conditions for self-employed foreigners eased . investment requirements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a points system would be more flexiable , wansleben said at present , foreign entrepreneurs have to invest at least 1 million euros and create 10 new jobs in order to be entitled to stay in germany . martin wansleben , head of the german chamber of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , said as long as new jobs are created , there 's no need to be too specific about the level of investment .
wansleben said he favors a points system to help regulate the influx of skilled workers . " it could be done along the lines that already exist in canada or australia , " he said .
" points would be awarded to applicants according to their qualifications , job experience and language skills .
this would be a very flexible system that could be adapted to suit the real needs of the country .
such a system could be implemented swiftly and with no red tape at all .

now they 're calling for far-reaching policy reform to bring more skilled workers into the country .
-lrb- july 6 , 2006 -rrb- illegals in germany face similar problems as those in us with the status and protests of illegal immigrants in the united states making the headlines over the past days and weeks , the same question can be posed for germany : how do illegal immigrants fare in this country ?

then , a year ago , it finally put a new immigration law on the books which seems to have achieved very little .

staying up is the team 's only goal this season , but coach petrik sander knows it wo n't be easy . " we 're not strong enough to stay in the first division on our own , " sander said .
" we 'll need help from other clubs . cottbus ' strategy thus far has been to disrupt the flow of play in midfield , turning games into wrestling matches .
that 's a good way to pick up draws against stronger opposition , but it does n't bring the wins a team ultimately needs to survive in the top flight . in an effort to improve on their 17 points in 17 games , cottbus brought in creative midfielder ervin skela during the winter break , but he 's out until at least mid-february with an undisclosed blood ailment . cottbus will put up a fight , but most observers predict them to drift down into the bottom three . the roster goal : andré thoms , tomislav piplica , gerhard tremmel defense : sidney , kevin mckenna , mariusz kukielka , vragel da silva , zoltan szelesi , benjamin schöckel , mario cvitanovic midfield : timo rost , lawrence aidoo , sebastian schuppan , daniel ziebig , tomasz bandrowski , daniel gunkel , vlad munteanu , ervin skela strikers : steffen baumgart , francis kioyo , jiayi shao , stiven rivic , lars jungnickel , christof neumann , sergiu radu , marco küntzel -lrb- as of january 2007 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sports get all the news from the bundesliga the teams of the bundesliga back to the bundesliga teams overview feedback send us an e-mail .

" security and military measures have not managed to put islamist terrorist networks out of business , " beckstein said while presenting the twice-yearly security report put out by bavaria 's domestic intelligence agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are worried the conflict could inflame passions among muslims in europe beckstein said the current conflict between israel and hezbollah guerillas had no impact on the security of the state of bavaria , but added that the crisis could inflame people who reject the basic principle of freedom in the first place . his fears were echoed by gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister , who said he was worried about the country 's arab community reacting emotionally to events in the middle east , where israeli forces are bombing lebanon in retaliation for the seizure of two israeli soldiers by the group and the firing of rockets at northern israel .
the month-old conflict has killed more than a 1,000 people so far . " i share the huge concern that if we do n't manage to come to a solution -lrb- to the conflict -rrb- , we 're going to face a wave of radicalization , " erler said in a radio interview . no concrete threat last month , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble also warned of a hardening of radical tendencies in germany in light of the conflict .

fc nuremberg arminia bielefeld alemannia aachen bayer leverkusen sports -pipe- 08.08.2006 energie cottbus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goals from daniel gunkel have helped tiny cottbus in their fight for bundesliga survival it was n't often pretty , but cottbus ended the first half of the season in fifteenth place - out of the relegation zone .
staying up is the team 's only goal this season , but coach petrik sander knows it wo n't be easy . " we 're not strong enough to stay in the first division on our own , " sander said .
" we 'll need help from other clubs . cottbus ' strategy thus far has been to disrupt the flow of play in midfield , turning games into wrestling matches .
that 's a good way to pick up draws against stronger opposition , but it does n't bring the wins a team ultimately needs to survive in the top flight . in an effort to improve on their 17 points in 17 games , cottbus brought in creative midfielder ervin skela during the winter break , but he 's out until at least mid-february with an undisclosed blood ailment . cottbus will put up a fight , but most observers predict them to drift down into the bottom three . the roster goal : andré thoms , tomislav piplica , gerhard tremmel defense : sidney , kevin mckenna , mariusz kukielka , vragel da silva , zoltan szelesi , benjamin schöckel , mario cvitanovic midfield : timo rost , lawrence aidoo , sebastian schuppan , daniel ziebig , tomasz bandrowski , daniel gunkel , vlad munteanu , ervin skela strikers : steffen baumgart , francis kioyo , jiayi shao , stiven rivic , lars jungnickel , christof neumann , sergiu radu , marco küntzel -lrb- as of january 2007 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sports get all the news from the bundesliga the teams of the bundesliga back to the bundesliga teams overview feedback send us an e-mail .

staying up is the team 's only goal this season , but coach petrik sander knows it wo n't be easy . " we 're not strong enough to stay in the first division on our own , " sander said .
" we 'll need help from other clubs . cottbus ' strategy thus far has been to disrupt the flow of play in midfield , turning games into wrestling matches .

but many locals are still reluctant to leave the area , preferring to stay with their crops and belongings .
officials have ordered the evacuation of thousands of people living near the volcano , in central albay province .
the alert level was raised to four , the second highest level , as experts warned that an eruption could take place soon .
mayon has been rumbling since february and started emitting lava in mid-july .
it is the most active volcano in the philippines , having erupted about 50 times in the past 400 years .
' everybody out ' early on monday , six successive volcanic blasts occurred within 40 minutes , sending ash up to 800m into the air .
by midday , mayon 's peak was covered in a dark cloud of volcanic material rising high above the crater .
officials say residents will be forced to leave overnight the activity continued , with the volcano emitting ash at least three times , according to a vulcanologist who spoke to the associated press news agency .
meanwhile the evacuation from the area is gathering pace .
tens of thousands of villagers were taken by truck to 34 specially-created evacuation centres on monday , but others still remain in the danger zone .
" yesterday we evacuated 60 % , but the evacuation is still ongoing until we take everybody out , " albay governor fernando gonzales told reuters news agency on tuesday .
in total , 35,000 people will be moved from the area , and an additional 20,000 will be evacuated in the case of a major eruption .
staying despite the mandatory evacuations , some villagers would rather stay on their farms , with their livestock and belongings .
farmer bienvenido belga told the french news agency afp : " we need the money .

even some of those who have been evacuated insist on returning regularly .

defence secretary avelino cruz said that police would forcibly remove those who refused to leave .
" if we have to carry them out bodily into the truck and get them out of the zone , the task force mayon will do that , " he told a press conference on monday .

mayon is one of 22 active volcanoes in the philippines .
its most violent eruption , in 1814 , killed more than 1,200 people .
another 75 people died during an eruption in 1993 .

speculation about a possible move for the company had led to a sharp jump in its share price on monday .
monstermob said talks were at a " preliminary stage " and there was no certainty that an offer would be made .
the company , which has recently been expanding into china , has had a tough year , seeing its share price fall 90 % .
monstermob began to expand overseas to offset tougher controls in the uk .
in april , it warned that uk profits would be lower this year , because of new regulatory controls restricting subscription services .
however , in early july , its shares sank after it said that changes to subscription services operated via china mobile could have a " substantial " short-term impact on its revenues in the country .

a 24-year-old man died of the virus in november 2003 , xinhua news agency said .
this could make china the first country to report a bird flu fatality in this outbreak .
previously , three deaths in vietnam in late 2003 were the first .
china 's announcement raises questions about the extent of the disease in china , and its monitoring .
the case may not have been spotted because china and other asian countries were at the time more concerned about severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- .
the man was tested for sars but tested negative , according to a letter from chinese researchers who first raised the case in a letter to a us medical journal .
criticised the scientists , who published the letter in the new england journal of medicine in june , said the man became ill in november 2003 and later died .
china 's health ministry had confirmed the findings in laboratory tests that it carried out with the world health organisation , xinhua said on tuesday .
the agency did not say who the man was or where he lived .
china had previously said that its first bird flu casualty was a poultry worker who died in november 2005 .
since the latest outbreak began in 2003 , more than 130 people have died around the world , mainly in south east asia , from the h5n1 virus .
scientists fear that the virus could mutate into a form where it could pass easily from human to human , potentially triggering a pandemic .
china was widely criticised by the international community for initially covering up the sars epidemic in late 2002 and early 2003 .
sars killed nearly 800 people worldwide in the months after it emerged , and experts suggested china 's failure to come clean about the extent of the outbreak contributed to the spread of the disease .

the £ 1m painting was made by francis hayman just after the 1740 publication of richardson 's most famous work , his debut novel pamela or virtue rewarded .
it shows the writer with a book in his hand accompanied by members of his second family .
the tate was able to buy the painting with a grant from the art fund .
the painting - entitled samuel richardson , the novelist -lrb- 1689-1761 -rrb- , seated surrounded by his second family - is considered one of the most important " conversation piece " paintings , a type of informal portrait in which sitters would appear in domestic or private settings .
" this portrait captures a fascinating moment in the novelist 's life just after he had become an overnight sensation , " said david barrie , director of the art fund , which gave a total of £ 150,000 towards the purchase of the picture .
" the portrait is undoubtedly one of hayman 's best , and after decades in a private collection the art fund is delighted that it can at last be appreciated by the public . "
richardson 's novel pamela or virtue rewarded tells the story of a young maid who refuses the advances of a richer householder until he agrees to marry her .
it was so loved by the mid-18th century middle-classes that it went through five print runs within a year of publication .
it also influenced some of the biggest names in literature , such as jane austen and jean-jacques rousseau .

the £ 1m painting was made by francis hayman just after the 1740 publication of richardson 's most famous work , his debut novel pamela or virtue rewarded .
it shows the writer with a book in his hand accompanied by members of his second family .
the tate was able to buy the painting with a grant from the art fund .
the painting - entitled samuel richardson , the novelist -lrb- 1689-1761 -rrb- , seated surrounded by his second family - is considered one of the most important " conversation piece " paintings , a type of informal portrait in which sitters would appear in domestic or private settings .
" this portrait captures a fascinating moment in the novelist 's life just after he had become an overnight sensation , " said david barrie , director of the art fund , which gave a total of £ 150,000 towards the purchase of the picture .
" the portrait is undoubtedly one of hayman 's best , and after decades in a private collection the art fund is delighted that it can at last be appreciated by the public . "
richardson 's novel pamela or virtue rewarded tells the story of a young maid who refuses the advances of a richer householder until he agrees to marry her .
it was so loved by the mid-18th century middle-classes that it went through five print runs within a year of publication .
it also influenced some of the biggest names in literature , such as jane austen and jean-jacques rousseau .

mr cameron said work pressure meant he was unable to ride every day , but he cycled on wednesdays as it " gets me going " for prime minister 's questions .
and , referring to the fact that a car used to follow him with his briefcase , he stressed that he now cycles alone .
he wants more firms to consider ecological issues and said more workers would cycle if bosses provided showers .
he added : " everybody should be thinking : ' what can i do to help with the issue of climate change ? " '
hybrid car the tory leader , who has been keen to establish his green credentials , found himself accused of hypocrisy earlier this year for cycling while being followed by a car carrying his briefcase .

if i have papers to carry they go in a pannier on my bike and i can promise you that will never happen again . "
but mr cameron said he was not going to give up his official chauffeur because of the number of places he had to visit and people he had to see in his job .
however , he said that he was considering the use of a hybrid car operated partly by battery and conventional engine instead of the conventional government-issued model .
in a separate interview , former conservative leader michael howard has told how he predicted a decade ago that mr cameron would become prime minister .
mr cameron worked as mr howard 's special adviser when he was home secretary in the 1990s .
mr howard told the times : " i did say to people then , as his mother reminded me a few weeks ago ... , that i 'd told quite a lot of people that in so far as it was possible to say of anyone in their twenties - which it is n't really , because luck plays such a huge part in life - ' he is going to become prime minister ' , i would say it of david cameron .

mr cameron said work pressure meant he was unable to ride every day , but he cycled on wednesdays as it " gets me going " for prime minister 's questions .
and , referring to the fact that a car used to follow him with his briefcase , he stressed that he now cycles alone .
he wants more firms to consider ecological issues and said more workers would cycle if bosses provided showers .
he added : " everybody should be thinking : ' what can i do to help with the issue of climate change ? " '
hybrid car the tory leader , who has been keen to establish his green credentials , found himself accused of hypocrisy earlier this year for cycling while being followed by a car carrying his briefcase .
but in an interview on climate change for bbc radio 1 newsbeat , mr cameron said it was " not true at all " that a car followed him to work .
i did say to people then , as his mother reminded me a few weeks ago ... ' he is going to become prime minister ' michael howard on david cameron he said : " that did happen once or twice and i 've now made sure that it will never happen again ...
i have a huge amount of paperwork that i carry to work with me .
" i now make sure that when i do bicycle on a wednesday , no car follows me .
if i have papers to carry they go in a pannier on my bike and i can promise you that will never happen again . "
but mr cameron said he was not going to give up his official chauffeur because of the number of places he had to visit and people he had to see in his job .
however , he said that he was considering the use of a hybrid car operated partly by battery and conventional engine instead of the conventional government-issued model .
in a separate interview , former conservative leader michael howard has told how he predicted a decade ago that mr cameron would become prime minister .
mr cameron worked as mr howard 's special adviser when he was home secretary in the 1990s .
mr howard told the times : " i did say to people then , as his mother reminded me a few weeks ago ... , that i 'd told quite a lot of people that in so far as it was possible to say of anyone in their twenties - which it is n't really , because luck plays such a huge part in life - ' he is going to become prime minister ' , i would say it of david cameron .

renowned as an excellent business brain , the 49-year-old started out as an accountant at british steel .
he rose through positions on the boards of a number of companies , including tm and grand metropolitan , until he became head of food service giant compass group .
he joined granada in 1991 and was appointed to the board a year later .
in 1996 he became chief executive - and when , in 1997 , granada entered into a joint venture with carlton - the other major itv franchise-holder - to begin digital broadcasting , mr allen was selected to be a director for the new company .
unfortunately , the resulting operation , on digital , would end up as one of the biggest failures in british television history .
meanwhile , in july 2000 , granada merged with mr allen 's previous company compass , and he became head of the short-lived new company , granada compass , which demerged less than a year later .
mr allen remained head of what is now granada plc , overseeing the painful and protracted end of on digital - now rebranded as itv digital .
however , the on digital project had proved that a significant tie-up between granada and carlton could be achieved - and it was mr allen who steered the full merger between the two to form itv plc in february 2004 .
revenue plummet it was as a result of this that mr allen became chief executive of the new company , which put him in control of operations of all the company 's channels .
indeed , he has overseen the launch of much of the broadcaster 's venture into multi-channel programming , most recently with itv4 going live in november 2005 and itv play in march 2006 .
celebrity wrestling was a ratings flop - and eventually cancelled but it has been the problems surrounding the flagship channel , itv1 , that have ultimately seen him leave .
despite his business brain , feeling in the media industry is that he has been unable to inject the channel with the required entertainment and fresh programming needed to hold viewers in the multi-channel world .
this has been reflected in the channel 's ratings .
its share of viewers has declined from 28.5 percent in july 2000 to a record low of 16.3 percent last month .
and over the same period , advertising revenue has plummeted from £ 2bn in 2000 to predicted £ 1.3bn next year .
