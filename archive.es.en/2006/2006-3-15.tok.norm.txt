program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.03.2006 strikers in for the long haul as arbitrators brought in großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesting strikers in stuttgart say they are n't ready to back down , even after six weeks as germany 's public-sector strikes mark week six , arbitration is now being seen as a possible way to bring the sides closer .
in stuttgart , at the heart of the labor action , union members say they 're determined to win . it is about symbolism , many analysts say , this protracted work stoppage by the verdi services union that has closed kindergartens , interrupted hospital services and kept garbage collection trucks idle inside city garages .
while that symbolism may be about union power and unions ' futures , there 's another powerful symbol of germany 's biggest public-service stoppage in 14 years : trash . these days , it 's everywhere in stuttgart , this usually pristine city in southwestern germany , capital of the state of baden-württemberg and one of the principle cities of the historical region of swabia .
the swabians , as the stereotype goes , are not only extraordinarily thrifty ; they can be fanatically clean .
but six weeks into this public-sector strike , clean is hard to come by , at least in the public sphere .
the city is swimming in garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many explosions of trash around stuttgart trashcans have been filled to overflowing , and often , packed to the breaking point , have dumped their contents in a messy circle around them .
stuttgart 's street curbs have become the resting place for a rising tide of daily detritus : mcdonald 's cups , candy wrappers , cigarette packs and old napkins . " i 've had enough of this strike , " said doris laphardt , 46 , as she stepped over a pile of discarded paper in a central square .
" this place is beginning to look like new york . " arbitration but there could be a glimmer of hope in the strike that until just yesterday , showed no signs of coming to an end .
municipal authorities in baden-württemberg and the verdi services union said on tuesday they were bringing in outside arbitrators to try to bring the union and public-sector employers , who up until now have dug in their heels in negotiations , come closer together . the two sides have agreed to bring in two arbitrators , the head of aok health insurance for baden-württemberg , roland sing , and a former president of the state 's administrative court , claus messner .
the two began familiarizing themselves with the material on wednesday morning and talks were planned to begin between representatives from verdi and employers during the afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike hq in stuttgart employers want to extend the working week from 38.5 hour to 40 hour without an increase in pay .
they say they need to ease up pressure on state coffers - personnel costs consume almost one-half of state budgets - and argue that many other civil servants , not to mention the private sector , already work 40-hour weeks .
employers argue that they are asking public-sector employees to only add 18 minutes to each working day . verdi counters that increasing the working week will cut employees ' take home pay , which would further erode already weak consumer spending in germany .
the union also says the change could endanger some 250,000 jobs in the public sector . verdi , along with most of germany 's trade unions , has been struggling with falling membership and an increasing feeling among the populace that it is obstructionist and out of step with the realities of today 's labor environment .
while 18 minutes a day does not seem like much to ask to help prop up struggling state governments , observers say the strike has become a test of verdi 's ability to maintain its strong role in germany 's centralized bargaining system , which is increasingly under attack . " it 's really about symbolism .
the real point is whether they are forced to capitulate on this very symbolic point , " deutsche bank economist stefan schneider told reuters . noisy determination on a cold but clear tuesday morning outside the verdi headquarters in stuttgart , thoughts of capitulation were not in evidence .
at 10:30 a.m. , amid blowing whistles and rattling noisemakers , a group of some 2,500 strikers began a protest march .
carrying banners , waving red verdi flags and chanting slogans , the strikers made their way from the union building through central stuttgart to a large square where speakers encouraged them to stay the fight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching through stuttgart there did not seem to be need for much encouraging .
in fact , the mood was almost festive , now six weeks into the labor action .
instead of slumped shoulders and resigned expressions , the crowd was marked by a strong sense of determination to fight the fight for as long as it takes . " up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the result we want , and we can go on for a while .
we have enough money in the strike fund , " said bärbel illi , 47 , an employee of verdi 's stuttgart branch . heike fischer , 48 , is a child-care worker who said that although the media liked to focus on the trouble some parents have had since their child-care facilities have been closed , most parents were behind the action . " of course , all of us would rather not be on strike anymore , we would like to be with the children , " she said .
" but we ca n't stop now if we want to have a future .
we ca n't give up now , and i 'm ready to continue until we are successful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confrontation between garbage workers replacement workers many of the striking sanitation workers wore signs that said " strikebreakers , hands off our trash ! " referring to the private firms that have been hired to take care of some of the city 's sanitation problems .
those two worlds collided briefly after the main rally when a group of striking workers came across a private garbage truck waiting at a stoplight .
the group stepped in front of the vehicle and , yelling at the three men sitting inside , tried to cover the truck 's windshield with posters to prevent it from driving on .
police had to disperse the group . verdi officials say that besides showing its strength , the strike has mobilized union members , many of whom had begun wondering why they were bothering to pay their monthly dues . " it was important that the unions do something , " said jürgen rönsch , 37 , a cemetery maintenance worker .
" in my department there was hardly anyone left in the union , since it never did anything .
but now people have been coming back . " public support waning while the strike has given verdi a boost in popularity among those in sectors it represents , it is less clear how the strike will play out among the populace at large .
public disgruntlement about the labor action is growing .
in a poll last week carried out for the zdf public television channel , 61 percent of germans opposed the protests , up six percentage points from a poll conducted on feb .
17 . union members in stuttgart claim the local media is overplaying the dissatisfaction felt by stuttgart residents about the strike and the resulting piles of trash .
but on tuesday , most residents asked said they thought it was time for the striking workers to get back on the job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tired of the trash some were split on the issue , like 50-year-old maria schlom , who said she was tired of the trash but trying to remain open : " i can sympathize if the fear is really about losing jobs , " she said .
" but if it 's just about working 40 hours in a week , that i ca n't understand . " others supported the action in the beginning but felt that the union had taken things too far .
" when they 're blocking entrances so trucks ca n't spread grit on icy streets or private firms ca n't take away garbage , that 's too much , " said agathe hiller , 48 . but karl-heinz walther , 62 , who was visiting stuttgart with his wife for the day , said he was fully behind the striking workers .
" the employers just have to give a little and it 'd be all over . " when told that his response was a minority one , his wife chimed in : " maybe that 's because we 're not from stuttgart .

in stuttgart , at the heart of the labor action , union members say they 're determined to win . it is about symbolism , many analysts say , this protracted work stoppage by the verdi services union that has closed kindergartens , interrupted hospital services and kept garbage collection trucks idle inside city garages .
while that symbolism may be about union power and unions ' futures , there 's another powerful symbol of germany 's biggest public-service stoppage in 14 years : trash . these days , it 's everywhere in stuttgart , this usually pristine city in southwestern germany , capital of the state of baden-württemberg and one of the principle cities of the historical region of swabia .
the swabians , as the stereotype goes , are not only extraordinarily thrifty ; they can be fanatically clean .
but six weeks into this public-sector strike , clean is hard to come by , at least in the public sphere .
the city is swimming in garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many explosions of trash around stuttgart trashcans have been filled to overflowing , and often , packed to the breaking point , have dumped their contents in a messy circle around them .
stuttgart 's street curbs have become the resting place for a rising tide of daily detritus : mcdonald 's cups , candy wrappers , cigarette packs and old napkins . " i 've had enough of this strike , " said doris laphardt , 46 , as she stepped over a pile of discarded paper in a central square .
" this place is beginning to look like new york . " arbitration but there could be a glimmer of hope in the strike that until just yesterday , showed no signs of coming to an end .
municipal authorities in baden-württemberg and the verdi services union said on tuesday they were bringing in outside arbitrators to try to bring the union and public-sector employers , who up until now have dug in their heels in negotiations , come closer together . the two sides have agreed to bring in two arbitrators , the head of aok health insurance for baden-württemberg , roland sing , and a former president of the state 's administrative court , claus messner .
the two began familiarizing themselves with the material on wednesday morning and talks were planned to begin between representatives from verdi and employers during the afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike hq in stuttgart employers want to extend the working week from 38.5 hour to 40 hour without an increase in pay .
they say they need to ease up pressure on state coffers - personnel costs consume almost one-half of state budgets - and argue that many other civil servants , not to mention the private sector , already work 40-hour weeks .
employers argue that they are asking public-sector employees to only add 18 minutes to each working day . verdi counters that increasing the working week will cut employees ' take home pay , which would further erode already weak consumer spending in germany .
the union also says the change could endanger some 250,000 jobs in the public sector . verdi , along with most of germany 's trade unions , has been struggling with falling membership and an increasing feeling among the populace that it is obstructionist and out of step with the realities of today 's labor environment .
while 18 minutes a day does not seem like much to ask to help prop up struggling state governments , observers say the strike has become a test of verdi 's ability to maintain its strong role in germany 's centralized bargaining system , which is increasingly under attack . " it 's really about symbolism .
the real point is whether they are forced to capitulate on this very symbolic point , " deutsche bank economist stefan schneider told reuters . noisy determination on a cold but clear tuesday morning outside the verdi headquarters in stuttgart , thoughts of capitulation were not in evidence .
at 10:30 a.m. , amid blowing whistles and rattling noisemakers , a group of some 2,500 strikers began a protest march .
carrying banners , waving red verdi flags and chanting slogans , the strikers made their way from the union building through central stuttgart to a large square where speakers encouraged them to stay the fight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching through stuttgart there did not seem to be need for much encouraging .
in fact , the mood was almost festive , now six weeks into the labor action .
instead of slumped shoulders and resigned expressions , the crowd was marked by a strong sense of determination to fight the fight for as long as it takes . " up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the result we want , and we can go on for a while .
we have enough money in the strike fund , " said bärbel illi , 47 , an employee of verdi 's stuttgart branch . heike fischer , 48 , is a child-care worker who said that although the media liked to focus on the trouble some parents have had since their child-care facilities have been closed , most parents were behind the action . " of course , all of us would rather not be on strike anymore , we would like to be with the children , " she said .
" but we ca n't stop now if we want to have a future .
we ca n't give up now , and i 'm ready to continue until we are successful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confrontation between garbage workers replacement workers many of the striking sanitation workers wore signs that said " strikebreakers , hands off our trash ! " referring to the private firms that have been hired to take care of some of the city 's sanitation problems .
those two worlds collided briefly after the main rally when a group of striking workers came across a private garbage truck waiting at a stoplight .
the group stepped in front of the vehicle and , yelling at the three men sitting inside , tried to cover the truck 's windshield with posters to prevent it from driving on .
police had to disperse the group . verdi officials say that besides showing its strength , the strike has mobilized union members , many of whom had begun wondering why they were bothering to pay their monthly dues . " it was important that the unions do something , " said jürgen rönsch , 37 , a cemetery maintenance worker .
" in my department there was hardly anyone left in the union , since it never did anything .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.03.2006 strikers in for the long haul as arbitrators brought in großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesting strikers in stuttgart say they are n't ready to back down , even after six weeks as germany 's public-sector strikes mark week six , arbitration is now being seen as a possible way to bring the sides closer .
in stuttgart , at the heart of the labor action , union members say they 're determined to win . it is about symbolism , many analysts say , this protracted work stoppage by the verdi services union that has closed kindergartens , interrupted hospital services and kept garbage collection trucks idle inside city garages .
while that symbolism may be about union power and unions ' futures , there 's another powerful symbol of germany 's biggest public-service stoppage in 14 years : trash . these days , it 's everywhere in stuttgart , this usually pristine city in southwestern germany , capital of the state of baden-württemberg and one of the principle cities of the historical region of swabia .
the swabians , as the stereotype goes , are not only extraordinarily thrifty ; they can be fanatically clean .
but six weeks into this public-sector strike , clean is hard to come by , at least in the public sphere .
the city is swimming in garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many explosions of trash around stuttgart trashcans have been filled to overflowing , and often , packed to the breaking point , have dumped their contents in a messy circle around them .
stuttgart 's street curbs have become the resting place for a rising tide of daily detritus : mcdonald 's cups , candy wrappers , cigarette packs and old napkins . " i 've had enough of this strike , " said doris laphardt , 46 , as she stepped over a pile of discarded paper in a central square .
" this place is beginning to look like new york . " arbitration but there could be a glimmer of hope in the strike that until just yesterday , showed no signs of coming to an end .
municipal authorities in baden-württemberg and the verdi services union said on tuesday they were bringing in outside arbitrators to try to bring the union and public-sector employers , who up until now have dug in their heels in negotiations , come closer together . the two sides have agreed to bring in two arbitrators , the head of aok health insurance for baden-württemberg , roland sing , and a former president of the state 's administrative court , claus messner .
the two began familiarizing themselves with the material on wednesday morning and talks were planned to begin between representatives from verdi and employers during the afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike hq in stuttgart employers want to extend the working week from 38.5 hour to 40 hour without an increase in pay .
they say they need to ease up pressure on state coffers - personnel costs consume almost one-half of state budgets - and argue that many other civil servants , not to mention the private sector , already work 40-hour weeks .
employers argue that they are asking public-sector employees to only add 18 minutes to each working day . verdi counters that increasing the working week will cut employees ' take home pay , which would further erode already weak consumer spending in germany .
the union also says the change could endanger some 250,000 jobs in the public sector . verdi , along with most of germany 's trade unions , has been struggling with falling membership and an increasing feeling among the populace that it is obstructionist and out of step with the realities of today 's labor environment .
while 18 minutes a day does not seem like much to ask to help prop up struggling state governments , observers say the strike has become a test of verdi 's ability to maintain its strong role in germany 's centralized bargaining system , which is increasingly under attack . " it 's really about symbolism .
the real point is whether they are forced to capitulate on this very symbolic point , " deutsche bank economist stefan schneider told reuters . noisy determination on a cold but clear tuesday morning outside the verdi headquarters in stuttgart , thoughts of capitulation were not in evidence .
at 10:30 a.m. , amid blowing whistles and rattling noisemakers , a group of some 2,500 strikers began a protest march .
carrying banners , waving red verdi flags and chanting slogans , the strikers made their way from the union building through central stuttgart to a large square where speakers encouraged them to stay the fight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching through stuttgart there did not seem to be need for much encouraging .
in fact , the mood was almost festive , now six weeks into the labor action .
instead of slumped shoulders and resigned expressions , the crowd was marked by a strong sense of determination to fight the fight for as long as it takes . " up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the result we want , and we can go on for a while .
we have enough money in the strike fund , " said bärbel illi , 47 , an employee of verdi 's stuttgart branch . heike fischer , 48 , is a child-care worker who said that although the media liked to focus on the trouble some parents have had since their child-care facilities have been closed , most parents were behind the action . " of course , all of us would rather not be on strike anymore , we would like to be with the children , " she said .
" but we ca n't stop now if we want to have a future .
we ca n't give up now , and i 'm ready to continue until we are successful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confrontation between garbage workers replacement workers many of the striking sanitation workers wore signs that said " strikebreakers , hands off our trash ! " referring to the private firms that have been hired to take care of some of the city 's sanitation problems .
those two worlds collided briefly after the main rally when a group of striking workers came across a private garbage truck waiting at a stoplight .
the group stepped in front of the vehicle and , yelling at the three men sitting inside , tried to cover the truck 's windshield with posters to prevent it from driving on .
police had to disperse the group . verdi officials say that besides showing its strength , the strike has mobilized union members , many of whom had begun wondering why they were bothering to pay their monthly dues . " it was important that the unions do something , " said jürgen rönsch , 37 , a cemetery maintenance worker .
" in my department there was hardly anyone left in the union , since it never did anything .
but now people have been coming back . " public support waning while the strike has given verdi a boost in popularity among those in sectors it represents , it is less clear how the strike will play out among the populace at large .

but according to political economist friedrich schneider , that 's partly due to hypocritical western governments , who do n't want to be team players . an international conference on combating the financing of terrorism is being held in the hague on wednesday and thursday .
dw-world.de spoke with political economist friedrich schneider from johannes kepler university in linz , austria , about the chances of successfully cutting off terrorists ' money supplies and the obstacles preventing faster progress . dw-world.de : professor schneider , seven years ago , the g7 countries initiated the international financial action task force , or fatf .
it is meant to fight terrorist financing , but so far , the force has n't had any significant success .
why are these international efforts failing ? friedrich schneider : on an international level , next to nothing is being done .
it 's that simple .
every country is doing its own work , there 's no international cooperation that 's working .
data is n't even being exchanged in the aftermath of a terrorist attack , let alone cooperation among various secret services . why is n't there more cooperation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban leader mullah omar : the us funded the taliban in the past i 'll give you an example .
if the french finance covert operations in africa through their secret service , or if the germans pay ransom in iraq , do you think these governments want to publicly acknowledge this kind of financing ?
and good and evil can quickly change , as we know .
just take the taliban in afghanistan , for example .
for a long time , they were financed by the united states when the us was against russia .
this is where hypocrisy comes in .
if governments do n't want to expose their own covert financing operations , then they ca n't have any real interest in more efficient uncovering of money laundering . to what extent is money laundering linked to the financing of terrorism ?
money laundering is mostly associated with the drugs trade and human trafficking . terrorist financing is , broadly speaking , the financing of terrorist operations , and not all that much money is needed .
the september 2001 attacks cost just $ 500,000 , including flight training .
much more money is needed for the maintenance of terrorist bases .
to pull together this kind of funding , money from the drugs trade , illegal diamond trading or kidnapping is laundered . so is it mainly through the tracking of money laundering that sources of terrorist financing can be found ?
with money from legal operations … … you ca n't prevent the financing of terrorism .
there are donations to terrorist organizations - hamas for example .
it gets a lot of money from arab states for hospitals and schools , but where there 's no clear dividing line to show whether the money was used for terrorist acts . what can really be done to stop terrorist financing then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug money often ends up financing terrorist cells the first question is , whether there is any desire to effectively fight money laundering .
only then can you really combat terrorist financing .
to fight money laundering , you need international cooperation , and a task force that is just as agile and flexible as the terrorists .
this would also require the regulations prohibiting data exchange to be loosened , but so far that has n't happened . what can financial service providers do to stop terrorist financing ? that depends firstly on the extent to which they want to do business with people from the mafia or other organized criminals .
investigators rely on insider information from banks which often have little knowledge about how clean certain transactions are . as a political economist , you 've called for combating poverty and promoting democratic values as a way to stop terrorism .
why ? simply put , people who earn money do n't throw bombs .
if i have a house , a car , and a well-paid job , i 'm less likely to become a terrorist .
there will always be fanatics who resort to terrorism regardless of their income , but they 'll be far fewer .
it 's about drying up part of the basis for terrorism , which is why fighting poverty is such an effective strategy .
in addition to this , we have to fight religious extremism , and deal with religious differences in a peaceful manner , but there have only been half-hearted attempts at that so far . that does n't sound very optimistic .
how do you think the financing of terrorism will develop in the future ? unfortunately , i think europe will have to experience two or three more attacks before we start to work more closely together . martin schrader interviewed friedrich schneider send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops the agenda in warsaw as the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member council of europe enters its last day in warsaw , talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime .

but according to political economist friedrich schneider , that 's partly due to hypocritical western governments , who do n't want to be team players . an international conference on combating the financing of terrorism is being held in the hague on wednesday and thursday .
dw-world.de spoke with political economist friedrich schneider from johannes kepler university in linz , austria , about the chances of successfully cutting off terrorists ' money supplies and the obstacles preventing faster progress . dw-world.de : professor schneider , seven years ago , the g7 countries initiated the international financial action task force , or fatf .
it is meant to fight terrorist financing , but so far , the force has n't had any significant success .
why are these international efforts failing ? friedrich schneider : on an international level , next to nothing is being done .
it 's that simple .
every country is doing its own work , there 's no international cooperation that 's working .
data is n't even being exchanged in the aftermath of a terrorist attack , let alone cooperation among various secret services . why is n't there more cooperation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban leader mullah omar : the us funded the taliban in the past i 'll give you an example .

the company would first wait and see whether a rival offer materialized from a third party , merck 's supervisory board chief wilhelm simson told a news conference in berlin . but merck was not prepared to pay so high a price that a purchase could only be financed by selling off bits of schering , simson added . the price of 77 euros per share was " fair " , he continued .
and simson said he hoped to meet with schering 's chairman hubertus erlen later on tuesday . " our main aim is to enter into negotiations with schering , " he said .
" we need both sides to come to the table .

work-life balance gets boost in germany the dumbing down of germany gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids germany -pipe- 15.03.2006 politicians discuss pension cuts for childless germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's younger generation is dwindling new statistics confirming the declining birth rate have sent germany in to a state of panic , amid a growing consensus that pensions should be increased for people with children and reduced for those without . " people without children should either receive a reduced pension or pay more into pension schemes , " said norbert geis from the csu . johann eekhoff , director of the cologne institute for economic policy said a reform of the pension system was long overdue . " people without children should never have been admitted into pension schemes because these only work when they are financed by subsequent generations , " he said in an interview with mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" their pensions should be cut by 50 percent . " cdu politician elisabeth winkelmeier-becker agreed , pointing out that working parents are financially disadvantaged compared to their childless peers .
" in the long-term , we need to consider awarding people without children lower pensions , " she said . chilling statistics the headline in germany 's mass-selling daily bild on wednesday said it all : " baby shock : we germans are dying out , " the paper screamed . that might sound a bit extreme , but latest figures , based on data collected at the federal statistics office , released on tuesday have sent a chill among demographers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more babies were born in post-war year of 1946 than today last year , only some 676,000 children were born in germany according to german daily die welt which cited forecasts by the federal statistics office .

in january this year , the ruling grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats decided to make it easier for working mothers to continue being part of the labor market , increasing tax breaks on child care , encourage setting up full-day schools and making kindergartens cost-free . chancellor merkel 's family affairs minister , ursula von der leyen , a mother of seven children herself , has also been credited with pushing for family-friendly policies and ensuring that the issue remains in the political spotlight . much more to be done but , it 's obvious that more needs to be done . on wednesday , johannes singhammer , family affairs spokesman for the conservative union of the christian democrats and christian social democrats demanded that demographic policies had to be given a high priority . efforts to fight the " free fall of births " had to take a place at the center of politics alongside the battle against unemployment and reining in the ballooning deficit , singhammer added . dw staff -lrb- sp / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : learning to think outside the box once dismissed as " nonsense " by former chancellor schröder , family policies have now climbed to the top of germany 's political agenda .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.03.2006 a spring festival for books großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-day fair kicks off on thursday the key to the success of the leipzig book fair is that there is something for everyone , from works by budding novelists to world renowned authors , comic books and audio books and much more ... each year , there are two book fairs in germany : in the autumn , the massive international trade fair in frankfurt , and in the spring , the more intimate leipzig book fair that brings together authors and readers .
thanks to public demand and a positive resonance from publishers in recent years , the four-day leipzig book fair , which will kick off on thursday , has emerged as europe 's largest literary festival for author readings and events . leipzig does not even strive to compete with frankfurt , but over the years , has established its own identity , especially with its popular concept " leipzig reads . "
unlike frankfurt , which is geared towards trade professionals , leipzig generates much of its business from the general public . children are welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comic books are one of the key attractions of the book fair during the day , the fair is held in new , modern facilities outside the city center , where literary fans from all walks of life gather - be it school classes storming the exhibits , parents pushing prams down the aisles , or readers coming into contact with internationally best-selling authors in an informal atmosphere .
a large chunk of the fairgrounds will also be devoted to children 's books and comics . in the evenings , numerous readings are offered throughout the city , in bookshops , cozy cafes or a city hall chamber .
there will be 1,800 events this year alone , and late night partygoers could even bump into vladimir kaminer , the german-russian author of " russian disco , " who doubles up as a disc jockey . emphasis on german literature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author vladimir kaminer will double up as a disc jockey for the fair what distinguishes leipzig from frankfurt , is the strong emphasis on german-language literature and its knack for discovering young talent .
a number of well-known authors , such as ingo schulze , got their publishing start at the fair .
schulze , along with max frisch , and heinrich böll , is among the very few german authors , who have had the distinction of being published in the new yorker magazine . the magic of leipzig is that everyone can find his or her niche , whether it is the budding novelist or a world renowned author , according to oliver zille , head of the book fair . given the proximity of this city in saxony to central and eastern europe , the foreign focus is on showcasing up-and-coming authors from that region and launching them in the german-language market .
due to its unique role as the cultural bridge in a wider europe that has expanded eastwards , it has become a book fair tradition to award the " prize for european understanding " to one outstanding author each year .
this year ukrainian writer juri andruchovich , who has chronicled political events that unfolded in his home country before and after the orange revolution , will be honored . audio books are big in leipzig leipzig not only " reads , " but " leipzig listens " as well .
another tradition is to award the " hörkules " prize in the audio segment of the book market , which has experienced tremendous growth in the past several years .
plenty of events will revolve around the medium of audio books or productions .
emerging playwrights for example , can get feedback for their unpublished radio plays performed in front of a live audience . bildunterschrift : taking in culture at leipzig 's renowned gewandhaus leipzig has been dubbed the " city of the black arts " for its centuries-long tradition in the printing and book trade .
after world war ii and the division of germany , frankfurt became the venue for the world 's biggest fair in the publishing industry , whereas leipzig , relegated to decades of communist rule , became primarily a forum for east-west publishers . internationally , leipzig is a city that has long been associated with values such as liberty and freedom of expression , having led the peaceful demonstrations in 1989 that led to the fall of the berlin wall .
it is also famous for its cultural life and the gewandhaus orchestra . at the time of german reunification in 1990 , publishing houses in the former east germany were shut down or integrated into west german ones .
but already in 1991 , the leipzig book fair came back with a vengeance .
leipzig may never have the global impact and resources of its big brother in frankfurt , but it certainly sounds like more fun . gabriela schaaf -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de art , book , music and lifestyle fairs while cologne remains germany 's art and furniture capital , the publishing industry heads to frankfurt and leipzig 's fairs .

thanks to public demand and a positive resonance from publishers in recent years , the four-day leipzig book fair , which will kick off on thursday , has emerged as europe 's largest literary festival for author readings and events . leipzig does not even strive to compete with frankfurt , but over the years , has established its own identity , especially with its popular concept " leipzig reads . "
unlike frankfurt , which is geared towards trade professionals , leipzig generates much of its business from the general public . children are welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comic books are one of the key attractions of the book fair during the day , the fair is held in new , modern facilities outside the city center , where literary fans from all walks of life gather - be it school classes storming the exhibits , parents pushing prams down the aisles , or readers coming into contact with internationally best-selling authors in an informal atmosphere .
a large chunk of the fairgrounds will also be devoted to children 's books and comics . in the evenings , numerous readings are offered throughout the city , in bookshops , cozy cafes or a city hall chamber .
there will be 1,800 events this year alone , and late night partygoers could even bump into vladimir kaminer , the german-russian author of " russian disco , " who doubles up as a disc jockey . emphasis on german literature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author vladimir kaminer will double up as a disc jockey for the fair what distinguishes leipzig from frankfurt , is the strong emphasis on german-language literature and its knack for discovering young talent .
a number of well-known authors , such as ingo schulze , got their publishing start at the fair .
schulze , along with max frisch , and heinrich böll , is among the very few german authors , who have had the distinction of being published in the new yorker magazine . the magic of leipzig is that everyone can find his or her niche , whether it is the budding novelist or a world renowned author , according to oliver zille , head of the book fair . given the proximity of this city in saxony to central and eastern europe , the foreign focus is on showcasing up-and-coming authors from that region and launching them in the german-language market .
due to its unique role as the cultural bridge in a wider europe that has expanded eastwards , it has become a book fair tradition to award the " prize for european understanding " to one outstanding author each year .
this year ukrainian writer juri andruchovich , who has chronicled political events that unfolded in his home country before and after the orange revolution , will be honored . audio books are big in leipzig leipzig not only " reads , " but " leipzig listens " as well .
another tradition is to award the " hörkules " prize in the audio segment of the book market , which has experienced tremendous growth in the past several years .
plenty of events will revolve around the medium of audio books or productions .
emerging playwrights for example , can get feedback for their unpublished radio plays performed in front of a live audience . bildunterschrift : taking in culture at leipzig 's renowned gewandhaus leipzig has been dubbed the " city of the black arts " for its centuries-long tradition in the printing and book trade .
after world war ii and the division of germany , frankfurt became the venue for the world 's biggest fair in the publishing industry , whereas leipzig , relegated to decades of communist rule , became primarily a forum for east-west publishers . internationally , leipzig is a city that has long been associated with values such as liberty and freedom of expression , having led the peaceful demonstrations in 1989 that led to the fall of the berlin wall .
it is also famous for its cultural life and the gewandhaus orchestra . at the time of german reunification in 1990 , publishing houses in the former east germany were shut down or integrated into west german ones .

a new german soap opera has the answer : all hell breaks loose . " turkish for beginners , " a new soap opera which premiered on german public broadcaster ard on tuesday , is a highly entertaining bonanza of cultural stereotypes .
in it , doris schneider , an anti-disciplinarian german therapist and mother of two , falls in love with turkish policeman metin öztürk , a father of two as well .
to the absolute horror of the children from both sides of the cultural divide , doris -lrb- played by anna stieblich -rrb- and metin -lrb- adnan maral -rrb- decide to move in with each other and conduct a risky , cross-cultural family merger . yagmur and cem , metin 's children , are walking and talking cliches of young turks living in germany .
yagmur picks her room in the new apartment with a compass so that she can determine the direction of mecca for her regular prayers .
cem , a quintessential wannabe macho , hangs out with his friends and speaks with a strong turkish accent in order to sound street-smart and cool .

" i orient myself on american tv shows , in which the whole ensemble has a chance to develop , " soap author bora dagtekin said .

a new german soap opera has the answer : all hell breaks loose . " turkish for beginners , " a new soap opera which premiered on german public broadcaster ard on tuesday , is a highly entertaining bonanza of cultural stereotypes .
in it , doris schneider , an anti-disciplinarian german therapist and mother of two , falls in love with turkish policeman metin öztürk , a father of two as well .
to the absolute horror of the children from both sides of the cultural divide , doris -lrb- played by anna stieblich -rrb- and metin -lrb- adnan maral -rrb- decide to move in with each other and conduct a risky , cross-cultural family merger . yagmur and cem , metin 's children , are walking and talking cliches of young turks living in germany .
yagmur picks her room in the new apartment with a compass so that she can determine the direction of mecca for her regular prayers .
cem , a quintessential wannabe macho , hangs out with his friends and speaks with a strong turkish accent in order to sound street-smart and cool .
he believes that a woman 's place is next to the stove , but he 's in for a big surprise when he finds out that his new stepmother ca n't cook . new frontiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tough guy with a soft spot for celine dion appearances are , nonetheless , deceptive .
behind her stern , anti-western facade , yagmur secretly watches music videos on tv .
lena , doris ' daughter , is openly opposed to her mother 's intercultural experiment , but deep down she finds her new family to be just whacky enough to have lots of fun with . and cem , despite wanting to be a tough guy , falls in love with an asian girl and writes a love letter under the unlikely poetic influence of celine dion , the exemplary queen of commercial sap . " i orient myself on american tv shows , in which the whole ensemble has a chance to develop , " soap author bora dagtekin said .
" these are the stories in which inner conflicts are not only reserved for the leading character . " " turkish for beginners " is an exceptional show on german television .
there is not a touch of political correctness in it , but it freshens up the usually rather stale tv portraits of foreigners in germany . moving beyond the kebab joint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teenage angst with a german-turkish twist is the basis of the new ard soap " i find it highly critical that turks always only work in kebab joints -lrb- on television -rrb- , " said michael mangold , who leads the institute for media and economics at the karlsruhe center for art and media technology . " integration is the central goal of the current social policy , " mangold said . but you would n't be able to guess that by watching german television .
according to the nuremberg society for consumer research , german tv channels are not particularly interested in targeting their programs for the turkish audience since turks in germany spend half of their television time watching turkish channels via satellite dishes . " that is probably because they do not feel they are being addressed by german television , " mangold said . " turkish for beginners , " however , offers a humorous and a long overdue peek into multicultural germany without trying to be too controversial . " we really watched how far we would go , " dagtekin said .
" for me , it was important to approach cultural conflicts on an internal , familiar level without becoming political .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.03.2006 a spring festival for books großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-day fair kicks off on thursday the key to the success of the leipzig book fair is that there is something for everyone , from works by budding novelists to world renowned authors , comic books and audio books and much more ... each year , there are two book fairs in germany : in the autumn , the massive international trade fair in frankfurt , and in the spring , the more intimate leipzig book fair that brings together authors and readers .
thanks to public demand and a positive resonance from publishers in recent years , the four-day leipzig book fair , which will kick off on thursday , has emerged as europe 's largest literary festival for author readings and events . leipzig does not even strive to compete with frankfurt , but over the years , has established its own identity , especially with its popular concept " leipzig reads . "
unlike frankfurt , which is geared towards trade professionals , leipzig generates much of its business from the general public . children are welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comic books are one of the key attractions of the book fair during the day , the fair is held in new , modern facilities outside the city center , where literary fans from all walks of life gather - be it school classes storming the exhibits , parents pushing prams down the aisles , or readers coming into contact with internationally best-selling authors in an informal atmosphere .
a large chunk of the fairgrounds will also be devoted to children 's books and comics . in the evenings , numerous readings are offered throughout the city , in bookshops , cozy cafes or a city hall chamber .
there will be 1,800 events this year alone , and late night partygoers could even bump into vladimir kaminer , the german-russian author of " russian disco , " who doubles up as a disc jockey . emphasis on german literature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author vladimir kaminer will double up as a disc jockey for the fair what distinguishes leipzig from frankfurt , is the strong emphasis on german-language literature and its knack for discovering young talent .
a number of well-known authors , such as ingo schulze , got their publishing start at the fair .
schulze , along with max frisch , and heinrich böll , is among the very few german authors , who have had the distinction of being published in the new yorker magazine . the magic of leipzig is that everyone can find his or her niche , whether it is the budding novelist or a world renowned author , according to oliver zille , head of the book fair . given the proximity of this city in saxony to central and eastern europe , the foreign focus is on showcasing up-and-coming authors from that region and launching them in the german-language market .
due to its unique role as the cultural bridge in a wider europe that has expanded eastwards , it has become a book fair tradition to award the " prize for european understanding " to one outstanding author each year .
this year ukrainian writer juri andruchovich , who has chronicled political events that unfolded in his home country before and after the orange revolution , will be honored . audio books are big in leipzig leipzig not only " reads , " but " leipzig listens " as well .
another tradition is to award the " hörkules " prize in the audio segment of the book market , which has experienced tremendous growth in the past several years .
plenty of events will revolve around the medium of audio books or productions .
emerging playwrights for example , can get feedback for their unpublished radio plays performed in front of a live audience . bildunterschrift : taking in culture at leipzig 's renowned gewandhaus leipzig has been dubbed the " city of the black arts " for its centuries-long tradition in the printing and book trade .
after world war ii and the division of germany , frankfurt became the venue for the world 's biggest fair in the publishing industry , whereas leipzig , relegated to decades of communist rule , became primarily a forum for east-west publishers . internationally , leipzig is a city that has long been associated with values such as liberty and freedom of expression , having led the peaceful demonstrations in 1989 that led to the fall of the berlin wall .
it is also famous for its cultural life and the gewandhaus orchestra . at the time of german reunification in 1990 , publishing houses in the former east germany were shut down or integrated into west german ones .
but already in 1991 , the leipzig book fair came back with a vengeance .
leipzig may never have the global impact and resources of its big brother in frankfurt , but it certainly sounds like more fun . gabriela schaaf -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de art , book , music and lifestyle fairs while cologne remains germany 's art and furniture capital , the publishing industry heads to frankfurt and leipzig 's fairs .

it 's not about these 18 minutes a day , it 's about our jobs .
everything 's being cut little by little , and no one can tell us that the 40-hour week wo n't lead to more cuts .
we want to keep these jobs for the future , for young people and we 're not going to back down .
it 's not easy for me financially , but i accept the losses .
i 'm ready to strike for as long as it takes and i think we have more support than the press says we do .

we 're ready to do this until we reach the results we want , and we can go on for a while since we have enough money in the strike fund .
i hope that this is a new beginning for the union , since the strike has brought us a lot of new members .
more people see now what the union is there for , why they need it .
i hope that it 's a revival for us .

but the press never talks about that .
i think it 's a conscious smear against our strike .

we regret that employers are taking such a hard-line position and that it 's become a political fight in the meantime , especially when you see that the states governed by the christian democrats are being so unrelenting .
i 'm employed by the city in the civil engineering office and for 10 years i 've watched how jobs have been cut .
that 's why we do n't believe the mayor when he says this extension of working hours wo n't lead to job cuts .
there are some sectors where a 35-hour work week is the norm .
others in the private sector have 40 , but employees are compensated financially for that .
i do n't buy the argument that everyone has to work longer these days . " " the longer we strike , the more determined the strikers are .
you could feel it ; there 's a certain rage there and that helps strengthen our determination to keep going .

i think that 's severe and cruel and that 's why i 'm standing here .
it 's very difficult , but in my profession , a very important aspect is to instill in children a sense of social responsibility .

below are some voices from verdi members at tuesday 's demonstration . jürgen rönsch , 37 cemetery maintenance worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rönsch " the strike is more justified than ever .
it 's not about these 18 minutes a day , it 's about our jobs .
everything 's being cut little by little , and no one can tell us that the 40-hour week wo n't lead to more cuts .
we want to keep these jobs for the future , for young people and we 're not going to back down .
it 's not easy for me financially , but i accept the losses .
i 'm ready to strike for as long as it takes and i think we have more support than the press says we do . " bärbel illi , 47 verdi union employee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bärbel illi " it 's going well and up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the results we want , and we can go on for a while since we have enough money in the strike fund .
i hope that this is a new beginning for the union , since the strike has brought us a lot of new members .
more people see now what the union is there for , why they need it .
i hope that it 's a revival for us . " heike fischer , 48 child-care worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike fischer " the press always focuses on parents who are against the strike , but where i work , out of 50 parents , there are just two who are against the strike .
but the press never talks about that .
i think it 's a conscious smear against our strike .
the parents stand with us , because they know what kind of quality we bring to the center , and they do n't want that quality to be reduced . " helmut zahner , 53 civil engineer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut zahner " we still think it 's absolutely necessary to strike .
we regret that employers are taking such a hard-line position and that it 's become a political fight in the meantime , especially when you see that the states governed by the christian democrats are being so unrelenting .
i 'm employed by the city in the civil engineering office and for 10 years i 've watched how jobs have been cut .
that 's why we do n't believe the mayor when he says this extension of working hours wo n't lead to job cuts .
there are some sectors where a 35-hour work week is the norm .
others in the private sector have 40 , but employees are compensated financially for that .
i do n't buy the argument that everyone has to work longer these days . " " the longer we strike , the more determined the strikers are .
you could feel it ; there 's a certain rage there and that helps strengthen our determination to keep going .
we 're more determined than ever . " gabriele krische , 44 kindergarten teacher bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriele krische " i am resolute because i do n't want jobs to be cut where i work .
we already have enough unemployed people here and i ca n't be part of a policy that leads to even more people losing their jobs .
i think that 's severe and cruel and that 's why i 'm standing here .
it 's very difficult , but in my profession , a very important aspect is to instill in children a sense of social responsibility .
that means we have to share the work and we ca n't stand by and just watch while others lose their jobs . " heike marwit , 29 child-care worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike marwit " we 're lucky that the parents where i work are understanding of what we 're doing - when i hear what has happened in some other places , where parents have blockaded exits and not let child-care workers leave the facility .
i think if we give up now , the whole thing would n't have made any sense and we should n't have bothered in the first place .
i wish it would have been wrapped up sooner , but what can we do about it ? " lutz bötzer , 45 special education teacher bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutz bötzer " i 've paid union dues for 25 years and never been on a strike .
i 've got to get my money 's worth !
i can only recommend that everybody strike because you see so many people that you hardly ever come across in this big bureaucracy where we work , especially since they 've cut out the company outing , where you 'd see people at least once a year .
now on strike , we 're forced to see each other .

but according to political economist friedrich schneider , that 's partly due to hypocritical western governments , who do n't want to be team players . an international conference on combating the financing of terrorism is being held in the hague on wednesday and thursday .
dw-world.de spoke with political economist friedrich schneider from johannes kepler university in linz , austria , about the chances of successfully cutting off terrorists ' money supplies and the obstacles preventing faster progress . dw-world.de : professor schneider , seven years ago , the g7 countries initiated the international financial action task force , or fatf .
it is meant to fight terrorist financing , but so far , the force has n't had any significant success .
why are these international efforts failing ? friedrich schneider : on an international level , next to nothing is being done .
it 's that simple .
every country is doing its own work , there 's no international cooperation that 's working .
data is n't even being exchanged in the aftermath of a terrorist attack , let alone cooperation among various secret services . why is n't there more cooperation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban leader mullah omar : the us funded the taliban in the past i 'll give you an example .
if the french finance covert operations in africa through their secret service , or if the germans pay ransom in iraq , do you think these governments want to publicly acknowledge this kind of financing ?
and good and evil can quickly change , as we know .
just take the taliban in afghanistan , for example .
for a long time , they were financed by the united states when the us was against russia .
this is where hypocrisy comes in .
if governments do n't want to expose their own covert financing operations , then they ca n't have any real interest in more efficient uncovering of money laundering . to what extent is money laundering linked to the financing of terrorism ?
money laundering is mostly associated with the drugs trade and human trafficking . terrorist financing is , broadly speaking , the financing of terrorist operations , and not all that much money is needed .
the september 2001 attacks cost just $ 500,000 , including flight training .
much more money is needed for the maintenance of terrorist bases .
to pull together this kind of funding , money from the drugs trade , illegal diamond trading or kidnapping is laundered . so is it mainly through the tracking of money laundering that sources of terrorist financing can be found ?
with money from legal operations … … you ca n't prevent the financing of terrorism .
there are donations to terrorist organizations - hamas for example .
it gets a lot of money from arab states for hospitals and schools , but where there 's no clear dividing line to show whether the money was used for terrorist acts . what can really be done to stop terrorist financing then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug money often ends up financing terrorist cells the first question is , whether there is any desire to effectively fight money laundering .
only then can you really combat terrorist financing .
to fight money laundering , you need international cooperation , and a task force that is just as agile and flexible as the terrorists .
this would also require the regulations prohibiting data exchange to be loosened , but so far that has n't happened . what can financial service providers do to stop terrorist financing ? that depends firstly on the extent to which they want to do business with people from the mafia or other organized criminals .
investigators rely on insider information from banks which often have little knowledge about how clean certain transactions are . as a political economist , you 've called for combating poverty and promoting democratic values as a way to stop terrorism .
why ? simply put , people who earn money do n't throw bombs .
if i have a house , a car , and a well-paid job , i 'm less likely to become a terrorist .
there will always be fanatics who resort to terrorism regardless of their income , but they 'll be far fewer .
it 's about drying up part of the basis for terrorism , which is why fighting poverty is such an effective strategy .
in addition to this , we have to fight religious extremism , and deal with religious differences in a peaceful manner , but there have only been half-hearted attempts at that so far . that does n't sound very optimistic .
how do you think the financing of terrorism will develop in the future ? unfortunately , i think europe will have to experience two or three more attacks before we start to work more closely together . martin schrader interviewed friedrich schneider send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops the agenda in warsaw as the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member council of europe enters its last day in warsaw , talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime .

" we will increase our commitment and our funding by 500 million euros over the next 10 years , " transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said .
he was speaking at the opening of a second hydrogen refueling station in berlin .
the german capital 's transport authorities have promised to introduce a fleet of 14 hydrogen-powered buses by 2007 in a bid to become the european " capital " for the low-pollution technology . federal funding for the development of hydrogen-powered vehicles is to be expanded to other german regions - such as hamburg , southern germany and parts of north rhine-westphalia - in the next few years .
hydroge n -power hurdles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrogen-fueling stations are still few and far between however , there are several hindrances to the development of hydrogen-powered vehicles , principally the cost of building refueling stations . another hurdle is reducing the cost of obtaining hydrogen itself , which has to be extracted from fossil fuels , such as carbon , or from water . " as a fuel for cars , hydrogen technology has a long way to go , " tiefensee said . clea n er tech n ology could become more affordable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : optimizing technology while making it affordable is the hope experts from german automaker bmw predict that the cost of hydrogen technology could be reduced to levels affordable for individual consumers by 2015 .
even then , basic hydrogen-powered cars would cost up to 3,000 euros -lrb- 3,600 dollars -rrb- more than gasoline models at today 's prices . bmw , daimlerchrysler , ford and gm / opel are the four car manufacturers involved in the clean energy partnership , an international group set up to develop hydrogen power which receives support from the german government . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de high fuel prices push alternative engines record prices at gas stations caused in part by the devastating effects of hurricane katrina have knocked discussion in germany about alternative engines into high gear ahead of this month 's auto show .

" emergencies will continue to be handled - we can not simply leave patients on respirators or similar cases to fend for themselves , " he said . the union has noted that comparable countries in the european union paid far higher salaries and argued that the only way to stop a mass flight of doctors was to raise the pay scale , noting that some 6,300 german hospital physicians had already left to work abroad . the move comes amid a public sector strike in several german states over longer working hours that has hit key services such as child care and garbage collection . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : german doctors feel the pinch a week of protest by german doctors frustrated by their working conditions culminated in a demonstration that saw thousands take to the streets on wednesday .

a new german soap opera has the answer : all hell breaks loose . " turkish for beginners , " a new soap opera which premiered on german public broadcaster ard on tuesday , is a highly entertaining bonanza of cultural stereotypes .
in it , doris schneider , an anti-disciplinarian german therapist and mother of two , falls in love with turkish policeman metin öztürk , a father of two as well .
to the absolute horror of the children from both sides of the cultural divide , doris -lrb- played by anna stieblich -rrb- and metin -lrb- adnan maral -rrb- decide to move in with each other and conduct a risky , cross-cultural family merger . yagmur and cem , metin 's children , are walking and talking cliches of young turks living in germany .
yagmur picks her room in the new apartment with a compass so that she can determine the direction of mecca for her regular prayers .
cem , a quintessential wannabe macho , hangs out with his friends and speaks with a strong turkish accent in order to sound street-smart and cool .
he believes that a woman 's place is next to the stove , but he 's in for a big surprise when he finds out that his new stepmother ca n't cook . new frontiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tough guy with a soft spot for celine dion appearances are , nonetheless , deceptive .
behind her stern , anti-western facade , yagmur secretly watches music videos on tv .
lena , doris ' daughter , is openly opposed to her mother 's intercultural experiment , but deep down she finds her new family to be just whacky enough to have lots of fun with . and cem , despite wanting to be a tough guy , falls in love with an asian girl and writes a love letter under the unlikely poetic influence of celine dion , the exemplary queen of commercial sap . " i orient myself on american tv shows , in which the whole ensemble has a chance to develop , " soap author bora dagtekin said .
" these are the stories in which inner conflicts are not only reserved for the leading character . " " turkish for beginners " is an exceptional show on german television .
there is not a touch of political correctness in it , but it freshens up the usually rather stale tv portraits of foreigners in germany . moving beyond the kebab joint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teenage angst with a german-turkish twist is the basis of the new ard soap " i find it highly critical that turks always only work in kebab joints -lrb- on television -rrb- , " said michael mangold , who leads the institute for media and economics at the karlsruhe center for art and media technology . " integration is the central goal of the current social policy , " mangold said . but you would n't be able to guess that by watching german television .
according to the nuremberg society for consumer research , german tv channels are not particularly interested in targeting their programs for the turkish audience since turks in germany spend half of their television time watching turkish channels via satellite dishes . " that is probably because they do not feel they are being addressed by german television , " mangold said . " turkish for beginners , " however , offers a humorous and a long overdue peek into multicultural germany without trying to be too controversial . " we really watched how far we would go , " dagtekin said .
" for me , it was important to approach cultural conflicts on an internal , familiar level without becoming political .

but according to political economist friedrich schneider , that 's partly due to hypocritical western governments , who do n't want to be team players . an international conference on combating the financing of terrorism is being held in the hague on wednesday and thursday .
dw-world.de spoke with political economist friedrich schneider from johannes kepler university in linz , austria , about the chances of successfully cutting off terrorists ' money supplies and the obstacles preventing faster progress . dw-world.de : professor schneider , seven years ago , the g7 countries initiated the international financial action task force , or fatf .
it is meant to fight terrorist financing , but so far , the force has n't had any significant success .
why are these international efforts failing ? friedrich schneider : on an international level , next to nothing is being done .
it 's that simple .
every country is doing its own work , there 's no international cooperation that 's working .
data is n't even being exchanged in the aftermath of a terrorist attack , let alone cooperation among various secret services . why is n't there more cooperation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban leader mullah omar : the us funded the taliban in the past i 'll give you an example .
if the french finance covert operations in africa through their secret service , or if the germans pay ransom in iraq , do you think these governments want to publicly acknowledge this kind of financing ?
and good and evil can quickly change , as we know .
just take the taliban in afghanistan , for example .
for a long time , they were financed by the united states when the us was against russia .
this is where hypocrisy comes in .
if governments do n't want to expose their own covert financing operations , then they ca n't have any real interest in more efficient uncovering of money laundering . to what extent is money laundering linked to the financing of terrorism ?
money laundering is mostly associated with the drugs trade and human trafficking . terrorist financing is , broadly speaking , the financing of terrorist operations , and not all that much money is needed .
the september 2001 attacks cost just $ 500,000 , including flight training .
much more money is needed for the maintenance of terrorist bases .
to pull together this kind of funding , money from the drugs trade , illegal diamond trading or kidnapping is laundered . so is it mainly through the tracking of money laundering that sources of terrorist financing can be found ?
with money from legal operations … … you ca n't prevent the financing of terrorism .
there are donations to terrorist organizations - hamas for example .
it gets a lot of money from arab states for hospitals and schools , but where there 's no clear dividing line to show whether the money was used for terrorist acts . what can really be done to stop terrorist financing then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug money often ends up financing terrorist cells the first question is , whether there is any desire to effectively fight money laundering .
only then can you really combat terrorist financing .
to fight money laundering , you need international cooperation , and a task force that is just as agile and flexible as the terrorists .
this would also require the regulations prohibiting data exchange to be loosened , but so far that has n't happened . what can financial service providers do to stop terrorist financing ? that depends firstly on the extent to which they want to do business with people from the mafia or other organized criminals .
investigators rely on insider information from banks which often have little knowledge about how clean certain transactions are . as a political economist , you 've called for combating poverty and promoting democratic values as a way to stop terrorism .
why ? simply put , people who earn money do n't throw bombs .
if i have a house , a car , and a well-paid job , i 'm less likely to become a terrorist .
there will always be fanatics who resort to terrorism regardless of their income , but they 'll be far fewer .
it 's about drying up part of the basis for terrorism , which is why fighting poverty is such an effective strategy .
in addition to this , we have to fight religious extremism , and deal with religious differences in a peaceful manner , but there have only been half-hearted attempts at that so far . that does n't sound very optimistic .
how do you think the financing of terrorism will develop in the future ? unfortunately , i think europe will have to experience two or three more attacks before we start to work more closely together . martin schrader interviewed friedrich schneider send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops the agenda in warsaw as the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member council of europe enters its last day in warsaw , talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime .

the company would first wait and see whether a rival offer materialized from a third party , merck 's supervisory board chief wilhelm simson told a news conference in berlin . but merck was not prepared to pay so high a price that a purchase could only be financed by selling off bits of schering , simson added . the price of 77 euros per share was " fair " , he continued .
and simson said he hoped to meet with schering 's chairman hubertus erlen later on tuesday . " our main aim is to enter into negotiations with schering , " he said .

work-life balance gets boost in germany the dumbing down of germany gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids germany -pipe- 15.03.2006 politicians discuss pension cuts for childless germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's younger generation is dwindling new statistics confirming the declining birth rate have sent germany in to a state of panic , amid a growing consensus that pensions should be increased for people with children and reduced for those without . " people without children should either receive a reduced pension or pay more into pension schemes , " said norbert geis from the csu . johann eekhoff , director of the cologne institute for economic policy said a reform of the pension system was long overdue . " people without children should never have been admitted into pension schemes because these only work when they are financed by subsequent generations , " he said in an interview with mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" their pensions should be cut by 50 percent . " cdu politician elisabeth winkelmeier-becker agreed , pointing out that working parents are financially disadvantaged compared to their childless peers .
" in the long-term , we need to consider awarding people without children lower pensions , " she said . chilling statistics the headline in germany 's mass-selling daily bild on wednesday said it all : " baby shock : we germans are dying out , " the paper screamed . that might sound a bit extreme , but latest figures , based on data collected at the federal statistics office , released on tuesday have sent a chill among demographers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more babies were born in post-war year of 1946 than today last year , only some 676,000 children were born in germany according to german daily die welt which cited forecasts by the federal statistics office .
that pushed the birth rate to its worst low in 15 years : in 2004 , the number of newborns amounted to 706,000 .

a new german soap opera has the answer : all hell breaks loose . " turkish for beginners , " a new soap opera which premiered on german public broadcaster ard on tuesday , is a highly entertaining bonanza of cultural stereotypes .
in it , doris schneider , an anti-disciplinarian german therapist and mother of two , falls in love with turkish policeman metin öztürk , a father of two as well .
to the absolute horror of the children from both sides of the cultural divide , doris -lrb- played by anna stieblich -rrb- and metin -lrb- adnan maral -rrb- decide to move in with each other and conduct a risky , cross-cultural family merger . yagmur and cem , metin 's children , are walking and talking cliches of young turks living in germany .
yagmur picks her room in the new apartment with a compass so that she can determine the direction of mecca for her regular prayers .
cem , a quintessential wannabe macho , hangs out with his friends and speaks with a strong turkish accent in order to sound street-smart and cool .
he believes that a woman 's place is next to the stove , but he 's in for a big surprise when he finds out that his new stepmother ca n't cook . new frontiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tough guy with a soft spot for celine dion appearances are , nonetheless , deceptive .
behind her stern , anti-western facade , yagmur secretly watches music videos on tv .
lena , doris ' daughter , is openly opposed to her mother 's intercultural experiment , but deep down she finds her new family to be just whacky enough to have lots of fun with . and cem , despite wanting to be a tough guy , falls in love with an asian girl and writes a love letter under the unlikely poetic influence of celine dion , the exemplary queen of commercial sap . " i orient myself on american tv shows , in which the whole ensemble has a chance to develop , " soap author bora dagtekin said .
" these are the stories in which inner conflicts are not only reserved for the leading character . " " turkish for beginners " is an exceptional show on german television .
there is not a touch of political correctness in it , but it freshens up the usually rather stale tv portraits of foreigners in germany . moving beyond the kebab joint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teenage angst with a german-turkish twist is the basis of the new ard soap " i find it highly critical that turks always only work in kebab joints -lrb- on television -rrb- , " said michael mangold , who leads the institute for media and economics at the karlsruhe center for art and media technology . " integration is the central goal of the current social policy , " mangold said . but you would n't be able to guess that by watching german television .
according to the nuremberg society for consumer research , german tv channels are not particularly interested in targeting their programs for the turkish audience since turks in germany spend half of their television time watching turkish channels via satellite dishes . " that is probably because they do not feel they are being addressed by german television , " mangold said . " turkish for beginners , " however , offers a humorous and a long overdue peek into multicultural germany without trying to be too controversial . " we really watched how far we would go , " dagtekin said .
" for me , it was important to approach cultural conflicts on an internal , familiar level without becoming political .

work-life balance gets boost in germany the dumbing down of germany gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids germany -pipe- 15.03.2006 politicians discuss pension cuts for childless germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's younger generation is dwindling new statistics confirming the declining birth rate have sent germany in to a state of panic , amid a growing consensus that pensions should be increased for people with children and reduced for those without . " people without children should either receive a reduced pension or pay more into pension schemes , " said norbert geis from the csu . johann eekhoff , director of the cologne institute for economic policy said a reform of the pension system was long overdue . " people without children should never have been admitted into pension schemes because these only work when they are financed by subsequent generations , " he said in an interview with mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" their pensions should be cut by 50 percent . " cdu politician elisabeth winkelmeier-becker agreed , pointing out that working parents are financially disadvantaged compared to their childless peers .
" in the long-term , we need to consider awarding people without children lower pensions , " she said . chilling statistics the headline in germany 's mass-selling daily bild on wednesday said it all : " baby shock : we germans are dying out , " the paper screamed . that might sound a bit extreme , but latest figures , based on data collected at the federal statistics office , released on tuesday have sent a chill among demographers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more babies were born in post-war year of 1946 than today last year , only some 676,000 children were born in germany according to german daily die welt which cited forecasts by the federal statistics office .
that pushed the birth rate to its worst low in 15 years : in 2004 , the number of newborns amounted to 706,000 .
that 's all still significantly less than the 922,000 births in the post-war year of 1946 . " that 's dramatic , we 're running into a dead end , " michael hüther , director of the cologne-based institute for the german economy told the paper . wiesbaden on top the demographic figures have also shown huge variations in germany 's 50 largest cities . the eastern german city of magdeburg , the capital of saxony-anhalt , took the dubious honor of having the lowest birth rate in the country : only some 6.9 children per 1000 inhabitants are born in the city on a yearly average . as against that , the significantly richer city of wiesbaden near frankfurt , has the highest birth rate with 10.5 births per 1000 inhabitants .
the western german cities of frankfurt and bonn followed closely , while the capital berlin also features on spot 30 with a birthrate of 8.7 . issue being taken seriously though the latest statistics have come as a shock , the issue is hardly new in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is apparently doing things better when it comes to boosting its birth rate according to eurostat , the eu statistics office , there were 8.5 births per 1000 inhabitants in germany in 2004 - making it the country with the lowest birth rate in the entire european union .
countries such as france and britain boasted birthrates - at 12.7 and 12.0 respectively in the same year - that exceeded german levels by more than 50 percent . for years , politicians and demographers in germany have warned of the dangers of a falling birth rate and ageing population .
in recent months in particular , the subject has raced to the top of the political agenda and been the focus of heated debates over family-friendly and childcare policies . the damning pisa study on germany 's faltering education standards has also stepped up the urgency surrounding the issue .
in january this year , the ruling grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats decided to make it easier for working mothers to continue being part of the labor market , increasing tax breaks on child care , encourage setting up full-day schools and making kindergartens cost-free . chancellor merkel 's family affairs minister , ursula von der leyen , a mother of seven children herself , has also been credited with pushing for family-friendly policies and ensuring that the issue remains in the political spotlight . much more to be done but , it 's obvious that more needs to be done . on wednesday , johannes singhammer , family affairs spokesman for the conservative union of the christian democrats and christian social democrats demanded that demographic policies had to be given a high priority . efforts to fight the " free fall of births " had to take a place at the center of politics alongside the battle against unemployment and reining in the ballooning deficit , singhammer added . dw staff -lrb- sp / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : learning to think outside the box once dismissed as " nonsense " by former chancellor schröder , family policies have now climbed to the top of germany 's political agenda .
the debate is headed in the right direction , says dw-world 's uta thofern .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.03.2006 why the fight against terrorist financing is faltering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money laundering and the financing of terrorism go hand in hand the financing of international terrorism is notoriously hard to stop .
but according to political economist friedrich schneider , that 's partly due to hypocritical western governments , who do n't want to be team players . an international conference on combating the financing of terrorism is being held in the hague on wednesday and thursday .
dw-world.de spoke with political economist friedrich schneider from johannes kepler university in linz , austria , about the chances of successfully cutting off terrorists ' money supplies and the obstacles preventing faster progress . dw-world.de : professor schneider , seven years ago , the g7 countries initiated the international financial action task force , or fatf .
it is meant to fight terrorist financing , but so far , the force has n't had any significant success .
why are these international efforts failing ? friedrich schneider : on an international level , next to nothing is being done .
it 's that simple .
every country is doing its own work , there 's no international cooperation that 's working .
data is n't even being exchanged in the aftermath of a terrorist attack , let alone cooperation among various secret services . why is n't there more cooperation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban leader mullah omar : the us funded the taliban in the past i 'll give you an example .
if the french finance covert operations in africa through their secret service , or if the germans pay ransom in iraq , do you think these governments want to publicly acknowledge this kind of financing ?
and good and evil can quickly change , as we know .
just take the taliban in afghanistan , for example .
for a long time , they were financed by the united states when the us was against russia .
this is where hypocrisy comes in .
if governments do n't want to expose their own covert financing operations , then they ca n't have any real interest in more efficient uncovering of money laundering . to what extent is money laundering linked to the financing of terrorism ?
money laundering is mostly associated with the drugs trade and human trafficking . terrorist financing is , broadly speaking , the financing of terrorist operations , and not all that much money is needed .
the september 2001 attacks cost just $ 500,000 , including flight training .
much more money is needed for the maintenance of terrorist bases .
to pull together this kind of funding , money from the drugs trade , illegal diamond trading or kidnapping is laundered . so is it mainly through the tracking of money laundering that sources of terrorist financing can be found ?
with money from legal operations … … you ca n't prevent the financing of terrorism .
there are donations to terrorist organizations - hamas for example .
it gets a lot of money from arab states for hospitals and schools , but where there 's no clear dividing line to show whether the money was used for terrorist acts . what can really be done to stop terrorist financing then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug money often ends up financing terrorist cells the first question is , whether there is any desire to effectively fight money laundering .
only then can you really combat terrorist financing .
to fight money laundering , you need international cooperation , and a task force that is just as agile and flexible as the terrorists .
this would also require the regulations prohibiting data exchange to be loosened , but so far that has n't happened . what can financial service providers do to stop terrorist financing ? that depends firstly on the extent to which they want to do business with people from the mafia or other organized criminals .
investigators rely on insider information from banks which often have little knowledge about how clean certain transactions are . as a political economist , you 've called for combating poverty and promoting democratic values as a way to stop terrorism .
why ? simply put , people who earn money do n't throw bombs .
if i have a house , a car , and a well-paid job , i 'm less likely to become a terrorist .
there will always be fanatics who resort to terrorism regardless of their income , but they 'll be far fewer .
it 's about drying up part of the basis for terrorism , which is why fighting poverty is such an effective strategy .
in addition to this , we have to fight religious extremism , and deal with religious differences in a peaceful manner , but there have only been half-hearted attempts at that so far . that does n't sound very optimistic .
how do you think the financing of terrorism will develop in the future ? unfortunately , i think europe will have to experience two or three more attacks before we start to work more closely together . martin schrader interviewed friedrich schneider send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops the agenda in warsaw as the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member council of europe enters its last day in warsaw , talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime .

below are some voices from verdi members at tuesday 's demonstration . jürgen rönsch , 37 cemetery maintenance worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rönsch " the strike is more justified than ever .
it 's not about these 18 minutes a day , it 's about our jobs .
everything 's being cut little by little , and no one can tell us that the 40-hour week wo n't lead to more cuts .
we want to keep these jobs for the future , for young people and we 're not going to back down .
it 's not easy for me financially , but i accept the losses .
i 'm ready to strike for as long as it takes and i think we have more support than the press says we do . " bärbel illi , 47 verdi union employee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bärbel illi " it 's going well and up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the results we want , and we can go on for a while since we have enough money in the strike fund .
i hope that this is a new beginning for the union , since the strike has brought us a lot of new members .
more people see now what the union is there for , why they need it .
i hope that it 's a revival for us . " heike fischer , 48 child-care worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike fischer " the press always focuses on parents who are against the strike , but where i work , out of 50 parents , there are just two who are against the strike .
but the press never talks about that .
i think it 's a conscious smear against our strike .
the parents stand with us , because they know what kind of quality we bring to the center , and they do n't want that quality to be reduced . " helmut zahner , 53 civil engineer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut zahner " we still think it 's absolutely necessary to strike .
we regret that employers are taking such a hard-line position and that it 's become a political fight in the meantime , especially when you see that the states governed by the christian democrats are being so unrelenting .
i 'm employed by the city in the civil engineering office and for 10 years i 've watched how jobs have been cut .
that 's why we do n't believe the mayor when he says this extension of working hours wo n't lead to job cuts .
there are some sectors where a 35-hour work week is the norm .
others in the private sector have 40 , but employees are compensated financially for that .
i do n't buy the argument that everyone has to work longer these days . " " the longer we strike , the more determined the strikers are .
you could feel it ; there 's a certain rage there and that helps strengthen our determination to keep going .
we 're more determined than ever . " gabriele krische , 44 kindergarten teacher bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriele krische " i am resolute because i do n't want jobs to be cut where i work .
we already have enough unemployed people here and i ca n't be part of a policy that leads to even more people losing their jobs .
i think that 's severe and cruel and that 's why i 'm standing here .
it 's very difficult , but in my profession , a very important aspect is to instill in children a sense of social responsibility .
that means we have to share the work and we ca n't stand by and just watch while others lose their jobs . " heike marwit , 29 child-care worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike marwit " we 're lucky that the parents where i work are understanding of what we 're doing - when i hear what has happened in some other places , where parents have blockaded exits and not let child-care workers leave the facility .
i think if we give up now , the whole thing would n't have made any sense and we should n't have bothered in the first place .
i wish it would have been wrapped up sooner , but what can we do about it ? " lutz bötzer , 45 special education teacher bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutz bötzer " i 've paid union dues for 25 years and never been on a strike .
i 've got to get my money 's worth !
i can only recommend that everybody strike because you see so many people that you hardly ever come across in this big bureaucracy where we work , especially since they 've cut out the company outing , where you 'd see people at least once a year .
now on strike , we 're forced to see each other .

the company would first wait and see whether a rival offer materialized from a third party , merck 's supervisory board chief wilhelm simson told a news conference in berlin . but merck was not prepared to pay so high a price that a purchase could only be financed by selling off bits of schering , simson added . the price of 77 euros per share was " fair " , he continued .

a new german soap opera has the answer : all hell breaks loose . " turkish for beginners , " a new soap opera which premiered on german public broadcaster ard on tuesday , is a highly entertaining bonanza of cultural stereotypes .
in it , doris schneider , an anti-disciplinarian german therapist and mother of two , falls in love with turkish policeman metin öztürk , a father of two as well .
to the absolute horror of the children from both sides of the cultural divide , doris -lrb- played by anna stieblich -rrb- and metin -lrb- adnan maral -rrb- decide to move in with each other and conduct a risky , cross-cultural family merger . yagmur and cem , metin 's children , are walking and talking cliches of young turks living in germany .
yagmur picks her room in the new apartment with a compass so that she can determine the direction of mecca for her regular prayers .
cem , a quintessential wannabe macho , hangs out with his friends and speaks with a strong turkish accent in order to sound street-smart and cool .
he believes that a woman 's place is next to the stove , but he 's in for a big surprise when he finds out that his new stepmother ca n't cook . new frontiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tough guy with a soft spot for celine dion appearances are , nonetheless , deceptive .
behind her stern , anti-western facade , yagmur secretly watches music videos on tv .
lena , doris ' daughter , is openly opposed to her mother 's intercultural experiment , but deep down she finds her new family to be just whacky enough to have lots of fun with . and cem , despite wanting to be a tough guy , falls in love with an asian girl and writes a love letter under the unlikely poetic influence of celine dion , the exemplary queen of commercial sap . " i orient myself on american tv shows , in which the whole ensemble has a chance to develop , " soap author bora dagtekin said .
" these are the stories in which inner conflicts are not only reserved for the leading character . " " turkish for beginners " is an exceptional show on german television .
there is not a touch of political correctness in it , but it freshens up the usually rather stale tv portraits of foreigners in germany . moving beyond the kebab joint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teenage angst with a german-turkish twist is the basis of the new ard soap " i find it highly critical that turks always only work in kebab joints -lrb- on television -rrb- , " said michael mangold , who leads the institute for media and economics at the karlsruhe center for art and media technology . " integration is the central goal of the current social policy , " mangold said . but you would n't be able to guess that by watching german television .
according to the nuremberg society for consumer research , german tv channels are not particularly interested in targeting their programs for the turkish audience since turks in germany spend half of their television time watching turkish channels via satellite dishes . " that is probably because they do not feel they are being addressed by german television , " mangold said . " turkish for beginners , " however , offers a humorous and a long overdue peek into multicultural germany without trying to be too controversial . " we really watched how far we would go , " dagtekin said .
" for me , it was important to approach cultural conflicts on an internal , familiar level without becoming political .

a new german soap opera has the answer : all hell breaks loose . " turkish for beginners , " a new soap opera which premiered on german public broadcaster ard on tuesday , is a highly entertaining bonanza of cultural stereotypes .
in it , doris schneider , an anti-disciplinarian german therapist and mother of two , falls in love with turkish policeman metin öztürk , a father of two as well .
to the absolute horror of the children from both sides of the cultural divide , doris -lrb- played by anna stieblich -rrb- and metin -lrb- adnan maral -rrb- decide to move in with each other and conduct a risky , cross-cultural family merger . yagmur and cem , metin 's children , are walking and talking cliches of young turks living in germany .
yagmur picks her room in the new apartment with a compass so that she can determine the direction of mecca for her regular prayers .
cem , a quintessential wannabe macho , hangs out with his friends and speaks with a strong turkish accent in order to sound street-smart and cool .
he believes that a woman 's place is next to the stove , but he 's in for a big surprise when he finds out that his new stepmother ca n't cook . new frontiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tough guy with a soft spot for celine dion appearances are , nonetheless , deceptive .
behind her stern , anti-western facade , yagmur secretly watches music videos on tv .
lena , doris ' daughter , is openly opposed to her mother 's intercultural experiment , but deep down she finds her new family to be just whacky enough to have lots of fun with . and cem , despite wanting to be a tough guy , falls in love with an asian girl and writes a love letter under the unlikely poetic influence of celine dion , the exemplary queen of commercial sap . " i orient myself on american tv shows , in which the whole ensemble has a chance to develop , " soap author bora dagtekin said .
" these are the stories in which inner conflicts are not only reserved for the leading character . " " turkish for beginners " is an exceptional show on german television .
there is not a touch of political correctness in it , but it freshens up the usually rather stale tv portraits of foreigners in germany . moving beyond the kebab joint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teenage angst with a german-turkish twist is the basis of the new ard soap " i find it highly critical that turks always only work in kebab joints -lrb- on television -rrb- , " said michael mangold , who leads the institute for media and economics at the karlsruhe center for art and media technology . " integration is the central goal of the current social policy , " mangold said . but you would n't be able to guess that by watching german television .
according to the nuremberg society for consumer research , german tv channels are not particularly interested in targeting their programs for the turkish audience since turks in germany spend half of their television time watching turkish channels via satellite dishes . " that is probably because they do not feel they are being addressed by german television , " mangold said . " turkish for beginners , " however , offers a humorous and a long overdue peek into multicultural germany without trying to be too controversial . " we really watched how far we would go , " dagtekin said .
" for me , it was important to approach cultural conflicts on an internal , familiar level without becoming political .

the company would first wait and see whether a rival offer materialized from a third party , merck 's supervisory board chief wilhelm simson told a news conference in berlin . but merck was not prepared to pay so high a price that a purchase could only be financed by selling off bits of schering , simson added . the price of 77 euros per share was " fair " , he continued .
and simson said he hoped to meet with schering 's chairman hubertus erlen later on tuesday . " our main aim is to enter into negotiations with schering , " he said .

below are some voices from verdi members at tuesday 's demonstration . jürgen rönsch , 37 cemetery maintenance worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rönsch " the strike is more justified than ever .
it 's not about these 18 minutes a day , it 's about our jobs .
everything 's being cut little by little , and no one can tell us that the 40-hour week wo n't lead to more cuts .
we want to keep these jobs for the future , for young people and we 're not going to back down .
it 's not easy for me financially , but i accept the losses .
i 'm ready to strike for as long as it takes and i think we have more support than the press says we do . " bärbel illi , 47 verdi union employee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bärbel illi " it 's going well and up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the results we want , and we can go on for a while since we have enough money in the strike fund .
i hope that this is a new beginning for the union , since the strike has brought us a lot of new members .
more people see now what the union is there for , why they need it .
i hope that it 's a revival for us . " heike fischer , 48 child-care worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike fischer " the press always focuses on parents who are against the strike , but where i work , out of 50 parents , there are just two who are against the strike .
but the press never talks about that .
i think it 's a conscious smear against our strike .
the parents stand with us , because they know what kind of quality we bring to the center , and they do n't want that quality to be reduced . " helmut zahner , 53 civil engineer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut zahner " we still think it 's absolutely necessary to strike .
we regret that employers are taking such a hard-line position and that it 's become a political fight in the meantime , especially when you see that the states governed by the christian democrats are being so unrelenting .
i 'm employed by the city in the civil engineering office and for 10 years i 've watched how jobs have been cut .
that 's why we do n't believe the mayor when he says this extension of working hours wo n't lead to job cuts .
there are some sectors where a 35-hour work week is the norm .
others in the private sector have 40 , but employees are compensated financially for that .
i do n't buy the argument that everyone has to work longer these days . " " the longer we strike , the more determined the strikers are .
you could feel it ; there 's a certain rage there and that helps strengthen our determination to keep going .
we 're more determined than ever . " gabriele krische , 44 kindergarten teacher bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriele krische " i am resolute because i do n't want jobs to be cut where i work .
we already have enough unemployed people here and i ca n't be part of a policy that leads to even more people losing their jobs .
i think that 's severe and cruel and that 's why i 'm standing here .
it 's very difficult , but in my profession , a very important aspect is to instill in children a sense of social responsibility .
that means we have to share the work and we ca n't stand by and just watch while others lose their jobs . " heike marwit , 29 child-care worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike marwit " we 're lucky that the parents where i work are understanding of what we 're doing - when i hear what has happened in some other places , where parents have blockaded exits and not let child-care workers leave the facility .
i think if we give up now , the whole thing would n't have made any sense and we should n't have bothered in the first place .
i wish it would have been wrapped up sooner , but what can we do about it ? " lutz bötzer , 45 special education teacher bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutz bötzer " i 've paid union dues for 25 years and never been on a strike .
i 've got to get my money 's worth !
i can only recommend that everybody strike because you see so many people that you hardly ever come across in this big bureaucracy where we work , especially since they 've cut out the company outing , where you 'd see people at least once a year .

work-life balance gets boost in germany the dumbing down of germany gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids germany -pipe- 15.03.2006 politicians discuss pension cuts for childless germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's younger generation is dwindling new statistics confirming the declining birth rate have sent germany in to a state of panic , amid a growing consensus that pensions should be increased for people with children and reduced for those without . " people without children should either receive a reduced pension or pay more into pension schemes , " said norbert geis from the csu . johann eekhoff , director of the cologne institute for economic policy said a reform of the pension system was long overdue . " people without children should never have been admitted into pension schemes because these only work when they are financed by subsequent generations , " he said in an interview with mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" their pensions should be cut by 50 percent . " cdu politician elisabeth winkelmeier-becker agreed , pointing out that working parents are financially disadvantaged compared to their childless peers .
" in the long-term , we need to consider awarding people without children lower pensions , " she said . chilling statistics the headline in germany 's mass-selling daily bild on wednesday said it all : " baby shock : we germans are dying out , " the paper screamed . that might sound a bit extreme , but latest figures , based on data collected at the federal statistics office , released on tuesday have sent a chill among demographers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more babies were born in post-war year of 1946 than today last year , only some 676,000 children were born in germany according to german daily die welt which cited forecasts by the federal statistics office .
that pushed the birth rate to its worst low in 15 years : in 2004 , the number of newborns amounted to 706,000 .
that 's all still significantly less than the 922,000 births in the post-war year of 1946 . " that 's dramatic , we 're running into a dead end , " michael hüther , director of the cologne-based institute for the german economy told the paper . wiesbaden on top the demographic figures have also shown huge variations in germany 's 50 largest cities . the eastern german city of magdeburg , the capital of saxony-anhalt , took the dubious honor of having the lowest birth rate in the country : only some 6.9 children per 1000 inhabitants are born in the city on a yearly average . as against that , the significantly richer city of wiesbaden near frankfurt , has the highest birth rate with 10.5 births per 1000 inhabitants .
the western german cities of frankfurt and bonn followed closely , while the capital berlin also features on spot 30 with a birthrate of 8.7 . issue being taken seriously though the latest statistics have come as a shock , the issue is hardly new in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is apparently doing things better when it comes to boosting its birth rate according to eurostat , the eu statistics office , there were 8.5 births per 1000 inhabitants in germany in 2004 - making it the country with the lowest birth rate in the entire european union .
countries such as france and britain boasted birthrates - at 12.7 and 12.0 respectively in the same year - that exceeded german levels by more than 50 percent . for years , politicians and demographers in germany have warned of the dangers of a falling birth rate and ageing population .
in recent months in particular , the subject has raced to the top of the political agenda and been the focus of heated debates over family-friendly and childcare policies . the damning pisa study on germany 's faltering education standards has also stepped up the urgency surrounding the issue .
in january this year , the ruling grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats decided to make it easier for working mothers to continue being part of the labor market , increasing tax breaks on child care , encourage setting up full-day schools and making kindergartens cost-free . chancellor merkel 's family affairs minister , ursula von der leyen , a mother of seven children herself , has also been credited with pushing for family-friendly policies and ensuring that the issue remains in the political spotlight . much more to be done but , it 's obvious that more needs to be done . on wednesday , johannes singhammer , family affairs spokesman for the conservative union of the christian democrats and christian social democrats demanded that demographic policies had to be given a high priority . efforts to fight the " free fall of births " had to take a place at the center of politics alongside the battle against unemployment and reining in the ballooning deficit , singhammer added . dw staff -lrb- sp / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : learning to think outside the box once dismissed as " nonsense " by former chancellor schröder , family policies have now climbed to the top of germany 's political agenda .

" we will increase our commitment and our funding by 500 million euros over the next 10 years , " transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said .
he was speaking at the opening of a second hydrogen refueling station in berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.03.2006 why the fight against terrorist financing is faltering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money laundering and the financing of terrorism go hand in hand the financing of international terrorism is notoriously hard to stop .
but according to political economist friedrich schneider , that 's partly due to hypocritical western governments , who do n't want to be team players . an international conference on combating the financing of terrorism is being held in the hague on wednesday and thursday .
dw-world.de spoke with political economist friedrich schneider from johannes kepler university in linz , austria , about the chances of successfully cutting off terrorists ' money supplies and the obstacles preventing faster progress . dw-world.de : professor schneider , seven years ago , the g7 countries initiated the international financial action task force , or fatf .
it is meant to fight terrorist financing , but so far , the force has n't had any significant success .
why are these international efforts failing ? friedrich schneider : on an international level , next to nothing is being done .
it 's that simple .
every country is doing its own work , there 's no international cooperation that 's working .
data is n't even being exchanged in the aftermath of a terrorist attack , let alone cooperation among various secret services . why is n't there more cooperation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban leader mullah omar : the us funded the taliban in the past i 'll give you an example .
if the french finance covert operations in africa through their secret service , or if the germans pay ransom in iraq , do you think these governments want to publicly acknowledge this kind of financing ?
and good and evil can quickly change , as we know .
just take the taliban in afghanistan , for example .
for a long time , they were financed by the united states when the us was against russia .
this is where hypocrisy comes in .
if governments do n't want to expose their own covert financing operations , then they ca n't have any real interest in more efficient uncovering of money laundering . to what extent is money laundering linked to the financing of terrorism ?
money laundering is mostly associated with the drugs trade and human trafficking . terrorist financing is , broadly speaking , the financing of terrorist operations , and not all that much money is needed .
the september 2001 attacks cost just $ 500,000 , including flight training .
much more money is needed for the maintenance of terrorist bases .
to pull together this kind of funding , money from the drugs trade , illegal diamond trading or kidnapping is laundered . so is it mainly through the tracking of money laundering that sources of terrorist financing can be found ?
with money from legal operations … … you ca n't prevent the financing of terrorism .
there are donations to terrorist organizations - hamas for example .
it gets a lot of money from arab states for hospitals and schools , but where there 's no clear dividing line to show whether the money was used for terrorist acts . what can really be done to stop terrorist financing then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug money often ends up financing terrorist cells the first question is , whether there is any desire to effectively fight money laundering .
only then can you really combat terrorist financing .
to fight money laundering , you need international cooperation , and a task force that is just as agile and flexible as the terrorists .
this would also require the regulations prohibiting data exchange to be loosened , but so far that has n't happened . what can financial service providers do to stop terrorist financing ? that depends firstly on the extent to which they want to do business with people from the mafia or other organized criminals .
investigators rely on insider information from banks which often have little knowledge about how clean certain transactions are . as a political economist , you 've called for combating poverty and promoting democratic values as a way to stop terrorism .
why ? simply put , people who earn money do n't throw bombs .
if i have a house , a car , and a well-paid job , i 'm less likely to become a terrorist .
there will always be fanatics who resort to terrorism regardless of their income , but they 'll be far fewer .
it 's about drying up part of the basis for terrorism , which is why fighting poverty is such an effective strategy .
in addition to this , we have to fight religious extremism , and deal with religious differences in a peaceful manner , but there have only been half-hearted attempts at that so far . that does n't sound very optimistic .
how do you think the financing of terrorism will develop in the future ? unfortunately , i think europe will have to experience two or three more attacks before we start to work more closely together . martin schrader interviewed friedrich schneider send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops the agenda in warsaw as the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member council of europe enters its last day in warsaw , talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime .

thanks to public demand and a positive resonance from publishers in recent years , the four-day leipzig book fair , which will kick off on thursday , has emerged as europe 's largest literary festival for author readings and events . leipzig does not even strive to compete with frankfurt , but over the years , has established its own identity , especially with its popular concept " leipzig reads . "
unlike frankfurt , which is geared towards trade professionals , leipzig generates much of its business from the general public . children are welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comic books are one of the key attractions of the book fair during the day , the fair is held in new , modern facilities outside the city center , where literary fans from all walks of life gather - be it school classes storming the exhibits , parents pushing prams down the aisles , or readers coming into contact with internationally best-selling authors in an informal atmosphere .
a large chunk of the fairgrounds will also be devoted to children 's books and comics . in the evenings , numerous readings are offered throughout the city , in bookshops , cozy cafes or a city hall chamber .

a number of well-known authors , such as ingo schulze , got their publishing start at the fair .
schulze , along with max frisch , and heinrich böll , is among the very few german authors , who have had the distinction of being published in the new yorker magazine . the magic of leipzig is that everyone can find his or her niche , whether it is the budding novelist or a world renowned author , according to oliver zille , head of the book fair . given the proximity of this city in saxony to central and eastern europe , the foreign focus is on showcasing up-and-coming authors from that region and launching them in the german-language market .
due to its unique role as the cultural bridge in a wider europe that has expanded eastwards , it has become a book fair tradition to award the " prize for european understanding " to one outstanding author each year .
this year ukrainian writer juri andruchovich , who has chronicled political events that unfolded in his home country before and after the orange revolution , will be honored . audio books are big in leipzig leipzig not only " reads , " but " leipzig listens " as well .
another tradition is to award the " hörkules " prize in the audio segment of the book market , which has experienced tremendous growth in the past several years .
plenty of events will revolve around the medium of audio books or productions .
emerging playwrights for example , can get feedback for their unpublished radio plays performed in front of a live audience . bildunterschrift : taking in culture at leipzig 's renowned gewandhaus leipzig has been dubbed the " city of the black arts " for its centuries-long tradition in the printing and book trade .
after world war ii and the division of germany , frankfurt became the venue for the world 's biggest fair in the publishing industry , whereas leipzig , relegated to decades of communist rule , became primarily a forum for east-west publishers . internationally , leipzig is a city that has long been associated with values such as liberty and freedom of expression , having led the peaceful demonstrations in 1989 that led to the fall of the berlin wall .
it is also famous for its cultural life and the gewandhaus orchestra . at the time of german reunification in 1990 , publishing houses in the former east germany were shut down or integrated into west german ones .

in stuttgart , at the heart of the labor action , union members say they 're determined to win . it is about symbolism , many analysts say , this protracted work stoppage by the verdi services union that has closed kindergartens , interrupted hospital services and kept garbage collection trucks idle inside city garages .
while that symbolism may be about union power and unions ' futures , there 's another powerful symbol of germany 's biggest public-service stoppage in 14 years : trash . these days , it 's everywhere in stuttgart , this usually pristine city in southwestern germany , capital of the state of baden-württemberg and one of the principle cities of the historical region of swabia .
the swabians , as the stereotype goes , are not only extraordinarily thrifty ; they can be fanatically clean .
but six weeks into this public-sector strike , clean is hard to come by , at least in the public sphere .
the city is swimming in garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many explosions of trash around stuttgart trashcans have been filled to overflowing , and often , packed to the breaking point , have dumped their contents in a messy circle around them .
stuttgart 's street curbs have become the resting place for a rising tide of daily detritus : mcdonald 's cups , candy wrappers , cigarette packs and old napkins . " i 've had enough of this strike , " said doris laphardt , 46 , as she stepped over a pile of discarded paper in a central square .
" this place is beginning to look like new york . " arbitration but there could be a glimmer of hope in the strike that until just yesterday , showed no signs of coming to an end .
municipal authorities in baden-württemberg and the verdi services union said on tuesday they were bringing in outside arbitrators to try to bring the union and public-sector employers , who up until now have dug in their heels in negotiations , come closer together . the two sides have agreed to bring in two arbitrators , the head of aok health insurance for baden-württemberg , roland sing , and a former president of the state 's administrative court , claus messner .
the two began familiarizing themselves with the material on wednesday morning and talks were planned to begin between representatives from verdi and employers during the afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike hq in stuttgart employers want to extend the working week from 38.5 hour to 40 hour without an increase in pay .
they say they need to ease up pressure on state coffers - personnel costs consume almost one-half of state budgets - and argue that many other civil servants , not to mention the private sector , already work 40-hour weeks .
employers argue that they are asking public-sector employees to only add 18 minutes to each working day . verdi counters that increasing the working week will cut employees ' take home pay , which would further erode already weak consumer spending in germany .
the union also says the change could endanger some 250,000 jobs in the public sector . verdi , along with most of germany 's trade unions , has been struggling with falling membership and an increasing feeling among the populace that it is obstructionist and out of step with the realities of today 's labor environment .
while 18 minutes a day does not seem like much to ask to help prop up struggling state governments , observers say the strike has become a test of verdi 's ability to maintain its strong role in germany 's centralized bargaining system , which is increasingly under attack . " it 's really about symbolism .
the real point is whether they are forced to capitulate on this very symbolic point , " deutsche bank economist stefan schneider told reuters . noisy determination on a cold but clear tuesday morning outside the verdi headquarters in stuttgart , thoughts of capitulation were not in evidence .
at 10:30 a.m. , amid blowing whistles and rattling noisemakers , a group of some 2,500 strikers began a protest march .
carrying banners , waving red verdi flags and chanting slogans , the strikers made their way from the union building through central stuttgart to a large square where speakers encouraged them to stay the fight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching through stuttgart there did not seem to be need for much encouraging .
in fact , the mood was almost festive , now six weeks into the labor action .
instead of slumped shoulders and resigned expressions , the crowd was marked by a strong sense of determination to fight the fight for as long as it takes . " up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the result we want , and we can go on for a while .
we have enough money in the strike fund , " said bärbel illi , 47 , an employee of verdi 's stuttgart branch . heike fischer , 48 , is a child-care worker who said that although the media liked to focus on the trouble some parents have had since their child-care facilities have been closed , most parents were behind the action . " of course , all of us would rather not be on strike anymore , we would like to be with the children , " she said .
" but we ca n't stop now if we want to have a future .
we ca n't give up now , and i 'm ready to continue until we are successful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confrontation between garbage workers replacement workers many of the striking sanitation workers wore signs that said " strikebreakers , hands off our trash ! " referring to the private firms that have been hired to take care of some of the city 's sanitation problems .
those two worlds collided briefly after the main rally when a group of striking workers came across a private garbage truck waiting at a stoplight .
the group stepped in front of the vehicle and , yelling at the three men sitting inside , tried to cover the truck 's windshield with posters to prevent it from driving on .
police had to disperse the group . verdi officials say that besides showing its strength , the strike has mobilized union members , many of whom had begun wondering why they were bothering to pay their monthly dues . " it was important that the unions do something , " said jürgen rönsch , 37 , a cemetery maintenance worker .
" in my department there was hardly anyone left in the union , since it never did anything .
but now people have been coming back . " public support waning while the strike has given verdi a boost in popularity among those in sectors it represents , it is less clear how the strike will play out among the populace at large .
public disgruntlement about the labor action is growing .
in a poll last week carried out for the zdf public television channel , 61 percent of germans opposed the protests , up six percentage points from a poll conducted on feb .
17 . union members in stuttgart claim the local media is overplaying the dissatisfaction felt by stuttgart residents about the strike and the resulting piles of trash .
but on tuesday , most residents asked said they thought it was time for the striking workers to get back on the job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tired of the trash some were split on the issue , like 50-year-old maria schlom , who said she was tired of the trash but trying to remain open : " i can sympathize if the fear is really about losing jobs , " she said .
" but if it 's just about working 40 hours in a week , that i ca n't understand . " others supported the action in the beginning but felt that the union had taken things too far .
" when they 're blocking entrances so trucks ca n't spread grit on icy streets or private firms ca n't take away garbage , that 's too much , " said agathe hiller , 48 . but karl-heinz walther , 62 , who was visiting stuttgart with his wife for the day , said he was fully behind the striking workers .
" the employers just have to give a little and it 'd be all over . " when told that his response was a minority one , his wife chimed in : " maybe that 's because we 're not from stuttgart .

in stuttgart , at the heart of the labor action , union members say they 're determined to win . it is about symbolism , many analysts say , this protracted work stoppage by the verdi services union that has closed kindergartens , interrupted hospital services and kept garbage collection trucks idle inside city garages .
while that symbolism may be about union power and unions ' futures , there 's another powerful symbol of germany 's biggest public-service stoppage in 14 years : trash . these days , it 's everywhere in stuttgart , this usually pristine city in southwestern germany , capital of the state of baden-württemberg and one of the principle cities of the historical region of swabia .
the swabians , as the stereotype goes , are not only extraordinarily thrifty ; they can be fanatically clean .
but six weeks into this public-sector strike , clean is hard to come by , at least in the public sphere .
the city is swimming in garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many explosions of trash around stuttgart trashcans have been filled to overflowing , and often , packed to the breaking point , have dumped their contents in a messy circle around them .
stuttgart 's street curbs have become the resting place for a rising tide of daily detritus : mcdonald 's cups , candy wrappers , cigarette packs and old napkins . " i 've had enough of this strike , " said doris laphardt , 46 , as she stepped over a pile of discarded paper in a central square .
" this place is beginning to look like new york . " arbitration but there could be a glimmer of hope in the strike that until just yesterday , showed no signs of coming to an end .
municipal authorities in baden-württemberg and the verdi services union said on tuesday they were bringing in outside arbitrators to try to bring the union and public-sector employers , who up until now have dug in their heels in negotiations , come closer together . the two sides have agreed to bring in two arbitrators , the head of aok health insurance for baden-württemberg , roland sing , and a former president of the state 's administrative court , claus messner .
the two began familiarizing themselves with the material on wednesday morning and talks were planned to begin between representatives from verdi and employers during the afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike hq in stuttgart employers want to extend the working week from 38.5 hour to 40 hour without an increase in pay .
they say they need to ease up pressure on state coffers - personnel costs consume almost one-half of state budgets - and argue that many other civil servants , not to mention the private sector , already work 40-hour weeks .
employers argue that they are asking public-sector employees to only add 18 minutes to each working day . verdi counters that increasing the working week will cut employees ' take home pay , which would further erode already weak consumer spending in germany .
the union also says the change could endanger some 250,000 jobs in the public sector . verdi , along with most of germany 's trade unions , has been struggling with falling membership and an increasing feeling among the populace that it is obstructionist and out of step with the realities of today 's labor environment .
while 18 minutes a day does not seem like much to ask to help prop up struggling state governments , observers say the strike has become a test of verdi 's ability to maintain its strong role in germany 's centralized bargaining system , which is increasingly under attack . " it 's really about symbolism .
the real point is whether they are forced to capitulate on this very symbolic point , " deutsche bank economist stefan schneider told reuters . noisy determination on a cold but clear tuesday morning outside the verdi headquarters in stuttgart , thoughts of capitulation were not in evidence .
at 10:30 a.m. , amid blowing whistles and rattling noisemakers , a group of some 2,500 strikers began a protest march .
carrying banners , waving red verdi flags and chanting slogans , the strikers made their way from the union building through central stuttgart to a large square where speakers encouraged them to stay the fight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching through stuttgart there did not seem to be need for much encouraging .
in fact , the mood was almost festive , now six weeks into the labor action .
instead of slumped shoulders and resigned expressions , the crowd was marked by a strong sense of determination to fight the fight for as long as it takes . " up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the result we want , and we can go on for a while .
we have enough money in the strike fund , " said bärbel illi , 47 , an employee of verdi 's stuttgart branch . heike fischer , 48 , is a child-care worker who said that although the media liked to focus on the trouble some parents have had since their child-care facilities have been closed , most parents were behind the action . " of course , all of us would rather not be on strike anymore , we would like to be with the children , " she said .
" but we ca n't stop now if we want to have a future .
we ca n't give up now , and i 'm ready to continue until we are successful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confrontation between garbage workers replacement workers many of the striking sanitation workers wore signs that said " strikebreakers , hands off our trash ! " referring to the private firms that have been hired to take care of some of the city 's sanitation problems .
those two worlds collided briefly after the main rally when a group of striking workers came across a private garbage truck waiting at a stoplight .
the group stepped in front of the vehicle and , yelling at the three men sitting inside , tried to cover the truck 's windshield with posters to prevent it from driving on .
police had to disperse the group . verdi officials say that besides showing its strength , the strike has mobilized union members , many of whom had begun wondering why they were bothering to pay their monthly dues . " it was important that the unions do something , " said jürgen rönsch , 37 , a cemetery maintenance worker .
" in my department there was hardly anyone left in the union , since it never did anything .
but now people have been coming back . " public support waning while the strike has given verdi a boost in popularity among those in sectors it represents , it is less clear how the strike will play out among the populace at large .
public disgruntlement about the labor action is growing .
in a poll last week carried out for the zdf public television channel , 61 percent of germans opposed the protests , up six percentage points from a poll conducted on feb .
17 . union members in stuttgart claim the local media is overplaying the dissatisfaction felt by stuttgart residents about the strike and the resulting piles of trash .
but on tuesday , most residents asked said they thought it was time for the striking workers to get back on the job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tired of the trash some were split on the issue , like 50-year-old maria schlom , who said she was tired of the trash but trying to remain open : " i can sympathize if the fear is really about losing jobs , " she said .
" but if it 's just about working 40 hours in a week , that i ca n't understand . " others supported the action in the beginning but felt that the union had taken things too far .
" when they 're blocking entrances so trucks ca n't spread grit on icy streets or private firms ca n't take away garbage , that 's too much , " said agathe hiller , 48 . but karl-heinz walther , 62 , who was visiting stuttgart with his wife for the day , said he was fully behind the striking workers .
" the employers just have to give a little and it 'd be all over . " when told that his response was a minority one , his wife chimed in : " maybe that 's because we 're not from stuttgart .

in stuttgart , at the heart of the labor action , union members say they 're determined to win . it is about symbolism , many analysts say , this protracted work stoppage by the verdi services union that has closed kindergartens , interrupted hospital services and kept garbage collection trucks idle inside city garages .
while that symbolism may be about union power and unions ' futures , there 's another powerful symbol of germany 's biggest public-service stoppage in 14 years : trash . these days , it 's everywhere in stuttgart , this usually pristine city in southwestern germany , capital of the state of baden-württemberg and one of the principle cities of the historical region of swabia .
the swabians , as the stereotype goes , are not only extraordinarily thrifty ; they can be fanatically clean .
but six weeks into this public-sector strike , clean is hard to come by , at least in the public sphere .
the city is swimming in garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many explosions of trash around stuttgart trashcans have been filled to overflowing , and often , packed to the breaking point , have dumped their contents in a messy circle around them .
stuttgart 's street curbs have become the resting place for a rising tide of daily detritus : mcdonald 's cups , candy wrappers , cigarette packs and old napkins . " i 've had enough of this strike , " said doris laphardt , 46 , as she stepped over a pile of discarded paper in a central square .
" this place is beginning to look like new york . " arbitration but there could be a glimmer of hope in the strike that until just yesterday , showed no signs of coming to an end .
municipal authorities in baden-württemberg and the verdi services union said on tuesday they were bringing in outside arbitrators to try to bring the union and public-sector employers , who up until now have dug in their heels in negotiations , come closer together . the two sides have agreed to bring in two arbitrators , the head of aok health insurance for baden-württemberg , roland sing , and a former president of the state 's administrative court , claus messner .
the two began familiarizing themselves with the material on wednesday morning and talks were planned to begin between representatives from verdi and employers during the afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike hq in stuttgart employers want to extend the working week from 38.5 hour to 40 hour without an increase in pay .
they say they need to ease up pressure on state coffers - personnel costs consume almost one-half of state budgets - and argue that many other civil servants , not to mention the private sector , already work 40-hour weeks .
employers argue that they are asking public-sector employees to only add 18 minutes to each working day . verdi counters that increasing the working week will cut employees ' take home pay , which would further erode already weak consumer spending in germany .
the union also says the change could endanger some 250,000 jobs in the public sector . verdi , along with most of germany 's trade unions , has been struggling with falling membership and an increasing feeling among the populace that it is obstructionist and out of step with the realities of today 's labor environment .
while 18 minutes a day does not seem like much to ask to help prop up struggling state governments , observers say the strike has become a test of verdi 's ability to maintain its strong role in germany 's centralized bargaining system , which is increasingly under attack . " it 's really about symbolism .
the real point is whether they are forced to capitulate on this very symbolic point , " deutsche bank economist stefan schneider told reuters . noisy determination on a cold but clear tuesday morning outside the verdi headquarters in stuttgart , thoughts of capitulation were not in evidence .
at 10:30 a.m. , amid blowing whistles and rattling noisemakers , a group of some 2,500 strikers began a protest march .
carrying banners , waving red verdi flags and chanting slogans , the strikers made their way from the union building through central stuttgart to a large square where speakers encouraged them to stay the fight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching through stuttgart there did not seem to be need for much encouraging .
in fact , the mood was almost festive , now six weeks into the labor action .
instead of slumped shoulders and resigned expressions , the crowd was marked by a strong sense of determination to fight the fight for as long as it takes . " up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the result we want , and we can go on for a while .
we have enough money in the strike fund , " said bärbel illi , 47 , an employee of verdi 's stuttgart branch . heike fischer , 48 , is a child-care worker who said that although the media liked to focus on the trouble some parents have had since their child-care facilities have been closed , most parents were behind the action . " of course , all of us would rather not be on strike anymore , we would like to be with the children , " she said .
" but we ca n't stop now if we want to have a future .
we ca n't give up now , and i 'm ready to continue until we are successful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confrontation between garbage workers replacement workers many of the striking sanitation workers wore signs that said " strikebreakers , hands off our trash ! " referring to the private firms that have been hired to take care of some of the city 's sanitation problems .
those two worlds collided briefly after the main rally when a group of striking workers came across a private garbage truck waiting at a stoplight .
the group stepped in front of the vehicle and , yelling at the three men sitting inside , tried to cover the truck 's windshield with posters to prevent it from driving on .
police had to disperse the group . verdi officials say that besides showing its strength , the strike has mobilized union members , many of whom had begun wondering why they were bothering to pay their monthly dues . " it was important that the unions do something , " said jürgen rönsch , 37 , a cemetery maintenance worker .
" in my department there was hardly anyone left in the union , since it never did anything .
but now people have been coming back . " public support waning while the strike has given verdi a boost in popularity among those in sectors it represents , it is less clear how the strike will play out among the populace at large .
public disgruntlement about the labor action is growing .
in a poll last week carried out for the zdf public television channel , 61 percent of germans opposed the protests , up six percentage points from a poll conducted on feb .
17 . union members in stuttgart claim the local media is overplaying the dissatisfaction felt by stuttgart residents about the strike and the resulting piles of trash .
but on tuesday , most residents asked said they thought it was time for the striking workers to get back on the job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tired of the trash some were split on the issue , like 50-year-old maria schlom , who said she was tired of the trash but trying to remain open : " i can sympathize if the fear is really about losing jobs , " she said .
" but if it 's just about working 40 hours in a week , that i ca n't understand . " others supported the action in the beginning but felt that the union had taken things too far .
" when they 're blocking entrances so trucks ca n't spread grit on icy streets or private firms ca n't take away garbage , that 's too much , " said agathe hiller , 48 . but karl-heinz walther , 62 , who was visiting stuttgart with his wife for the day , said he was fully behind the striking workers .
" the employers just have to give a little and it 'd be all over . " when told that his response was a minority one , his wife chimed in : " maybe that 's because we 're not from stuttgart .

work-life balance gets boost in germany the dumbing down of germany gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids germany -pipe- 15.03.2006 politicians discuss pension cuts for childless germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's younger generation is dwindling new statistics confirming the declining birth rate have sent germany in to a state of panic , amid a growing consensus that pensions should be increased for people with children and reduced for those without . " people without children should either receive a reduced pension or pay more into pension schemes , " said norbert geis from the csu . johann eekhoff , director of the cologne institute for economic policy said a reform of the pension system was long overdue . " people without children should never have been admitted into pension schemes because these only work when they are financed by subsequent generations , " he said in an interview with mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" their pensions should be cut by 50 percent . " cdu politician elisabeth winkelmeier-becker agreed , pointing out that working parents are financially disadvantaged compared to their childless peers .
" in the long-term , we need to consider awarding people without children lower pensions , " she said . chilling statistics the headline in germany 's mass-selling daily bild on wednesday said it all : " baby shock : we germans are dying out , " the paper screamed . that might sound a bit extreme , but latest figures , based on data collected at the federal statistics office , released on tuesday have sent a chill among demographers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more babies were born in post-war year of 1946 than today last year , only some 676,000 children were born in germany according to german daily die welt which cited forecasts by the federal statistics office .
that pushed the birth rate to its worst low in 15 years : in 2004 , the number of newborns amounted to 706,000 .
that 's all still significantly less than the 922,000 births in the post-war year of 1946 . " that 's dramatic , we 're running into a dead end , " michael hüther , director of the cologne-based institute for the german economy told the paper . wiesbaden on top the demographic figures have also shown huge variations in germany 's 50 largest cities . the eastern german city of magdeburg , the capital of saxony-anhalt , took the dubious honor of having the lowest birth rate in the country : only some 6.9 children per 1000 inhabitants are born in the city on a yearly average . as against that , the significantly richer city of wiesbaden near frankfurt , has the highest birth rate with 10.5 births per 1000 inhabitants .
the western german cities of frankfurt and bonn followed closely , while the capital berlin also features on spot 30 with a birthrate of 8.7 . issue being taken seriously though the latest statistics have come as a shock , the issue is hardly new in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is apparently doing things better when it comes to boosting its birth rate according to eurostat , the eu statistics office , there were 8.5 births per 1000 inhabitants in germany in 2004 - making it the country with the lowest birth rate in the entire european union .
countries such as france and britain boasted birthrates - at 12.7 and 12.0 respectively in the same year - that exceeded german levels by more than 50 percent . for years , politicians and demographers in germany have warned of the dangers of a falling birth rate and ageing population .
in recent months in particular , the subject has raced to the top of the political agenda and been the focus of heated debates over family-friendly and childcare policies . the damning pisa study on germany 's faltering education standards has also stepped up the urgency surrounding the issue .
in january this year , the ruling grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats decided to make it easier for working mothers to continue being part of the labor market , increasing tax breaks on child care , encourage setting up full-day schools and making kindergartens cost-free . chancellor merkel 's family affairs minister , ursula von der leyen , a mother of seven children herself , has also been credited with pushing for family-friendly policies and ensuring that the issue remains in the political spotlight . much more to be done but , it 's obvious that more needs to be done . on wednesday , johannes singhammer , family affairs spokesman for the conservative union of the christian democrats and christian social democrats demanded that demographic policies had to be given a high priority . efforts to fight the " free fall of births " had to take a place at the center of politics alongside the battle against unemployment and reining in the ballooning deficit , singhammer added . dw staff -lrb- sp / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : learning to think outside the box once dismissed as " nonsense " by former chancellor schröder , family policies have now climbed to the top of germany 's political agenda .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.03.2006 a spring festival for books großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-day fair kicks off on thursday the key to the success of the leipzig book fair is that there is something for everyone , from works by budding novelists to world renowned authors , comic books and audio books and much more ... each year , there are two book fairs in germany : in the autumn , the massive international trade fair in frankfurt , and in the spring , the more intimate leipzig book fair that brings together authors and readers .
thanks to public demand and a positive resonance from publishers in recent years , the four-day leipzig book fair , which will kick off on thursday , has emerged as europe 's largest literary festival for author readings and events . leipzig does not even strive to compete with frankfurt , but over the years , has established its own identity , especially with its popular concept " leipzig reads . "
unlike frankfurt , which is geared towards trade professionals , leipzig generates much of its business from the general public . children are welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comic books are one of the key attractions of the book fair during the day , the fair is held in new , modern facilities outside the city center , where literary fans from all walks of life gather - be it school classes storming the exhibits , parents pushing prams down the aisles , or readers coming into contact with internationally best-selling authors in an informal atmosphere .
a large chunk of the fairgrounds will also be devoted to children 's books and comics . in the evenings , numerous readings are offered throughout the city , in bookshops , cozy cafes or a city hall chamber .
there will be 1,800 events this year alone , and late night partygoers could even bump into vladimir kaminer , the german-russian author of " russian disco , " who doubles up as a disc jockey . emphasis on german literature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author vladimir kaminer will double up as a disc jockey for the fair what distinguishes leipzig from frankfurt , is the strong emphasis on german-language literature and its knack for discovering young talent .
a number of well-known authors , such as ingo schulze , got their publishing start at the fair .
schulze , along with max frisch , and heinrich böll , is among the very few german authors , who have had the distinction of being published in the new yorker magazine . the magic of leipzig is that everyone can find his or her niche , whether it is the budding novelist or a world renowned author , according to oliver zille , head of the book fair . given the proximity of this city in saxony to central and eastern europe , the foreign focus is on showcasing up-and-coming authors from that region and launching them in the german-language market .
due to its unique role as the cultural bridge in a wider europe that has expanded eastwards , it has become a book fair tradition to award the " prize for european understanding " to one outstanding author each year .
this year ukrainian writer juri andruchovich , who has chronicled political events that unfolded in his home country before and after the orange revolution , will be honored . audio books are big in leipzig leipzig not only " reads , " but " leipzig listens " as well .
another tradition is to award the " hörkules " prize in the audio segment of the book market , which has experienced tremendous growth in the past several years .
plenty of events will revolve around the medium of audio books or productions .
emerging playwrights for example , can get feedback for their unpublished radio plays performed in front of a live audience . bildunterschrift : taking in culture at leipzig 's renowned gewandhaus leipzig has been dubbed the " city of the black arts " for its centuries-long tradition in the printing and book trade .
after world war ii and the division of germany , frankfurt became the venue for the world 's biggest fair in the publishing industry , whereas leipzig , relegated to decades of communist rule , became primarily a forum for east-west publishers . internationally , leipzig is a city that has long been associated with values such as liberty and freedom of expression , having led the peaceful demonstrations in 1989 that led to the fall of the berlin wall .
it is also famous for its cultural life and the gewandhaus orchestra . at the time of german reunification in 1990 , publishing houses in the former east germany were shut down or integrated into west german ones .
but already in 1991 , the leipzig book fair came back with a vengeance .

thanks to public demand and a positive resonance from publishers in recent years , the four-day leipzig book fair , which will kick off on thursday , has emerged as europe 's largest literary festival for author readings and events . leipzig does not even strive to compete with frankfurt , but over the years , has established its own identity , especially with its popular concept " leipzig reads . "
unlike frankfurt , which is geared towards trade professionals , leipzig generates much of its business from the general public . children are welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comic books are one of the key attractions of the book fair during the day , the fair is held in new , modern facilities outside the city center , where literary fans from all walks of life gather - be it school classes storming the exhibits , parents pushing prams down the aisles , or readers coming into contact with internationally best-selling authors in an informal atmosphere .
a large chunk of the fairgrounds will also be devoted to children 's books and comics . in the evenings , numerous readings are offered throughout the city , in bookshops , cozy cafes or a city hall chamber .

below are some voices from verdi members at tuesday 's demonstration . jürgen rönsch , 37 cemetery maintenance worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rönsch " the strike is more justified than ever .
it 's not about these 18 minutes a day , it 's about our jobs .
everything 's being cut little by little , and no one can tell us that the 40-hour week wo n't lead to more cuts .
we want to keep these jobs for the future , for young people and we 're not going to back down .
it 's not easy for me financially , but i accept the losses .
i 'm ready to strike for as long as it takes and i think we have more support than the press says we do . " bärbel illi , 47 verdi union employee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bärbel illi " it 's going well and up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the results we want , and we can go on for a while since we have enough money in the strike fund .
i hope that this is a new beginning for the union , since the strike has brought us a lot of new members .
more people see now what the union is there for , why they need it .
i hope that it 's a revival for us . " heike fischer , 48 child-care worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike fischer " the press always focuses on parents who are against the strike , but where i work , out of 50 parents , there are just two who are against the strike .
but the press never talks about that .
i think it 's a conscious smear against our strike .
the parents stand with us , because they know what kind of quality we bring to the center , and they do n't want that quality to be reduced . " helmut zahner , 53 civil engineer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut zahner " we still think it 's absolutely necessary to strike .
we regret that employers are taking such a hard-line position and that it 's become a political fight in the meantime , especially when you see that the states governed by the christian democrats are being so unrelenting .
i 'm employed by the city in the civil engineering office and for 10 years i 've watched how jobs have been cut .
that 's why we do n't believe the mayor when he says this extension of working hours wo n't lead to job cuts .
there are some sectors where a 35-hour work week is the norm .
others in the private sector have 40 , but employees are compensated financially for that .
i do n't buy the argument that everyone has to work longer these days . " " the longer we strike , the more determined the strikers are .
you could feel it ; there 's a certain rage there and that helps strengthen our determination to keep going .
we 're more determined than ever . " gabriele krische , 44 kindergarten teacher bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriele krische " i am resolute because i do n't want jobs to be cut where i work .
we already have enough unemployed people here and i ca n't be part of a policy that leads to even more people losing their jobs .
i think that 's severe and cruel and that 's why i 'm standing here .
it 's very difficult , but in my profession , a very important aspect is to instill in children a sense of social responsibility .
that means we have to share the work and we ca n't stand by and just watch while others lose their jobs . " heike marwit , 29 child-care worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike marwit " we 're lucky that the parents where i work are understanding of what we 're doing - when i hear what has happened in some other places , where parents have blockaded exits and not let child-care workers leave the facility .
i think if we give up now , the whole thing would n't have made any sense and we should n't have bothered in the first place .
i wish it would have been wrapped up sooner , but what can we do about it ? " lutz bötzer , 45 special education teacher bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutz bötzer " i 've paid union dues for 25 years and never been on a strike .
i 've got to get my money 's worth !
i can only recommend that everybody strike because you see so many people that you hardly ever come across in this big bureaucracy where we work , especially since they 've cut out the company outing , where you 'd see people at least once a year .
now on strike , we 're forced to see each other .

but according to political economist friedrich schneider , that 's partly due to hypocritical western governments , who do n't want to be team players . an international conference on combating the financing of terrorism is being held in the hague on wednesday and thursday .
dw-world.de spoke with political economist friedrich schneider from johannes kepler university in linz , austria , about the chances of successfully cutting off terrorists ' money supplies and the obstacles preventing faster progress . dw-world.de : professor schneider , seven years ago , the g7 countries initiated the international financial action task force , or fatf .
it is meant to fight terrorist financing , but so far , the force has n't had any significant success .
why are these international efforts failing ? friedrich schneider : on an international level , next to nothing is being done .
it 's that simple .
every country is doing its own work , there 's no international cooperation that 's working .
data is n't even being exchanged in the aftermath of a terrorist attack , let alone cooperation among various secret services . why is n't there more cooperation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban leader mullah omar : the us funded the taliban in the past i 'll give you an example .
if the french finance covert operations in africa through their secret service , or if the germans pay ransom in iraq , do you think these governments want to publicly acknowledge this kind of financing ?
and good and evil can quickly change , as we know .
just take the taliban in afghanistan , for example .
for a long time , they were financed by the united states when the us was against russia .
this is where hypocrisy comes in .
if governments do n't want to expose their own covert financing operations , then they ca n't have any real interest in more efficient uncovering of money laundering . to what extent is money laundering linked to the financing of terrorism ?
money laundering is mostly associated with the drugs trade and human trafficking . terrorist financing is , broadly speaking , the financing of terrorist operations , and not all that much money is needed .
the september 2001 attacks cost just $ 500,000 , including flight training .
much more money is needed for the maintenance of terrorist bases .
to pull together this kind of funding , money from the drugs trade , illegal diamond trading or kidnapping is laundered . so is it mainly through the tracking of money laundering that sources of terrorist financing can be found ?
with money from legal operations … … you ca n't prevent the financing of terrorism .
there are donations to terrorist organizations - hamas for example .
it gets a lot of money from arab states for hospitals and schools , but where there 's no clear dividing line to show whether the money was used for terrorist acts . what can really be done to stop terrorist financing then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug money often ends up financing terrorist cells the first question is , whether there is any desire to effectively fight money laundering .
only then can you really combat terrorist financing .
to fight money laundering , you need international cooperation , and a task force that is just as agile and flexible as the terrorists .
this would also require the regulations prohibiting data exchange to be loosened , but so far that has n't happened . what can financial service providers do to stop terrorist financing ? that depends firstly on the extent to which they want to do business with people from the mafia or other organized criminals .
investigators rely on insider information from banks which often have little knowledge about how clean certain transactions are . as a political economist , you 've called for combating poverty and promoting democratic values as a way to stop terrorism .
why ? simply put , people who earn money do n't throw bombs .
if i have a house , a car , and a well-paid job , i 'm less likely to become a terrorist .
there will always be fanatics who resort to terrorism regardless of their income , but they 'll be far fewer .
it 's about drying up part of the basis for terrorism , which is why fighting poverty is such an effective strategy .
in addition to this , we have to fight religious extremism , and deal with religious differences in a peaceful manner , but there have only been half-hearted attempts at that so far . that does n't sound very optimistic .
how do you think the financing of terrorism will develop in the future ? unfortunately , i think europe will have to experience two or three more attacks before we start to work more closely together . martin schrader interviewed friedrich schneider send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops the agenda in warsaw as the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member council of europe enters its last day in warsaw , talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime .

below are some voices from verdi members at tuesday 's demonstration . jürgen rönsch , 37 cemetery maintenance worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rönsch " the strike is more justified than ever .
it 's not about these 18 minutes a day , it 's about our jobs .
everything 's being cut little by little , and no one can tell us that the 40-hour week wo n't lead to more cuts .
we want to keep these jobs for the future , for young people and we 're not going to back down .
it 's not easy for me financially , but i accept the losses .
i 'm ready to strike for as long as it takes and i think we have more support than the press says we do . " bärbel illi , 47 verdi union employee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bärbel illi " it 's going well and up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the results we want , and we can go on for a while since we have enough money in the strike fund .
i hope that this is a new beginning for the union , since the strike has brought us a lot of new members .
more people see now what the union is there for , why they need it .
i hope that it 's a revival for us . " heike fischer , 48 child-care worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike fischer " the press always focuses on parents who are against the strike , but where i work , out of 50 parents , there are just two who are against the strike .
but the press never talks about that .
i think it 's a conscious smear against our strike .
the parents stand with us , because they know what kind of quality we bring to the center , and they do n't want that quality to be reduced . " helmut zahner , 53 civil engineer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut zahner " we still think it 's absolutely necessary to strike .
we regret that employers are taking such a hard-line position and that it 's become a political fight in the meantime , especially when you see that the states governed by the christian democrats are being so unrelenting .
i 'm employed by the city in the civil engineering office and for 10 years i 've watched how jobs have been cut .
that 's why we do n't believe the mayor when he says this extension of working hours wo n't lead to job cuts .
there are some sectors where a 35-hour work week is the norm .
others in the private sector have 40 , but employees are compensated financially for that .
i do n't buy the argument that everyone has to work longer these days . " " the longer we strike , the more determined the strikers are .
you could feel it ; there 's a certain rage there and that helps strengthen our determination to keep going .
we 're more determined than ever . " gabriele krische , 44 kindergarten teacher bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriele krische " i am resolute because i do n't want jobs to be cut where i work .
we already have enough unemployed people here and i ca n't be part of a policy that leads to even more people losing their jobs .
i think that 's severe and cruel and that 's why i 'm standing here .
it 's very difficult , but in my profession , a very important aspect is to instill in children a sense of social responsibility .
that means we have to share the work and we ca n't stand by and just watch while others lose their jobs . " heike marwit , 29 child-care worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike marwit " we 're lucky that the parents where i work are understanding of what we 're doing - when i hear what has happened in some other places , where parents have blockaded exits and not let child-care workers leave the facility .
i think if we give up now , the whole thing would n't have made any sense and we should n't have bothered in the first place .
i wish it would have been wrapped up sooner , but what can we do about it ? " lutz bötzer , 45 special education teacher bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutz bötzer " i 've paid union dues for 25 years and never been on a strike .
i 've got to get my money 's worth !
i can only recommend that everybody strike because you see so many people that you hardly ever come across in this big bureaucracy where we work , especially since they 've cut out the company outing , where you 'd see people at least once a year .
now on strike , we 're forced to see each other .

below are some voices from verdi members at tuesday 's demonstration . jürgen rönsch , 37 cemetery maintenance worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rönsch " the strike is more justified than ever .
it 's not about these 18 minutes a day , it 's about our jobs .
everything 's being cut little by little , and no one can tell us that the 40-hour week wo n't lead to more cuts .
we want to keep these jobs for the future , for young people and we 're not going to back down .
it 's not easy for me financially , but i accept the losses .
i 'm ready to strike for as long as it takes and i think we have more support than the press says we do . " bärbel illi , 47 verdi union employee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bärbel illi " it 's going well and up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the results we want , and we can go on for a while since we have enough money in the strike fund .
i hope that this is a new beginning for the union , since the strike has brought us a lot of new members .
more people see now what the union is there for , why they need it .
i hope that it 's a revival for us . " heike fischer , 48 child-care worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike fischer " the press always focuses on parents who are against the strike , but where i work , out of 50 parents , there are just two who are against the strike .
but the press never talks about that .
i think it 's a conscious smear against our strike .
the parents stand with us , because they know what kind of quality we bring to the center , and they do n't want that quality to be reduced . " helmut zahner , 53 civil engineer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut zahner " we still think it 's absolutely necessary to strike .
we regret that employers are taking such a hard-line position and that it 's become a political fight in the meantime , especially when you see that the states governed by the christian democrats are being so unrelenting .
i 'm employed by the city in the civil engineering office and for 10 years i 've watched how jobs have been cut .
that 's why we do n't believe the mayor when he says this extension of working hours wo n't lead to job cuts .
there are some sectors where a 35-hour work week is the norm .
others in the private sector have 40 , but employees are compensated financially for that .
i do n't buy the argument that everyone has to work longer these days . " " the longer we strike , the more determined the strikers are .
you could feel it ; there 's a certain rage there and that helps strengthen our determination to keep going .
we 're more determined than ever . " gabriele krische , 44 kindergarten teacher bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriele krische " i am resolute because i do n't want jobs to be cut where i work .
we already have enough unemployed people here and i ca n't be part of a policy that leads to even more people losing their jobs .
i think that 's severe and cruel and that 's why i 'm standing here .
it 's very difficult , but in my profession , a very important aspect is to instill in children a sense of social responsibility .
that means we have to share the work and we ca n't stand by and just watch while others lose their jobs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.03.2006 strikers in for the long haul as arbitrators brought in großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesting strikers in stuttgart say they are n't ready to back down , even after six weeks as germany 's public-sector strikes mark week six , arbitration is now being seen as a possible way to bring the sides closer .
in stuttgart , at the heart of the labor action , union members say they 're determined to win . it is about symbolism , many analysts say , this protracted work stoppage by the verdi services union that has closed kindergartens , interrupted hospital services and kept garbage collection trucks idle inside city garages .
while that symbolism may be about union power and unions ' futures , there 's another powerful symbol of germany 's biggest public-service stoppage in 14 years : trash . these days , it 's everywhere in stuttgart , this usually pristine city in southwestern germany , capital of the state of baden-württemberg and one of the principle cities of the historical region of swabia .
the swabians , as the stereotype goes , are not only extraordinarily thrifty ; they can be fanatically clean .
but six weeks into this public-sector strike , clean is hard to come by , at least in the public sphere .
the city is swimming in garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many explosions of trash around stuttgart trashcans have been filled to overflowing , and often , packed to the breaking point , have dumped their contents in a messy circle around them .
stuttgart 's street curbs have become the resting place for a rising tide of daily detritus : mcdonald 's cups , candy wrappers , cigarette packs and old napkins . " i 've had enough of this strike , " said doris laphardt , 46 , as she stepped over a pile of discarded paper in a central square .
" this place is beginning to look like new york . " arbitration but there could be a glimmer of hope in the strike that until just yesterday , showed no signs of coming to an end .
municipal authorities in baden-württemberg and the verdi services union said on tuesday they were bringing in outside arbitrators to try to bring the union and public-sector employers , who up until now have dug in their heels in negotiations , come closer together . the two sides have agreed to bring in two arbitrators , the head of aok health insurance for baden-württemberg , roland sing , and a former president of the state 's administrative court , claus messner .
the two began familiarizing themselves with the material on wednesday morning and talks were planned to begin between representatives from verdi and employers during the afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike hq in stuttgart employers want to extend the working week from 38.5 hour to 40 hour without an increase in pay .
they say they need to ease up pressure on state coffers - personnel costs consume almost one-half of state budgets - and argue that many other civil servants , not to mention the private sector , already work 40-hour weeks .
employers argue that they are asking public-sector employees to only add 18 minutes to each working day . verdi counters that increasing the working week will cut employees ' take home pay , which would further erode already weak consumer spending in germany .
the union also says the change could endanger some 250,000 jobs in the public sector . verdi , along with most of germany 's trade unions , has been struggling with falling membership and an increasing feeling among the populace that it is obstructionist and out of step with the realities of today 's labor environment .
while 18 minutes a day does not seem like much to ask to help prop up struggling state governments , observers say the strike has become a test of verdi 's ability to maintain its strong role in germany 's centralized bargaining system , which is increasingly under attack . " it 's really about symbolism .
the real point is whether they are forced to capitulate on this very symbolic point , " deutsche bank economist stefan schneider told reuters . noisy determination on a cold but clear tuesday morning outside the verdi headquarters in stuttgart , thoughts of capitulation were not in evidence .
at 10:30 a.m. , amid blowing whistles and rattling noisemakers , a group of some 2,500 strikers began a protest march .
carrying banners , waving red verdi flags and chanting slogans , the strikers made their way from the union building through central stuttgart to a large square where speakers encouraged them to stay the fight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching through stuttgart there did not seem to be need for much encouraging .
in fact , the mood was almost festive , now six weeks into the labor action .
instead of slumped shoulders and resigned expressions , the crowd was marked by a strong sense of determination to fight the fight for as long as it takes . " up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the result we want , and we can go on for a while .
we have enough money in the strike fund , " said bärbel illi , 47 , an employee of verdi 's stuttgart branch . heike fischer , 48 , is a child-care worker who said that although the media liked to focus on the trouble some parents have had since their child-care facilities have been closed , most parents were behind the action . " of course , all of us would rather not be on strike anymore , we would like to be with the children , " she said .
" but we ca n't stop now if we want to have a future .
we ca n't give up now , and i 'm ready to continue until we are successful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confrontation between garbage workers replacement workers many of the striking sanitation workers wore signs that said " strikebreakers , hands off our trash ! " referring to the private firms that have been hired to take care of some of the city 's sanitation problems .
those two worlds collided briefly after the main rally when a group of striking workers came across a private garbage truck waiting at a stoplight .
the group stepped in front of the vehicle and , yelling at the three men sitting inside , tried to cover the truck 's windshield with posters to prevent it from driving on .
police had to disperse the group . verdi officials say that besides showing its strength , the strike has mobilized union members , many of whom had begun wondering why they were bothering to pay their monthly dues . " it was important that the unions do something , " said jürgen rönsch , 37 , a cemetery maintenance worker .
" in my department there was hardly anyone left in the union , since it never did anything .
but now people have been coming back . " public support waning while the strike has given verdi a boost in popularity among those in sectors it represents , it is less clear how the strike will play out among the populace at large .
public disgruntlement about the labor action is growing .
in a poll last week carried out for the zdf public television channel , 61 percent of germans opposed the protests , up six percentage points from a poll conducted on feb .
17 . union members in stuttgart claim the local media is overplaying the dissatisfaction felt by stuttgart residents about the strike and the resulting piles of trash .
but on tuesday , most residents asked said they thought it was time for the striking workers to get back on the job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tired of the trash some were split on the issue , like 50-year-old maria schlom , who said she was tired of the trash but trying to remain open : " i can sympathize if the fear is really about losing jobs , " she said .
" but if it 's just about working 40 hours in a week , that i ca n't understand . " others supported the action in the beginning but felt that the union had taken things too far .
" when they 're blocking entrances so trucks ca n't spread grit on icy streets or private firms ca n't take away garbage , that 's too much , " said agathe hiller , 48 . but karl-heinz walther , 62 , who was visiting stuttgart with his wife for the day , said he was fully behind the striking workers .
" the employers just have to give a little and it 'd be all over . " when told that his response was a minority one , his wife chimed in : " maybe that 's because we 're not from stuttgart .

in stuttgart , at the heart of the labor action , union members say they 're determined to win . it is about symbolism , many analysts say , this protracted work stoppage by the verdi services union that has closed kindergartens , interrupted hospital services and kept garbage collection trucks idle inside city garages .
while that symbolism may be about union power and unions ' futures , there 's another powerful symbol of germany 's biggest public-service stoppage in 14 years : trash . these days , it 's everywhere in stuttgart , this usually pristine city in southwestern germany , capital of the state of baden-württemberg and one of the principle cities of the historical region of swabia .
the swabians , as the stereotype goes , are not only extraordinarily thrifty ; they can be fanatically clean .
but six weeks into this public-sector strike , clean is hard to come by , at least in the public sphere .
the city is swimming in garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many explosions of trash around stuttgart trashcans have been filled to overflowing , and often , packed to the breaking point , have dumped their contents in a messy circle around them .
stuttgart 's street curbs have become the resting place for a rising tide of daily detritus : mcdonald 's cups , candy wrappers , cigarette packs and old napkins . " i 've had enough of this strike , " said doris laphardt , 46 , as she stepped over a pile of discarded paper in a central square .
" this place is beginning to look like new york . " arbitration but there could be a glimmer of hope in the strike that until just yesterday , showed no signs of coming to an end .
municipal authorities in baden-württemberg and the verdi services union said on tuesday they were bringing in outside arbitrators to try to bring the union and public-sector employers , who up until now have dug in their heels in negotiations , come closer together . the two sides have agreed to bring in two arbitrators , the head of aok health insurance for baden-württemberg , roland sing , and a former president of the state 's administrative court , claus messner .
the two began familiarizing themselves with the material on wednesday morning and talks were planned to begin between representatives from verdi and employers during the afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike hq in stuttgart employers want to extend the working week from 38.5 hour to 40 hour without an increase in pay .
they say they need to ease up pressure on state coffers - personnel costs consume almost one-half of state budgets - and argue that many other civil servants , not to mention the private sector , already work 40-hour weeks .
employers argue that they are asking public-sector employees to only add 18 minutes to each working day . verdi counters that increasing the working week will cut employees ' take home pay , which would further erode already weak consumer spending in germany .
the union also says the change could endanger some 250,000 jobs in the public sector . verdi , along with most of germany 's trade unions , has been struggling with falling membership and an increasing feeling among the populace that it is obstructionist and out of step with the realities of today 's labor environment .
while 18 minutes a day does not seem like much to ask to help prop up struggling state governments , observers say the strike has become a test of verdi 's ability to maintain its strong role in germany 's centralized bargaining system , which is increasingly under attack . " it 's really about symbolism .
the real point is whether they are forced to capitulate on this very symbolic point , " deutsche bank economist stefan schneider told reuters . noisy determination on a cold but clear tuesday morning outside the verdi headquarters in stuttgart , thoughts of capitulation were not in evidence .
at 10:30 a.m. , amid blowing whistles and rattling noisemakers , a group of some 2,500 strikers began a protest march .
carrying banners , waving red verdi flags and chanting slogans , the strikers made their way from the union building through central stuttgart to a large square where speakers encouraged them to stay the fight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching through stuttgart there did not seem to be need for much encouraging .
in fact , the mood was almost festive , now six weeks into the labor action .
instead of slumped shoulders and resigned expressions , the crowd was marked by a strong sense of determination to fight the fight for as long as it takes . " up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the result we want , and we can go on for a while .
we have enough money in the strike fund , " said bärbel illi , 47 , an employee of verdi 's stuttgart branch . heike fischer , 48 , is a child-care worker who said that although the media liked to focus on the trouble some parents have had since their child-care facilities have been closed , most parents were behind the action . " of course , all of us would rather not be on strike anymore , we would like to be with the children , " she said .
" but we ca n't stop now if we want to have a future .
we ca n't give up now , and i 'm ready to continue until we are successful . "

" referring to the private firms that have been hired to take care of some of the city 's sanitation problems .
those two worlds collided briefly after the main rally when a group of striking workers came across a private garbage truck waiting at a stoplight .
the group stepped in front of the vehicle and , yelling at the three men sitting inside , tried to cover the truck 's windshield with posters to prevent it from driving on .
police had to disperse the group . verdi officials say that besides showing its strength , the strike has mobilized union members , many of whom had begun wondering why they were bothering to pay their monthly dues . " it was important that the unions do something , " said jürgen rönsch , 37 , a cemetery maintenance worker .
" in my department there was hardly anyone left in the union , since it never did anything .
but now people have been coming back . " public support waning while the strike has given verdi a boost in popularity among those in sectors it represents , it is less clear how the strike will play out among the populace at large .
public disgruntlement about the labor action is growing .
in a poll last week carried out for the zdf public television channel , 61 percent of germans opposed the protests , up six percentage points from a poll conducted on feb .

but on tuesday , most residents asked said they thought it was time for the striking workers to get back on the job .

" but if it 's just about working 40 hours in a week , that i ca n't understand . " others supported the action in the beginning but felt that the union had taken things too far .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.03.2006 why the fight against terrorist financing is faltering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money laundering and the financing of terrorism go hand in hand the financing of international terrorism is notoriously hard to stop .
but according to political economist friedrich schneider , that 's partly due to hypocritical western governments , who do n't want to be team players . an international conference on combating the financing of terrorism is being held in the hague on wednesday and thursday .
dw-world.de spoke with political economist friedrich schneider from johannes kepler university in linz , austria , about the chances of successfully cutting off terrorists ' money supplies and the obstacles preventing faster progress . dw-world.de : professor schneider , seven years ago , the g7 countries initiated the international financial action task force , or fatf .
it is meant to fight terrorist financing , but so far , the force has n't had any significant success .
why are these international efforts failing ? friedrich schneider : on an international level , next to nothing is being done .
it 's that simple .
every country is doing its own work , there 's no international cooperation that 's working .
data is n't even being exchanged in the aftermath of a terrorist attack , let alone cooperation among various secret services . why is n't there more cooperation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban leader mullah omar : the us funded the taliban in the past i 'll give you an example .
if the french finance covert operations in africa through their secret service , or if the germans pay ransom in iraq , do you think these governments want to publicly acknowledge this kind of financing ?
and good and evil can quickly change , as we know .
just take the taliban in afghanistan , for example .
for a long time , they were financed by the united states when the us was against russia .
this is where hypocrisy comes in .
if governments do n't want to expose their own covert financing operations , then they ca n't have any real interest in more efficient uncovering of money laundering . to what extent is money laundering linked to the financing of terrorism ?
money laundering is mostly associated with the drugs trade and human trafficking . terrorist financing is , broadly speaking , the financing of terrorist operations , and not all that much money is needed .
the september 2001 attacks cost just $ 500,000 , including flight training .
much more money is needed for the maintenance of terrorist bases .
to pull together this kind of funding , money from the drugs trade , illegal diamond trading or kidnapping is laundered . so is it mainly through the tracking of money laundering that sources of terrorist financing can be found ?
with money from legal operations … … you ca n't prevent the financing of terrorism .
there are donations to terrorist organizations - hamas for example .
it gets a lot of money from arab states for hospitals and schools , but where there 's no clear dividing line to show whether the money was used for terrorist acts . what can really be done to stop terrorist financing then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug money often ends up financing terrorist cells the first question is , whether there is any desire to effectively fight money laundering .
only then can you really combat terrorist financing .
to fight money laundering , you need international cooperation , and a task force that is just as agile and flexible as the terrorists .
this would also require the regulations prohibiting data exchange to be loosened , but so far that has n't happened . what can financial service providers do to stop terrorist financing ? that depends firstly on the extent to which they want to do business with people from the mafia or other organized criminals .
investigators rely on insider information from banks which often have little knowledge about how clean certain transactions are . as a political economist , you 've called for combating poverty and promoting democratic values as a way to stop terrorism .
why ? simply put , people who earn money do n't throw bombs .
if i have a house , a car , and a well-paid job , i 'm less likely to become a terrorist .
there will always be fanatics who resort to terrorism regardless of their income , but they 'll be far fewer .
it 's about drying up part of the basis for terrorism , which is why fighting poverty is such an effective strategy .
in addition to this , we have to fight religious extremism , and deal with religious differences in a peaceful manner , but there have only been half-hearted attempts at that so far . that does n't sound very optimistic .
how do you think the financing of terrorism will develop in the future ? unfortunately , i think europe will have to experience two or three more attacks before we start to work more closely together . martin schrader interviewed friedrich schneider send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops the agenda in warsaw as the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member council of europe enters its last day in warsaw , talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime .

but according to political economist friedrich schneider , that 's partly due to hypocritical western governments , who do n't want to be team players . an international conference on combating the financing of terrorism is being held in the hague on wednesday and thursday .
dw-world.de spoke with political economist friedrich schneider from johannes kepler university in linz , austria , about the chances of successfully cutting off terrorists ' money supplies and the obstacles preventing faster progress . dw-world.de : professor schneider , seven years ago , the g7 countries initiated the international financial action task force , or fatf .
it is meant to fight terrorist financing , but so far , the force has n't had any significant success .
why are these international efforts failing ? friedrich schneider : on an international level , next to nothing is being done .
it 's that simple .
every country is doing its own work , there 's no international cooperation that 's working .
data is n't even being exchanged in the aftermath of a terrorist attack , let alone cooperation among various secret services . why is n't there more cooperation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban leader mullah omar : the us funded the taliban in the past i 'll give you an example .
if the french finance covert operations in africa through their secret service , or if the germans pay ransom in iraq , do you think these governments want to publicly acknowledge this kind of financing ?
and good and evil can quickly change , as we know .
just take the taliban in afghanistan , for example .
for a long time , they were financed by the united states when the us was against russia .
this is where hypocrisy comes in .
if governments do n't want to expose their own covert financing operations , then they ca n't have any real interest in more efficient uncovering of money laundering . to what extent is money laundering linked to the financing of terrorism ?
money laundering is mostly associated with the drugs trade and human trafficking . terrorist financing is , broadly speaking , the financing of terrorist operations , and not all that much money is needed .
the september 2001 attacks cost just $ 500,000 , including flight training .
much more money is needed for the maintenance of terrorist bases .
to pull together this kind of funding , money from the drugs trade , illegal diamond trading or kidnapping is laundered . so is it mainly through the tracking of money laundering that sources of terrorist financing can be found ?
with money from legal operations … … you ca n't prevent the financing of terrorism .
there are donations to terrorist organizations - hamas for example .
it gets a lot of money from arab states for hospitals and schools , but where there 's no clear dividing line to show whether the money was used for terrorist acts . what can really be done to stop terrorist financing then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug money often ends up financing terrorist cells the first question is , whether there is any desire to effectively fight money laundering .
only then can you really combat terrorist financing .

work-life balance gets boost in germany the dumbing down of germany gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids germany -pipe- 15.03.2006 politicians discuss pension cuts for childless germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's younger generation is dwindling new statistics confirming the declining birth rate have sent germany in to a state of panic , amid a growing consensus that pensions should be increased for people with children and reduced for those without . " people without children should either receive a reduced pension or pay more into pension schemes , " said norbert geis from the csu . johann eekhoff , director of the cologne institute for economic policy said a reform of the pension system was long overdue . " people without children should never have been admitted into pension schemes because these only work when they are financed by subsequent generations , " he said in an interview with mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" their pensions should be cut by 50 percent . " cdu politician elisabeth winkelmeier-becker agreed , pointing out that working parents are financially disadvantaged compared to their childless peers .
" in the long-term , we need to consider awarding people without children lower pensions , " she said . chilling statistics the headline in germany 's mass-selling daily bild on wednesday said it all : " baby shock : we germans are dying out , " the paper screamed . that might sound a bit extreme , but latest figures , based on data collected at the federal statistics office , released on tuesday have sent a chill among demographers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more babies were born in post-war year of 1946 than today last year , only some 676,000 children were born in germany according to german daily die welt which cited forecasts by the federal statistics office .
that pushed the birth rate to its worst low in 15 years : in 2004 , the number of newborns amounted to 706,000 .
that 's all still significantly less than the 922,000 births in the post-war year of 1946 . " that 's dramatic , we 're running into a dead end , " michael hüther , director of the cologne-based institute for the german economy told the paper . wiesbaden on top the demographic figures have also shown huge variations in germany 's 50 largest cities . the eastern german city of magdeburg , the capital of saxony-anhalt , took the dubious honor of having the lowest birth rate in the country : only some 6.9 children per 1000 inhabitants are born in the city on a yearly average . as against that , the significantly richer city of wiesbaden near frankfurt , has the highest birth rate with 10.5 births per 1000 inhabitants .
the western german cities of frankfurt and bonn followed closely , while the capital berlin also features on spot 30 with a birthrate of 8.7 . issue being taken seriously though the latest statistics have come as a shock , the issue is hardly new in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is apparently doing things better when it comes to boosting its birth rate according to eurostat , the eu statistics office , there were 8.5 births per 1000 inhabitants in germany in 2004 - making it the country with the lowest birth rate in the entire european union .
countries such as france and britain boasted birthrates - at 12.7 and 12.0 respectively in the same year - that exceeded german levels by more than 50 percent . for years , politicians and demographers in germany have warned of the dangers of a falling birth rate and ageing population .
in recent months in particular , the subject has raced to the top of the political agenda and been the focus of heated debates over family-friendly and childcare policies . the damning pisa study on germany 's faltering education standards has also stepped up the urgency surrounding the issue .
in january this year , the ruling grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats decided to make it easier for working mothers to continue being part of the labor market , increasing tax breaks on child care , encourage setting up full-day schools and making kindergartens cost-free . chancellor merkel 's family affairs minister , ursula von der leyen , a mother of seven children herself , has also been credited with pushing for family-friendly policies and ensuring that the issue remains in the political spotlight . much more to be done but , it 's obvious that more needs to be done . on wednesday , johannes singhammer , family affairs spokesman for the conservative union of the christian democrats and christian social democrats demanded that demographic policies had to be given a high priority . efforts to fight the " free fall of births " had to take a place at the center of politics alongside the battle against unemployment and reining in the ballooning deficit , singhammer added . dw staff -lrb- sp / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : learning to think outside the box once dismissed as " nonsense " by former chancellor schröder , family policies have now climbed to the top of germany 's political agenda .

work-life balance gets boost in germany the dumbing down of germany gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids germany -pipe- 15.03.2006 politicians discuss pension cuts for childless germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's younger generation is dwindling new statistics confirming the declining birth rate have sent germany in to a state of panic , amid a growing consensus that pensions should be increased for people with children and reduced for those without . " people without children should either receive a reduced pension or pay more into pension schemes , " said norbert geis from the csu . johann eekhoff , director of the cologne institute for economic policy said a reform of the pension system was long overdue . " people without children should never have been admitted into pension schemes because these only work when they are financed by subsequent generations , " he said in an interview with mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" their pensions should be cut by 50 percent . " cdu politician elisabeth winkelmeier-becker agreed , pointing out that working parents are financially disadvantaged compared to their childless peers .
" in the long-term , we need to consider awarding people without children lower pensions , " she said . chilling statistics the headline in germany 's mass-selling daily bild on wednesday said it all : " baby shock : we germans are dying out , " the paper screamed . that might sound a bit extreme , but latest figures , based on data collected at the federal statistics office , released on tuesday have sent a chill among demographers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more babies were born in post-war year of 1946 than today last year , only some 676,000 children were born in germany according to german daily die welt which cited forecasts by the federal statistics office .
that pushed the birth rate to its worst low in 15 years : in 2004 , the number of newborns amounted to 706,000 .
that 's all still significantly less than the 922,000 births in the post-war year of 1946 . " that 's dramatic , we 're running into a dead end , " michael hüther , director of the cologne-based institute for the german economy told the paper . wiesbaden on top the demographic figures have also shown huge variations in germany 's 50 largest cities . the eastern german city of magdeburg , the capital of saxony-anhalt , took the dubious honor of having the lowest birth rate in the country : only some 6.9 children per 1000 inhabitants are born in the city on a yearly average . as against that , the significantly richer city of wiesbaden near frankfurt , has the highest birth rate with 10.5 births per 1000 inhabitants .
the western german cities of frankfurt and bonn followed closely , while the capital berlin also features on spot 30 with a birthrate of 8.7 . issue being taken seriously though the latest statistics have come as a shock , the issue is hardly new in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is apparently doing things better when it comes to boosting its birth rate according to eurostat , the eu statistics office , there were 8.5 births per 1000 inhabitants in germany in 2004 - making it the country with the lowest birth rate in the entire european union .
countries such as france and britain boasted birthrates - at 12.7 and 12.0 respectively in the same year - that exceeded german levels by more than 50 percent . for years , politicians and demographers in germany have warned of the dangers of a falling birth rate and ageing population .
in recent months in particular , the subject has raced to the top of the political agenda and been the focus of heated debates over family-friendly and childcare policies . the damning pisa study on germany 's faltering education standards has also stepped up the urgency surrounding the issue .
in january this year , the ruling grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats decided to make it easier for working mothers to continue being part of the labor market , increasing tax breaks on child care , encourage setting up full-day schools and making kindergartens cost-free . chancellor merkel 's family affairs minister , ursula von der leyen , a mother of seven children herself , has also been credited with pushing for family-friendly policies and ensuring that the issue remains in the political spotlight . much more to be done but , it 's obvious that more needs to be done . on wednesday , johannes singhammer , family affairs spokesman for the conservative union of the christian democrats and christian social democrats demanded that demographic policies had to be given a high priority . efforts to fight the " free fall of births " had to take a place at the center of politics alongside the battle against unemployment and reining in the ballooning deficit , singhammer added . dw staff -lrb- sp / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : learning to think outside the box once dismissed as " nonsense " by former chancellor schröder , family policies have now climbed to the top of germany 's political agenda .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.03.2006 a spring festival for books großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-day fair kicks off on thursday the key to the success of the leipzig book fair is that there is something for everyone , from works by budding novelists to world renowned authors , comic books and audio books and much more ... each year , there are two book fairs in germany : in the autumn , the massive international trade fair in frankfurt , and in the spring , the more intimate leipzig book fair that brings together authors and readers .
thanks to public demand and a positive resonance from publishers in recent years , the four-day leipzig book fair , which will kick off on thursday , has emerged as europe 's largest literary festival for author readings and events . leipzig does not even strive to compete with frankfurt , but over the years , has established its own identity , especially with its popular concept " leipzig reads . "

below are some voices from verdi members at tuesday 's demonstration . jürgen rönsch , 37 cemetery maintenance worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rönsch " the strike is more justified than ever .
it 's not about these 18 minutes a day , it 's about our jobs .
everything 's being cut little by little , and no one can tell us that the 40-hour week wo n't lead to more cuts .
we want to keep these jobs for the future , for young people and we 're not going to back down .
it 's not easy for me financially , but i accept the losses .
i 'm ready to strike for as long as it takes and i think we have more support than the press says we do . " bärbel illi , 47 verdi union employee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bärbel illi " it 's going well and up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the results we want , and we can go on for a while since we have enough money in the strike fund .
i hope that this is a new beginning for the union , since the strike has brought us a lot of new members .
more people see now what the union is there for , why they need it .
i hope that it 's a revival for us . " heike fischer , 48 child-care worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike fischer " the press always focuses on parents who are against the strike , but where i work , out of 50 parents , there are just two who are against the strike .
but the press never talks about that .
i think it 's a conscious smear against our strike .
the parents stand with us , because they know what kind of quality we bring to the center , and they do n't want that quality to be reduced . " helmut zahner , 53 civil engineer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut zahner " we still think it 's absolutely necessary to strike .
we regret that employers are taking such a hard-line position and that it 's become a political fight in the meantime , especially when you see that the states governed by the christian democrats are being so unrelenting .
i 'm employed by the city in the civil engineering office and for 10 years i 've watched how jobs have been cut .
that 's why we do n't believe the mayor when he says this extension of working hours wo n't lead to job cuts .
there are some sectors where a 35-hour work week is the norm .
others in the private sector have 40 , but employees are compensated financially for that .
i do n't buy the argument that everyone has to work longer these days . " " the longer we strike , the more determined the strikers are .
you could feel it ; there 's a certain rage there and that helps strengthen our determination to keep going .
we 're more determined than ever . " gabriele krische , 44 kindergarten teacher bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriele krische " i am resolute because i do n't want jobs to be cut where i work .
we already have enough unemployed people here and i ca n't be part of a policy that leads to even more people losing their jobs .
i think that 's severe and cruel and that 's why i 'm standing here .
it 's very difficult , but in my profession , a very important aspect is to instill in children a sense of social responsibility .
that means we have to share the work and we ca n't stand by and just watch while others lose their jobs . " heike marwit , 29 child-care worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike marwit " we 're lucky that the parents where i work are understanding of what we 're doing - when i hear what has happened in some other places , where parents have blockaded exits and not let child-care workers leave the facility .
i think if we give up now , the whole thing would n't have made any sense and we should n't have bothered in the first place .
i wish it would have been wrapped up sooner , but what can we do about it ? " lutz bötzer , 45 special education teacher bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutz bötzer " i 've paid union dues for 25 years and never been on a strike .
i 've got to get my money 's worth !
i can only recommend that everybody strike because you see so many people that you hardly ever come across in this big bureaucracy where we work , especially since they 've cut out the company outing , where you 'd see people at least once a year .
now on strike , we 're forced to see each other .

thanks to public demand and a positive resonance from publishers in recent years , the four-day leipzig book fair , which will kick off on thursday , has emerged as europe 's largest literary festival for author readings and events . leipzig does not even strive to compete with frankfurt , but over the years , has established its own identity , especially with its popular concept " leipzig reads . "
unlike frankfurt , which is geared towards trade professionals , leipzig generates much of its business from the general public . children are welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comic books are one of the key attractions of the book fair during the day , the fair is held in new , modern facilities outside the city center , where literary fans from all walks of life gather - be it school classes storming the exhibits , parents pushing prams down the aisles , or readers coming into contact with internationally best-selling authors in an informal atmosphere .
a large chunk of the fairgrounds will also be devoted to children 's books and comics . in the evenings , numerous readings are offered throughout the city , in bookshops , cozy cafes or a city hall chamber .
there will be 1,800 events this year alone , and late night partygoers could even bump into vladimir kaminer , the german-russian author of " russian disco , " who doubles up as a disc jockey . emphasis on german literature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author vladimir kaminer will double up as a disc jockey for the fair what distinguishes leipzig from frankfurt , is the strong emphasis on german-language literature and its knack for discovering young talent .
a number of well-known authors , such as ingo schulze , got their publishing start at the fair .
schulze , along with max frisch , and heinrich böll , is among the very few german authors , who have had the distinction of being published in the new yorker magazine . the magic of leipzig is that everyone can find his or her niche , whether it is the budding novelist or a world renowned author , according to oliver zille , head of the book fair . given the proximity of this city in saxony to central and eastern europe , the foreign focus is on showcasing up-and-coming authors from that region and launching them in the german-language market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.03.2006 why the fight against terrorist financing is faltering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money laundering and the financing of terrorism go hand in hand the financing of international terrorism is notoriously hard to stop .
but according to political economist friedrich schneider , that 's partly due to hypocritical western governments , who do n't want to be team players . an international conference on combating the financing of terrorism is being held in the hague on wednesday and thursday .
dw-world.de spoke with political economist friedrich schneider from johannes kepler university in linz , austria , about the chances of successfully cutting off terrorists ' money supplies and the obstacles preventing faster progress . dw-world.de : professor schneider , seven years ago , the g7 countries initiated the international financial action task force , or fatf .
it is meant to fight terrorist financing , but so far , the force has n't had any significant success .
why are these international efforts failing ? friedrich schneider : on an international level , next to nothing is being done .
it 's that simple .
every country is doing its own work , there 's no international cooperation that 's working .
data is n't even being exchanged in the aftermath of a terrorist attack , let alone cooperation among various secret services . why is n't there more cooperation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban leader mullah omar : the us funded the taliban in the past i 'll give you an example .
if the french finance covert operations in africa through their secret service , or if the germans pay ransom in iraq , do you think these governments want to publicly acknowledge this kind of financing ?
and good and evil can quickly change , as we know .
just take the taliban in afghanistan , for example .
for a long time , they were financed by the united states when the us was against russia .
this is where hypocrisy comes in .
if governments do n't want to expose their own covert financing operations , then they ca n't have any real interest in more efficient uncovering of money laundering . to what extent is money laundering linked to the financing of terrorism ?
money laundering is mostly associated with the drugs trade and human trafficking . terrorist financing is , broadly speaking , the financing of terrorist operations , and not all that much money is needed .
the september 2001 attacks cost just $ 500,000 , including flight training .
much more money is needed for the maintenance of terrorist bases .
to pull together this kind of funding , money from the drugs trade , illegal diamond trading or kidnapping is laundered . so is it mainly through the tracking of money laundering that sources of terrorist financing can be found ?
with money from legal operations … … you ca n't prevent the financing of terrorism .
there are donations to terrorist organizations - hamas for example .
it gets a lot of money from arab states for hospitals and schools , but where there 's no clear dividing line to show whether the money was used for terrorist acts . what can really be done to stop terrorist financing then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug money often ends up financing terrorist cells the first question is , whether there is any desire to effectively fight money laundering .
only then can you really combat terrorist financing .
to fight money laundering , you need international cooperation , and a task force that is just as agile and flexible as the terrorists .
this would also require the regulations prohibiting data exchange to be loosened , but so far that has n't happened . what can financial service providers do to stop terrorist financing ? that depends firstly on the extent to which they want to do business with people from the mafia or other organized criminals .
investigators rely on insider information from banks which often have little knowledge about how clean certain transactions are . as a political economist , you 've called for combating poverty and promoting democratic values as a way to stop terrorism .
why ? simply put , people who earn money do n't throw bombs .
if i have a house , a car , and a well-paid job , i 'm less likely to become a terrorist .
there will always be fanatics who resort to terrorism regardless of their income , but they 'll be far fewer .
it 's about drying up part of the basis for terrorism , which is why fighting poverty is such an effective strategy .
in addition to this , we have to fight religious extremism , and deal with religious differences in a peaceful manner , but there have only been half-hearted attempts at that so far . that does n't sound very optimistic .
how do you think the financing of terrorism will develop in the future ? unfortunately , i think europe will have to experience two or three more attacks before we start to work more closely together . martin schrader interviewed friedrich schneider send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops the agenda in warsaw as the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member council of europe enters its last day in warsaw , talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime .

a new german soap opera has the answer : all hell breaks loose . " turkish for beginners , " a new soap opera which premiered on german public broadcaster ard on tuesday , is a highly entertaining bonanza of cultural stereotypes .
in it , doris schneider , an anti-disciplinarian german therapist and mother of two , falls in love with turkish policeman metin öztürk , a father of two as well .
to the absolute horror of the children from both sides of the cultural divide , doris -lrb- played by anna stieblich -rrb- and metin -lrb- adnan maral -rrb- decide to move in with each other and conduct a risky , cross-cultural family merger . yagmur and cem , metin 's children , are walking and talking cliches of young turks living in germany .
yagmur picks her room in the new apartment with a compass so that she can determine the direction of mecca for her regular prayers .
cem , a quintessential wannabe macho , hangs out with his friends and speaks with a strong turkish accent in order to sound street-smart and cool .

a new german soap opera has the answer : all hell breaks loose . " turkish for beginners , " a new soap opera which premiered on german public broadcaster ard on tuesday , is a highly entertaining bonanza of cultural stereotypes .
in it , doris schneider , an anti-disciplinarian german therapist and mother of two , falls in love with turkish policeman metin öztürk , a father of two as well .
to the absolute horror of the children from both sides of the cultural divide , doris -lrb- played by anna stieblich -rrb- and metin -lrb- adnan maral -rrb- decide to move in with each other and conduct a risky , cross-cultural family merger . yagmur and cem , metin 's children , are walking and talking cliches of young turks living in germany .
yagmur picks her room in the new apartment with a compass so that she can determine the direction of mecca for her regular prayers .
cem , a quintessential wannabe macho , hangs out with his friends and speaks with a strong turkish accent in order to sound street-smart and cool .
he believes that a woman 's place is next to the stove , but he 's in for a big surprise when he finds out that his new stepmother ca n't cook . new frontiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tough guy with a soft spot for celine dion appearances are , nonetheless , deceptive .
behind her stern , anti-western facade , yagmur secretly watches music videos on tv .
lena , doris ' daughter , is openly opposed to her mother 's intercultural experiment , but deep down she finds her new family to be just whacky enough to have lots of fun with . and cem , despite wanting to be a tough guy , falls in love with an asian girl and writes a love letter under the unlikely poetic influence of celine dion , the exemplary queen of commercial sap . " i orient myself on american tv shows , in which the whole ensemble has a chance to develop , " soap author bora dagtekin said .
" these are the stories in which inner conflicts are not only reserved for the leading character . " " turkish for beginners " is an exceptional show on german television .
there is not a touch of political correctness in it , but it freshens up the usually rather stale tv portraits of foreigners in germany . moving beyond the kebab joint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teenage angst with a german-turkish twist is the basis of the new ard soap " i find it highly critical that turks always only work in kebab joints -lrb- on television -rrb- , " said michael mangold , who leads the institute for media and economics at the karlsruhe center for art and media technology . " integration is the central goal of the current social policy , " mangold said . but you would n't be able to guess that by watching german television .
according to the nuremberg society for consumer research , german tv channels are not particularly interested in targeting their programs for the turkish audience since turks in germany spend half of their television time watching turkish channels via satellite dishes . " that is probably because they do not feel they are being addressed by german television , " mangold said . " turkish for beginners , " however , offers a humorous and a long overdue peek into multicultural germany without trying to be too controversial .

thanks to public demand and a positive resonance from publishers in recent years , the four-day leipzig book fair , which will kick off on thursday , has emerged as europe 's largest literary festival for author readings and events . leipzig does not even strive to compete with frankfurt , but over the years , has established its own identity , especially with its popular concept " leipzig reads . "
unlike frankfurt , which is geared towards trade professionals , leipzig generates much of its business from the general public . children are welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comic books are one of the key attractions of the book fair during the day , the fair is held in new , modern facilities outside the city center , where literary fans from all walks of life gather - be it school classes storming the exhibits , parents pushing prams down the aisles , or readers coming into contact with internationally best-selling authors in an informal atmosphere .
a large chunk of the fairgrounds will also be devoted to children 's books and comics . in the evenings , numerous readings are offered throughout the city , in bookshops , cozy cafes or a city hall chamber .
there will be 1,800 events this year alone , and late night partygoers could even bump into vladimir kaminer , the german-russian author of " russian disco , " who doubles up as a disc jockey . emphasis on german literature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author vladimir kaminer will double up as a disc jockey for the fair what distinguishes leipzig from frankfurt , is the strong emphasis on german-language literature and its knack for discovering young talent .
a number of well-known authors , such as ingo schulze , got their publishing start at the fair .
schulze , along with max frisch , and heinrich böll , is among the very few german authors , who have had the distinction of being published in the new yorker magazine . the magic of leipzig is that everyone can find his or her niche , whether it is the budding novelist or a world renowned author , according to oliver zille , head of the book fair . given the proximity of this city in saxony to central and eastern europe , the foreign focus is on showcasing up-and-coming authors from that region and launching them in the german-language market .
due to its unique role as the cultural bridge in a wider europe that has expanded eastwards , it has become a book fair tradition to award the " prize for european understanding " to one outstanding author each year .
this year ukrainian writer juri andruchovich , who has chronicled political events that unfolded in his home country before and after the orange revolution , will be honored . audio books are big in leipzig leipzig not only " reads , " but " leipzig listens " as well .
another tradition is to award the " hörkules " prize in the audio segment of the book market , which has experienced tremendous growth in the past several years .
plenty of events will revolve around the medium of audio books or productions .
emerging playwrights for example , can get feedback for their unpublished radio plays performed in front of a live audience . bildunterschrift : taking in culture at leipzig 's renowned gewandhaus leipzig has been dubbed the " city of the black arts " for its centuries-long tradition in the printing and book trade .
after world war ii and the division of germany , frankfurt became the venue for the world 's biggest fair in the publishing industry , whereas leipzig , relegated to decades of communist rule , became primarily a forum for east-west publishers . internationally , leipzig is a city that has long been associated with values such as liberty and freedom of expression , having led the peaceful demonstrations in 1989 that led to the fall of the berlin wall .
it is also famous for its cultural life and the gewandhaus orchestra . at the time of german reunification in 1990 , publishing houses in the former east germany were shut down or integrated into west german ones .
but already in 1991 , the leipzig book fair came back with a vengeance .
leipzig may never have the global impact and resources of its big brother in frankfurt , but it certainly sounds like more fun . gabriela schaaf -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de art , book , music and lifestyle fairs while cologne remains germany 's art and furniture capital , the publishing industry heads to frankfurt and leipzig 's fairs .

thanks to public demand and a positive resonance from publishers in recent years , the four-day leipzig book fair , which will kick off on thursday , has emerged as europe 's largest literary festival for author readings and events . leipzig does not even strive to compete with frankfurt , but over the years , has established its own identity , especially with its popular concept " leipzig reads . "
unlike frankfurt , which is geared towards trade professionals , leipzig generates much of its business from the general public . children are welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comic books are one of the key attractions of the book fair during the day , the fair is held in new , modern facilities outside the city center , where literary fans from all walks of life gather - be it school classes storming the exhibits , parents pushing prams down the aisles , or readers coming into contact with internationally best-selling authors in an informal atmosphere .
a large chunk of the fairgrounds will also be devoted to children 's books and comics . in the evenings , numerous readings are offered throughout the city , in bookshops , cozy cafes or a city hall chamber .

a number of well-known authors , such as ingo schulze , got their publishing start at the fair .
schulze , along with max frisch , and heinrich böll , is among the very few german authors , who have had the distinction of being published in the new yorker magazine . the magic of leipzig is that everyone can find his or her niche , whether it is the budding novelist or a world renowned author , according to oliver zille , head of the book fair . given the proximity of this city in saxony to central and eastern europe , the foreign focus is on showcasing up-and-coming authors from that region and launching them in the german-language market .
due to its unique role as the cultural bridge in a wider europe that has expanded eastwards , it has become a book fair tradition to award the " prize for european understanding " to one outstanding author each year .
this year ukrainian writer juri andruchovich , who has chronicled political events that unfolded in his home country before and after the orange revolution , will be honored . audio books are big in leipzig leipzig not only " reads , " but " leipzig listens " as well .
another tradition is to award the " hörkules " prize in the audio segment of the book market , which has experienced tremendous growth in the past several years .

a new german soap opera has the answer : all hell breaks loose . " turkish for beginners , " a new soap opera which premiered on german public broadcaster ard on tuesday , is a highly entertaining bonanza of cultural stereotypes .
in it , doris schneider , an anti-disciplinarian german therapist and mother of two , falls in love with turkish policeman metin öztürk , a father of two as well .
to the absolute horror of the children from both sides of the cultural divide , doris -lrb- played by anna stieblich -rrb- and metin -lrb- adnan maral -rrb- decide to move in with each other and conduct a risky , cross-cultural family merger . yagmur and cem , metin 's children , are walking and talking cliches of young turks living in germany .
yagmur picks her room in the new apartment with a compass so that she can determine the direction of mecca for her regular prayers .
cem , a quintessential wannabe macho , hangs out with his friends and speaks with a strong turkish accent in order to sound street-smart and cool .
he believes that a woman 's place is next to the stove , but he 's in for a big surprise when he finds out that his new stepmother ca n't cook . new frontiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tough guy with a soft spot for celine dion appearances are , nonetheless , deceptive .
behind her stern , anti-western facade , yagmur secretly watches music videos on tv .
lena , doris ' daughter , is openly opposed to her mother 's intercultural experiment , but deep down she finds her new family to be just whacky enough to have lots of fun with . and cem , despite wanting to be a tough guy , falls in love with an asian girl and writes a love letter under the unlikely poetic influence of celine dion , the exemplary queen of commercial sap . " i orient myself on american tv shows , in which the whole ensemble has a chance to develop , " soap author bora dagtekin said .
" these are the stories in which inner conflicts are not only reserved for the leading character . " " turkish for beginners " is an exceptional show on german television .
there is not a touch of political correctness in it , but it freshens up the usually rather stale tv portraits of foreigners in germany . moving beyond the kebab joint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teenage angst with a german-turkish twist is the basis of the new ard soap " i find it highly critical that turks always only work in kebab joints -lrb- on television -rrb- , " said michael mangold , who leads the institute for media and economics at the karlsruhe center for art and media technology . " integration is the central goal of the current social policy , " mangold said . but you would n't be able to guess that by watching german television .
according to the nuremberg society for consumer research , german tv channels are not particularly interested in targeting their programs for the turkish audience since turks in germany spend half of their television time watching turkish channels via satellite dishes . " that is probably because they do not feel they are being addressed by german television , " mangold said . " turkish for beginners , " however , offers a humorous and a long overdue peek into multicultural germany without trying to be too controversial . " we really watched how far we would go , " dagtekin said .
" for me , it was important to approach cultural conflicts on an internal , familiar level without becoming political .

work-life balance gets boost in germany the dumbing down of germany gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids germany -pipe- 15.03.2006 politicians discuss pension cuts for childless germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's younger generation is dwindling new statistics confirming the declining birth rate have sent germany in to a state of panic , amid a growing consensus that pensions should be increased for people with children and reduced for those without . " people without children should either receive a reduced pension or pay more into pension schemes , " said norbert geis from the csu . johann eekhoff , director of the cologne institute for economic policy said a reform of the pension system was long overdue . " people without children should never have been admitted into pension schemes because these only work when they are financed by subsequent generations , " he said in an interview with mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" their pensions should be cut by 50 percent . " cdu politician elisabeth winkelmeier-becker agreed , pointing out that working parents are financially disadvantaged compared to their childless peers .
" in the long-term , we need to consider awarding people without children lower pensions , " she said . chilling statistics the headline in germany 's mass-selling daily bild on wednesday said it all : " baby shock : we germans are dying out , " the paper screamed . that might sound a bit extreme , but latest figures , based on data collected at the federal statistics office , released on tuesday have sent a chill among demographers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more babies were born in post-war year of 1946 than today last year , only some 676,000 children were born in germany according to german daily die welt which cited forecasts by the federal statistics office .
that pushed the birth rate to its worst low in 15 years : in 2004 , the number of newborns amounted to 706,000 .
that 's all still significantly less than the 922,000 births in the post-war year of 1946 . " that 's dramatic , we 're running into a dead end , " michael hüther , director of the cologne-based institute for the german economy told the paper . wiesbaden on top the demographic figures have also shown huge variations in germany 's 50 largest cities . the eastern german city of magdeburg , the capital of saxony-anhalt , took the dubious honor of having the lowest birth rate in the country : only some 6.9 children per 1000 inhabitants are born in the city on a yearly average . as against that , the significantly richer city of wiesbaden near frankfurt , has the highest birth rate with 10.5 births per 1000 inhabitants .
the western german cities of frankfurt and bonn followed closely , while the capital berlin also features on spot 30 with a birthrate of 8.7 . issue being taken seriously though the latest statistics have come as a shock , the issue is hardly new in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is apparently doing things better when it comes to boosting its birth rate according to eurostat , the eu statistics office , there were 8.5 births per 1000 inhabitants in germany in 2004 - making it the country with the lowest birth rate in the entire european union .
countries such as france and britain boasted birthrates - at 12.7 and 12.0 respectively in the same year - that exceeded german levels by more than 50 percent . for years , politicians and demographers in germany have warned of the dangers of a falling birth rate and ageing population .
in recent months in particular , the subject has raced to the top of the political agenda and been the focus of heated debates over family-friendly and childcare policies . the damning pisa study on germany 's faltering education standards has also stepped up the urgency surrounding the issue .
in january this year , the ruling grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats decided to make it easier for working mothers to continue being part of the labor market , increasing tax breaks on child care , encourage setting up full-day schools and making kindergartens cost-free . chancellor merkel 's family affairs minister , ursula von der leyen , a mother of seven children herself , has also been credited with pushing for family-friendly policies and ensuring that the issue remains in the political spotlight . much more to be done but , it 's obvious that more needs to be done . on wednesday , johannes singhammer , family affairs spokesman for the conservative union of the christian democrats and christian social democrats demanded that demographic policies had to be given a high priority . efforts to fight the " free fall of births " had to take a place at the center of politics alongside the battle against unemployment and reining in the ballooning deficit , singhammer added . dw staff -lrb- sp / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : learning to think outside the box once dismissed as " nonsense " by former chancellor schröder , family policies have now climbed to the top of germany 's political agenda .
the debate is headed in the right direction , says dw-world 's uta thofern .

" people without children should either receive a reduced pension or pay more into pension schemes , " said norbert geis from the csu . johann eekhoff , director of the cologne institute for economic policy said a reform of the pension system was long overdue . " people without children should never have been admitted into pension schemes because these only work when they are financed by subsequent generations , " he said in an interview with mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" their pensions should be cut by 50 percent . " cdu politician elisabeth winkelmeier-becker agreed , pointing out that working parents are financially disadvantaged compared to their childless peers .
" in the long-term , we need to consider awarding people without children lower pensions , " she said . chilling statistics the headline in germany 's mass-selling daily bild on wednesday said it all : " baby shock : we germans are dying out , " the paper screamed . that might sound a bit extreme , but latest figures , based on data collected at the federal statistics office , released on tuesday have sent a chill among demographers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more babies were born in post-war year of 1946 than today last year , only some 676,000 children were born in germany according to german daily die welt which cited forecasts by the federal statistics office .
that pushed the birth rate to its worst low in 15 years : in 2004 , the number of newborns amounted to 706,000 .

countries such as france and britain boasted birthrates - at 12.7 and 12.0 respectively in the same year - that exceeded german levels by more than 50 percent . for years , politicians and demographers in germany have warned of the dangers of a falling birth rate and ageing population .
in recent months in particular , the subject has raced to the top of the political agenda and been the focus of heated debates over family-friendly and childcare policies . the damning pisa study on germany 's faltering education standards has also stepped up the urgency surrounding the issue .

" people without children should either receive a reduced pension or pay more into pension schemes , " said norbert geis from the csu . johann eekhoff , director of the cologne institute for economic policy said a reform of the pension system was long overdue . " people without children should never have been admitted into pension schemes because these only work when they are financed by subsequent generations , " he said in an interview with mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" their pensions should be cut by 50 percent . " cdu politician elisabeth winkelmeier-becker agreed , pointing out that working parents are financially disadvantaged compared to their childless peers .
" in the long-term , we need to consider awarding people without children lower pensions , " she said . chilling statistics the headline in germany 's mass-selling daily bild on wednesday said it all : " baby shock : we germans are dying out , " the paper screamed . that might sound a bit extreme , but latest figures , based on data collected at the federal statistics office , released on tuesday have sent a chill among demographers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more babies were born in post-war year of 1946 than today last year , only some 676,000 children were born in germany according to german daily die welt which cited forecasts by the federal statistics office .
that pushed the birth rate to its worst low in 15 years : in 2004 , the number of newborns amounted to 706,000 .
that 's all still significantly less than the 922,000 births in the post-war year of 1946 . " that 's dramatic , we 're running into a dead end , " michael hüther , director of the cologne-based institute for the german economy told the paper . wiesbaden on top the demographic figures have also shown huge variations in germany 's 50 largest cities . the eastern german city of magdeburg , the capital of saxony-anhalt , took the dubious honor of having the lowest birth rate in the country : only some 6.9 children per 1000 inhabitants are born in the city on a yearly average . as against that , the significantly richer city of wiesbaden near frankfurt , has the highest birth rate with 10.5 births per 1000 inhabitants .
the western german cities of frankfurt and bonn followed closely , while the capital berlin also features on spot 30 with a birthrate of 8.7 . issue being taken seriously though the latest statistics have come as a shock , the issue is hardly new in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is apparently doing things better when it comes to boosting its birth rate according to eurostat , the eu statistics office , there were 8.5 births per 1000 inhabitants in germany in 2004 - making it the country with the lowest birth rate in the entire european union .
countries such as france and britain boasted birthrates - at 12.7 and 12.0 respectively in the same year - that exceeded german levels by more than 50 percent . for years , politicians and demographers in germany have warned of the dangers of a falling birth rate and ageing population .
in recent months in particular , the subject has raced to the top of the political agenda and been the focus of heated debates over family-friendly and childcare policies . the damning pisa study on germany 's faltering education standards has also stepped up the urgency surrounding the issue .
in january this year , the ruling grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats decided to make it easier for working mothers to continue being part of the labor market , increasing tax breaks on child care , encourage setting up full-day schools and making kindergartens cost-free . chancellor merkel 's family affairs minister , ursula von der leyen , a mother of seven children herself , has also been credited with pushing for family-friendly policies and ensuring that the issue remains in the political spotlight . much more to be done but , it 's obvious that more needs to be done . on wednesday , johannes singhammer , family affairs spokesman for the conservative union of the christian democrats and christian social democrats demanded that demographic policies had to be given a high priority . efforts to fight the " free fall of births " had to take a place at the center of politics alongside the battle against unemployment and reining in the ballooning deficit , singhammer added . dw staff -lrb- sp / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : learning to think outside the box once dismissed as " nonsense " by former chancellor schröder , family policies have now climbed to the top of germany 's political agenda .
the debate is headed in the right direction , says dw-world 's uta thofern .

the company would first wait and see whether a rival offer materialized from a third party , merck 's supervisory board chief wilhelm simson told a news conference in berlin . but merck was not prepared to pay so high a price that a purchase could only be financed by selling off bits of schering , simson added . the price of 77 euros per share was " fair " , he continued .

but according to political economist friedrich schneider , that 's partly due to hypocritical western governments , who do n't want to be team players . an international conference on combating the financing of terrorism is being held in the hague on wednesday and thursday .
dw-world.de spoke with political economist friedrich schneider from johannes kepler university in linz , austria , about the chances of successfully cutting off terrorists ' money supplies and the obstacles preventing faster progress . dw-world.de : professor schneider , seven years ago , the g7 countries initiated the international financial action task force , or fatf .
it is meant to fight terrorist financing , but so far , the force has n't had any significant success .
why are these international efforts failing ? friedrich schneider : on an international level , next to nothing is being done .
it 's that simple .
every country is doing its own work , there 's no international cooperation that 's working .
data is n't even being exchanged in the aftermath of a terrorist attack , let alone cooperation among various secret services . why is n't there more cooperation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban leader mullah omar : the us funded the taliban in the past i 'll give you an example .
if the french finance covert operations in africa through their secret service , or if the germans pay ransom in iraq , do you think these governments want to publicly acknowledge this kind of financing ?
and good and evil can quickly change , as we know .
just take the taliban in afghanistan , for example .
for a long time , they were financed by the united states when the us was against russia .
this is where hypocrisy comes in .
if governments do n't want to expose their own covert financing operations , then they ca n't have any real interest in more efficient uncovering of money laundering . to what extent is money laundering linked to the financing of terrorism ?
money laundering is mostly associated with the drugs trade and human trafficking . terrorist financing is , broadly speaking , the financing of terrorist operations , and not all that much money is needed .
the september 2001 attacks cost just $ 500,000 , including flight training .
much more money is needed for the maintenance of terrorist bases .
to pull together this kind of funding , money from the drugs trade , illegal diamond trading or kidnapping is laundered . so is it mainly through the tracking of money laundering that sources of terrorist financing can be found ?
with money from legal operations … … you ca n't prevent the financing of terrorism .
there are donations to terrorist organizations - hamas for example .
it gets a lot of money from arab states for hospitals and schools , but where there 's no clear dividing line to show whether the money was used for terrorist acts . what can really be done to stop terrorist financing then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug money often ends up financing terrorist cells the first question is , whether there is any desire to effectively fight money laundering .
only then can you really combat terrorist financing .
to fight money laundering , you need international cooperation , and a task force that is just as agile and flexible as the terrorists .
this would also require the regulations prohibiting data exchange to be loosened , but so far that has n't happened . what can financial service providers do to stop terrorist financing ? that depends firstly on the extent to which they want to do business with people from the mafia or other organized criminals .
investigators rely on insider information from banks which often have little knowledge about how clean certain transactions are . as a political economist , you 've called for combating poverty and promoting democratic values as a way to stop terrorism .
why ? simply put , people who earn money do n't throw bombs .
if i have a house , a car , and a well-paid job , i 'm less likely to become a terrorist .
there will always be fanatics who resort to terrorism regardless of their income , but they 'll be far fewer .
it 's about drying up part of the basis for terrorism , which is why fighting poverty is such an effective strategy .
in addition to this , we have to fight religious extremism , and deal with religious differences in a peaceful manner , but there have only been half-hearted attempts at that so far . that does n't sound very optimistic .
how do you think the financing of terrorism will develop in the future ? unfortunately , i think europe will have to experience two or three more attacks before we start to work more closely together . martin schrader interviewed friedrich schneider send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops the agenda in warsaw as the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member council of europe enters its last day in warsaw , talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime .

but according to political economist friedrich schneider , that 's partly due to hypocritical western governments , who do n't want to be team players . an international conference on combating the financing of terrorism is being held in the hague on wednesday and thursday .
dw-world.de spoke with political economist friedrich schneider from johannes kepler university in linz , austria , about the chances of successfully cutting off terrorists ' money supplies and the obstacles preventing faster progress . dw-world.de : professor schneider , seven years ago , the g7 countries initiated the international financial action task force , or fatf .
it is meant to fight terrorist financing , but so far , the force has n't had any significant success .
why are these international efforts failing ? friedrich schneider : on an international level , next to nothing is being done .
it 's that simple .
every country is doing its own work , there 's no international cooperation that 's working .

but according to political economist friedrich schneider , that 's partly due to hypocritical western governments , who do n't want to be team players . an international conference on combating the financing of terrorism is being held in the hague on wednesday and thursday .
dw-world.de spoke with political economist friedrich schneider from johannes kepler university in linz , austria , about the chances of successfully cutting off terrorists ' money supplies and the obstacles preventing faster progress . dw-world.de : professor schneider , seven years ago , the g7 countries initiated the international financial action task force , or fatf .
it is meant to fight terrorist financing , but so far , the force has n't had any significant success .
why are these international efforts failing ? friedrich schneider : on an international level , next to nothing is being done .
it 's that simple .
every country is doing its own work , there 's no international cooperation that 's working .
data is n't even being exchanged in the aftermath of a terrorist attack , let alone cooperation among various secret services . why is n't there more cooperation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban leader mullah omar : the us funded the taliban in the past i 'll give you an example .
if the french finance covert operations in africa through their secret service , or if the germans pay ransom in iraq , do you think these governments want to publicly acknowledge this kind of financing ?
and good and evil can quickly change , as we know .
just take the taliban in afghanistan , for example .
for a long time , they were financed by the united states when the us was against russia .
this is where hypocrisy comes in .
if governments do n't want to expose their own covert financing operations , then they ca n't have any real interest in more efficient uncovering of money laundering . to what extent is money laundering linked to the financing of terrorism ?
money laundering is mostly associated with the drugs trade and human trafficking . terrorist financing is , broadly speaking , the financing of terrorist operations , and not all that much money is needed .
the september 2001 attacks cost just $ 500,000 , including flight training .
much more money is needed for the maintenance of terrorist bases .
to pull together this kind of funding , money from the drugs trade , illegal diamond trading or kidnapping is laundered . so is it mainly through the tracking of money laundering that sources of terrorist financing can be found ?
with money from legal operations … … you ca n't prevent the financing of terrorism .
there are donations to terrorist organizations - hamas for example .
it gets a lot of money from arab states for hospitals and schools , but where there 's no clear dividing line to show whether the money was used for terrorist acts . what can really be done to stop terrorist financing then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug money often ends up financing terrorist cells the first question is , whether there is any desire to effectively fight money laundering .
only then can you really combat terrorist financing .
to fight money laundering , you need international cooperation , and a task force that is just as agile and flexible as the terrorists .
this would also require the regulations prohibiting data exchange to be loosened , but so far that has n't happened . what can financial service providers do to stop terrorist financing ? that depends firstly on the extent to which they want to do business with people from the mafia or other organized criminals .
investigators rely on insider information from banks which often have little knowledge about how clean certain transactions are . as a political economist , you 've called for combating poverty and promoting democratic values as a way to stop terrorism .
why ? simply put , people who earn money do n't throw bombs .
if i have a house , a car , and a well-paid job , i 'm less likely to become a terrorist .
there will always be fanatics who resort to terrorism regardless of their income , but they 'll be far fewer .
it 's about drying up part of the basis for terrorism , which is why fighting poverty is such an effective strategy .
in addition to this , we have to fight religious extremism , and deal with religious differences in a peaceful manner , but there have only been half-hearted attempts at that so far . that does n't sound very optimistic .
how do you think the financing of terrorism will develop in the future ? unfortunately , i think europe will have to experience two or three more attacks before we start to work more closely together . martin schrader interviewed friedrich schneider send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops the agenda in warsaw as the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member council of europe enters its last day in warsaw , talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.03.2006 strikers in for the long haul as arbitrators brought in großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesting strikers in stuttgart say they are n't ready to back down , even after six weeks as germany 's public-sector strikes mark week six , arbitration is now being seen as a possible way to bring the sides closer .
in stuttgart , at the heart of the labor action , union members say they 're determined to win . it is about symbolism , many analysts say , this protracted work stoppage by the verdi services union that has closed kindergartens , interrupted hospital services and kept garbage collection trucks idle inside city garages .
while that symbolism may be about union power and unions ' futures , there 's another powerful symbol of germany 's biggest public-service stoppage in 14 years : trash . these days , it 's everywhere in stuttgart , this usually pristine city in southwestern germany , capital of the state of baden-württemberg and one of the principle cities of the historical region of swabia .
the swabians , as the stereotype goes , are not only extraordinarily thrifty ; they can be fanatically clean .
but six weeks into this public-sector strike , clean is hard to come by , at least in the public sphere .
the city is swimming in garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many explosions of trash around stuttgart trashcans have been filled to overflowing , and often , packed to the breaking point , have dumped their contents in a messy circle around them .
stuttgart 's street curbs have become the resting place for a rising tide of daily detritus : mcdonald 's cups , candy wrappers , cigarette packs and old napkins . " i 've had enough of this strike , " said doris laphardt , 46 , as she stepped over a pile of discarded paper in a central square .
" this place is beginning to look like new york . " arbitration but there could be a glimmer of hope in the strike that until just yesterday , showed no signs of coming to an end .
municipal authorities in baden-württemberg and the verdi services union said on tuesday they were bringing in outside arbitrators to try to bring the union and public-sector employers , who up until now have dug in their heels in negotiations , come closer together . the two sides have agreed to bring in two arbitrators , the head of aok health insurance for baden-württemberg , roland sing , and a former president of the state 's administrative court , claus messner .
the two began familiarizing themselves with the material on wednesday morning and talks were planned to begin between representatives from verdi and employers during the afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike hq in stuttgart employers want to extend the working week from 38.5 hour to 40 hour without an increase in pay .
they say they need to ease up pressure on state coffers - personnel costs consume almost one-half of state budgets - and argue that many other civil servants , not to mention the private sector , already work 40-hour weeks .
employers argue that they are asking public-sector employees to only add 18 minutes to each working day . verdi counters that increasing the working week will cut employees ' take home pay , which would further erode already weak consumer spending in germany .
the union also says the change could endanger some 250,000 jobs in the public sector . verdi , along with most of germany 's trade unions , has been struggling with falling membership and an increasing feeling among the populace that it is obstructionist and out of step with the realities of today 's labor environment .
while 18 minutes a day does not seem like much to ask to help prop up struggling state governments , observers say the strike has become a test of verdi 's ability to maintain its strong role in germany 's centralized bargaining system , which is increasingly under attack . " it 's really about symbolism .
the real point is whether they are forced to capitulate on this very symbolic point , " deutsche bank economist stefan schneider told reuters . noisy determination on a cold but clear tuesday morning outside the verdi headquarters in stuttgart , thoughts of capitulation were not in evidence .
at 10:30 a.m. , amid blowing whistles and rattling noisemakers , a group of some 2,500 strikers began a protest march .
carrying banners , waving red verdi flags and chanting slogans , the strikers made their way from the union building through central stuttgart to a large square where speakers encouraged them to stay the fight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching through stuttgart there did not seem to be need for much encouraging .
in fact , the mood was almost festive , now six weeks into the labor action .
instead of slumped shoulders and resigned expressions , the crowd was marked by a strong sense of determination to fight the fight for as long as it takes . " up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the result we want , and we can go on for a while .
we have enough money in the strike fund , " said bärbel illi , 47 , an employee of verdi 's stuttgart branch . heike fischer , 48 , is a child-care worker who said that although the media liked to focus on the trouble some parents have had since their child-care facilities have been closed , most parents were behind the action . " of course , all of us would rather not be on strike anymore , we would like to be with the children , " she said .
" but we ca n't stop now if we want to have a future .
we ca n't give up now , and i 'm ready to continue until we are successful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confrontation between garbage workers replacement workers many of the striking sanitation workers wore signs that said " strikebreakers , hands off our trash ! " referring to the private firms that have been hired to take care of some of the city 's sanitation problems .
those two worlds collided briefly after the main rally when a group of striking workers came across a private garbage truck waiting at a stoplight .
the group stepped in front of the vehicle and , yelling at the three men sitting inside , tried to cover the truck 's windshield with posters to prevent it from driving on .
police had to disperse the group . verdi officials say that besides showing its strength , the strike has mobilized union members , many of whom had begun wondering why they were bothering to pay their monthly dues . " it was important that the unions do something , " said jürgen rönsch , 37 , a cemetery maintenance worker .
" in my department there was hardly anyone left in the union , since it never did anything .
but now people have been coming back . " public support waning while the strike has given verdi a boost in popularity among those in sectors it represents , it is less clear how the strike will play out among the populace at large .
public disgruntlement about the labor action is growing .
in a poll last week carried out for the zdf public television channel , 61 percent of germans opposed the protests , up six percentage points from a poll conducted on feb .

in stuttgart , at the heart of the labor action , union members say they 're determined to win . it is about symbolism , many analysts say , this protracted work stoppage by the verdi services union that has closed kindergartens , interrupted hospital services and kept garbage collection trucks idle inside city garages .
while that symbolism may be about union power and unions ' futures , there 's another powerful symbol of germany 's biggest public-service stoppage in 14 years : trash . these days , it 's everywhere in stuttgart , this usually pristine city in southwestern germany , capital of the state of baden-württemberg and one of the principle cities of the historical region of swabia .
the swabians , as the stereotype goes , are not only extraordinarily thrifty ; they can be fanatically clean .
but six weeks into this public-sector strike , clean is hard to come by , at least in the public sphere .
the city is swimming in garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many explosions of trash around stuttgart trashcans have been filled to overflowing , and often , packed to the breaking point , have dumped their contents in a messy circle around them .
stuttgart 's street curbs have become the resting place for a rising tide of daily detritus : mcdonald 's cups , candy wrappers , cigarette packs and old napkins . " i 've had enough of this strike , " said doris laphardt , 46 , as she stepped over a pile of discarded paper in a central square .
" this place is beginning to look like new york . " arbitration but there could be a glimmer of hope in the strike that until just yesterday , showed no signs of coming to an end .
municipal authorities in baden-württemberg and the verdi services union said on tuesday they were bringing in outside arbitrators to try to bring the union and public-sector employers , who up until now have dug in their heels in negotiations , come closer together . the two sides have agreed to bring in two arbitrators , the head of aok health insurance for baden-württemberg , roland sing , and a former president of the state 's administrative court , claus messner .
the two began familiarizing themselves with the material on wednesday morning and talks were planned to begin between representatives from verdi and employers during the afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike hq in stuttgart employers want to extend the working week from 38.5 hour to 40 hour without an increase in pay .
they say they need to ease up pressure on state coffers - personnel costs consume almost one-half of state budgets - and argue that many other civil servants , not to mention the private sector , already work 40-hour weeks .
employers argue that they are asking public-sector employees to only add 18 minutes to each working day . verdi counters that increasing the working week will cut employees ' take home pay , which would further erode already weak consumer spending in germany .
the union also says the change could endanger some 250,000 jobs in the public sector . verdi , along with most of germany 's trade unions , has been struggling with falling membership and an increasing feeling among the populace that it is obstructionist and out of step with the realities of today 's labor environment .
while 18 minutes a day does not seem like much to ask to help prop up struggling state governments , observers say the strike has become a test of verdi 's ability to maintain its strong role in germany 's centralized bargaining system , which is increasingly under attack . " it 's really about symbolism .
the real point is whether they are forced to capitulate on this very symbolic point , " deutsche bank economist stefan schneider told reuters . noisy determination on a cold but clear tuesday morning outside the verdi headquarters in stuttgart , thoughts of capitulation were not in evidence .
at 10:30 a.m. , amid blowing whistles and rattling noisemakers , a group of some 2,500 strikers began a protest march .
carrying banners , waving red verdi flags and chanting slogans , the strikers made their way from the union building through central stuttgart to a large square where speakers encouraged them to stay the fight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching through stuttgart there did not seem to be need for much encouraging .
in fact , the mood was almost festive , now six weeks into the labor action .
instead of slumped shoulders and resigned expressions , the crowd was marked by a strong sense of determination to fight the fight for as long as it takes . " up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the result we want , and we can go on for a while .
we have enough money in the strike fund , " said bärbel illi , 47 , an employee of verdi 's stuttgart branch . heike fischer , 48 , is a child-care worker who said that although the media liked to focus on the trouble some parents have had since their child-care facilities have been closed , most parents were behind the action . " of course , all of us would rather not be on strike anymore , we would like to be with the children , " she said .
" but we ca n't stop now if we want to have a future .
we ca n't give up now , and i 'm ready to continue until we are successful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confrontation between garbage workers replacement workers many of the striking sanitation workers wore signs that said " strikebreakers , hands off our trash ! " referring to the private firms that have been hired to take care of some of the city 's sanitation problems .
those two worlds collided briefly after the main rally when a group of striking workers came across a private garbage truck waiting at a stoplight .
the group stepped in front of the vehicle and , yelling at the three men sitting inside , tried to cover the truck 's windshield with posters to prevent it from driving on .
police had to disperse the group . verdi officials say that besides showing its strength , the strike has mobilized union members , many of whom had begun wondering why they were bothering to pay their monthly dues . " it was important that the unions do something , " said jürgen rönsch , 37 , a cemetery maintenance worker .
" in my department there was hardly anyone left in the union , since it never did anything .
but now people have been coming back . " public support waning while the strike has given verdi a boost in popularity among those in sectors it represents , it is less clear how the strike will play out among the populace at large .
public disgruntlement about the labor action is growing .
in a poll last week carried out for the zdf public television channel , 61 percent of germans opposed the protests , up six percentage points from a poll conducted on feb .

in stuttgart , at the heart of the labor action , union members say they 're determined to win . it is about symbolism , many analysts say , this protracted work stoppage by the verdi services union that has closed kindergartens , interrupted hospital services and kept garbage collection trucks idle inside city garages .
while that symbolism may be about union power and unions ' futures , there 's another powerful symbol of germany 's biggest public-service stoppage in 14 years : trash . these days , it 's everywhere in stuttgart , this usually pristine city in southwestern germany , capital of the state of baden-württemberg and one of the principle cities of the historical region of swabia .
the swabians , as the stereotype goes , are not only extraordinarily thrifty ; they can be fanatically clean .
but six weeks into this public-sector strike , clean is hard to come by , at least in the public sphere .
the city is swimming in garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many explosions of trash around stuttgart trashcans have been filled to overflowing , and often , packed to the breaking point , have dumped their contents in a messy circle around them .
stuttgart 's street curbs have become the resting place for a rising tide of daily detritus : mcdonald 's cups , candy wrappers , cigarette packs and old napkins . " i 've had enough of this strike , " said doris laphardt , 46 , as she stepped over a pile of discarded paper in a central square .
" this place is beginning to look like new york . " arbitration but there could be a glimmer of hope in the strike that until just yesterday , showed no signs of coming to an end .
municipal authorities in baden-württemberg and the verdi services union said on tuesday they were bringing in outside arbitrators to try to bring the union and public-sector employers , who up until now have dug in their heels in negotiations , come closer together . the two sides have agreed to bring in two arbitrators , the head of aok health insurance for baden-württemberg , roland sing , and a former president of the state 's administrative court , claus messner .
the two began familiarizing themselves with the material on wednesday morning and talks were planned to begin between representatives from verdi and employers during the afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike hq in stuttgart employers want to extend the working week from 38.5 hour to 40 hour without an increase in pay .
they say they need to ease up pressure on state coffers - personnel costs consume almost one-half of state budgets - and argue that many other civil servants , not to mention the private sector , already work 40-hour weeks .
employers argue that they are asking public-sector employees to only add 18 minutes to each working day . verdi counters that increasing the working week will cut employees ' take home pay , which would further erode already weak consumer spending in germany .
the union also says the change could endanger some 250,000 jobs in the public sector . verdi , along with most of germany 's trade unions , has been struggling with falling membership and an increasing feeling among the populace that it is obstructionist and out of step with the realities of today 's labor environment .
while 18 minutes a day does not seem like much to ask to help prop up struggling state governments , observers say the strike has become a test of verdi 's ability to maintain its strong role in germany 's centralized bargaining system , which is increasingly under attack . " it 's really about symbolism .
the real point is whether they are forced to capitulate on this very symbolic point , " deutsche bank economist stefan schneider told reuters . noisy determination on a cold but clear tuesday morning outside the verdi headquarters in stuttgart , thoughts of capitulation were not in evidence .
at 10:30 a.m. , amid blowing whistles and rattling noisemakers , a group of some 2,500 strikers began a protest march .
carrying banners , waving red verdi flags and chanting slogans , the strikers made their way from the union building through central stuttgart to a large square where speakers encouraged them to stay the fight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching through stuttgart there did not seem to be need for much encouraging .
in fact , the mood was almost festive , now six weeks into the labor action .
instead of slumped shoulders and resigned expressions , the crowd was marked by a strong sense of determination to fight the fight for as long as it takes . " up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the result we want , and we can go on for a while .
we have enough money in the strike fund , " said bärbel illi , 47 , an employee of verdi 's stuttgart branch . heike fischer , 48 , is a child-care worker who said that although the media liked to focus on the trouble some parents have had since their child-care facilities have been closed , most parents were behind the action . " of course , all of us would rather not be on strike anymore , we would like to be with the children , " she said .
" but we ca n't stop now if we want to have a future .
we ca n't give up now , and i 'm ready to continue until we are successful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confrontation between garbage workers replacement workers many of the striking sanitation workers wore signs that said " strikebreakers , hands off our trash ! " referring to the private firms that have been hired to take care of some of the city 's sanitation problems .
those two worlds collided briefly after the main rally when a group of striking workers came across a private garbage truck waiting at a stoplight .
the group stepped in front of the vehicle and , yelling at the three men sitting inside , tried to cover the truck 's windshield with posters to prevent it from driving on .
police had to disperse the group . verdi officials say that besides showing its strength , the strike has mobilized union members , many of whom had begun wondering why they were bothering to pay their monthly dues . " it was important that the unions do something , " said jürgen rönsch , 37 , a cemetery maintenance worker .
" in my department there was hardly anyone left in the union , since it never did anything .
but now people have been coming back . " public support waning while the strike has given verdi a boost in popularity among those in sectors it represents , it is less clear how the strike will play out among the populace at large .

we already have enough unemployed people here and i ca n't be part of a policy that leads to even more people losing their jobs .
i think that 's severe and cruel and that 's why i 'm standing here .
it 's very difficult , but in my profession , a very important aspect is to instill in children a sense of social responsibility .
that means we have to share the work and we ca n't stand by and just watch while others lose their jobs . " heike marwit , 29 child-care worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike marwit " we 're lucky that the parents where i work are understanding of what we 're doing - when i hear what has happened in some other places , where parents have blockaded exits and not let child-care workers leave the facility .
i think if we give up now , the whole thing would n't have made any sense and we should n't have bothered in the first place .
i wish it would have been wrapped up sooner , but what can we do about it ? " lutz bötzer , 45 special education teacher bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutz bötzer " i 've paid union dues for 25 years and never been on a strike .
i 've got to get my money 's worth !
i can only recommend that everybody strike because you see so many people that you hardly ever come across in this big bureaucracy where we work , especially since they 've cut out the company outing , where you 'd see people at least once a year .
now on strike , we 're forced to see each other .

" we will increase our commitment and our funding by 500 million euros over the next 10 years , " transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said .
he was speaking at the opening of a second hydrogen refueling station in berlin .
the german capital 's transport authorities have promised to introduce a fleet of 14 hydrogen-powered buses by 2007 in a bid to become the european " capital " for the low-pollution technology . federal funding for the development of hydrogen-powered vehicles is to be expanded to other german regions - such as hamburg , southern germany and parts of north rhine-westphalia - in the next few years .
hydroge n -power hurdles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrogen-fueling stations are still few and far between however , there are several hindrances to the development of hydrogen-powered vehicles , principally the cost of building refueling stations . another hurdle is reducing the cost of obtaining hydrogen itself , which has to be extracted from fossil fuels , such as carbon , or from water . " as a fuel for cars , hydrogen technology has a long way to go , " tiefensee said . clea n er tech n ology could become more affordable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : optimizing technology while making it affordable is the hope experts from german automaker bmw predict that the cost of hydrogen technology could be reduced to levels affordable for individual consumers by 2015 .

in stuttgart , at the heart of the labor action , union members say they 're determined to win . it is about symbolism , many analysts say , this protracted work stoppage by the verdi services union that has closed kindergartens , interrupted hospital services and kept garbage collection trucks idle inside city garages .
while that symbolism may be about union power and unions ' futures , there 's another powerful symbol of germany 's biggest public-service stoppage in 14 years : trash . these days , it 's everywhere in stuttgart , this usually pristine city in southwestern germany , capital of the state of baden-württemberg and one of the principle cities of the historical region of swabia .
the swabians , as the stereotype goes , are not only extraordinarily thrifty ; they can be fanatically clean .
but six weeks into this public-sector strike , clean is hard to come by , at least in the public sphere .
the city is swimming in garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many explosions of trash around stuttgart trashcans have been filled to overflowing , and often , packed to the breaking point , have dumped their contents in a messy circle around them .
stuttgart 's street curbs have become the resting place for a rising tide of daily detritus : mcdonald 's cups , candy wrappers , cigarette packs and old napkins . " i 've had enough of this strike , " said doris laphardt , 46 , as she stepped over a pile of discarded paper in a central square .
" this place is beginning to look like new york . " arbitration but there could be a glimmer of hope in the strike that until just yesterday , showed no signs of coming to an end .
municipal authorities in baden-württemberg and the verdi services union said on tuesday they were bringing in outside arbitrators to try to bring the union and public-sector employers , who up until now have dug in their heels in negotiations , come closer together . the two sides have agreed to bring in two arbitrators , the head of aok health insurance for baden-württemberg , roland sing , and a former president of the state 's administrative court , claus messner .
the two began familiarizing themselves with the material on wednesday morning and talks were planned to begin between representatives from verdi and employers during the afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike hq in stuttgart employers want to extend the working week from 38.5 hour to 40 hour without an increase in pay .
they say they need to ease up pressure on state coffers - personnel costs consume almost one-half of state budgets - and argue that many other civil servants , not to mention the private sector , already work 40-hour weeks .
employers argue that they are asking public-sector employees to only add 18 minutes to each working day . verdi counters that increasing the working week will cut employees ' take home pay , which would further erode already weak consumer spending in germany .
the union also says the change could endanger some 250,000 jobs in the public sector . verdi , along with most of germany 's trade unions , has been struggling with falling membership and an increasing feeling among the populace that it is obstructionist and out of step with the realities of today 's labor environment .
while 18 minutes a day does not seem like much to ask to help prop up struggling state governments , observers say the strike has become a test of verdi 's ability to maintain its strong role in germany 's centralized bargaining system , which is increasingly under attack . " it 's really about symbolism .
the real point is whether they are forced to capitulate on this very symbolic point , " deutsche bank economist stefan schneider told reuters . noisy determination on a cold but clear tuesday morning outside the verdi headquarters in stuttgart , thoughts of capitulation were not in evidence .
at 10:30 a.m. , amid blowing whistles and rattling noisemakers , a group of some 2,500 strikers began a protest march .
carrying banners , waving red verdi flags and chanting slogans , the strikers made their way from the union building through central stuttgart to a large square where speakers encouraged them to stay the fight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching through stuttgart there did not seem to be need for much encouraging .
in fact , the mood was almost festive , now six weeks into the labor action .
instead of slumped shoulders and resigned expressions , the crowd was marked by a strong sense of determination to fight the fight for as long as it takes . " up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the result we want , and we can go on for a while .
we have enough money in the strike fund , " said bärbel illi , 47 , an employee of verdi 's stuttgart branch . heike fischer , 48 , is a child-care worker who said that although the media liked to focus on the trouble some parents have had since their child-care facilities have been closed , most parents were behind the action . " of course , all of us would rather not be on strike anymore , we would like to be with the children , " she said .
" but we ca n't stop now if we want to have a future .
we ca n't give up now , and i 'm ready to continue until we are successful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confrontation between garbage workers replacement workers many of the striking sanitation workers wore signs that said " strikebreakers , hands off our trash ! " referring to the private firms that have been hired to take care of some of the city 's sanitation problems .
those two worlds collided briefly after the main rally when a group of striking workers came across a private garbage truck waiting at a stoplight .
the group stepped in front of the vehicle and , yelling at the three men sitting inside , tried to cover the truck 's windshield with posters to prevent it from driving on .
police had to disperse the group . verdi officials say that besides showing its strength , the strike has mobilized union members , many of whom had begun wondering why they were bothering to pay their monthly dues . " it was important that the unions do something , " said jürgen rönsch , 37 , a cemetery maintenance worker .
" in my department there was hardly anyone left in the union , since it never did anything .
but now people have been coming back . " public support waning while the strike has given verdi a boost in popularity among those in sectors it represents , it is less clear how the strike will play out among the populace at large .
public disgruntlement about the labor action is growing .
in a poll last week carried out for the zdf public television channel , 61 percent of germans opposed the protests , up six percentage points from a poll conducted on feb .
17 . union members in stuttgart claim the local media is overplaying the dissatisfaction felt by stuttgart residents about the strike and the resulting piles of trash .
but on tuesday , most residents asked said they thought it was time for the striking workers to get back on the job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tired of the trash some were split on the issue , like 50-year-old maria schlom , who said she was tired of the trash but trying to remain open : " i can sympathize if the fear is really about losing jobs , " she said .

in stuttgart , at the heart of the labor action , union members say they 're determined to win . it is about symbolism , many analysts say , this protracted work stoppage by the verdi services union that has closed kindergartens , interrupted hospital services and kept garbage collection trucks idle inside city garages .
while that symbolism may be about union power and unions ' futures , there 's another powerful symbol of germany 's biggest public-service stoppage in 14 years : trash . these days , it 's everywhere in stuttgart , this usually pristine city in southwestern germany , capital of the state of baden-württemberg and one of the principle cities of the historical region of swabia .
the swabians , as the stereotype goes , are not only extraordinarily thrifty ; they can be fanatically clean .
but six weeks into this public-sector strike , clean is hard to come by , at least in the public sphere .
the city is swimming in garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many explosions of trash around stuttgart trashcans have been filled to overflowing , and often , packed to the breaking point , have dumped their contents in a messy circle around them .
stuttgart 's street curbs have become the resting place for a rising tide of daily detritus : mcdonald 's cups , candy wrappers , cigarette packs and old napkins . " i 've had enough of this strike , " said doris laphardt , 46 , as she stepped over a pile of discarded paper in a central square .
" this place is beginning to look like new york . " arbitration but there could be a glimmer of hope in the strike that until just yesterday , showed no signs of coming to an end .
municipal authorities in baden-württemberg and the verdi services union said on tuesday they were bringing in outside arbitrators to try to bring the union and public-sector employers , who up until now have dug in their heels in negotiations , come closer together . the two sides have agreed to bring in two arbitrators , the head of aok health insurance for baden-württemberg , roland sing , and a former president of the state 's administrative court , claus messner .
the two began familiarizing themselves with the material on wednesday morning and talks were planned to begin between representatives from verdi and employers during the afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike hq in stuttgart employers want to extend the working week from 38.5 hour to 40 hour without an increase in pay .
they say they need to ease up pressure on state coffers - personnel costs consume almost one-half of state budgets - and argue that many other civil servants , not to mention the private sector , already work 40-hour weeks .
employers argue that they are asking public-sector employees to only add 18 minutes to each working day . verdi counters that increasing the working week will cut employees ' take home pay , which would further erode already weak consumer spending in germany .
the union also says the change could endanger some 250,000 jobs in the public sector . verdi , along with most of germany 's trade unions , has been struggling with falling membership and an increasing feeling among the populace that it is obstructionist and out of step with the realities of today 's labor environment .
while 18 minutes a day does not seem like much to ask to help prop up struggling state governments , observers say the strike has become a test of verdi 's ability to maintain its strong role in germany 's centralized bargaining system , which is increasingly under attack . " it 's really about symbolism .
the real point is whether they are forced to capitulate on this very symbolic point , " deutsche bank economist stefan schneider told reuters . noisy determination on a cold but clear tuesday morning outside the verdi headquarters in stuttgart , thoughts of capitulation were not in evidence .
at 10:30 a.m. , amid blowing whistles and rattling noisemakers , a group of some 2,500 strikers began a protest march .
carrying banners , waving red verdi flags and chanting slogans , the strikers made their way from the union building through central stuttgart to a large square where speakers encouraged them to stay the fight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching through stuttgart there did not seem to be need for much encouraging .
in fact , the mood was almost festive , now six weeks into the labor action .
instead of slumped shoulders and resigned expressions , the crowd was marked by a strong sense of determination to fight the fight for as long as it takes . " up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the result we want , and we can go on for a while .
we have enough money in the strike fund , " said bärbel illi , 47 , an employee of verdi 's stuttgart branch . heike fischer , 48 , is a child-care worker who said that although the media liked to focus on the trouble some parents have had since their child-care facilities have been closed , most parents were behind the action . " of course , all of us would rather not be on strike anymore , we would like to be with the children , " she said .
" but we ca n't stop now if we want to have a future .
we ca n't give up now , and i 'm ready to continue until we are successful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confrontation between garbage workers replacement workers many of the striking sanitation workers wore signs that said " strikebreakers , hands off our trash ! " referring to the private firms that have been hired to take care of some of the city 's sanitation problems .
those two worlds collided briefly after the main rally when a group of striking workers came across a private garbage truck waiting at a stoplight .
the group stepped in front of the vehicle and , yelling at the three men sitting inside , tried to cover the truck 's windshield with posters to prevent it from driving on .
police had to disperse the group . verdi officials say that besides showing its strength , the strike has mobilized union members , many of whom had begun wondering why they were bothering to pay their monthly dues . " it was important that the unions do something , " said jürgen rönsch , 37 , a cemetery maintenance worker .
" in my department there was hardly anyone left in the union , since it never did anything .
but now people have been coming back . " public support waning while the strike has given verdi a boost in popularity among those in sectors it represents , it is less clear how the strike will play out among the populace at large .
public disgruntlement about the labor action is growing .
in a poll last week carried out for the zdf public television channel , 61 percent of germans opposed the protests , up six percentage points from a poll conducted on feb .
17 . union members in stuttgart claim the local media is overplaying the dissatisfaction felt by stuttgart residents about the strike and the resulting piles of trash .
but on tuesday , most residents asked said they thought it was time for the striking workers to get back on the job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tired of the trash some were split on the issue , like 50-year-old maria schlom , who said she was tired of the trash but trying to remain open : " i can sympathize if the fear is really about losing jobs , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.03.2006 why the fight against terrorist financing is faltering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money laundering and the financing of terrorism go hand in hand the financing of international terrorism is notoriously hard to stop .
but according to political economist friedrich schneider , that 's partly due to hypocritical western governments , who do n't want to be team players . an international conference on combating the financing of terrorism is being held in the hague on wednesday and thursday .
dw-world.de spoke with political economist friedrich schneider from johannes kepler university in linz , austria , about the chances of successfully cutting off terrorists ' money supplies and the obstacles preventing faster progress . dw-world.de : professor schneider , seven years ago , the g7 countries initiated the international financial action task force , or fatf .
it is meant to fight terrorist financing , but so far , the force has n't had any significant success .
why are these international efforts failing ? friedrich schneider : on an international level , next to nothing is being done .
it 's that simple .
every country is doing its own work , there 's no international cooperation that 's working .
data is n't even being exchanged in the aftermath of a terrorist attack , let alone cooperation among various secret services . why is n't there more cooperation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban leader mullah omar : the us funded the taliban in the past i 'll give you an example .
if the french finance covert operations in africa through their secret service , or if the germans pay ransom in iraq , do you think these governments want to publicly acknowledge this kind of financing ?
and good and evil can quickly change , as we know .
just take the taliban in afghanistan , for example .
for a long time , they were financed by the united states when the us was against russia .
this is where hypocrisy comes in .
if governments do n't want to expose their own covert financing operations , then they ca n't have any real interest in more efficient uncovering of money laundering . to what extent is money laundering linked to the financing of terrorism ?
money laundering is mostly associated with the drugs trade and human trafficking . terrorist financing is , broadly speaking , the financing of terrorist operations , and not all that much money is needed .
the september 2001 attacks cost just $ 500,000 , including flight training .
much more money is needed for the maintenance of terrorist bases .
to pull together this kind of funding , money from the drugs trade , illegal diamond trading or kidnapping is laundered . so is it mainly through the tracking of money laundering that sources of terrorist financing can be found ?
with money from legal operations … … you ca n't prevent the financing of terrorism .
there are donations to terrorist organizations - hamas for example .
it gets a lot of money from arab states for hospitals and schools , but where there 's no clear dividing line to show whether the money was used for terrorist acts . what can really be done to stop terrorist financing then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug money often ends up financing terrorist cells the first question is , whether there is any desire to effectively fight money laundering .
only then can you really combat terrorist financing .
to fight money laundering , you need international cooperation , and a task force that is just as agile and flexible as the terrorists .
this would also require the regulations prohibiting data exchange to be loosened , but so far that has n't happened . what can financial service providers do to stop terrorist financing ? that depends firstly on the extent to which they want to do business with people from the mafia or other organized criminals .
investigators rely on insider information from banks which often have little knowledge about how clean certain transactions are . as a political economist , you 've called for combating poverty and promoting democratic values as a way to stop terrorism .
why ? simply put , people who earn money do n't throw bombs .
if i have a house , a car , and a well-paid job , i 'm less likely to become a terrorist .
there will always be fanatics who resort to terrorism regardless of their income , but they 'll be far fewer .
it 's about drying up part of the basis for terrorism , which is why fighting poverty is such an effective strategy .
in addition to this , we have to fight religious extremism , and deal with religious differences in a peaceful manner , but there have only been half-hearted attempts at that so far . that does n't sound very optimistic .
how do you think the financing of terrorism will develop in the future ? unfortunately , i think europe will have to experience two or three more attacks before we start to work more closely together . martin schrader interviewed friedrich schneider send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops the agenda in warsaw as the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member council of europe enters its last day in warsaw , talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime .

but according to political economist friedrich schneider , that 's partly due to hypocritical western governments , who do n't want to be team players . an international conference on combating the financing of terrorism is being held in the hague on wednesday and thursday .
dw-world.de spoke with political economist friedrich schneider from johannes kepler university in linz , austria , about the chances of successfully cutting off terrorists ' money supplies and the obstacles preventing faster progress . dw-world.de : professor schneider , seven years ago , the g7 countries initiated the international financial action task force , or fatf .
it is meant to fight terrorist financing , but so far , the force has n't had any significant success .
why are these international efforts failing ? friedrich schneider : on an international level , next to nothing is being done .
it 's that simple .
every country is doing its own work , there 's no international cooperation that 's working .
data is n't even being exchanged in the aftermath of a terrorist attack , let alone cooperation among various secret services . why is n't there more cooperation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban leader mullah omar : the us funded the taliban in the past i 'll give you an example .
if the french finance covert operations in africa through their secret service , or if the germans pay ransom in iraq , do you think these governments want to publicly acknowledge this kind of financing ?
and good and evil can quickly change , as we know .
just take the taliban in afghanistan , for example .
for a long time , they were financed by the united states when the us was against russia .
this is where hypocrisy comes in .
if governments do n't want to expose their own covert financing operations , then they ca n't have any real interest in more efficient uncovering of money laundering . to what extent is money laundering linked to the financing of terrorism ?
money laundering is mostly associated with the drugs trade and human trafficking . terrorist financing is , broadly speaking , the financing of terrorist operations , and not all that much money is needed .
the september 2001 attacks cost just $ 500,000 , including flight training .
much more money is needed for the maintenance of terrorist bases .
to pull together this kind of funding , money from the drugs trade , illegal diamond trading or kidnapping is laundered . so is it mainly through the tracking of money laundering that sources of terrorist financing can be found ?
with money from legal operations … … you ca n't prevent the financing of terrorism .
there are donations to terrorist organizations - hamas for example .
it gets a lot of money from arab states for hospitals and schools , but where there 's no clear dividing line to show whether the money was used for terrorist acts . what can really be done to stop terrorist financing then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug money often ends up financing terrorist cells the first question is , whether there is any desire to effectively fight money laundering .
only then can you really combat terrorist financing .
to fight money laundering , you need international cooperation , and a task force that is just as agile and flexible as the terrorists .
this would also require the regulations prohibiting data exchange to be loosened , but so far that has n't happened . what can financial service providers do to stop terrorist financing ? that depends firstly on the extent to which they want to do business with people from the mafia or other organized criminals .
investigators rely on insider information from banks which often have little knowledge about how clean certain transactions are . as a political economist , you 've called for combating poverty and promoting democratic values as a way to stop terrorism .
why ? simply put , people who earn money do n't throw bombs .
if i have a house , a car , and a well-paid job , i 'm less likely to become a terrorist .
there will always be fanatics who resort to terrorism regardless of their income , but they 'll be far fewer .
it 's about drying up part of the basis for terrorism , which is why fighting poverty is such an effective strategy .
in addition to this , we have to fight religious extremism , and deal with religious differences in a peaceful manner , but there have only been half-hearted attempts at that so far . that does n't sound very optimistic .
how do you think the financing of terrorism will develop in the future ? unfortunately , i think europe will have to experience two or three more attacks before we start to work more closely together . martin schrader interviewed friedrich schneider send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops the agenda in warsaw as the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member council of europe enters its last day in warsaw , talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime .

work-life balance gets boost in germany the dumbing down of germany gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids germany -pipe- 15.03.2006 politicians discuss pension cuts for childless germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's younger generation is dwindling new statistics confirming the declining birth rate have sent germany in to a state of panic , amid a growing consensus that pensions should be increased for people with children and reduced for those without . " people without children should either receive a reduced pension or pay more into pension schemes , " said norbert geis from the csu . johann eekhoff , director of the cologne institute for economic policy said a reform of the pension system was long overdue . " people without children should never have been admitted into pension schemes because these only work when they are financed by subsequent generations , " he said in an interview with mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" their pensions should be cut by 50 percent . " cdu politician elisabeth winkelmeier-becker agreed , pointing out that working parents are financially disadvantaged compared to their childless peers .
" in the long-term , we need to consider awarding people without children lower pensions , " she said . chilling statistics the headline in germany 's mass-selling daily bild on wednesday said it all : " baby shock : we germans are dying out , " the paper screamed . that might sound a bit extreme , but latest figures , based on data collected at the federal statistics office , released on tuesday have sent a chill among demographers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more babies were born in post-war year of 1946 than today last year , only some 676,000 children were born in germany according to german daily die welt which cited forecasts by the federal statistics office .
that pushed the birth rate to its worst low in 15 years : in 2004 , the number of newborns amounted to 706,000 .
that 's all still significantly less than the 922,000 births in the post-war year of 1946 . " that 's dramatic , we 're running into a dead end , " michael hüther , director of the cologne-based institute for the german economy told the paper . wiesbaden on top the demographic figures have also shown huge variations in germany 's 50 largest cities . the eastern german city of magdeburg , the capital of saxony-anhalt , took the dubious honor of having the lowest birth rate in the country : only some 6.9 children per 1000 inhabitants are born in the city on a yearly average . as against that , the significantly richer city of wiesbaden near frankfurt , has the highest birth rate with 10.5 births per 1000 inhabitants .
the western german cities of frankfurt and bonn followed closely , while the capital berlin also features on spot 30 with a birthrate of 8.7 . issue being taken seriously though the latest statistics have come as a shock , the issue is hardly new in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is apparently doing things better when it comes to boosting its birth rate according to eurostat , the eu statistics office , there were 8.5 births per 1000 inhabitants in germany in 2004 - making it the country with the lowest birth rate in the entire european union .
countries such as france and britain boasted birthrates - at 12.7 and 12.0 respectively in the same year - that exceeded german levels by more than 50 percent . for years , politicians and demographers in germany have warned of the dangers of a falling birth rate and ageing population .
in recent months in particular , the subject has raced to the top of the political agenda and been the focus of heated debates over family-friendly and childcare policies . the damning pisa study on germany 's faltering education standards has also stepped up the urgency surrounding the issue .
in january this year , the ruling grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats decided to make it easier for working mothers to continue being part of the labor market , increasing tax breaks on child care , encourage setting up full-day schools and making kindergartens cost-free . chancellor merkel 's family affairs minister , ursula von der leyen , a mother of seven children herself , has also been credited with pushing for family-friendly policies and ensuring that the issue remains in the political spotlight . much more to be done but , it 's obvious that more needs to be done . on wednesday , johannes singhammer , family affairs spokesman for the conservative union of the christian democrats and christian social democrats demanded that demographic policies had to be given a high priority . efforts to fight the " free fall of births " had to take a place at the center of politics alongside the battle against unemployment and reining in the ballooning deficit , singhammer added . dw staff -lrb- sp / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : learning to think outside the box once dismissed as " nonsense " by former chancellor schröder , family policies have now climbed to the top of germany 's political agenda .
the debate is headed in the right direction , says dw-world 's uta thofern .

work-life balance gets boost in germany the dumbing down of germany gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids germany -pipe- 15.03.2006 politicians discuss pension cuts for childless germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's younger generation is dwindling new statistics confirming the declining birth rate have sent germany in to a state of panic , amid a growing consensus that pensions should be increased for people with children and reduced for those without . " people without children should either receive a reduced pension or pay more into pension schemes , " said norbert geis from the csu . johann eekhoff , director of the cologne institute for economic policy said a reform of the pension system was long overdue . " people without children should never have been admitted into pension schemes because these only work when they are financed by subsequent generations , " he said in an interview with mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" their pensions should be cut by 50 percent . " cdu politician elisabeth winkelmeier-becker agreed , pointing out that working parents are financially disadvantaged compared to their childless peers .
" in the long-term , we need to consider awarding people without children lower pensions , " she said . chilling statistics the headline in germany 's mass-selling daily bild on wednesday said it all : " baby shock : we germans are dying out , " the paper screamed . that might sound a bit extreme , but latest figures , based on data collected at the federal statistics office , released on tuesday have sent a chill among demographers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more babies were born in post-war year of 1946 than today last year , only some 676,000 children were born in germany according to german daily die welt which cited forecasts by the federal statistics office .
that pushed the birth rate to its worst low in 15 years : in 2004 , the number of newborns amounted to 706,000 .
that 's all still significantly less than the 922,000 births in the post-war year of 1946 . " that 's dramatic , we 're running into a dead end , " michael hüther , director of the cologne-based institute for the german economy told the paper . wiesbaden on top the demographic figures have also shown huge variations in germany 's 50 largest cities . the eastern german city of magdeburg , the capital of saxony-anhalt , took the dubious honor of having the lowest birth rate in the country : only some 6.9 children per 1000 inhabitants are born in the city on a yearly average . as against that , the significantly richer city of wiesbaden near frankfurt , has the highest birth rate with 10.5 births per 1000 inhabitants .
the western german cities of frankfurt and bonn followed closely , while the capital berlin also features on spot 30 with a birthrate of 8.7 . issue being taken seriously though the latest statistics have come as a shock , the issue is hardly new in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is apparently doing things better when it comes to boosting its birth rate according to eurostat , the eu statistics office , there were 8.5 births per 1000 inhabitants in germany in 2004 - making it the country with the lowest birth rate in the entire european union .
countries such as france and britain boasted birthrates - at 12.7 and 12.0 respectively in the same year - that exceeded german levels by more than 50 percent . for years , politicians and demographers in germany have warned of the dangers of a falling birth rate and ageing population .
in recent months in particular , the subject has raced to the top of the political agenda and been the focus of heated debates over family-friendly and childcare policies . the damning pisa study on germany 's faltering education standards has also stepped up the urgency surrounding the issue .
in january this year , the ruling grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats decided to make it easier for working mothers to continue being part of the labor market , increasing tax breaks on child care , encourage setting up full-day schools and making kindergartens cost-free . chancellor merkel 's family affairs minister , ursula von der leyen , a mother of seven children herself , has also been credited with pushing for family-friendly policies and ensuring that the issue remains in the political spotlight . much more to be done but , it 's obvious that more needs to be done . on wednesday , johannes singhammer , family affairs spokesman for the conservative union of the christian democrats and christian social democrats demanded that demographic policies had to be given a high priority . efforts to fight the " free fall of births " had to take a place at the center of politics alongside the battle against unemployment and reining in the ballooning deficit , singhammer added . dw staff -lrb- sp / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : learning to think outside the box once dismissed as " nonsense " by former chancellor schröder , family policies have now climbed to the top of germany 's political agenda .

a new german soap opera has the answer : all hell breaks loose . " turkish for beginners , " a new soap opera which premiered on german public broadcaster ard on tuesday , is a highly entertaining bonanza of cultural stereotypes .
in it , doris schneider , an anti-disciplinarian german therapist and mother of two , falls in love with turkish policeman metin öztürk , a father of two as well .
to the absolute horror of the children from both sides of the cultural divide , doris -lrb- played by anna stieblich -rrb- and metin -lrb- adnan maral -rrb- decide to move in with each other and conduct a risky , cross-cultural family merger . yagmur and cem , metin 's children , are walking and talking cliches of young turks living in germany .
yagmur picks her room in the new apartment with a compass so that she can determine the direction of mecca for her regular prayers .
cem , a quintessential wannabe macho , hangs out with his friends and speaks with a strong turkish accent in order to sound street-smart and cool .

" i orient myself on american tv shows , in which the whole ensemble has a chance to develop , " soap author bora dagtekin said .

" integration is the central goal of the current social policy , " mangold said . but you would n't be able to guess that by watching german television .

a new german soap opera has the answer : all hell breaks loose . " turkish for beginners , " a new soap opera which premiered on german public broadcaster ard on tuesday , is a highly entertaining bonanza of cultural stereotypes .
in it , doris schneider , an anti-disciplinarian german therapist and mother of two , falls in love with turkish policeman metin öztürk , a father of two as well .
to the absolute horror of the children from both sides of the cultural divide , doris -lrb- played by anna stieblich -rrb- and metin -lrb- adnan maral -rrb- decide to move in with each other and conduct a risky , cross-cultural family merger . yagmur and cem , metin 's children , are walking and talking cliches of young turks living in germany .
yagmur picks her room in the new apartment with a compass so that she can determine the direction of mecca for her regular prayers .
cem , a quintessential wannabe macho , hangs out with his friends and speaks with a strong turkish accent in order to sound street-smart and cool .
he believes that a woman 's place is next to the stove , but he 's in for a big surprise when he finds out that his new stepmother ca n't cook . new frontiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tough guy with a soft spot for celine dion appearances are , nonetheless , deceptive .
behind her stern , anti-western facade , yagmur secretly watches music videos on tv .
lena , doris ' daughter , is openly opposed to her mother 's intercultural experiment , but deep down she finds her new family to be just whacky enough to have lots of fun with . and cem , despite wanting to be a tough guy , falls in love with an asian girl and writes a love letter under the unlikely poetic influence of celine dion , the exemplary queen of commercial sap . " i orient myself on american tv shows , in which the whole ensemble has a chance to develop , " soap author bora dagtekin said .
" these are the stories in which inner conflicts are not only reserved for the leading character . " " turkish for beginners " is an exceptional show on german television .
there is not a touch of political correctness in it , but it freshens up the usually rather stale tv portraits of foreigners in germany . moving beyond the kebab joint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teenage angst with a german-turkish twist is the basis of the new ard soap " i find it highly critical that turks always only work in kebab joints -lrb- on television -rrb- , " said michael mangold , who leads the institute for media and economics at the karlsruhe center for art and media technology . " integration is the central goal of the current social policy , " mangold said . but you would n't be able to guess that by watching german television .
according to the nuremberg society for consumer research , german tv channels are not particularly interested in targeting their programs for the turkish audience since turks in germany spend half of their television time watching turkish channels via satellite dishes . " that is probably because they do not feel they are being addressed by german television , " mangold said .

" we will increase our commitment and our funding by 500 million euros over the next 10 years , " transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said .
he was speaking at the opening of a second hydrogen refueling station in berlin .
the german capital 's transport authorities have promised to introduce a fleet of 14 hydrogen-powered buses by 2007 in a bid to become the european " capital " for the low-pollution technology . federal funding for the development of hydrogen-powered vehicles is to be expanded to other german regions - such as hamburg , southern germany and parts of north rhine-westphalia - in the next few years .
hydroge n -power hurdles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrogen-fueling stations are still few and far between however , there are several hindrances to the development of hydrogen-powered vehicles , principally the cost of building refueling stations . another hurdle is reducing the cost of obtaining hydrogen itself , which has to be extracted from fossil fuels , such as carbon , or from water . " as a fuel for cars , hydrogen technology has a long way to go , " tiefensee said . clea n er tech n ology could become more affordable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : optimizing technology while making it affordable is the hope experts from german automaker bmw predict that the cost of hydrogen technology could be reduced to levels affordable for individual consumers by 2015 .
even then , basic hydrogen-powered cars would cost up to 3,000 euros -lrb- 3,600 dollars -rrb- more than gasoline models at today 's prices . bmw , daimlerchrysler , ford and gm / opel are the four car manufacturers involved in the clean energy partnership , an international group set up to develop hydrogen power which receives support from the german government . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de high fuel prices push alternative engines record prices at gas stations caused in part by the devastating effects of hurricane katrina have knocked discussion in germany about alternative engines into high gear ahead of this month 's auto show .

below are some voices from verdi members at tuesday 's demonstration . jürgen rönsch , 37 cemetery maintenance worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rönsch " the strike is more justified than ever .
it 's not about these 18 minutes a day , it 's about our jobs .
everything 's being cut little by little , and no one can tell us that the 40-hour week wo n't lead to more cuts .
we want to keep these jobs for the future , for young people and we 're not going to back down .
it 's not easy for me financially , but i accept the losses .
i 'm ready to strike for as long as it takes and i think we have more support than the press says we do . " bärbel illi , 47 verdi union employee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bärbel illi " it 's going well and up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the results we want , and we can go on for a while since we have enough money in the strike fund .
i hope that this is a new beginning for the union , since the strike has brought us a lot of new members .
more people see now what the union is there for , why they need it .
i hope that it 's a revival for us . " heike fischer , 48 child-care worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike fischer " the press always focuses on parents who are against the strike , but where i work , out of 50 parents , there are just two who are against the strike .
but the press never talks about that .
i think it 's a conscious smear against our strike .
the parents stand with us , because they know what kind of quality we bring to the center , and they do n't want that quality to be reduced . " helmut zahner , 53 civil engineer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut zahner " we still think it 's absolutely necessary to strike .
we regret that employers are taking such a hard-line position and that it 's become a political fight in the meantime , especially when you see that the states governed by the christian democrats are being so unrelenting .
i 'm employed by the city in the civil engineering office and for 10 years i 've watched how jobs have been cut .
that 's why we do n't believe the mayor when he says this extension of working hours wo n't lead to job cuts .
there are some sectors where a 35-hour work week is the norm .
others in the private sector have 40 , but employees are compensated financially for that .
i do n't buy the argument that everyone has to work longer these days . " " the longer we strike , the more determined the strikers are .
you could feel it ; there 's a certain rage there and that helps strengthen our determination to keep going .
we 're more determined than ever . " gabriele krische , 44 kindergarten teacher bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriele krische " i am resolute because i do n't want jobs to be cut where i work .
we already have enough unemployed people here and i ca n't be part of a policy that leads to even more people losing their jobs .
i think that 's severe and cruel and that 's why i 'm standing here .
it 's very difficult , but in my profession , a very important aspect is to instill in children a sense of social responsibility .
that means we have to share the work and we ca n't stand by and just watch while others lose their jobs .

i think if we give up now , the whole thing would n't have made any sense and we should n't have bothered in the first place .
i wish it would have been wrapped up sooner , but what can we do about it ? " lutz bötzer , 45 special education teacher bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutz bötzer " i 've paid union dues for 25 years and never been on a strike .
i 've got to get my money 's worth !

the company would first wait and see whether a rival offer materialized from a third party , merck 's supervisory board chief wilhelm simson told a news conference in berlin . but merck was not prepared to pay so high a price that a purchase could only be financed by selling off bits of schering , simson added . the price of 77 euros per share was " fair " , he continued .
and simson said he hoped to meet with schering 's chairman hubertus erlen later on tuesday . " our main aim is to enter into negotiations with schering , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.03.2006 a spring festival for books großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-day fair kicks off on thursday the key to the success of the leipzig book fair is that there is something for everyone , from works by budding novelists to world renowned authors , comic books and audio books and much more ... each year , there are two book fairs in germany : in the autumn , the massive international trade fair in frankfurt , and in the spring , the more intimate leipzig book fair that brings together authors and readers .
thanks to public demand and a positive resonance from publishers in recent years , the four-day leipzig book fair , which will kick off on thursday , has emerged as europe 's largest literary festival for author readings and events . leipzig does not even strive to compete with frankfurt , but over the years , has established its own identity , especially with its popular concept " leipzig reads . "
unlike frankfurt , which is geared towards trade professionals , leipzig generates much of its business from the general public . children are welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comic books are one of the key attractions of the book fair during the day , the fair is held in new , modern facilities outside the city center , where literary fans from all walks of life gather - be it school classes storming the exhibits , parents pushing prams down the aisles , or readers coming into contact with internationally best-selling authors in an informal atmosphere .
a large chunk of the fairgrounds will also be devoted to children 's books and comics . in the evenings , numerous readings are offered throughout the city , in bookshops , cozy cafes or a city hall chamber .
there will be 1,800 events this year alone , and late night partygoers could even bump into vladimir kaminer , the german-russian author of " russian disco , " who doubles up as a disc jockey . emphasis on german literature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author vladimir kaminer will double up as a disc jockey for the fair what distinguishes leipzig from frankfurt , is the strong emphasis on german-language literature and its knack for discovering young talent .
a number of well-known authors , such as ingo schulze , got their publishing start at the fair .
schulze , along with max frisch , and heinrich böll , is among the very few german authors , who have had the distinction of being published in the new yorker magazine . the magic of leipzig is that everyone can find his or her niche , whether it is the budding novelist or a world renowned author , according to oliver zille , head of the book fair . given the proximity of this city in saxony to central and eastern europe , the foreign focus is on showcasing up-and-coming authors from that region and launching them in the german-language market .
due to its unique role as the cultural bridge in a wider europe that has expanded eastwards , it has become a book fair tradition to award the " prize for european understanding " to one outstanding author each year .
this year ukrainian writer juri andruchovich , who has chronicled political events that unfolded in his home country before and after the orange revolution , will be honored . audio books are big in leipzig leipzig not only " reads , " but " leipzig listens " as well .
another tradition is to award the " hörkules " prize in the audio segment of the book market , which has experienced tremendous growth in the past several years .
plenty of events will revolve around the medium of audio books or productions .
emerging playwrights for example , can get feedback for their unpublished radio plays performed in front of a live audience . bildunterschrift : taking in culture at leipzig 's renowned gewandhaus leipzig has been dubbed the " city of the black arts " for its centuries-long tradition in the printing and book trade .
after world war ii and the division of germany , frankfurt became the venue for the world 's biggest fair in the publishing industry , whereas leipzig , relegated to decades of communist rule , became primarily a forum for east-west publishers . internationally , leipzig is a city that has long been associated with values such as liberty and freedom of expression , having led the peaceful demonstrations in 1989 that led to the fall of the berlin wall .
it is also famous for its cultural life and the gewandhaus orchestra . at the time of german reunification in 1990 , publishing houses in the former east germany were shut down or integrated into west german ones .
but already in 1991 , the leipzig book fair came back with a vengeance .
leipzig may never have the global impact and resources of its big brother in frankfurt , but it certainly sounds like more fun . gabriela schaaf -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de art , book , music and lifestyle fairs while cologne remains germany 's art and furniture capital , the publishing industry heads to frankfurt and leipzig 's fairs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.03.2006 a spring festival for books großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-day fair kicks off on thursday the key to the success of the leipzig book fair is that there is something for everyone , from works by budding novelists to world renowned authors , comic books and audio books and much more ... each year , there are two book fairs in germany : in the autumn , the massive international trade fair in frankfurt , and in the spring , the more intimate leipzig book fair that brings together authors and readers .
thanks to public demand and a positive resonance from publishers in recent years , the four-day leipzig book fair , which will kick off on thursday , has emerged as europe 's largest literary festival for author readings and events . leipzig does not even strive to compete with frankfurt , but over the years , has established its own identity , especially with its popular concept " leipzig reads . "
unlike frankfurt , which is geared towards trade professionals , leipzig generates much of its business from the general public . children are welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comic books are one of the key attractions of the book fair during the day , the fair is held in new , modern facilities outside the city center , where literary fans from all walks of life gather - be it school classes storming the exhibits , parents pushing prams down the aisles , or readers coming into contact with internationally best-selling authors in an informal atmosphere .
a large chunk of the fairgrounds will also be devoted to children 's books and comics . in the evenings , numerous readings are offered throughout the city , in bookshops , cozy cafes or a city hall chamber .
there will be 1,800 events this year alone , and late night partygoers could even bump into vladimir kaminer , the german-russian author of " russian disco , " who doubles up as a disc jockey . emphasis on german literature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author vladimir kaminer will double up as a disc jockey for the fair what distinguishes leipzig from frankfurt , is the strong emphasis on german-language literature and its knack for discovering young talent .
a number of well-known authors , such as ingo schulze , got their publishing start at the fair .
schulze , along with max frisch , and heinrich böll , is among the very few german authors , who have had the distinction of being published in the new yorker magazine . the magic of leipzig is that everyone can find his or her niche , whether it is the budding novelist or a world renowned author , according to oliver zille , head of the book fair . given the proximity of this city in saxony to central and eastern europe , the foreign focus is on showcasing up-and-coming authors from that region and launching them in the german-language market .
due to its unique role as the cultural bridge in a wider europe that has expanded eastwards , it has become a book fair tradition to award the " prize for european understanding " to one outstanding author each year .
this year ukrainian writer juri andruchovich , who has chronicled political events that unfolded in his home country before and after the orange revolution , will be honored . audio books are big in leipzig leipzig not only " reads , " but " leipzig listens " as well .
another tradition is to award the " hörkules " prize in the audio segment of the book market , which has experienced tremendous growth in the past several years .
plenty of events will revolve around the medium of audio books or productions .
emerging playwrights for example , can get feedback for their unpublished radio plays performed in front of a live audience . bildunterschrift : taking in culture at leipzig 's renowned gewandhaus leipzig has been dubbed the " city of the black arts " for its centuries-long tradition in the printing and book trade .
after world war ii and the division of germany , frankfurt became the venue for the world 's biggest fair in the publishing industry , whereas leipzig , relegated to decades of communist rule , became primarily a forum for east-west publishers . internationally , leipzig is a city that has long been associated with values such as liberty and freedom of expression , having led the peaceful demonstrations in 1989 that led to the fall of the berlin wall .
it is also famous for its cultural life and the gewandhaus orchestra . at the time of german reunification in 1990 , publishing houses in the former east germany were shut down or integrated into west german ones .
but already in 1991 , the leipzig book fair came back with a vengeance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.03.2006 a spring festival for books großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-day fair kicks off on thursday the key to the success of the leipzig book fair is that there is something for everyone , from works by budding novelists to world renowned authors , comic books and audio books and much more ... each year , there are two book fairs in germany : in the autumn , the massive international trade fair in frankfurt , and in the spring , the more intimate leipzig book fair that brings together authors and readers .
thanks to public demand and a positive resonance from publishers in recent years , the four-day leipzig book fair , which will kick off on thursday , has emerged as europe 's largest literary festival for author readings and events . leipzig does not even strive to compete with frankfurt , but over the years , has established its own identity , especially with its popular concept " leipzig reads . "
unlike frankfurt , which is geared towards trade professionals , leipzig generates much of its business from the general public . children are welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comic books are one of the key attractions of the book fair during the day , the fair is held in new , modern facilities outside the city center , where literary fans from all walks of life gather - be it school classes storming the exhibits , parents pushing prams down the aisles , or readers coming into contact with internationally best-selling authors in an informal atmosphere .
a large chunk of the fairgrounds will also be devoted to children 's books and comics . in the evenings , numerous readings are offered throughout the city , in bookshops , cozy cafes or a city hall chamber .
there will be 1,800 events this year alone , and late night partygoers could even bump into vladimir kaminer , the german-russian author of " russian disco , " who doubles up as a disc jockey . emphasis on german literature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author vladimir kaminer will double up as a disc jockey for the fair what distinguishes leipzig from frankfurt , is the strong emphasis on german-language literature and its knack for discovering young talent .
a number of well-known authors , such as ingo schulze , got their publishing start at the fair .
schulze , along with max frisch , and heinrich böll , is among the very few german authors , who have had the distinction of being published in the new yorker magazine . the magic of leipzig is that everyone can find his or her niche , whether it is the budding novelist or a world renowned author , according to oliver zille , head of the book fair . given the proximity of this city in saxony to central and eastern europe , the foreign focus is on showcasing up-and-coming authors from that region and launching them in the german-language market .
due to its unique role as the cultural bridge in a wider europe that has expanded eastwards , it has become a book fair tradition to award the " prize for european understanding " to one outstanding author each year .
this year ukrainian writer juri andruchovich , who has chronicled political events that unfolded in his home country before and after the orange revolution , will be honored . audio books are big in leipzig leipzig not only " reads , " but " leipzig listens " as well .
another tradition is to award the " hörkules " prize in the audio segment of the book market , which has experienced tremendous growth in the past several years .
plenty of events will revolve around the medium of audio books or productions .
emerging playwrights for example , can get feedback for their unpublished radio plays performed in front of a live audience . bildunterschrift : taking in culture at leipzig 's renowned gewandhaus leipzig has been dubbed the " city of the black arts " for its centuries-long tradition in the printing and book trade .
after world war ii and the division of germany , frankfurt became the venue for the world 's biggest fair in the publishing industry , whereas leipzig , relegated to decades of communist rule , became primarily a forum for east-west publishers . internationally , leipzig is a city that has long been associated with values such as liberty and freedom of expression , having led the peaceful demonstrations in 1989 that led to the fall of the berlin wall .
it is also famous for its cultural life and the gewandhaus orchestra . at the time of german reunification in 1990 , publishing houses in the former east germany were shut down or integrated into west german ones .
but already in 1991 , the leipzig book fair came back with a vengeance .
leipzig may never have the global impact and resources of its big brother in frankfurt , but it certainly sounds like more fun . gabriela schaaf -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de art , book , music and lifestyle fairs while cologne remains germany 's art and furniture capital , the publishing industry heads to frankfurt and leipzig 's fairs .

thanks to public demand and a positive resonance from publishers in recent years , the four-day leipzig book fair , which will kick off on thursday , has emerged as europe 's largest literary festival for author readings and events . leipzig does not even strive to compete with frankfurt , but over the years , has established its own identity , especially with its popular concept " leipzig reads . "
unlike frankfurt , which is geared towards trade professionals , leipzig generates much of its business from the general public . children are welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comic books are one of the key attractions of the book fair during the day , the fair is held in new , modern facilities outside the city center , where literary fans from all walks of life gather - be it school classes storming the exhibits , parents pushing prams down the aisles , or readers coming into contact with internationally best-selling authors in an informal atmosphere .
a large chunk of the fairgrounds will also be devoted to children 's books and comics . in the evenings , numerous readings are offered throughout the city , in bookshops , cozy cafes or a city hall chamber .
there will be 1,800 events this year alone , and late night partygoers could even bump into vladimir kaminer , the german-russian author of " russian disco , " who doubles up as a disc jockey . emphasis on german literature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author vladimir kaminer will double up as a disc jockey for the fair what distinguishes leipzig from frankfurt , is the strong emphasis on german-language literature and its knack for discovering young talent .
a number of well-known authors , such as ingo schulze , got their publishing start at the fair .
schulze , along with max frisch , and heinrich böll , is among the very few german authors , who have had the distinction of being published in the new yorker magazine . the magic of leipzig is that everyone can find his or her niche , whether it is the budding novelist or a world renowned author , according to oliver zille , head of the book fair . given the proximity of this city in saxony to central and eastern europe , the foreign focus is on showcasing up-and-coming authors from that region and launching them in the german-language market .
due to its unique role as the cultural bridge in a wider europe that has expanded eastwards , it has become a book fair tradition to award the " prize for european understanding " to one outstanding author each year .
this year ukrainian writer juri andruchovich , who has chronicled political events that unfolded in his home country before and after the orange revolution , will be honored . audio books are big in leipzig leipzig not only " reads , " but " leipzig listens " as well .
another tradition is to award the " hörkules " prize in the audio segment of the book market , which has experienced tremendous growth in the past several years .
plenty of events will revolve around the medium of audio books or productions .
emerging playwrights for example , can get feedback for their unpublished radio plays performed in front of a live audience . bildunterschrift : taking in culture at leipzig 's renowned gewandhaus leipzig has been dubbed the " city of the black arts " for its centuries-long tradition in the printing and book trade .
after world war ii and the division of germany , frankfurt became the venue for the world 's biggest fair in the publishing industry , whereas leipzig , relegated to decades of communist rule , became primarily a forum for east-west publishers . internationally , leipzig is a city that has long been associated with values such as liberty and freedom of expression , having led the peaceful demonstrations in 1989 that led to the fall of the berlin wall .
it is also famous for its cultural life and the gewandhaus orchestra . at the time of german reunification in 1990 , publishing houses in the former east germany were shut down or integrated into west german ones .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.03.2006 strikers in for the long haul as arbitrators brought in großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesting strikers in stuttgart say they are n't ready to back down , even after six weeks as germany 's public-sector strikes mark week six , arbitration is now being seen as a possible way to bring the sides closer .
in stuttgart , at the heart of the labor action , union members say they 're determined to win . it is about symbolism , many analysts say , this protracted work stoppage by the verdi services union that has closed kindergartens , interrupted hospital services and kept garbage collection trucks idle inside city garages .
while that symbolism may be about union power and unions ' futures , there 's another powerful symbol of germany 's biggest public-service stoppage in 14 years : trash . these days , it 's everywhere in stuttgart , this usually pristine city in southwestern germany , capital of the state of baden-württemberg and one of the principle cities of the historical region of swabia .
the swabians , as the stereotype goes , are not only extraordinarily thrifty ; they can be fanatically clean .
but six weeks into this public-sector strike , clean is hard to come by , at least in the public sphere .
the city is swimming in garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many explosions of trash around stuttgart trashcans have been filled to overflowing , and often , packed to the breaking point , have dumped their contents in a messy circle around them .
stuttgart 's street curbs have become the resting place for a rising tide of daily detritus : mcdonald 's cups , candy wrappers , cigarette packs and old napkins . " i 've had enough of this strike , " said doris laphardt , 46 , as she stepped over a pile of discarded paper in a central square .
" this place is beginning to look like new york . " arbitration but there could be a glimmer of hope in the strike that until just yesterday , showed no signs of coming to an end .
municipal authorities in baden-württemberg and the verdi services union said on tuesday they were bringing in outside arbitrators to try to bring the union and public-sector employers , who up until now have dug in their heels in negotiations , come closer together . the two sides have agreed to bring in two arbitrators , the head of aok health insurance for baden-württemberg , roland sing , and a former president of the state 's administrative court , claus messner .
the two began familiarizing themselves with the material on wednesday morning and talks were planned to begin between representatives from verdi and employers during the afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike hq in stuttgart employers want to extend the working week from 38.5 hour to 40 hour without an increase in pay .
they say they need to ease up pressure on state coffers - personnel costs consume almost one-half of state budgets - and argue that many other civil servants , not to mention the private sector , already work 40-hour weeks .
employers argue that they are asking public-sector employees to only add 18 minutes to each working day . verdi counters that increasing the working week will cut employees ' take home pay , which would further erode already weak consumer spending in germany .
the union also says the change could endanger some 250,000 jobs in the public sector . verdi , along with most of germany 's trade unions , has been struggling with falling membership and an increasing feeling among the populace that it is obstructionist and out of step with the realities of today 's labor environment .
while 18 minutes a day does not seem like much to ask to help prop up struggling state governments , observers say the strike has become a test of verdi 's ability to maintain its strong role in germany 's centralized bargaining system , which is increasingly under attack . " it 's really about symbolism .
the real point is whether they are forced to capitulate on this very symbolic point , " deutsche bank economist stefan schneider told reuters . noisy determination on a cold but clear tuesday morning outside the verdi headquarters in stuttgart , thoughts of capitulation were not in evidence .
at 10:30 a.m. , amid blowing whistles and rattling noisemakers , a group of some 2,500 strikers began a protest march .
carrying banners , waving red verdi flags and chanting slogans , the strikers made their way from the union building through central stuttgart to a large square where speakers encouraged them to stay the fight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching through stuttgart there did not seem to be need for much encouraging .
in fact , the mood was almost festive , now six weeks into the labor action .
instead of slumped shoulders and resigned expressions , the crowd was marked by a strong sense of determination to fight the fight for as long as it takes . " up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the result we want , and we can go on for a while .
we have enough money in the strike fund , " said bärbel illi , 47 , an employee of verdi 's stuttgart branch . heike fischer , 48 , is a child-care worker who said that although the media liked to focus on the trouble some parents have had since their child-care facilities have been closed , most parents were behind the action . " of course , all of us would rather not be on strike anymore , we would like to be with the children , " she said .
" but we ca n't stop now if we want to have a future .
we ca n't give up now , and i 'm ready to continue until we are successful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confrontation between garbage workers replacement workers many of the striking sanitation workers wore signs that said " strikebreakers , hands off our trash ! " referring to the private firms that have been hired to take care of some of the city 's sanitation problems .
those two worlds collided briefly after the main rally when a group of striking workers came across a private garbage truck waiting at a stoplight .
the group stepped in front of the vehicle and , yelling at the three men sitting inside , tried to cover the truck 's windshield with posters to prevent it from driving on .
police had to disperse the group . verdi officials say that besides showing its strength , the strike has mobilized union members , many of whom had begun wondering why they were bothering to pay their monthly dues . " it was important that the unions do something , " said jürgen rönsch , 37 , a cemetery maintenance worker .
" in my department there was hardly anyone left in the union , since it never did anything .
but now people have been coming back . " public support waning while the strike has given verdi a boost in popularity among those in sectors it represents , it is less clear how the strike will play out among the populace at large .
public disgruntlement about the labor action is growing .
in a poll last week carried out for the zdf public television channel , 61 percent of germans opposed the protests , up six percentage points from a poll conducted on feb .
17 . union members in stuttgart claim the local media is overplaying the dissatisfaction felt by stuttgart residents about the strike and the resulting piles of trash .
but on tuesday , most residents asked said they thought it was time for the striking workers to get back on the job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tired of the trash some were split on the issue , like 50-year-old maria schlom , who said she was tired of the trash but trying to remain open : " i can sympathize if the fear is really about losing jobs , " she said .
" but if it 's just about working 40 hours in a week , that i ca n't understand . " others supported the action in the beginning but felt that the union had taken things too far .
" when they 're blocking entrances so trucks ca n't spread grit on icy streets or private firms ca n't take away garbage , that 's too much , " said agathe hiller , 48 . but karl-heinz walther , 62 , who was visiting stuttgart with his wife for the day , said he was fully behind the striking workers .

in stuttgart , at the heart of the labor action , union members say they 're determined to win . it is about symbolism , many analysts say , this protracted work stoppage by the verdi services union that has closed kindergartens , interrupted hospital services and kept garbage collection trucks idle inside city garages .
while that symbolism may be about union power and unions ' futures , there 's another powerful symbol of germany 's biggest public-service stoppage in 14 years : trash . these days , it 's everywhere in stuttgart , this usually pristine city in southwestern germany , capital of the state of baden-württemberg and one of the principle cities of the historical region of swabia .
the swabians , as the stereotype goes , are not only extraordinarily thrifty ; they can be fanatically clean .
but six weeks into this public-sector strike , clean is hard to come by , at least in the public sphere .
the city is swimming in garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many explosions of trash around stuttgart trashcans have been filled to overflowing , and often , packed to the breaking point , have dumped their contents in a messy circle around them .
stuttgart 's street curbs have become the resting place for a rising tide of daily detritus : mcdonald 's cups , candy wrappers , cigarette packs and old napkins . " i 've had enough of this strike , " said doris laphardt , 46 , as she stepped over a pile of discarded paper in a central square .
" this place is beginning to look like new york . " arbitration but there could be a glimmer of hope in the strike that until just yesterday , showed no signs of coming to an end .
municipal authorities in baden-württemberg and the verdi services union said on tuesday they were bringing in outside arbitrators to try to bring the union and public-sector employers , who up until now have dug in their heels in negotiations , come closer together . the two sides have agreed to bring in two arbitrators , the head of aok health insurance for baden-württemberg , roland sing , and a former president of the state 's administrative court , claus messner .
the two began familiarizing themselves with the material on wednesday morning and talks were planned to begin between representatives from verdi and employers during the afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike hq in stuttgart employers want to extend the working week from 38.5 hour to 40 hour without an increase in pay .
they say they need to ease up pressure on state coffers - personnel costs consume almost one-half of state budgets - and argue that many other civil servants , not to mention the private sector , already work 40-hour weeks .
employers argue that they are asking public-sector employees to only add 18 minutes to each working day . verdi counters that increasing the working week will cut employees ' take home pay , which would further erode already weak consumer spending in germany .
the union also says the change could endanger some 250,000 jobs in the public sector . verdi , along with most of germany 's trade unions , has been struggling with falling membership and an increasing feeling among the populace that it is obstructionist and out of step with the realities of today 's labor environment .
while 18 minutes a day does not seem like much to ask to help prop up struggling state governments , observers say the strike has become a test of verdi 's ability to maintain its strong role in germany 's centralized bargaining system , which is increasingly under attack . " it 's really about symbolism .
the real point is whether they are forced to capitulate on this very symbolic point , " deutsche bank economist stefan schneider told reuters . noisy determination on a cold but clear tuesday morning outside the verdi headquarters in stuttgart , thoughts of capitulation were not in evidence .
at 10:30 a.m. , amid blowing whistles and rattling noisemakers , a group of some 2,500 strikers began a protest march .
carrying banners , waving red verdi flags and chanting slogans , the strikers made their way from the union building through central stuttgart to a large square where speakers encouraged them to stay the fight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching through stuttgart there did not seem to be need for much encouraging .
in fact , the mood was almost festive , now six weeks into the labor action .
instead of slumped shoulders and resigned expressions , the crowd was marked by a strong sense of determination to fight the fight for as long as it takes . " up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the result we want , and we can go on for a while .
we have enough money in the strike fund , " said bärbel illi , 47 , an employee of verdi 's stuttgart branch . heike fischer , 48 , is a child-care worker who said that although the media liked to focus on the trouble some parents have had since their child-care facilities have been closed , most parents were behind the action . " of course , all of us would rather not be on strike anymore , we would like to be with the children , " she said .
" but we ca n't stop now if we want to have a future .
we ca n't give up now , and i 'm ready to continue until we are successful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confrontation between garbage workers replacement workers many of the striking sanitation workers wore signs that said " strikebreakers , hands off our trash ! " referring to the private firms that have been hired to take care of some of the city 's sanitation problems .
those two worlds collided briefly after the main rally when a group of striking workers came across a private garbage truck waiting at a stoplight .
the group stepped in front of the vehicle and , yelling at the three men sitting inside , tried to cover the truck 's windshield with posters to prevent it from driving on .
police had to disperse the group . verdi officials say that besides showing its strength , the strike has mobilized union members , many of whom had begun wondering why they were bothering to pay their monthly dues . " it was important that the unions do something , " said jürgen rönsch , 37 , a cemetery maintenance worker .
" in my department there was hardly anyone left in the union , since it never did anything .
but now people have been coming back . " public support waning while the strike has given verdi a boost in popularity among those in sectors it represents , it is less clear how the strike will play out among the populace at large .
public disgruntlement about the labor action is growing .
in a poll last week carried out for the zdf public television channel , 61 percent of germans opposed the protests , up six percentage points from a poll conducted on feb .
17 . union members in stuttgart claim the local media is overplaying the dissatisfaction felt by stuttgart residents about the strike and the resulting piles of trash .
but on tuesday , most residents asked said they thought it was time for the striking workers to get back on the job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tired of the trash some were split on the issue , like 50-year-old maria schlom , who said she was tired of the trash but trying to remain open : " i can sympathize if the fear is really about losing jobs , " she said .
" but if it 's just about working 40 hours in a week , that i ca n't understand . " others supported the action in the beginning but felt that the union had taken things too far .
" when they 're blocking entrances so trucks ca n't spread grit on icy streets or private firms ca n't take away garbage , that 's too much , " said agathe hiller , 48 . but karl-heinz walther , 62 , who was visiting stuttgart with his wife for the day , said he was fully behind the striking workers .
" the employers just have to give a little and it 'd be all over . " when told that his response was a minority one , his wife chimed in : " maybe that 's because we 're not from stuttgart .

" we will increase our commitment and our funding by 500 million euros over the next 10 years , " transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said .
he was speaking at the opening of a second hydrogen refueling station in berlin .
the german capital 's transport authorities have promised to introduce a fleet of 14 hydrogen-powered buses by 2007 in a bid to become the european " capital " for the low-pollution technology . federal funding for the development of hydrogen-powered vehicles is to be expanded to other german regions - such as hamburg , southern germany and parts of north rhine-westphalia - in the next few years .
hydroge n -power hurdles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrogen-fueling stations are still few and far between however , there are several hindrances to the development of hydrogen-powered vehicles , principally the cost of building refueling stations . another hurdle is reducing the cost of obtaining hydrogen itself , which has to be extracted from fossil fuels , such as carbon , or from water . " as a fuel for cars , hydrogen technology has a long way to go , " tiefensee said . clea n er tech n ology could become more affordable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : optimizing technology while making it affordable is the hope experts from german automaker bmw predict that the cost of hydrogen technology could be reduced to levels affordable for individual consumers by 2015 .

thanks to public demand and a positive resonance from publishers in recent years , the four-day leipzig book fair , which will kick off on thursday , has emerged as europe 's largest literary festival for author readings and events . leipzig does not even strive to compete with frankfurt , but over the years , has established its own identity , especially with its popular concept " leipzig reads . "
unlike frankfurt , which is geared towards trade professionals , leipzig generates much of its business from the general public . children are welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comic books are one of the key attractions of the book fair during the day , the fair is held in new , modern facilities outside the city center , where literary fans from all walks of life gather - be it school classes storming the exhibits , parents pushing prams down the aisles , or readers coming into contact with internationally best-selling authors in an informal atmosphere .
a large chunk of the fairgrounds will also be devoted to children 's books and comics . in the evenings , numerous readings are offered throughout the city , in bookshops , cozy cafes or a city hall chamber .
there will be 1,800 events this year alone , and late night partygoers could even bump into vladimir kaminer , the german-russian author of " russian disco , " who doubles up as a disc jockey . emphasis on german literature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author vladimir kaminer will double up as a disc jockey for the fair what distinguishes leipzig from frankfurt , is the strong emphasis on german-language literature and its knack for discovering young talent .
a number of well-known authors , such as ingo schulze , got their publishing start at the fair .
schulze , along with max frisch , and heinrich böll , is among the very few german authors , who have had the distinction of being published in the new yorker magazine . the magic of leipzig is that everyone can find his or her niche , whether it is the budding novelist or a world renowned author , according to oliver zille , head of the book fair . given the proximity of this city in saxony to central and eastern europe , the foreign focus is on showcasing up-and-coming authors from that region and launching them in the german-language market .
due to its unique role as the cultural bridge in a wider europe that has expanded eastwards , it has become a book fair tradition to award the " prize for european understanding " to one outstanding author each year .
this year ukrainian writer juri andruchovich , who has chronicled political events that unfolded in his home country before and after the orange revolution , will be honored . audio books are big in leipzig leipzig not only " reads , " but " leipzig listens " as well .
another tradition is to award the " hörkules " prize in the audio segment of the book market , which has experienced tremendous growth in the past several years .
plenty of events will revolve around the medium of audio books or productions .
emerging playwrights for example , can get feedback for their unpublished radio plays performed in front of a live audience . bildunterschrift : taking in culture at leipzig 's renowned gewandhaus leipzig has been dubbed the " city of the black arts " for its centuries-long tradition in the printing and book trade .
after world war ii and the division of germany , frankfurt became the venue for the world 's biggest fair in the publishing industry , whereas leipzig , relegated to decades of communist rule , became primarily a forum for east-west publishers . internationally , leipzig is a city that has long been associated with values such as liberty and freedom of expression , having led the peaceful demonstrations in 1989 that led to the fall of the berlin wall .
it is also famous for its cultural life and the gewandhaus orchestra . at the time of german reunification in 1990 , publishing houses in the former east germany were shut down or integrated into west german ones .

unlike frankfurt , which is geared towards trade professionals , leipzig generates much of its business from the general public . children are welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comic books are one of the key attractions of the book fair during the day , the fair is held in new , modern facilities outside the city center , where literary fans from all walks of life gather - be it school classes storming the exhibits , parents pushing prams down the aisles , or readers coming into contact with internationally best-selling authors in an informal atmosphere .
a large chunk of the fairgrounds will also be devoted to children 's books and comics . in the evenings , numerous readings are offered throughout the city , in bookshops , cozy cafes or a city hall chamber .
there will be 1,800 events this year alone , and late night partygoers could even bump into vladimir kaminer , the german-russian author of " russian disco , " who doubles up as a disc jockey . emphasis on german literature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author vladimir kaminer will double up as a disc jockey for the fair what distinguishes leipzig from frankfurt , is the strong emphasis on german-language literature and its knack for discovering young talent .
a number of well-known authors , such as ingo schulze , got their publishing start at the fair .
schulze , along with max frisch , and heinrich böll , is among the very few german authors , who have had the distinction of being published in the new yorker magazine . the magic of leipzig is that everyone can find his or her niche , whether it is the budding novelist or a world renowned author , according to oliver zille , head of the book fair . given the proximity of this city in saxony to central and eastern europe , the foreign focus is on showcasing up-and-coming authors from that region and launching them in the german-language market .
due to its unique role as the cultural bridge in a wider europe that has expanded eastwards , it has become a book fair tradition to award the " prize for european understanding " to one outstanding author each year .
this year ukrainian writer juri andruchovich , who has chronicled political events that unfolded in his home country before and after the orange revolution , will be honored . audio books are big in leipzig leipzig not only " reads , " but " leipzig listens " as well .
another tradition is to award the " hörkules " prize in the audio segment of the book market , which has experienced tremendous growth in the past several years .
plenty of events will revolve around the medium of audio books or productions .
emerging playwrights for example , can get feedback for their unpublished radio plays performed in front of a live audience . bildunterschrift : taking in culture at leipzig 's renowned gewandhaus leipzig has been dubbed the " city of the black arts " for its centuries-long tradition in the printing and book trade .
after world war ii and the division of germany , frankfurt became the venue for the world 's biggest fair in the publishing industry , whereas leipzig , relegated to decades of communist rule , became primarily a forum for east-west publishers . internationally , leipzig is a city that has long been associated with values such as liberty and freedom of expression , having led the peaceful demonstrations in 1989 that led to the fall of the berlin wall .
it is also famous for its cultural life and the gewandhaus orchestra . at the time of german reunification in 1990 , publishing houses in the former east germany were shut down or integrated into west german ones .
but already in 1991 , the leipzig book fair came back with a vengeance .

this year ukrainian writer juri andruchovich , who has chronicled political events that unfolded in his home country before and after the orange revolution , will be honored . audio books are big in leipzig leipzig not only " reads , " but " leipzig listens " as well .
another tradition is to award the " hörkules " prize in the audio segment of the book market , which has experienced tremendous growth in the past several years .
plenty of events will revolve around the medium of audio books or productions .
emerging playwrights for example , can get feedback for their unpublished radio plays performed in front of a live audience . bildunterschrift : taking in culture at leipzig 's renowned gewandhaus leipzig has been dubbed the " city of the black arts " for its centuries-long tradition in the printing and book trade .
after world war ii and the division of germany , frankfurt became the venue for the world 's biggest fair in the publishing industry , whereas leipzig , relegated to decades of communist rule , became primarily a forum for east-west publishers . internationally , leipzig is a city that has long been associated with values such as liberty and freedom of expression , having led the peaceful demonstrations in 1989 that led to the fall of the berlin wall .
it is also famous for its cultural life and the gewandhaus orchestra . at the time of german reunification in 1990 , publishing houses in the former east germany were shut down or integrated into west german ones .
but already in 1991 , the leipzig book fair came back with a vengeance .

a new german soap opera has the answer : all hell breaks loose . " turkish for beginners , " a new soap opera which premiered on german public broadcaster ard on tuesday , is a highly entertaining bonanza of cultural stereotypes .
in it , doris schneider , an anti-disciplinarian german therapist and mother of two , falls in love with turkish policeman metin öztürk , a father of two as well .
to the absolute horror of the children from both sides of the cultural divide , doris -lrb- played by anna stieblich -rrb- and metin -lrb- adnan maral -rrb- decide to move in with each other and conduct a risky , cross-cultural family merger . yagmur and cem , metin 's children , are walking and talking cliches of young turks living in germany .
yagmur picks her room in the new apartment with a compass so that she can determine the direction of mecca for her regular prayers .
cem , a quintessential wannabe macho , hangs out with his friends and speaks with a strong turkish accent in order to sound street-smart and cool .
he believes that a woman 's place is next to the stove , but he 's in for a big surprise when he finds out that his new stepmother ca n't cook . new frontiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tough guy with a soft spot for celine dion appearances are , nonetheless , deceptive .
behind her stern , anti-western facade , yagmur secretly watches music videos on tv .
lena , doris ' daughter , is openly opposed to her mother 's intercultural experiment , but deep down she finds her new family to be just whacky enough to have lots of fun with . and cem , despite wanting to be a tough guy , falls in love with an asian girl and writes a love letter under the unlikely poetic influence of celine dion , the exemplary queen of commercial sap . " i orient myself on american tv shows , in which the whole ensemble has a chance to develop , " soap author bora dagtekin said .
" these are the stories in which inner conflicts are not only reserved for the leading character . " " turkish for beginners " is an exceptional show on german television .

" integration is the central goal of the current social policy , " mangold said . but you would n't be able to guess that by watching german television .
according to the nuremberg society for consumer research , german tv channels are not particularly interested in targeting their programs for the turkish audience since turks in germany spend half of their television time watching turkish channels via satellite dishes . " that is probably because they do not feel they are being addressed by german television , " mangold said .

a new german soap opera has the answer : all hell breaks loose . " turkish for beginners , " a new soap opera which premiered on german public broadcaster ard on tuesday , is a highly entertaining bonanza of cultural stereotypes .
in it , doris schneider , an anti-disciplinarian german therapist and mother of two , falls in love with turkish policeman metin öztürk , a father of two as well .
to the absolute horror of the children from both sides of the cultural divide , doris -lrb- played by anna stieblich -rrb- and metin -lrb- adnan maral -rrb- decide to move in with each other and conduct a risky , cross-cultural family merger . yagmur and cem , metin 's children , are walking and talking cliches of young turks living in germany .
yagmur picks her room in the new apartment with a compass so that she can determine the direction of mecca for her regular prayers .
cem , a quintessential wannabe macho , hangs out with his friends and speaks with a strong turkish accent in order to sound street-smart and cool .
he believes that a woman 's place is next to the stove , but he 's in for a big surprise when he finds out that his new stepmother ca n't cook . new frontiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tough guy with a soft spot for celine dion appearances are , nonetheless , deceptive .
behind her stern , anti-western facade , yagmur secretly watches music videos on tv .
lena , doris ' daughter , is openly opposed to her mother 's intercultural experiment , but deep down she finds her new family to be just whacky enough to have lots of fun with . and cem , despite wanting to be a tough guy , falls in love with an asian girl and writes a love letter under the unlikely poetic influence of celine dion , the exemplary queen of commercial sap . " i orient myself on american tv shows , in which the whole ensemble has a chance to develop , " soap author bora dagtekin said .
" these are the stories in which inner conflicts are not only reserved for the leading character . " " turkish for beginners " is an exceptional show on german television .
there is not a touch of political correctness in it , but it freshens up the usually rather stale tv portraits of foreigners in germany . moving beyond the kebab joint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teenage angst with a german-turkish twist is the basis of the new ard soap " i find it highly critical that turks always only work in kebab joints -lrb- on television -rrb- , " said michael mangold , who leads the institute for media and economics at the karlsruhe center for art and media technology . " integration is the central goal of the current social policy , " mangold said . but you would n't be able to guess that by watching german television .
according to the nuremberg society for consumer research , german tv channels are not particularly interested in targeting their programs for the turkish audience since turks in germany spend half of their television time watching turkish channels via satellite dishes . " that is probably because they do not feel they are being addressed by german television , " mangold said . " turkish for beginners , " however , offers a humorous and a long overdue peek into multicultural germany without trying to be too controversial .

below are some voices from verdi members at tuesday 's demonstration . jürgen rönsch , 37 cemetery maintenance worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rönsch " the strike is more justified than ever .
it 's not about these 18 minutes a day , it 's about our jobs .
everything 's being cut little by little , and no one can tell us that the 40-hour week wo n't lead to more cuts .
we want to keep these jobs for the future , for young people and we 're not going to back down .
it 's not easy for me financially , but i accept the losses .
i 'm ready to strike for as long as it takes and i think we have more support than the press says we do . " bärbel illi , 47 verdi union employee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bärbel illi " it 's going well and up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the results we want , and we can go on for a while since we have enough money in the strike fund .
i hope that this is a new beginning for the union , since the strike has brought us a lot of new members .
more people see now what the union is there for , why they need it .
i hope that it 's a revival for us . " heike fischer , 48 child-care worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike fischer " the press always focuses on parents who are against the strike , but where i work , out of 50 parents , there are just two who are against the strike .
but the press never talks about that .
i think it 's a conscious smear against our strike .
the parents stand with us , because they know what kind of quality we bring to the center , and they do n't want that quality to be reduced . " helmut zahner , 53 civil engineer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut zahner " we still think it 's absolutely necessary to strike .
we regret that employers are taking such a hard-line position and that it 's become a political fight in the meantime , especially when you see that the states governed by the christian democrats are being so unrelenting .
i 'm employed by the city in the civil engineering office and for 10 years i 've watched how jobs have been cut .
that 's why we do n't believe the mayor when he says this extension of working hours wo n't lead to job cuts .
there are some sectors where a 35-hour work week is the norm .
others in the private sector have 40 , but employees are compensated financially for that .
i do n't buy the argument that everyone has to work longer these days . " " the longer we strike , the more determined the strikers are .
you could feel it ; there 's a certain rage there and that helps strengthen our determination to keep going .
we 're more determined than ever . " gabriele krische , 44 kindergarten teacher bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriele krische " i am resolute because i do n't want jobs to be cut where i work .
we already have enough unemployed people here and i ca n't be part of a policy that leads to even more people losing their jobs .
i think that 's severe and cruel and that 's why i 'm standing here .
it 's very difficult , but in my profession , a very important aspect is to instill in children a sense of social responsibility .
that means we have to share the work and we ca n't stand by and just watch while others lose their jobs . " heike marwit , 29 child-care worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike marwit " we 're lucky that the parents where i work are understanding of what we 're doing - when i hear what has happened in some other places , where parents have blockaded exits and not let child-care workers leave the facility .
i think if we give up now , the whole thing would n't have made any sense and we should n't have bothered in the first place .
i wish it would have been wrapped up sooner , but what can we do about it ? " lutz bötzer , 45 special education teacher bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutz bötzer " i 've paid union dues for 25 years and never been on a strike .
i 've got to get my money 's worth !
i can only recommend that everybody strike because you see so many people that you hardly ever come across in this big bureaucracy where we work , especially since they 've cut out the company outing , where you 'd see people at least once a year .
now on strike , we 're forced to see each other .

below are some voices from verdi members at tuesday 's demonstration . jürgen rönsch , 37 cemetery maintenance worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rönsch " the strike is more justified than ever .
it 's not about these 18 minutes a day , it 's about our jobs .
everything 's being cut little by little , and no one can tell us that the 40-hour week wo n't lead to more cuts .
we want to keep these jobs for the future , for young people and we 're not going to back down .
it 's not easy for me financially , but i accept the losses .

we 're ready to do this until we reach the results we want , and we can go on for a while since we have enough money in the strike fund .
i hope that this is a new beginning for the union , since the strike has brought us a lot of new members .

but the press never talks about that .
i think it 's a conscious smear against our strike .
the parents stand with us , because they know what kind of quality we bring to the center , and they do n't want that quality to be reduced . " helmut zahner , 53 civil engineer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut zahner " we still think it 's absolutely necessary to strike .
we regret that employers are taking such a hard-line position and that it 's become a political fight in the meantime , especially when you see that the states governed by the christian democrats are being so unrelenting .
i 'm employed by the city in the civil engineering office and for 10 years i 've watched how jobs have been cut .
that 's why we do n't believe the mayor when he says this extension of working hours wo n't lead to job cuts .
there are some sectors where a 35-hour work week is the norm .
others in the private sector have 40 , but employees are compensated financially for that .
i do n't buy the argument that everyone has to work longer these days . " " the longer we strike , the more determined the strikers are .
you could feel it ; there 's a certain rage there and that helps strengthen our determination to keep going .

below are some voices from verdi members at tuesday 's demonstration . jürgen rönsch , 37 cemetery maintenance worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rönsch " the strike is more justified than ever .
it 's not about these 18 minutes a day , it 's about our jobs .
everything 's being cut little by little , and no one can tell us that the 40-hour week wo n't lead to more cuts .
we want to keep these jobs for the future , for young people and we 're not going to back down .
it 's not easy for me financially , but i accept the losses .
i 'm ready to strike for as long as it takes and i think we have more support than the press says we do . " bärbel illi , 47 verdi union employee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bärbel illi " it 's going well and up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the results we want , and we can go on for a while since we have enough money in the strike fund .
i hope that this is a new beginning for the union , since the strike has brought us a lot of new members .
more people see now what the union is there for , why they need it .
i hope that it 's a revival for us . " heike fischer , 48 child-care worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike fischer " the press always focuses on parents who are against the strike , but where i work , out of 50 parents , there are just two who are against the strike .
but the press never talks about that .
i think it 's a conscious smear against our strike .
the parents stand with us , because they know what kind of quality we bring to the center , and they do n't want that quality to be reduced . " helmut zahner , 53 civil engineer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut zahner " we still think it 's absolutely necessary to strike .
we regret that employers are taking such a hard-line position and that it 's become a political fight in the meantime , especially when you see that the states governed by the christian democrats are being so unrelenting .
i 'm employed by the city in the civil engineering office and for 10 years i 've watched how jobs have been cut .
that 's why we do n't believe the mayor when he says this extension of working hours wo n't lead to job cuts .
there are some sectors where a 35-hour work week is the norm .
others in the private sector have 40 , but employees are compensated financially for that .
i do n't buy the argument that everyone has to work longer these days . " " the longer we strike , the more determined the strikers are .
you could feel it ; there 's a certain rage there and that helps strengthen our determination to keep going .
we 're more determined than ever . " gabriele krische , 44 kindergarten teacher bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriele krische " i am resolute because i do n't want jobs to be cut where i work .
we already have enough unemployed people here and i ca n't be part of a policy that leads to even more people losing their jobs .
i think that 's severe and cruel and that 's why i 'm standing here .
it 's very difficult , but in my profession , a very important aspect is to instill in children a sense of social responsibility .
that means we have to share the work and we ca n't stand by and just watch while others lose their jobs . " heike marwit , 29 child-care worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike marwit " we 're lucky that the parents where i work are understanding of what we 're doing - when i hear what has happened in some other places , where parents have blockaded exits and not let child-care workers leave the facility .
i think if we give up now , the whole thing would n't have made any sense and we should n't have bothered in the first place .
i wish it would have been wrapped up sooner , but what can we do about it ? " lutz bötzer , 45 special education teacher bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutz bötzer " i 've paid union dues for 25 years and never been on a strike .
i 've got to get my money 's worth !
i can only recommend that everybody strike because you see so many people that you hardly ever come across in this big bureaucracy where we work , especially since they 've cut out the company outing , where you 'd see people at least once a year .
now on strike , we 're forced to see each other .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.03.2006 strikers in for the long haul as arbitrators brought in großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesting strikers in stuttgart say they are n't ready to back down , even after six weeks as germany 's public-sector strikes mark week six , arbitration is now being seen as a possible way to bring the sides closer .
in stuttgart , at the heart of the labor action , union members say they 're determined to win . it is about symbolism , many analysts say , this protracted work stoppage by the verdi services union that has closed kindergartens , interrupted hospital services and kept garbage collection trucks idle inside city garages .
while that symbolism may be about union power and unions ' futures , there 's another powerful symbol of germany 's biggest public-service stoppage in 14 years : trash . these days , it 's everywhere in stuttgart , this usually pristine city in southwestern germany , capital of the state of baden-württemberg and one of the principle cities of the historical region of swabia .
the swabians , as the stereotype goes , are not only extraordinarily thrifty ; they can be fanatically clean .
but six weeks into this public-sector strike , clean is hard to come by , at least in the public sphere .
the city is swimming in garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many explosions of trash around stuttgart trashcans have been filled to overflowing , and often , packed to the breaking point , have dumped their contents in a messy circle around them .
stuttgart 's street curbs have become the resting place for a rising tide of daily detritus : mcdonald 's cups , candy wrappers , cigarette packs and old napkins . " i 've had enough of this strike , " said doris laphardt , 46 , as she stepped over a pile of discarded paper in a central square .
" this place is beginning to look like new york . " arbitration but there could be a glimmer of hope in the strike that until just yesterday , showed no signs of coming to an end .
municipal authorities in baden-württemberg and the verdi services union said on tuesday they were bringing in outside arbitrators to try to bring the union and public-sector employers , who up until now have dug in their heels in negotiations , come closer together . the two sides have agreed to bring in two arbitrators , the head of aok health insurance for baden-württemberg , roland sing , and a former president of the state 's administrative court , claus messner .
the two began familiarizing themselves with the material on wednesday morning and talks were planned to begin between representatives from verdi and employers during the afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike hq in stuttgart employers want to extend the working week from 38.5 hour to 40 hour without an increase in pay .
they say they need to ease up pressure on state coffers - personnel costs consume almost one-half of state budgets - and argue that many other civil servants , not to mention the private sector , already work 40-hour weeks .
employers argue that they are asking public-sector employees to only add 18 minutes to each working day . verdi counters that increasing the working week will cut employees ' take home pay , which would further erode already weak consumer spending in germany .
the union also says the change could endanger some 250,000 jobs in the public sector . verdi , along with most of germany 's trade unions , has been struggling with falling membership and an increasing feeling among the populace that it is obstructionist and out of step with the realities of today 's labor environment .
while 18 minutes a day does not seem like much to ask to help prop up struggling state governments , observers say the strike has become a test of verdi 's ability to maintain its strong role in germany 's centralized bargaining system , which is increasingly under attack . " it 's really about symbolism .
the real point is whether they are forced to capitulate on this very symbolic point , " deutsche bank economist stefan schneider told reuters . noisy determination on a cold but clear tuesday morning outside the verdi headquarters in stuttgart , thoughts of capitulation were not in evidence .
at 10:30 a.m. , amid blowing whistles and rattling noisemakers , a group of some 2,500 strikers began a protest march .
carrying banners , waving red verdi flags and chanting slogans , the strikers made their way from the union building through central stuttgart to a large square where speakers encouraged them to stay the fight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching through stuttgart there did not seem to be need for much encouraging .
in fact , the mood was almost festive , now six weeks into the labor action .
instead of slumped shoulders and resigned expressions , the crowd was marked by a strong sense of determination to fight the fight for as long as it takes . " up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the result we want , and we can go on for a while .
we have enough money in the strike fund , " said bärbel illi , 47 , an employee of verdi 's stuttgart branch . heike fischer , 48 , is a child-care worker who said that although the media liked to focus on the trouble some parents have had since their child-care facilities have been closed , most parents were behind the action . " of course , all of us would rather not be on strike anymore , we would like to be with the children , " she said .
" but we ca n't stop now if we want to have a future .
we ca n't give up now , and i 'm ready to continue until we are successful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confrontation between garbage workers replacement workers many of the striking sanitation workers wore signs that said " strikebreakers , hands off our trash ! " referring to the private firms that have been hired to take care of some of the city 's sanitation problems .
those two worlds collided briefly after the main rally when a group of striking workers came across a private garbage truck waiting at a stoplight .
the group stepped in front of the vehicle and , yelling at the three men sitting inside , tried to cover the truck 's windshield with posters to prevent it from driving on .
police had to disperse the group . verdi officials say that besides showing its strength , the strike has mobilized union members , many of whom had begun wondering why they were bothering to pay their monthly dues . " it was important that the unions do something , " said jürgen rönsch , 37 , a cemetery maintenance worker .
" in my department there was hardly anyone left in the union , since it never did anything .
but now people have been coming back . " public support waning while the strike has given verdi a boost in popularity among those in sectors it represents , it is less clear how the strike will play out among the populace at large .
public disgruntlement about the labor action is growing .
in a poll last week carried out for the zdf public television channel , 61 percent of germans opposed the protests , up six percentage points from a poll conducted on feb .
17 . union members in stuttgart claim the local media is overplaying the dissatisfaction felt by stuttgart residents about the strike and the resulting piles of trash .
but on tuesday , most residents asked said they thought it was time for the striking workers to get back on the job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tired of the trash some were split on the issue , like 50-year-old maria schlom , who said she was tired of the trash but trying to remain open : " i can sympathize if the fear is really about losing jobs , " she said .
" but if it 's just about working 40 hours in a week , that i ca n't understand . " others supported the action in the beginning but felt that the union had taken things too far .
" when they 're blocking entrances so trucks ca n't spread grit on icy streets or private firms ca n't take away garbage , that 's too much , " said agathe hiller , 48 . but karl-heinz walther , 62 , who was visiting stuttgart with his wife for the day , said he was fully behind the striking workers .
" the employers just have to give a little and it 'd be all over . " when told that his response was a minority one , his wife chimed in : " maybe that 's because we 're not from stuttgart .

" people without children should either receive a reduced pension or pay more into pension schemes , " said norbert geis from the csu . johann eekhoff , director of the cologne institute for economic policy said a reform of the pension system was long overdue . " people without children should never have been admitted into pension schemes because these only work when they are financed by subsequent generations , " he said in an interview with mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" their pensions should be cut by 50 percent . " cdu politician elisabeth winkelmeier-becker agreed , pointing out that working parents are financially disadvantaged compared to their childless peers .
" in the long-term , we need to consider awarding people without children lower pensions , " she said . chilling statistics the headline in germany 's mass-selling daily bild on wednesday said it all : " baby shock : we germans are dying out , " the paper screamed . that might sound a bit extreme , but latest figures , based on data collected at the federal statistics office , released on tuesday have sent a chill among demographers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more babies were born in post-war year of 1946 than today last year , only some 676,000 children were born in germany according to german daily die welt which cited forecasts by the federal statistics office .
that pushed the birth rate to its worst low in 15 years : in 2004 , the number of newborns amounted to 706,000 .
that 's all still significantly less than the 922,000 births in the post-war year of 1946 .

countries such as france and britain boasted birthrates - at 12.7 and 12.0 respectively in the same year - that exceeded german levels by more than 50 percent . for years , politicians and demographers in germany have warned of the dangers of a falling birth rate and ageing population .
in recent months in particular , the subject has raced to the top of the political agenda and been the focus of heated debates over family-friendly and childcare policies . the damning pisa study on germany 's faltering education standards has also stepped up the urgency surrounding the issue .
in january this year , the ruling grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats decided to make it easier for working mothers to continue being part of the labor market , increasing tax breaks on child care , encourage setting up full-day schools and making kindergartens cost-free . chancellor merkel 's family affairs minister , ursula von der leyen , a mother of seven children herself , has also been credited with pushing for family-friendly policies and ensuring that the issue remains in the political spotlight . much more to be done but , it 's obvious that more needs to be done . on wednesday , johannes singhammer , family affairs spokesman for the conservative union of the christian democrats and christian social democrats demanded that demographic policies had to be given a high priority . efforts to fight the " free fall of births " had to take a place at the center of politics alongside the battle against unemployment and reining in the ballooning deficit , singhammer added . dw staff -lrb- sp / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : learning to think outside the box once dismissed as " nonsense " by former chancellor schröder , family policies have now climbed to the top of germany 's political agenda .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.03.2006 strikers in for the long haul as arbitrators brought in großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesting strikers in stuttgart say they are n't ready to back down , even after six weeks as germany 's public-sector strikes mark week six , arbitration is now being seen as a possible way to bring the sides closer .
in stuttgart , at the heart of the labor action , union members say they 're determined to win . it is about symbolism , many analysts say , this protracted work stoppage by the verdi services union that has closed kindergartens , interrupted hospital services and kept garbage collection trucks idle inside city garages .
while that symbolism may be about union power and unions ' futures , there 's another powerful symbol of germany 's biggest public-service stoppage in 14 years : trash . these days , it 's everywhere in stuttgart , this usually pristine city in southwestern germany , capital of the state of baden-württemberg and one of the principle cities of the historical region of swabia .
the swabians , as the stereotype goes , are not only extraordinarily thrifty ; they can be fanatically clean .
but six weeks into this public-sector strike , clean is hard to come by , at least in the public sphere .
the city is swimming in garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many explosions of trash around stuttgart trashcans have been filled to overflowing , and often , packed to the breaking point , have dumped their contents in a messy circle around them .
stuttgart 's street curbs have become the resting place for a rising tide of daily detritus : mcdonald 's cups , candy wrappers , cigarette packs and old napkins . " i 've had enough of this strike , " said doris laphardt , 46 , as she stepped over a pile of discarded paper in a central square .
" this place is beginning to look like new york . " arbitration but there could be a glimmer of hope in the strike that until just yesterday , showed no signs of coming to an end .
municipal authorities in baden-württemberg and the verdi services union said on tuesday they were bringing in outside arbitrators to try to bring the union and public-sector employers , who up until now have dug in their heels in negotiations , come closer together . the two sides have agreed to bring in two arbitrators , the head of aok health insurance for baden-württemberg , roland sing , and a former president of the state 's administrative court , claus messner .
the two began familiarizing themselves with the material on wednesday morning and talks were planned to begin between representatives from verdi and employers during the afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike hq in stuttgart employers want to extend the working week from 38.5 hour to 40 hour without an increase in pay .
they say they need to ease up pressure on state coffers - personnel costs consume almost one-half of state budgets - and argue that many other civil servants , not to mention the private sector , already work 40-hour weeks .
employers argue that they are asking public-sector employees to only add 18 minutes to each working day . verdi counters that increasing the working week will cut employees ' take home pay , which would further erode already weak consumer spending in germany .
the union also says the change could endanger some 250,000 jobs in the public sector . verdi , along with most of germany 's trade unions , has been struggling with falling membership and an increasing feeling among the populace that it is obstructionist and out of step with the realities of today 's labor environment .
while 18 minutes a day does not seem like much to ask to help prop up struggling state governments , observers say the strike has become a test of verdi 's ability to maintain its strong role in germany 's centralized bargaining system , which is increasingly under attack . " it 's really about symbolism .
the real point is whether they are forced to capitulate on this very symbolic point , " deutsche bank economist stefan schneider told reuters . noisy determination on a cold but clear tuesday morning outside the verdi headquarters in stuttgart , thoughts of capitulation were not in evidence .
at 10:30 a.m. , amid blowing whistles and rattling noisemakers , a group of some 2,500 strikers began a protest march .
carrying banners , waving red verdi flags and chanting slogans , the strikers made their way from the union building through central stuttgart to a large square where speakers encouraged them to stay the fight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching through stuttgart there did not seem to be need for much encouraging .
in fact , the mood was almost festive , now six weeks into the labor action .
instead of slumped shoulders and resigned expressions , the crowd was marked by a strong sense of determination to fight the fight for as long as it takes . " up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .

in stuttgart , at the heart of the labor action , union members say they 're determined to win . it is about symbolism , many analysts say , this protracted work stoppage by the verdi services union that has closed kindergartens , interrupted hospital services and kept garbage collection trucks idle inside city garages .
while that symbolism may be about union power and unions ' futures , there 's another powerful symbol of germany 's biggest public-service stoppage in 14 years : trash . these days , it 's everywhere in stuttgart , this usually pristine city in southwestern germany , capital of the state of baden-württemberg and one of the principle cities of the historical region of swabia .
the swabians , as the stereotype goes , are not only extraordinarily thrifty ; they can be fanatically clean .
but six weeks into this public-sector strike , clean is hard to come by , at least in the public sphere .
the city is swimming in garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many explosions of trash around stuttgart trashcans have been filled to overflowing , and often , packed to the breaking point , have dumped their contents in a messy circle around them .
stuttgart 's street curbs have become the resting place for a rising tide of daily detritus : mcdonald 's cups , candy wrappers , cigarette packs and old napkins . " i 've had enough of this strike , " said doris laphardt , 46 , as she stepped over a pile of discarded paper in a central square .
" this place is beginning to look like new york . " arbitration but there could be a glimmer of hope in the strike that until just yesterday , showed no signs of coming to an end .
municipal authorities in baden-württemberg and the verdi services union said on tuesday they were bringing in outside arbitrators to try to bring the union and public-sector employers , who up until now have dug in their heels in negotiations , come closer together . the two sides have agreed to bring in two arbitrators , the head of aok health insurance for baden-württemberg , roland sing , and a former president of the state 's administrative court , claus messner .
the two began familiarizing themselves with the material on wednesday morning and talks were planned to begin between representatives from verdi and employers during the afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike hq in stuttgart employers want to extend the working week from 38.5 hour to 40 hour without an increase in pay .
they say they need to ease up pressure on state coffers - personnel costs consume almost one-half of state budgets - and argue that many other civil servants , not to mention the private sector , already work 40-hour weeks .
employers argue that they are asking public-sector employees to only add 18 minutes to each working day . verdi counters that increasing the working week will cut employees ' take home pay , which would further erode already weak consumer spending in germany .
the union also says the change could endanger some 250,000 jobs in the public sector . verdi , along with most of germany 's trade unions , has been struggling with falling membership and an increasing feeling among the populace that it is obstructionist and out of step with the realities of today 's labor environment .
while 18 minutes a day does not seem like much to ask to help prop up struggling state governments , observers say the strike has become a test of verdi 's ability to maintain its strong role in germany 's centralized bargaining system , which is increasingly under attack . " it 's really about symbolism .
the real point is whether they are forced to capitulate on this very symbolic point , " deutsche bank economist stefan schneider told reuters . noisy determination on a cold but clear tuesday morning outside the verdi headquarters in stuttgart , thoughts of capitulation were not in evidence .
at 10:30 a.m. , amid blowing whistles and rattling noisemakers , a group of some 2,500 strikers began a protest march .
carrying banners , waving red verdi flags and chanting slogans , the strikers made their way from the union building through central stuttgart to a large square where speakers encouraged them to stay the fight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching through stuttgart there did not seem to be need for much encouraging .
in fact , the mood was almost festive , now six weeks into the labor action .
instead of slumped shoulders and resigned expressions , the crowd was marked by a strong sense of determination to fight the fight for as long as it takes . " up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the result we want , and we can go on for a while .

in stuttgart , at the heart of the labor action , union members say they 're determined to win . it is about symbolism , many analysts say , this protracted work stoppage by the verdi services union that has closed kindergartens , interrupted hospital services and kept garbage collection trucks idle inside city garages .
while that symbolism may be about union power and unions ' futures , there 's another powerful symbol of germany 's biggest public-service stoppage in 14 years : trash . these days , it 's everywhere in stuttgart , this usually pristine city in southwestern germany , capital of the state of baden-württemberg and one of the principle cities of the historical region of swabia .
the swabians , as the stereotype goes , are not only extraordinarily thrifty ; they can be fanatically clean .
but six weeks into this public-sector strike , clean is hard to come by , at least in the public sphere .
the city is swimming in garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many explosions of trash around stuttgart trashcans have been filled to overflowing , and often , packed to the breaking point , have dumped their contents in a messy circle around them .
stuttgart 's street curbs have become the resting place for a rising tide of daily detritus : mcdonald 's cups , candy wrappers , cigarette packs and old napkins . " i 've had enough of this strike , " said doris laphardt , 46 , as she stepped over a pile of discarded paper in a central square .
" this place is beginning to look like new york . " arbitration but there could be a glimmer of hope in the strike that until just yesterday , showed no signs of coming to an end .
municipal authorities in baden-württemberg and the verdi services union said on tuesday they were bringing in outside arbitrators to try to bring the union and public-sector employers , who up until now have dug in their heels in negotiations , come closer together . the two sides have agreed to bring in two arbitrators , the head of aok health insurance for baden-württemberg , roland sing , and a former president of the state 's administrative court , claus messner .
the two began familiarizing themselves with the material on wednesday morning and talks were planned to begin between representatives from verdi and employers during the afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike hq in stuttgart employers want to extend the working week from 38.5 hour to 40 hour without an increase in pay .
they say they need to ease up pressure on state coffers - personnel costs consume almost one-half of state budgets - and argue that many other civil servants , not to mention the private sector , already work 40-hour weeks .
employers argue that they are asking public-sector employees to only add 18 minutes to each working day . verdi counters that increasing the working week will cut employees ' take home pay , which would further erode already weak consumer spending in germany .
the union also says the change could endanger some 250,000 jobs in the public sector . verdi , along with most of germany 's trade unions , has been struggling with falling membership and an increasing feeling among the populace that it is obstructionist and out of step with the realities of today 's labor environment .
while 18 minutes a day does not seem like much to ask to help prop up struggling state governments , observers say the strike has become a test of verdi 's ability to maintain its strong role in germany 's centralized bargaining system , which is increasingly under attack . " it 's really about symbolism .
the real point is whether they are forced to capitulate on this very symbolic point , " deutsche bank economist stefan schneider told reuters . noisy determination on a cold but clear tuesday morning outside the verdi headquarters in stuttgart , thoughts of capitulation were not in evidence .
at 10:30 a.m. , amid blowing whistles and rattling noisemakers , a group of some 2,500 strikers began a protest march .
carrying banners , waving red verdi flags and chanting slogans , the strikers made their way from the union building through central stuttgart to a large square where speakers encouraged them to stay the fight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching through stuttgart there did not seem to be need for much encouraging .
in fact , the mood was almost festive , now six weeks into the labor action .
instead of slumped shoulders and resigned expressions , the crowd was marked by a strong sense of determination to fight the fight for as long as it takes . " up to now , there has n't been any strike fatigue .
we 're ready to do this until we reach the result we want , and we can go on for a while .
we have enough money in the strike fund , " said bärbel illi , 47 , an employee of verdi 's stuttgart branch . heike fischer , 48 , is a child-care worker who said that although the media liked to focus on the trouble some parents have had since their child-care facilities have been closed , most parents were behind the action . " of course , all of us would rather not be on strike anymore , we would like to be with the children , " she said .
" but we ca n't stop now if we want to have a future .
we ca n't give up now , and i 'm ready to continue until we are successful . "

but according to political economist friedrich schneider , that 's partly due to hypocritical western governments , who do n't want to be team players . an international conference on combating the financing of terrorism is being held in the hague on wednesday and thursday .
dw-world.de spoke with political economist friedrich schneider from johannes kepler university in linz , austria , about the chances of successfully cutting off terrorists ' money supplies and the obstacles preventing faster progress . dw-world.de : professor schneider , seven years ago , the g7 countries initiated the international financial action task force , or fatf .
it is meant to fight terrorist financing , but so far , the force has n't had any significant success .
why are these international efforts failing ? friedrich schneider : on an international level , next to nothing is being done .
it 's that simple .
every country is doing its own work , there 's no international cooperation that 's working .
data is n't even being exchanged in the aftermath of a terrorist attack , let alone cooperation among various secret services . why is n't there more cooperation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban leader mullah omar : the us funded the taliban in the past i 'll give you an example .
if the french finance covert operations in africa through their secret service , or if the germans pay ransom in iraq , do you think these governments want to publicly acknowledge this kind of financing ?
and good and evil can quickly change , as we know .
just take the taliban in afghanistan , for example .
for a long time , they were financed by the united states when the us was against russia .
this is where hypocrisy comes in .
if governments do n't want to expose their own covert financing operations , then they ca n't have any real interest in more efficient uncovering of money laundering . to what extent is money laundering linked to the financing of terrorism ?
money laundering is mostly associated with the drugs trade and human trafficking . terrorist financing is , broadly speaking , the financing of terrorist operations , and not all that much money is needed .
the september 2001 attacks cost just $ 500,000 , including flight training .
much more money is needed for the maintenance of terrorist bases .
to pull together this kind of funding , money from the drugs trade , illegal diamond trading or kidnapping is laundered . so is it mainly through the tracking of money laundering that sources of terrorist financing can be found ?
with money from legal operations … … you ca n't prevent the financing of terrorism .
there are donations to terrorist organizations - hamas for example .
it gets a lot of money from arab states for hospitals and schools , but where there 's no clear dividing line to show whether the money was used for terrorist acts . what can really be done to stop terrorist financing then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug money often ends up financing terrorist cells the first question is , whether there is any desire to effectively fight money laundering .
only then can you really combat terrorist financing .
to fight money laundering , you need international cooperation , and a task force that is just as agile and flexible as the terrorists .
this would also require the regulations prohibiting data exchange to be loosened , but so far that has n't happened . what can financial service providers do to stop terrorist financing ? that depends firstly on the extent to which they want to do business with people from the mafia or other organized criminals .
investigators rely on insider information from banks which often have little knowledge about how clean certain transactions are . as a political economist , you 've called for combating poverty and promoting democratic values as a way to stop terrorism .
why ? simply put , people who earn money do n't throw bombs .
if i have a house , a car , and a well-paid job , i 'm less likely to become a terrorist .
there will always be fanatics who resort to terrorism regardless of their income , but they 'll be far fewer .
it 's about drying up part of the basis for terrorism , which is why fighting poverty is such an effective strategy .
in addition to this , we have to fight religious extremism , and deal with religious differences in a peaceful manner , but there have only been half-hearted attempts at that so far . that does n't sound very optimistic .
how do you think the financing of terrorism will develop in the future ? unfortunately , i think europe will have to experience two or three more attacks before we start to work more closely together . martin schrader interviewed friedrich schneider send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops the agenda in warsaw as the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member council of europe enters its last day in warsaw , talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime .

but according to political economist friedrich schneider , that 's partly due to hypocritical western governments , who do n't want to be team players . an international conference on combating the financing of terrorism is being held in the hague on wednesday and thursday .
dw-world.de spoke with political economist friedrich schneider from johannes kepler university in linz , austria , about the chances of successfully cutting off terrorists ' money supplies and the obstacles preventing faster progress . dw-world.de : professor schneider , seven years ago , the g7 countries initiated the international financial action task force , or fatf .
it is meant to fight terrorist financing , but so far , the force has n't had any significant success .
why are these international efforts failing ? friedrich schneider : on an international level , next to nothing is being done .
it 's that simple .
every country is doing its own work , there 's no international cooperation that 's working .
data is n't even being exchanged in the aftermath of a terrorist attack , let alone cooperation among various secret services . why is n't there more cooperation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban leader mullah omar : the us funded the taliban in the past i 'll give you an example .
if the french finance covert operations in africa through their secret service , or if the germans pay ransom in iraq , do you think these governments want to publicly acknowledge this kind of financing ?
and good and evil can quickly change , as we know .
just take the taliban in afghanistan , for example .
for a long time , they were financed by the united states when the us was against russia .
this is where hypocrisy comes in .
if governments do n't want to expose their own covert financing operations , then they ca n't have any real interest in more efficient uncovering of money laundering . to what extent is money laundering linked to the financing of terrorism ?
money laundering is mostly associated with the drugs trade and human trafficking . terrorist financing is , broadly speaking , the financing of terrorist operations , and not all that much money is needed .
the september 2001 attacks cost just $ 500,000 , including flight training .
much more money is needed for the maintenance of terrorist bases .
to pull together this kind of funding , money from the drugs trade , illegal diamond trading or kidnapping is laundered . so is it mainly through the tracking of money laundering that sources of terrorist financing can be found ?
with money from legal operations … … you ca n't prevent the financing of terrorism .
there are donations to terrorist organizations - hamas for example .
it gets a lot of money from arab states for hospitals and schools , but where there 's no clear dividing line to show whether the money was used for terrorist acts . what can really be done to stop terrorist financing then ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug money often ends up financing terrorist cells the first question is , whether there is any desire to effectively fight money laundering .
only then can you really combat terrorist financing .
to fight money laundering , you need international cooperation , and a task force that is just as agile and flexible as the terrorists .
this would also require the regulations prohibiting data exchange to be loosened , but so far that has n't happened . what can financial service providers do to stop terrorist financing ? that depends firstly on the extent to which they want to do business with people from the mafia or other organized criminals .
investigators rely on insider information from banks which often have little knowledge about how clean certain transactions are . as a political economist , you 've called for combating poverty and promoting democratic values as a way to stop terrorism .
why ? simply put , people who earn money do n't throw bombs .
if i have a house , a car , and a well-paid job , i 'm less likely to become a terrorist .
there will always be fanatics who resort to terrorism regardless of their income , but they 'll be far fewer .
it 's about drying up part of the basis for terrorism , which is why fighting poverty is such an effective strategy .
in addition to this , we have to fight religious extremism , and deal with religious differences in a peaceful manner , but there have only been half-hearted attempts at that so far . that does n't sound very optimistic .
how do you think the financing of terrorism will develop in the future ? unfortunately , i think europe will have to experience two or three more attacks before we start to work more closely together . martin schrader interviewed friedrich schneider send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops the agenda in warsaw as the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member council of europe enters its last day in warsaw , talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime .

the company would first wait and see whether a rival offer materialized from a third party , merck 's supervisory board chief wilhelm simson told a news conference in berlin . but merck was not prepared to pay so high a price that a purchase could only be financed by selling off bits of schering , simson added . the price of 77 euros per share was " fair " , he continued .
and simson said he hoped to meet with schering 's chairman hubertus erlen later on tuesday . " our main aim is to enter into negotiations with schering , " he said .
" we need both sides to come to the table . " berli n mayor frets over implicatio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin mayor wowereit is worried about the takeover plans in the meantime , berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit said he was " concerned " about merck 's plans to buy schering , which is one of the biggest employers in the german capital . after meeting with merck chairman roemer , wowereit , a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said he was worried about the fate of schering 's 6,000 employees in berlin . schering is the only dax-listed company that has its headquarters in berlin and is one of the biggest employers in the german capital after rail operator deutsche bahn . berlin is home to very little industry and suffers from very high unemployment . suggestions last year that rail operator deutsche bahn could relocate some of its administrative activities to hamburg sparked political uproar , eventually persuading the company to back down and remain in berlin . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merck wants to swallow schering in hostile takeover the german pharmaceutical group merck announced a 77-euro-per-share all-cash takeover offer for schering ag on monday , valuing the berlin-based pharmaceutical manufacturer at about 14.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.7 billion -rrb- .

dw-world : work-life balance gets boost in germany dw-world : the dumbing down of germany dw-world : gerd 's family policy gets down to business dw-world : encouraging germans to have more kids germany -pipe- 15.03.2006 politicians discuss pension cuts for childless germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's younger generation is dwindling new statistics confirming the declining birth rate have sent germany in to a state of panic , amid a growing consensus that pensions should be increased for people with children and reduced for those without . " people without children should either receive a reduced pension or pay more into pension schemes , " said norbert geis from the csu . johann eekhoff , director of the cologne institute for economic policy said a reform of the pension system was long overdue . " people without children should never have been admitted into pension schemes because these only work when they are financed by subsequent generations , " he said in an interview with mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" their pensions should be cut by 50 percent . " cdu politician elisabeth winkelmeier-becker agreed , pointing out that working parents are financially disadvantaged compared to their childless peers .
" in the long-term , we need to consider awarding people without children lower pensions , " she said . chilling statistics the headline in germany 's mass-selling daily bild on wednesday said it all : " baby shock : we germans are dying out , " the paper screamed . that might sound a bit extreme , but latest figures , based on data collected at the federal statistics office , released on tuesday have sent a chill among demographers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more babies were born in post-war year of 1946 than today last year , only some 676,000 children were born in germany according to german daily die welt which cited forecasts by the federal statistics office .
that pushed the birth rate to its worst low in 15 years : in 2004 , the number of newborns amounted to 706,000 .
that 's all still significantly less than the 922,000 births in the post-war year of 1946 . " that 's dramatic , we 're running into a dead end , " michael hüther , director of the cologne-based institute for the german economy told the paper . wiesbaden on top the demographic figures have also shown huge variations in germany 's 50 largest cities . the eastern german city of magdeburg , the capital of saxony-anhalt , took the dubious honor of having the lowest birth rate in the country : only some 6.9 children per 1000 inhabitants are born in the city on a yearly average . as against that , the significantly richer city of wiesbaden near frankfurt , has the highest birth rate with 10.5 births per 1000 inhabitants .
the western german cities of frankfurt and bonn followed closely , while the capital berlin also features on spot 30 with a birthrate of 8.7 . issue being taken seriously though the latest statistics have come as a shock , the issue is hardly new in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is apparently doing things better when it comes to boosting its birth rate according to eurostat , the eu statistics office , there were 8.5 births per 1000 inhabitants in germany in 2004 - making it the country with the lowest birth rate in the entire european union .
countries such as france and britain boasted birthrates - at 12.7 and 12.0 respectively in the same year - that exceeded german levels by more than 50 percent . for years , politicians and demographers in germany have warned of the dangers of a falling birth rate and ageing population .
in recent months in particular , the subject has raced to the top of the political agenda and been the focus of heated debates over family-friendly and childcare policies . the damning pisa study on germany 's faltering education standards has also stepped up the urgency surrounding the issue .
in january this year , the ruling grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats decided to make it easier for working mothers to continue being part of the labor market , increasing tax breaks on child care , encourage setting up full-day schools and making kindergartens cost-free . chancellor merkel 's family affairs minister , ursula von der leyen , a mother of seven children herself , has also been credited with pushing for family-friendly policies and ensuring that the issue remains in the political spotlight . much more to be done but , it 's obvious that more needs to be done . on wednesday , johannes singhammer , family affairs spokesman for the conservative union of the christian democrats and christian social democrats demanded that demographic policies had to be given a high priority . efforts to fight the " free fall of births " had to take a place at the center of politics alongside the battle against unemployment and reining in the ballooning deficit , singhammer added . dw staff -lrb- sp / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : opinion : learning to think outside the box once dismissed as " nonsense " by former chancellor schröder , family policies have now climbed to the top of germany 's political agenda .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.03.2006 a spring festival for books großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-day fair kicks off on thursday the key to the success of the leipzig book fair is that there is something for everyone , from works by budding novelists to world renowned authors , comic books and audio books and much more ... each year , there are two book fairs in germany : in the autumn , the massive international trade fair in frankfurt , and in the spring , the more intimate leipzig book fair that brings together authors and readers .
thanks to public demand and a positive resonance from publishers in recent years , the four-day leipzig book fair , which will kick off on thursday , has emerged as europe 's largest literary festival for author readings and events . leipzig does not even strive to compete with frankfurt , but over the years , has established its own identity , especially with its popular concept " leipzig reads . "
unlike frankfurt , which is geared towards trade professionals , leipzig generates much of its business from the general public . children are welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comic books are one of the key attractions of the book fair during the day , the fair is held in new , modern facilities outside the city center , where literary fans from all walks of life gather - be it school classes storming the exhibits , parents pushing prams down the aisles , or readers coming into contact with internationally best-selling authors in an informal atmosphere .
a large chunk of the fairgrounds will also be devoted to children 's books and comics . in the evenings , numerous readings are offered throughout the city , in bookshops , cozy cafes or a city hall chamber .
there will be 1,800 events this year alone , and late night partygoers could even bump into vladimir kaminer , the german-russian author of " russian disco , " who doubles up as a disc jockey . emphasis on german literature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author vladimir kaminer will double up as a disc jockey for the fair what distinguishes leipzig from frankfurt , is the strong emphasis on german-language literature and its knack for discovering young talent .
a number of well-known authors , such as ingo schulze , got their publishing start at the fair .
schulze , along with max frisch , and heinrich böll , is among the very few german authors , who have had the distinction of being published in the new yorker magazine . the magic of leipzig is that everyone can find his or her niche , whether it is the budding novelist or a world renowned author , according to oliver zille , head of the book fair . given the proximity of this city in saxony to central and eastern europe , the foreign focus is on showcasing up-and-coming authors from that region and launching them in the german-language market .
due to its unique role as the cultural bridge in a wider europe that has expanded eastwards , it has become a book fair tradition to award the " prize for european understanding " to one outstanding author each year .
this year ukrainian writer juri andruchovich , who has chronicled political events that unfolded in his home country before and after the orange revolution , will be honored . audio books are big in leipzig leipzig not only " reads , " but " leipzig listens " as well .
another tradition is to award the " hörkules " prize in the audio segment of the book market , which has experienced tremendous growth in the past several years .
plenty of events will revolve around the medium of audio books or productions .
emerging playwrights for example , can get feedback for their unpublished radio plays performed in front of a live audience . bildunterschrift : taking in culture at leipzig 's renowned gewandhaus leipzig has been dubbed the " city of the black arts " for its centuries-long tradition in the printing and book trade .
after world war ii and the division of germany , frankfurt became the venue for the world 's biggest fair in the publishing industry , whereas leipzig , relegated to decades of communist rule , became primarily a forum for east-west publishers . internationally , leipzig is a city that has long been associated with values such as liberty and freedom of expression , having led the peaceful demonstrations in 1989 that led to the fall of the berlin wall .
it is also famous for its cultural life and the gewandhaus orchestra . at the time of german reunification in 1990 , publishing houses in the former east germany were shut down or integrated into west german ones .
but already in 1991 , the leipzig book fair came back with a vengeance .
leipzig may never have the global impact and resources of its big brother in frankfurt , but it certainly sounds like more fun . gabriela schaaf -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : art , book , music and lifestyle fairs while cologne remains germany 's art and furniture capital , the publishing industry heads to frankfurt and leipzig 's fairs .

23 , 2006 -rrb- dw-world : leipzig with the motto " leipzig is coming ! “ this former east german metropolis is certainly making its mark .
leipzig has undergone huge changes since reunification and is developing into one of the most modern cities in germany .

normal cells go through a constant process where millions die every second - a process called apoptosis - while millions more are made , to keep the numbers the same .
but cancer cells avoid that process and " dodge " apoptosis by mutating or deregulating the genes that participate in programmed cell suicide .

chris hiley , head of policy and research at the prostate cancer charity , said : " this is interesting laboratory-based work on cells but we do n't yet know how , if at all , it might help men with prostate cancer .
" eventually , it may be possible to extract the capsaicin and make it available as a drug treatment .
" in the meantime we caution men with prostate cancer in the uk against upping their weekly intake of the hottest known chillies - high intake of hot chillies has been linked with stomach cancers in the populations of india and mexico .

smoking ban views : ash scotland chairman alan bowes said that the company was not wholly opposed to the ban .
he said : " the london and edinburgh swallow group is not against the smoking ban and supports the need for a control on smoking in public places , but feel that the parameters of the act and regulations as they currently stand present some fundamental human rights issues . "

meanwhile , a study has claimed that nearly half of smokers have said they will cut back on visits to pubs and restaurants once the ban comes into effect .
the research showed that 45 % of smokers questioned would visit their local pub or favourite restaurant less often .
but 21 % said the ban would make them more determined to give up .
of the 1,004 smokers and non-smokers surveyed for niquitin , 72 % thought scotland would become a more pleasant place , while 17 % said it would create a worse atmosphere .

in a series of articles from interested parties supporting and opposed to the ban , tobacco control group action on smoking and health -lrb- ash -rrb- scotland gives its view .
chief executive maureen moore believes scotland can now look forward to a healthier future .
ash scotland is very proud of the new law on smoke-free enclosed public places .
smoking will be barred in pubs , clubs , restaurants and public places when scotland goes smoke-free on 26 march , we will all be taking a huge step forward .
in later years , people will look back on the legislation for smoke-free public places much in the same way that today we look back on the laws that got rid of industrial smog or provided for clean drinking water .
up to 1,000 non-smokers die every year in scotland because of exposure to second-hand smoke .
ash scotland argued that it was unacceptable that the carcinogens in second-hand smoke could continue to drift around unchecked in our public places and put everyone at risk to entirely preventable fatal diseases and ill-health .
when we go smoke-free , scotland will be joining a small elite of countries around the world that have gone for a comprehensive ban on smoking in enclosed public places .
there is no reason that scotland should n't see record declines in the numbers who smoke i think that scotland should expect to have a similar experience as they had when we go smoke-free .
in all other countries that have gone smoke-free , implementation goes smoothly and successfully .
most people respect the law and i am confident scots will observe the new restrictions after 26 march .
smoke-free public places are also popular .
most people are n't smokers , and most smokers wish they could quit , so there is actually a huge appetite for being able to go about your daily business without having to breathe other people 's cigarette smoke .
six months after ireland ended smoking in public , opinion polls showed that 94 % of people in ireland thought the law was a good idea .
' opportunity to choose ' once the law has become established , scotland can look forward to some real improvements in health .
non-smokers will be free from second-hand smoke .
many smokers will also take the opportunity to choose to beat their addiction .
if we look to somewhere like new york where they have been smoke-free for over two years , the number of people who smoke has fallen to record low levels .
if the scottish executive keeps supporting policies like smoke-free public places and remains committed to helping smokers to quit , then there is no reason that scotland should n't see record declines in the numbers who smoke as well .
ash scotland believes in a smoke-free future for everyone and will be campaigning to make smoke-free public places a success .

from 27 march , fares on the metro service will increase by an average of 7 % , while ulsterbus and ni railways fares will see an increase of about 9 % .
translink 's ciaran rogan said the increasing cost of fuel was to blame for the price rise .
" we have done what we can to minimise rises in fares , but everyone is aware of the rising cost of fuel , " he said .
" this was acknowledged by the consumer council .
nevertheless , with our net fuel costs increasing by over 70 % in two years it is now inevitable that this now impacts on northern ireland 's bus and rail services . "
eddie lynch , head of consumer affairs at the council , said people should make the most out of multi-journey travel cards to save money .
" this is unwelcome news for passengers and means that extra money has to be found from already overstretched pockets , " he said .
" the consumer council is particularly concerned for rural bus and train passengers who are facing the highest increases with this announcement and we are currently in discussions with translink on this important issue . "

belfast city council is looking for people who might have something suitable for a forthcoming easter exhibition at the city hall , titanic - an image .
the whole story surrounding the ship has been a marketing phenomenon since the 1997 release of the hollywood film , and una reilly of the belfast titanic society said they wanted to take a look at changing attitudes .
" we are going to reflect on how titanic is portrayed in modern society , and how -lrb- that depiction -rrb- has changed since the disaster , " she said .
the organisers hope to showcase not just heartfelt commemorations but also the numerous tawdry cash-ins that have appeared down the years .
anyone with a spare £ 50 might be able to buy something like a piece of titanic coal brought up from the seabed , gold-encased and transformed into a necklace .

alongside the exhibition which runs between 15 and 22 april , there will also be daily speakers , schools displays and tours around titanic sights in belfast by bus , boat and on foot .
the titanic was built at the harland and wolff shipyard in belfast , and the city has been capitalising on its links to the ship .
work on the first phase of the titanic quarter , the biggest property development scheme ever undertaken in northern ireland , has begun in the city .
an ambitious £ 100m heritage project at the site where the titanic was built is planned .
it will include a full-scale model of the liner , exhibition galleries and a hotel and conference centre .
it is hoped the attraction will be open by 2012 , the 100th anniversary of the ship 's launch .
the titanic signature project envisages a centrepiece building , three times the size of belfast city hall , based on the slipway where titanic and her sister ships were built .

technical hitches related to the console 's blu-ray disc drive had forced the delay , sony said .
sony games chief ken kutaragi said they were still finalising agreements on disc copy protection technology .
sony had been aiming for a spring launch for the successor to best-selling playstation 2 .
the news was announced at a hastily-convened news conference , after reports of a delay appeared in the nihon keizai shimbun , japan 's main financial daily newspaper .
the reports had triggered a 1.8 % drop in sony 's shares to 5,470 yen -lrb- $ 46.56 ; £ 26.67 -rrb- on the tokyo market .
the ps3 is one of three new gaming consoles promising cutting edge processing and graphical power .
sony has said the console will ship with a 60 gb hard drive and will play games created for both the playstation 1 and 2 at higher resolutions than the original .
no potential price was given for the console .
it will compete with microsoft 's xbox 360 , which went on sale late last year in the us , and nintendo 's revolution , which is due later this year .
worldwide release so far sony has dominated the market for home consoles , with its original playstation and playstation 2 having sold more than 200 million units .
it had originally planned to release its new machine in the spring .
but instead it is now talking of a november release in japan , the us and europe simultaneously .
in the past , sony has staggered the launch of new consoles , with europe coming a belated third .
" we are absolutely delighted that we will be able to bring ps3 to gamers in europe and australia before christmas , " said david reeves , head of sony computer entertainment europe .
" this is an exciting first for europe , and is a huge endorsement and vote of confidence in the strength of the european market and its importance globally . "
the delay means sony 's machine will not be in the shops in the us and japan until a year after the xbox 360 , giving microsoft a valuable lead in building up its market share .
a problem with the launch of the console could be a major setback for the company which is struggling to revive the performance of its consumer electronics division .
in an effort to revive its fortunes the firm has undergone a major restructuring drive involving 10,000 job cuts and 11 factory closures .
sony 's performance in the $ 25bn games industry is set to be one of the key factors determining the success of the firm 's turnaround this year .

sony 's performance in the $ 25bn games industry is set to be one of the key factors determining the success of the firm 's turnaround this year .

technical hitches related to the console 's blu-ray disc drive had forced the delay , sony said .
sony games chief ken kutaragi said they were still finalising agreements on disc copy protection technology .
sony had been aiming for a spring launch for the successor to best-selling playstation 2 .
the news was announced at a hastily-convened news conference , after reports of a delay appeared in the nihon keizai shimbun , japan 's main financial daily newspaper .
the reports had triggered a 1.8 % drop in sony 's shares to 5,470 yen -lrb- $ 46.56 ; £ 26.67 -rrb- on the tokyo market .
the ps3 is one of three new gaming consoles promising cutting edge processing and graphical power .
sony has said the console will ship with a 60 gb hard drive and will play games created for both the playstation 1 and 2 at higher resolutions than the original .
no potential price was given for the console .
it will compete with microsoft 's xbox 360 , which went on sale late last year in the us , and nintendo 's revolution , which is due later this year .
worldwide release so far sony has dominated the market for home consoles , with its original playstation and playstation 2 having sold more than 200 million units .
it had originally planned to release its new machine in the spring .
but instead it is now talking of a november release in japan , the us and europe simultaneously .
in the past , sony has staggered the launch of new consoles , with europe coming a belated third .
" we are absolutely delighted that we will be able to bring ps3 to gamers in europe and australia before christmas , " said david reeves , head of sony computer entertainment europe .
" this is an exciting first for europe , and is a huge endorsement and vote of confidence in the strength of the european market and its importance globally . "
the delay means sony 's machine will not be in the shops in the us and japan until a year after the xbox 360 , giving microsoft a valuable lead in building up its market share .
a problem with the launch of the console could be a major setback for the company which is struggling to revive the performance of its consumer electronics division .
in an effort to revive its fortunes the firm has undergone a major restructuring drive involving 10,000 job cuts and 11 factory closures .

ann abraham said the advice to 1,300 allied steel and wire staff in cardiff , sheerness and belfast caused " suffering , distress and uncertainty . "
she has called on the uk government to compensate those who lost pensions .
but the uk government has rejected her report , saying the companies involved should bear liability .
more than 800 staff in cardiff lost their jobs , and most of their pensions , when asw folded .
it quickly emerged that a massive shortfall in the pension funds meant asw pensions could not be guaranteed .
i would have roughly have been on about £ 150 a week , plus my old age pension , i could have retired and had a happy life , which i worked all my life for .
former asw worker , patrick morris one man who was affected is patrick morris who worked with asw for 26 years and fears he will never see his pension .
he said : " there 's people who generally lost their own claims and worked all their lives to survive and have a future when they retire and we 've lost the lot .
" there are some people who have actually passed away leaving their wives in a terrible state not knowing what will ever happen if we do get the pension .

the former steelworkers ' plight led the uk government to set up a £ 400m pensions protection fund to protect pension rights when a firm goes bust .
but when the new pensions bill was published , early in 2004 , there was further disappointment .
the legislation was not retrospective and did not help the welsh asw workers .
they are pinning their hopes on a fight through the european courts .
their case is expected to be heard in the european court of justice next year .

but the issue of whether australia will one day finally sever its ties with britain and become a republic has been brought to the fore once again by the mere presence of the queen .
the queen is generally held in high regard in australia she 's visiting a vast country - for the first time in four years - where 's she 's the constitutional head of state .
as far as monarchists are concerned , the matter was settled pretty decisively back in 1999 .
then , voters , in a referendum , overwhelmingly rejected the idea of a president being elected by parliamentarians .
a system created in its colonial past , lives on into the 21st century .
for the supporters of the status quo , the maxim , " if it ai n't broke why fix it ? " seems very appropriate .
seven years after the referendum , the debate about the rights and wrongs of a republic is not an active political one .
those impatient for change have chosen not to protest during this tour , not least because it might prove counter-productive .
it was an unrepeatable tour which prompted the young monarch to declare at the end that she was ' sad to be leaving the shores of your wonderful land ' the queen is generally held in high regard here , even by those wishing to move on .
but australia has changed dramatically since the queen first came here in 1954 .
then , most australians still viewed the uk as the mother country .

but the issue of whether australia will one day finally sever its ties with britain and become a republic has been brought to the fore once again by the mere presence of the queen .
the queen is generally held in high regard in australia she 's visiting a vast country - for the first time in four years - where 's she 's the constitutional head of state .
as far as monarchists are concerned , the matter was settled pretty decisively back in 1999 .
then , voters , in a referendum , overwhelmingly rejected the idea of a president being elected by parliamentarians .
a system created in its colonial past , lives on into the 21st century .
for the supporters of the status quo , the maxim , " if it ai n't broke why fix it ? " seems very appropriate .
seven years after the referendum , the debate about the rights and wrongs of a republic is not an active political one .
those impatient for change have chosen not to protest during this tour , not least because it might prove counter-productive .
it was an unrepeatable tour which prompted the young monarch to declare at the end that she was ' sad to be leaving the shores of your wonderful land ' the queen is generally held in high regard here , even by those wishing to move on .
but australia has changed dramatically since the queen first came here in 1954 .
then , most australians still viewed the uk as the mother country .
