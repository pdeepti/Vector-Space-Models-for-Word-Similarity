" we will have victory , " said a relaxed , beaming yanukovych , who has promised economic prosperity , stability and improved ties with moscow during his campaign , after voting in central kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters cheer julia tymoshenko the last pre-election opinion polls released two weeks before the vote suggested anukovych 's regions party would get up to 30 percent of the vote and yushchenko 's our ukraine up to 20 percent , while julia tymoshenko , the president 's estranged " orange " partner , would come in third with up to 17 percent . russia watching poll closely russia and the west , which wrangled over the bitterly contested 2004 campaign , are once again keenly watching the poll in this strategic country . while the kremlin sees ukraine as its historic backyard , the west has encouraged yushchenko 's drive to enter its ranks , safe from an increasingly confident and authoritarian moscow .
ukraine is deeply split along the divide . " the ' oranges ' are hated , they have n't fulfilled the hopes of those who came out into the streets , they 've done nothing , " said olexander , a taxi driver in the eastern city of donetsk , the industrial heartland where russian-speaking voters complain of low wages and rising prices , and want to retain close ties to moscow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the our ukraine party campaign wave flags " we need yushchenko because that 's moving toward the future ... and the future of ukraine is in europe and nato , " 43-year-old mykola said after voting on the other side of the country in the western city of lviv , the nationalist bastion where ukrainian-speaking voters yearn for a clean break from the kremlin . complex battle the battle for seats in the legislature has been fierce , as whoever controls parliament will have expanded powers under constitutional changes that came into force this year . out of the 45 parties competing , between five and nine could pass the three percent barrier needed to get into the chamber , but none is expected to get enough votes to secure a majority , forcing the winners to form a coalition . thus yushchenko is facing a risky marriage of convenience with one of his two top political rivals .
joining forces with yanukovych will slow down reforms needed for ukraine to move toward membership in the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and nato .
reuniting with tymoshenko risks scaring investors who are wary of her interventionist methods and strident stand on re-nationalization . coalition talks and subsequent negotiations on naming a new prime minister and forming the government could drag on for months .
yushchenko said that former " orange revolution " allies would start their negotiations on reuniting on monday . in addition to casting ballots for the legislature - under a purely proportional system using party lists - voters are also deciding regional and local assemblies , and municipal heads . major queues formed outside polling stations as voters struggled to handle up to four different ballots , some of them up to a meter long , with some waiting several hours to vote . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bitter rivalries mark first ukrainian election since " revolution " the presidential election in ukraine on sunday will be a clash of personalities all vying for the splintered vote in a country which is far from united in spite of the " orange revolution " a year and a half ago .

so how do young immigrants feel about the test ? it 's abundantly clear that many of the immigrants who 've gained german citizenship would never have done so had they sat a test like the one planned in hesse . what 's even more obvious is that a good deal of germans would fail it too . nine years ago , 25-year-old sisi and her father fled angola for germany .
even though she went to school here and is now a trained retail saleswoman , she 's floored by questions on the planned citizenship test such as " what did german scientist otto hahn do in 1938 ?

" feeling " more german " and she 's far from convinced that gaining german citizenship should depend on being able to answer such obscure questions .

" it 's reasonable to expect people to know about the country they want to live in .

they joined hundreds of others huddled in the office corridors before they were taken to germany .
gloria eventually gained german citizenship and now studies english and german at cologne university .
she agrees on the need for a test , but thinks the priorities need to be different . " the questions tend to concentrate very much on history , " she pointed out .

so how do young immigrants feel about the test ? it 's abundantly clear that many of the immigrants who 've gained german citizenship would never have done so had they sat a test like the one planned in hesse . what 's even more obvious is that a good deal of germans would fail it too . nine years ago , 25-year-old sisi and her father fled angola for germany .
even though she went to school here and is now a trained retail saleswoman , she 's floored by questions on the planned citizenship test such as " what did german scientist otto hahn do in 1938 ?

she agrees on the need for a test , but thinks the priorities need to be different . " the questions tend to concentrate very much on history , " she pointed out .

" we will have victory , " said a relaxed , beaming yanukovych , who has promised economic prosperity , stability and improved ties with moscow during his campaign , after voting in central kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters cheer julia tymoshenko the last pre-election opinion polls released two weeks before the vote suggested anukovych 's regions party would get up to 30 percent of the vote and yushchenko 's our ukraine up to 20 percent , while julia tymoshenko , the president 's estranged " orange " partner , would come in third with up to 17 percent . russia watching poll closely russia and the west , which wrangled over the bitterly contested 2004 campaign , are once again keenly watching the poll in this strategic country . while the kremlin sees ukraine as its historic backyard , the west has encouraged yushchenko 's drive to enter its ranks , safe from an increasingly confident and authoritarian moscow .
ukraine is deeply split along the divide . " the ' oranges ' are hated , they have n't fulfilled the hopes of those who came out into the streets , they 've done nothing , " said olexander , a taxi driver in the eastern city of donetsk , the industrial heartland where russian-speaking voters complain of low wages and rising prices , and want to retain close ties to moscow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the our ukraine party campaign wave flags " we need yushchenko because that 's moving toward the future ... and the future of ukraine is in europe and nato , " 43-year-old mykola said after voting on the other side of the country in the western city of lviv , the nationalist bastion where ukrainian-speaking voters yearn for a clean break from the kremlin . complex battle the battle for seats in the legislature has been fierce , as whoever controls parliament will have expanded powers under constitutional changes that came into force this year . out of the 45 parties competing , between five and nine could pass the three percent barrier needed to get into the chamber , but none is expected to get enough votes to secure a majority , forcing the winners to form a coalition . thus yushchenko is facing a risky marriage of convenience with one of his two top political rivals .
joining forces with yanukovych will slow down reforms needed for ukraine to move toward membership in the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and nato .
reuniting with tymoshenko risks scaring investors who are wary of her interventionist methods and strident stand on re-nationalization . coalition talks and subsequent negotiations on naming a new prime minister and forming the government could drag on for months .
yushchenko said that former " orange revolution " allies would start their negotiations on reuniting on monday . in addition to casting ballots for the legislature - under a purely proportional system using party lists - voters are also deciding regional and local assemblies , and municipal heads . major queues formed outside polling stations as voters struggled to handle up to four different ballots , some of them up to a meter long , with some waiting several hours to vote . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bitter rivalries mark first ukrainian election since " revolution " the presidential election in ukraine on sunday will be a clash of personalities all vying for the splintered vote in a country which is far from united in spite of the " orange revolution " a year and a half ago .

the christian democrats have ruled the state for half a century and will probably continue their coalition with the liberal free democrats .
günther oettinger will remain state premier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an air of expectation in saxony-anhalt voters in the depressed eastern state of saxony-anhalt gave the christian democrats 36.2 percent of the vote , according to the official figures , and put the social democrats in third place behind the left party who won 24.1 percent . the conservatives ' partners in the state , the free democrats , failed to muster a score that would allow them to continue the alliance , increasing the likelihood of a link-up with the social democrats , who garnered about 21 percent , under the current conservative state premier , wolfgang böhmer . a " grand coalition " in saxony-anhalt would broaden the merkel coalition 's majority in the bundesrat upper house , helping it in an upcoming battle over a sweeping overhaul of germany 's federal system . meanwhile the social democrats scored a historic victory in wine-producing rhineland-palatinate thanks to the popularity of premier kurt beck , one of their leading figures at the national level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck was happy on sunday they drew 45.6 percent of the vote , again according to provisional official figures , possibly enough for an absolute majority and far ahead of the christian democrats , who suffered a crushing defeat with under 33 percent of the vote . frie n dly campaig n analysts noted before the polls that merkel 's christian democrats had little interest in a disaster for the social democrats in sunday 's polls , which could have undermined the already unwieldy alliance in berlin and cause the spd to lurch to the left on key issues . the two parties , traditional rivals , largely steered clear of all-out attacks during the campaigns to avoid jeopardizing their coalition in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all eyes are on merkel and her reform plans now the chancellor , who has enjoyed an extended political honeymoon since ousting gerhard schröder and is now germany 's most popular politician , said this month she would tackle key reform initiatives after these elections . they include efforts to shore up the creaking health-care system , the possible introduction of a minimum wage and plans to strip away laws protecting employees against sacking - all potentially divisive tests of the ruling coalition . lowest voter tur n out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few went voting like these two women in traditional costumes in baden-württemberg turnout levels were the lowest since the reunification of germany in 1990 , ranging from 44.4 percent in saxony-anhalt to 58.2 percent in rhineland-palatinate . the press saw sunday 's elections as a ringing endorsement of merkel 's government , and said it was now time to begin the urgent reforms required in europe 's biggest economy . the vote was " a sign that citizens have new confidence in the policy " of the government , the conservative fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g wrote in an editorial . " the grand coalition in berlin can exhale but now it has nothing more to hide behind , " the conservative daily die welt wrote . " now the -lrb- conservatives -rrb- and the spd must show how far they want and are able to go together . " the center-left berli n er zeitu n g said the government could no longer drag its feet on the domestic agenda . " voters have shown that they are serious about the grand coalition , " it wrote .

" the spd should not lose too many votes , " a close advisor to merkel recently told the conservative daily die welt .
" it is difficult as it is with the social democrats as partners . " pressure on spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sdp are in vulnerable shape any dip in support could turn up the pressure on the social democrats ' chief matthias platzeck to overhaul his strategy or perhaps give up one of the three posts he juggles : party leader on the national and state level and brandenburg state premier . a poll disaster for the social democrats could also complicate thorny talks on reform of the ailing health care system , the introduction of a minimum wage and laws protecting employees against layoffs . polls show the social democrats are vulnerable .
a survey released this week by independent institute forsa showed the party at 28 percent - far below the 34 percent they scored in the general election . conservative winning streak the christian democrats , meanwhile , are flying high at 39 percent , up from 35 percent . the conservatives are tipped to hold onto two of the three states - saxony-anhalt and baden-württemberg - while the social democrats expect to maintain power in rhineland-palatinate . saxony-anhalt is one of germany 's poorest states and plagued by problems common throughout the ex-communist east : chronic unemployment of more than 20 percent , a looming public deficit and the flight of young people to wealthier regions . but conservative state premier wolfgang böhmer , a 70-year-old gynecologist , is expected to dump his liberal partners , the free democrats , who are sinking in support in the state , and link up with social democrats in a mirror-image of merkel 's coalition . " i assume that reasonable talks will produce a cdu-spd majority in the end , " the social democrat candidate in saxony-anhalt , jens bullerjahn , said this week . strike repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck in baden-württemberg , an economic powerhouse and home to automakers such as porsche and daimlerchrysler , the conservatives are counting on a continuation of their half-century lock on power despite crippling public sector strikes that have been running for seven weeks . and in rhineland-palatinate , the country 's only - and remarkably harmonious - marriage of social democrats and free democrats is expected to continue under the leadership of popular premier kurt beck . pollsters will be watching the social democrats ' score closely in the state as beck is the party 's deputy national leader . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : 100 days of angela merkel becoming germany 's first female leader was not easy , but angela merkel has already carved her name high up in the popularity stakes .

" we will have victory , " said a relaxed , beaming yanukovych , who has promised economic prosperity , stability and improved ties with moscow during his campaign , after voting in central kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters cheer julia tymoshenko the last pre-election opinion polls released two weeks before the vote suggested anukovych 's regions party would get up to 30 percent of the vote and yushchenko 's our ukraine up to 20 percent , while julia tymoshenko , the president 's estranged " orange " partner , would come in third with up to 17 percent . russia watching poll closely russia and the west , which wrangled over the bitterly contested 2004 campaign , are once again keenly watching the poll in this strategic country . while the kremlin sees ukraine as its historic backyard , the west has encouraged yushchenko 's drive to enter its ranks , safe from an increasingly confident and authoritarian moscow .
ukraine is deeply split along the divide . " the ' oranges ' are hated , they have n't fulfilled the hopes of those who came out into the streets , they 've done nothing , " said olexander , a taxi driver in the eastern city of donetsk , the industrial heartland where russian-speaking voters complain of low wages and rising prices , and want to retain close ties to moscow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the our ukraine party campaign wave flags " we need yushchenko because that 's moving toward the future ... and the future of ukraine is in europe and nato , " 43-year-old mykola said after voting on the other side of the country in the western city of lviv , the nationalist bastion where ukrainian-speaking voters yearn for a clean break from the kremlin . complex battle the battle for seats in the legislature has been fierce , as whoever controls parliament will have expanded powers under constitutional changes that came into force this year . out of the 45 parties competing , between five and nine could pass the three percent barrier needed to get into the chamber , but none is expected to get enough votes to secure a majority , forcing the winners to form a coalition . thus yushchenko is facing a risky marriage of convenience with one of his two top political rivals .
joining forces with yanukovych will slow down reforms needed for ukraine to move toward membership in the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and nato .
reuniting with tymoshenko risks scaring investors who are wary of her interventionist methods and strident stand on re-nationalization . coalition talks and subsequent negotiations on naming a new prime minister and forming the government could drag on for months .
yushchenko said that former " orange revolution " allies would start their negotiations on reuniting on monday . in addition to casting ballots for the legislature - under a purely proportional system using party lists - voters are also deciding regional and local assemblies , and municipal heads . major queues formed outside polling stations as voters struggled to handle up to four different ballots , some of them up to a meter long , with some waiting several hours to vote . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bitter rivalries mark first ukrainian election since " revolution " the presidential election in ukraine on sunday will be a clash of personalities all vying for the splintered vote in a country which is far from united in spite of the " orange revolution " a year and a half ago .

so how do young immigrants feel about the test ? it 's abundantly clear that many of the immigrants who 've gained german citizenship would never have done so had they sat a test like the one planned in hesse . what 's even more obvious is that a good deal of germans would fail it too . nine years ago , 25-year-old sisi and her father fled angola for germany .
even though she went to school here and is now a trained retail saleswoman , she 's floored by questions on the planned citizenship test such as " what did german scientist otto hahn do in 1938 ? " or " in which german elections are eu citizens allowed to vote ? " feeling " more german " and she 's far from convinced that gaining german citizenship should depend on being able to answer such obscure questions . " it does n't necessarily mean you 're a proper german , " said sisi .

but knowing the answers would n't make me feel more german . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe and schiller - part of germany 's cultural heritage but that 's exactly what the hesse questionnaire wants to achieve .
the state wants its would-be new citizens to possess an in-depth knowledge of german history , culture , politics and values - and be familiar not only with the works of goethe and schiller , but also with governmental structures and systems . the underlying principle is that the process of becoming german should be more than a mere formality .

" it 's reasonable to expect people to know about the country they want to live in .

they joined hundreds of others huddled in the office corridors before they were taken to germany .
gloria eventually gained german citizenship and now studies english and german at cologne university .
she agrees on the need for a test , but thinks the priorities need to be different . " the questions tend to concentrate very much on history , " she pointed out .
" of course a lot of those questions are very important especially when it comes to legal matters , but there 's no mention at all of contemporary german culture .

" the spd should not lose too many votes , " a close advisor to merkel recently told the conservative daily die welt .
" it is difficult as it is with the social democrats as partners . " pressure on spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sdp are in vulnerable shape any dip in support could turn up the pressure on the social democrats ' chief matthias platzeck to overhaul his strategy or perhaps give up one of the three posts he juggles : party leader on the national and state level and brandenburg state premier . a poll disaster for the social democrats could also complicate thorny talks on reform of the ailing health care system , the introduction of a minimum wage and laws protecting employees against layoffs . polls show the social democrats are vulnerable .
a survey released this week by independent institute forsa showed the party at 28 percent - far below the 34 percent they scored in the general election . conservative winning streak the christian democrats , meanwhile , are flying high at 39 percent , up from 35 percent . the conservatives are tipped to hold onto two of the three states - saxony-anhalt and baden-württemberg - while the social democrats expect to maintain power in rhineland-palatinate . saxony-anhalt is one of germany 's poorest states and plagued by problems common throughout the ex-communist east : chronic unemployment of more than 20 percent , a looming public deficit and the flight of young people to wealthier regions . but conservative state premier wolfgang böhmer , a 70-year-old gynecologist , is expected to dump his liberal partners , the free democrats , who are sinking in support in the state , and link up with social democrats in a mirror-image of merkel 's coalition . " i assume that reasonable talks will produce a cdu-spd majority in the end , " the social democrat candidate in saxony-anhalt , jens bullerjahn , said this week . strike repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck in baden-württemberg , an economic powerhouse and home to automakers such as porsche and daimlerchrysler , the conservatives are counting on a continuation of their half-century lock on power despite crippling public sector strikes that have been running for seven weeks . and in rhineland-palatinate , the country 's only - and remarkably harmonious - marriage of social democrats and free democrats is expected to continue under the leadership of popular premier kurt beck . pollsters will be watching the social democrats ' score closely in the state as beck is the party 's deputy national leader . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : 100 days of angela merkel becoming germany 's first female leader was not easy , but angela merkel has already carved her name high up in the popularity stakes .

" we will have victory , " said a relaxed , beaming yanukovych , who has promised economic prosperity , stability and improved ties with moscow during his campaign , after voting in central kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters cheer julia tymoshenko the last pre-election opinion polls released two weeks before the vote suggested anukovych 's regions party would get up to 30 percent of the vote and yushchenko 's our ukraine up to 20 percent , while julia tymoshenko , the president 's estranged " orange " partner , would come in third with up to 17 percent . russia watching poll closely russia and the west , which wrangled over the bitterly contested 2004 campaign , are once again keenly watching the poll in this strategic country . while the kremlin sees ukraine as its historic backyard , the west has encouraged yushchenko 's drive to enter its ranks , safe from an increasingly confident and authoritarian moscow .

" the ' oranges ' are hated , they have n't fulfilled the hopes of those who came out into the streets , they 've done nothing , " said olexander , a taxi driver in the eastern city of donetsk , the industrial heartland where russian-speaking voters complain of low wages and rising prices , and want to retain close ties to moscow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the our ukraine party campaign wave flags " we need yushchenko because that 's moving toward the future ... and the future of ukraine is in europe and nato , " 43-year-old mykola said after voting on the other side of the country in the western city of lviv , the nationalist bastion where ukrainian-speaking voters yearn for a clean break from the kremlin . complex battle the battle for seats in the legislature has been fierce , as whoever controls parliament will have expanded powers under constitutional changes that came into force this year . out of the 45 parties competing , between five and nine could pass the three percent barrier needed to get into the chamber , but none is expected to get enough votes to secure a majority , forcing the winners to form a coalition . thus yushchenko is facing a risky marriage of convenience with one of his two top political rivals .
joining forces with yanukovych will slow down reforms needed for ukraine to move toward membership in the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and nato .
reuniting with tymoshenko risks scaring investors who are wary of her interventionist methods and strident stand on re-nationalization . coalition talks and subsequent negotiations on naming a new prime minister and forming the government could drag on for months .
yushchenko said that former " orange revolution " allies would start their negotiations on reuniting on monday . in addition to casting ballots for the legislature - under a purely proportional system using party lists - voters are also deciding regional and local assemblies , and municipal heads . major queues formed outside polling stations as voters struggled to handle up to four different ballots , some of them up to a meter long , with some waiting several hours to vote . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bitter rivalries mark first ukrainian election since " revolution " the presidential election in ukraine on sunday will be a clash of personalities all vying for the splintered vote in a country which is far from united in spite of the " orange revolution " a year and a half ago .

the christian democrats have ruled the state for half a century and will probably continue their coalition with the liberal free democrats .
günther oettinger will remain state premier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an air of expectation in saxony-anhalt voters in the depressed eastern state of saxony-anhalt gave the christian democrats 36.2 percent of the vote , according to the official figures , and put the social democrats in third place behind the left party who won 24.1 percent . the conservatives ' partners in the state , the free democrats , failed to muster a score that would allow them to continue the alliance , increasing the likelihood of a link-up with the social democrats , who garnered about 21 percent , under the current conservative state premier , wolfgang böhmer . a " grand coalition " in saxony-anhalt would broaden the merkel coalition 's majority in the bundesrat upper house , helping it in an upcoming battle over a sweeping overhaul of germany 's federal system . meanwhile the social democrats scored a historic victory in wine-producing rhineland-palatinate thanks to the popularity of premier kurt beck , one of their leading figures at the national level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck was happy on sunday they drew 45.6 percent of the vote , again according to provisional official figures , possibly enough for an absolute majority and far ahead of the christian democrats , who suffered a crushing defeat with under 33 percent of the vote . frie n dly campaig n analysts noted before the polls that merkel 's christian democrats had little interest in a disaster for the social democrats in sunday 's polls , which could have undermined the already unwieldy alliance in berlin and cause the spd to lurch to the left on key issues . the two parties , traditional rivals , largely steered clear of all-out attacks during the campaigns to avoid jeopardizing their coalition in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all eyes are on merkel and her reform plans now the chancellor , who has enjoyed an extended political honeymoon since ousting gerhard schröder and is now germany 's most popular politician , said this month she would tackle key reform initiatives after these elections . they include efforts to shore up the creaking health-care system , the possible introduction of a minimum wage and plans to strip away laws protecting employees against sacking - all potentially divisive tests of the ruling coalition . lowest voter tur n out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few went voting like these two women in traditional costumes in baden-württemberg turnout levels were the lowest since the reunification of germany in 1990 , ranging from 44.4 percent in saxony-anhalt to 58.2 percent in rhineland-palatinate . the press saw sunday 's elections as a ringing endorsement of merkel 's government , and said it was now time to begin the urgent reforms required in europe 's biggest economy . the vote was " a sign that citizens have new confidence in the policy " of the government , the conservative fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g wrote in an editorial . " the grand coalition in berlin can exhale but now it has nothing more to hide behind , " the conservative daily die welt wrote .

" the spd should not lose too many votes , " a close advisor to merkel recently told the conservative daily die welt .
" it is difficult as it is with the social democrats as partners . " pressure on spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sdp are in vulnerable shape any dip in support could turn up the pressure on the social democrats ' chief matthias platzeck to overhaul his strategy or perhaps give up one of the three posts he juggles : party leader on the national and state level and brandenburg state premier . a poll disaster for the social democrats could also complicate thorny talks on reform of the ailing health care system , the introduction of a minimum wage and laws protecting employees against layoffs . polls show the social democrats are vulnerable .
a survey released this week by independent institute forsa showed the party at 28 percent - far below the 34 percent they scored in the general election . conservative winning streak the christian democrats , meanwhile , are flying high at 39 percent , up from 35 percent . the conservatives are tipped to hold onto two of the three states - saxony-anhalt and baden-württemberg - while the social democrats expect to maintain power in rhineland-palatinate . saxony-anhalt is one of germany 's poorest states and plagued by problems common throughout the ex-communist east : chronic unemployment of more than 20 percent , a looming public deficit and the flight of young people to wealthier regions . but conservative state premier wolfgang böhmer , a 70-year-old gynecologist , is expected to dump his liberal partners , the free democrats , who are sinking in support in the state , and link up with social democrats in a mirror-image of merkel 's coalition . " i assume that reasonable talks will produce a cdu-spd majority in the end , " the social democrat candidate in saxony-anhalt , jens bullerjahn , said this week . strike repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck in baden-württemberg , an economic powerhouse and home to automakers such as porsche and daimlerchrysler , the conservatives are counting on a continuation of their half-century lock on power despite crippling public sector strikes that have been running for seven weeks . and in rhineland-palatinate , the country 's only - and remarkably harmonious - marriage of social democrats and free democrats is expected to continue under the leadership of popular premier kurt beck . pollsters will be watching the social democrats ' score closely in the state as beck is the party 's deputy national leader . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : 100 days of angela merkel becoming germany 's first female leader was not easy , but angela merkel has already carved her name high up in the popularity stakes .

" the spd should not lose too many votes , " a close advisor to merkel recently told the conservative daily die welt .
" it is difficult as it is with the social democrats as partners . " pressure on spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sdp are in vulnerable shape any dip in support could turn up the pressure on the social democrats ' chief matthias platzeck to overhaul his strategy or perhaps give up one of the three posts he juggles : party leader on the national and state level and brandenburg state premier . a poll disaster for the social democrats could also complicate thorny talks on reform of the ailing health care system , the introduction of a minimum wage and laws protecting employees against layoffs . polls show the social democrats are vulnerable .
a survey released this week by independent institute forsa showed the party at 28 percent - far below the 34 percent they scored in the general election . conservative winning streak the christian democrats , meanwhile , are flying high at 39 percent , up from 35 percent . the conservatives are tipped to hold onto two of the three states - saxony-anhalt and baden-württemberg - while the social democrats expect to maintain power in rhineland-palatinate . saxony-anhalt is one of germany 's poorest states and plagued by problems common throughout the ex-communist east : chronic unemployment of more than 20 percent , a looming public deficit and the flight of young people to wealthier regions . but conservative state premier wolfgang böhmer , a 70-year-old gynecologist , is expected to dump his liberal partners , the free democrats , who are sinking in support in the state , and link up with social democrats in a mirror-image of merkel 's coalition . " i assume that reasonable talks will produce a cdu-spd majority in the end , " the social democrat candidate in saxony-anhalt , jens bullerjahn , said this week . strike repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck in baden-württemberg , an economic powerhouse and home to automakers such as porsche and daimlerchrysler , the conservatives are counting on a continuation of their half-century lock on power despite crippling public sector strikes that have been running for seven weeks . and in rhineland-palatinate , the country 's only - and remarkably harmonious - marriage of social democrats and free democrats is expected to continue under the leadership of popular premier kurt beck . pollsters will be watching the social democrats ' score closely in the state as beck is the party 's deputy national leader . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : 100 days of angela merkel becoming germany 's first female leader was not easy , but angela merkel has already carved her name high up in the popularity stakes .

" the grand coalition in berlin can exhale but now it has nothing more to hide behind , " the conservative daily die welt wrote . " now the -lrb- conservatives -rrb- and the spd must show how far they want and are able to go together . " the center-left berli n er zeitu n g said the government could no longer drag its feet on the domestic agenda . " voters have shown that they are serious about the grand coalition , " it wrote .

so how do young immigrants feel about the test ? it 's abundantly clear that many of the immigrants who 've gained german citizenship would never have done so had they sat a test like the one planned in hesse . what 's even more obvious is that a good deal of germans would fail it too . nine years ago , 25-year-old sisi and her father fled angola for germany .
even though she went to school here and is now a trained retail saleswoman , she 's floored by questions on the planned citizenship test such as " what did german scientist otto hahn do in 1938 ? " or " in which german elections are eu citizens allowed to vote ? " feeling " more german " and she 's far from convinced that gaining german citizenship should depend on being able to answer such obscure questions . " it does n't necessarily mean you 're a proper german , " said sisi .
" it 's not bad to have that kind of general knowledge , whether you 're german or not .
but knowing the answers would n't make me feel more german . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe and schiller - part of germany 's cultural heritage but that 's exactly what the hesse questionnaire wants to achieve .
the state wants its would-be new citizens to possess an in-depth knowledge of german history , culture , politics and values - and be familiar not only with the works of goethe and schiller , but also with governmental structures and systems . the underlying principle is that the process of becoming german should be more than a mere formality .
but many of the country 's freshly-minted citizens say that identifying with their new home has little if not nothing to do with reading up on its philosophers or learning the national anthem by heart . wrong priorities ? gloria , who hails from albania but has lived here for 14 years , observes that feeling german is harder for some than it is for others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the younger generation has more chance of integrating " some of the questions make sense , and after all , other countries require immigrants applying for citizenship to sit a test , " she said .
" it 's reasonable to expect people to know about the country they want to live in .
but those people who do n't get the opportunity to go to school in germany , like many of the guest workers who came here , stayed and started a family , obviously are n't going to know anything about the reformation or which convention took place in 1848 . " in 1991 , gloria 's parents sought political asylum with the german embassy in the albanian capital of tirana .
they joined hundreds of others huddled in the office corridors before they were taken to germany .
gloria eventually gained german citizenship and now studies english and german at cologne university .
she agrees on the need for a test , but thinks the priorities need to be different . " the questions tend to concentrate very much on history , " she pointed out .
" of course a lot of those questions are very important especially when it comes to legal matters , but there 's no mention at all of contemporary german culture .
why are n't there any questions about modern pop music or hip hop ? " an opportunity germany 's young immigrants agree that anyone who decides to live in germany should also do their best to integrate - not just learning to read and write language , but also getting to grips with german culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moving to germany can be a culture shock " i learnt all about germany when i came here , " said sisi .
" it 's not like africa .
germans eat at specific times , they visit each other at specific times .
sunday is a day of rest , which is a custom we do n't have in africa .
i 've become very german in that respect - if i want to visit someone i call them first .

" the united states deplores today 's use of force by belarussian authorities against peaceful demonstrators in minsk , " said us state department spokesman sean mccormack in a statement . the statement called " on belarussian authorities to refrain from further use of force and arrests against those exercising their legitimate rights to assembly and expression " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier demanded the release of opposition activists german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for the immediate release saturday of arrested belarussian opposition activists . " i condemn the imprisonment of opposition leader kozulin and i demand that he be immediately released along with the hundreds of other activists jailed over the past few days , " steinmeier said . " the fundamental rights of freedom of opinion and assembly should be assured in belarus , " said the foreign minister . " i urgently call upon the belarussian government to ensure without conditions , the safety of freedom of opposition leader alexander milinkevich . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition tent camp in minsk after police stormed it some 7,000 joined saturday 's rally to protest the reelection last week of alexander lukashenko to a third term in office , which the opposition claims was rigged . the european union and united states have also criticized the election , which western poll monitors said was neither free nor fair , and have vowed to impose sanctions after police cracked down friday on an opposition demonstration . wave of arrests and detentions meanwhile the belarussian opposition is searching for ways to regroup after the wave of arrests and clashes with police over the past days as they protest against lukashenko 's election to a third term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander kozulin relatives and supporters were unable to locate alexander kozulin , kozulin 's wife irina said .
" i looked for him all through the night , calling the interior ministry , the prosecutor , all possible institutions , but nowhere could they tell me where he was , " irina kozulina told afp . others in detention included the leader of the united civic party , anatoly lebedko , while the head of the belarussian popular front , vintsuk vyachorka , was in hiding , a relative of vyachorka told afp . ales bilatski , a leader of the viasna human rights group that monitors prisons and courts , estimated that as many as 100 people may have been detained in saturday evening 's clash , in which a number of people were injured . however there was no confirmation from the authorities on the number of arrests , after interior minister vladimir naumov said saturday that the most " active " part of the crowd kozulin had been leading had been detained . opposition seeks way forward saturday 's arrests followed arrests of hundreds of mainly young activists who camped out on minsk 's october square in a days-long protest .
most were convicted of hooliganism and handed relatively short sentences of up to two weeks . despite the blow dealt to the opposition , vyachorka 's deputy , viktor ivashkevich , said that plans were already well advanced on forming a new united opposition movement , " for freedom . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relatives and friends of arrested opposition supporters wait outside prison walls " many are now in prison but were convicted for 10-15 days and will come out and continue work , " ivashkevich told afp . " there 's been an explosion of activity , a new wave of young people and entrepreneurs who thought they could just work without getting involved in politics but realized it was impossible , that they had no prospects under the current authorities , " ivashkevich said . however political analyst sergei pankovsky said the opposition itself was still struggling to find its response to growing public discontent . " what 's happening is the search for a way to use this popular discontent .
even under conditions of an information blockade , people came out onto the streets .
the opposition only aligned itself with them , " said pankovsky . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belarus opposition figure seized a high-profile belarussian opposition figure was arrested following a rally in minsk saturday , a day after eu leaders slapped sanctions on president alexander lukashenko .

" the united states deplores today 's use of force by belarussian authorities against peaceful demonstrators in minsk , " said us state department spokesman sean mccormack in a statement . the statement called " on belarussian authorities to refrain from further use of force and arrests against those exercising their legitimate rights to assembly and expression " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier demanded the release of opposition activists german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for the immediate release saturday of arrested belarussian opposition activists . " i condemn the imprisonment of opposition leader kozulin and i demand that he be immediately released along with the hundreds of other activists jailed over the past few days , " steinmeier said . " the fundamental rights of freedom of opinion and assembly should be assured in belarus , " said the foreign minister . " i urgently call upon the belarussian government to ensure without conditions , the safety of freedom of opposition leader alexander milinkevich . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition tent camp in minsk after police stormed it some 7,000 joined saturday 's rally to protest the reelection last week of alexander lukashenko to a third term in office , which the opposition claims was rigged . the european union and united states have also criticized the election , which western poll monitors said was neither free nor fair , and have vowed to impose sanctions after police cracked down friday on an opposition demonstration . wave of arrests and detentions meanwhile the belarussian opposition is searching for ways to regroup after the wave of arrests and clashes with police over the past days as they protest against lukashenko 's election to a third term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander kozulin relatives and supporters were unable to locate alexander kozulin , kozulin 's wife irina said .

most were convicted of hooliganism and handed relatively short sentences of up to two weeks . despite the blow dealt to the opposition , vyachorka 's deputy , viktor ivashkevich , said that plans were already well advanced on forming a new united opposition movement , " for freedom . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relatives and friends of arrested opposition supporters wait outside prison walls " many are now in prison but were convicted for 10-15 days and will come out and continue work , " ivashkevich told afp . " there 's been an explosion of activity , a new wave of young people and entrepreneurs who thought they could just work without getting involved in politics but realized it was impossible , that they had no prospects under the current authorities , " ivashkevich said . however political analyst sergei pankovsky said the opposition itself was still struggling to find its response to growing public discontent . " what 's happening is the search for a way to use this popular discontent .
even under conditions of an information blockade , people came out onto the streets .
the opposition only aligned itself with them , " said pankovsky . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belarus opposition figure seized a high-profile belarussian opposition figure was arrested following a rally in minsk saturday , a day after eu leaders slapped sanctions on president alexander lukashenko .

" we will have victory , " said a relaxed , beaming yanukovych , who has promised economic prosperity , stability and improved ties with moscow during his campaign , after voting in central kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters cheer julia tymoshenko the last pre-election opinion polls released two weeks before the vote suggested anukovych 's regions party would get up to 30 percent of the vote and yushchenko 's our ukraine up to 20 percent , while julia tymoshenko , the president 's estranged " orange " partner , would come in third with up to 17 percent . russia watching poll closely russia and the west , which wrangled over the bitterly contested 2004 campaign , are once again keenly watching the poll in this strategic country . while the kremlin sees ukraine as its historic backyard , the west has encouraged yushchenko 's drive to enter its ranks , safe from an increasingly confident and authoritarian moscow .
ukraine is deeply split along the divide . " the ' oranges ' are hated , they have n't fulfilled the hopes of those who came out into the streets , they 've done nothing , " said olexander , a taxi driver in the eastern city of donetsk , the industrial heartland where russian-speaking voters complain of low wages and rising prices , and want to retain close ties to moscow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the our ukraine party campaign wave flags " we need yushchenko because that 's moving toward the future ... and the future of ukraine is in europe and nato , " 43-year-old mykola said after voting on the other side of the country in the western city of lviv , the nationalist bastion where ukrainian-speaking voters yearn for a clean break from the kremlin . complex battle the battle for seats in the legislature has been fierce , as whoever controls parliament will have expanded powers under constitutional changes that came into force this year . out of the 45 parties competing , between five and nine could pass the three percent barrier needed to get into the chamber , but none is expected to get enough votes to secure a majority , forcing the winners to form a coalition . thus yushchenko is facing a risky marriage of convenience with one of his two top political rivals .
joining forces with yanukovych will slow down reforms needed for ukraine to move toward membership in the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and nato .
reuniting with tymoshenko risks scaring investors who are wary of her interventionist methods and strident stand on re-nationalization . coalition talks and subsequent negotiations on naming a new prime minister and forming the government could drag on for months .
yushchenko said that former " orange revolution " allies would start their negotiations on reuniting on monday . in addition to casting ballots for the legislature - under a purely proportional system using party lists - voters are also deciding regional and local assemblies , and municipal heads . major queues formed outside polling stations as voters struggled to handle up to four different ballots , some of them up to a meter long , with some waiting several hours to vote . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bitter rivalries mark first ukrainian election since " revolution " the presidential election in ukraine on sunday will be a clash of personalities all vying for the splintered vote in a country which is far from united in spite of the " orange revolution " a year and a half ago .

" we will have victory , " said a relaxed , beaming yanukovych , who has promised economic prosperity , stability and improved ties with moscow during his campaign , after voting in central kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters cheer julia tymoshenko the last pre-election opinion polls released two weeks before the vote suggested anukovych 's regions party would get up to 30 percent of the vote and yushchenko 's our ukraine up to 20 percent , while julia tymoshenko , the president 's estranged " orange " partner , would come in third with up to 17 percent . russia watching poll closely russia and the west , which wrangled over the bitterly contested 2004 campaign , are once again keenly watching the poll in this strategic country . while the kremlin sees ukraine as its historic backyard , the west has encouraged yushchenko 's drive to enter its ranks , safe from an increasingly confident and authoritarian moscow .
ukraine is deeply split along the divide . " the ' oranges ' are hated , they have n't fulfilled the hopes of those who came out into the streets , they 've done nothing , " said olexander , a taxi driver in the eastern city of donetsk , the industrial heartland where russian-speaking voters complain of low wages and rising prices , and want to retain close ties to moscow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the our ukraine party campaign wave flags " we need yushchenko because that 's moving toward the future ... and the future of ukraine is in europe and nato , " 43-year-old mykola said after voting on the other side of the country in the western city of lviv , the nationalist bastion where ukrainian-speaking voters yearn for a clean break from the kremlin . complex battle the battle for seats in the legislature has been fierce , as whoever controls parliament will have expanded powers under constitutional changes that came into force this year . out of the 45 parties competing , between five and nine could pass the three percent barrier needed to get into the chamber , but none is expected to get enough votes to secure a majority , forcing the winners to form a coalition . thus yushchenko is facing a risky marriage of convenience with one of his two top political rivals .
joining forces with yanukovych will slow down reforms needed for ukraine to move toward membership in the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and nato .
reuniting with tymoshenko risks scaring investors who are wary of her interventionist methods and strident stand on re-nationalization . coalition talks and subsequent negotiations on naming a new prime minister and forming the government could drag on for months .
yushchenko said that former " orange revolution " allies would start their negotiations on reuniting on monday . in addition to casting ballots for the legislature - under a purely proportional system using party lists - voters are also deciding regional and local assemblies , and municipal heads . major queues formed outside polling stations as voters struggled to handle up to four different ballots , some of them up to a meter long , with some waiting several hours to vote . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bitter rivalries mark first ukrainian election since " revolution " the presidential election in ukraine on sunday will be a clash of personalities all vying for the splintered vote in a country which is far from united in spite of the " orange revolution " a year and a half ago .

the christian democrats have ruled the state for half a century and will probably continue their coalition with the liberal free democrats .
günther oettinger will remain state premier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an air of expectation in saxony-anhalt voters in the depressed eastern state of saxony-anhalt gave the christian democrats 36.2 percent of the vote , according to the official figures , and put the social democrats in third place behind the left party who won 24.1 percent . the conservatives ' partners in the state , the free democrats , failed to muster a score that would allow them to continue the alliance , increasing the likelihood of a link-up with the social democrats , who garnered about 21 percent , under the current conservative state premier , wolfgang böhmer . a " grand coalition " in saxony-anhalt would broaden the merkel coalition 's majority in the bundesrat upper house , helping it in an upcoming battle over a sweeping overhaul of germany 's federal system . meanwhile the social democrats scored a historic victory in wine-producing rhineland-palatinate thanks to the popularity of premier kurt beck , one of their leading figures at the national level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck was happy on sunday they drew 45.6 percent of the vote , again according to provisional official figures , possibly enough for an absolute majority and far ahead of the christian democrats , who suffered a crushing defeat with under 33 percent of the vote . frie n dly campaig n analysts noted before the polls that merkel 's christian democrats had little interest in a disaster for the social democrats in sunday 's polls , which could have undermined the already unwieldy alliance in berlin and cause the spd to lurch to the left on key issues . the two parties , traditional rivals , largely steered clear of all-out attacks during the campaigns to avoid jeopardizing their coalition in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all eyes are on merkel and her reform plans now the chancellor , who has enjoyed an extended political honeymoon since ousting gerhard schröder and is now germany 's most popular politician , said this month she would tackle key reform initiatives after these elections . they include efforts to shore up the creaking health-care system , the possible introduction of a minimum wage and plans to strip away laws protecting employees against sacking - all potentially divisive tests of the ruling coalition . lowest voter tur n out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few went voting like these two women in traditional costumes in baden-württemberg turnout levels were the lowest since the reunification of germany in 1990 , ranging from 44.4 percent in saxony-anhalt to 58.2 percent in rhineland-palatinate . the press saw sunday 's elections as a ringing endorsement of merkel 's government , and said it was now time to begin the urgent reforms required in europe 's biggest economy . the vote was " a sign that citizens have new confidence in the policy " of the government , the conservative fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g wrote in an editorial . " the grand coalition in berlin can exhale but now it has nothing more to hide behind , " the conservative daily die welt wrote . " now the -lrb- conservatives -rrb- and the spd must show how far they want and are able to go together . " the center-left berli n er zeitu n g said the government could no longer drag its feet on the domestic agenda . " voters have shown that they are serious about the grand coalition , " it wrote .
" but also that they expect something of it .
the clear outcome of the poll is an order to begin in earnest with the work at hand .

so how do young immigrants feel about the test ? it 's abundantly clear that many of the immigrants who 've gained german citizenship would never have done so had they sat a test like the one planned in hesse . what 's even more obvious is that a good deal of germans would fail it too . nine years ago , 25-year-old sisi and her father fled angola for germany .

but knowing the answers would n't make me feel more german . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe and schiller - part of germany 's cultural heritage but that 's exactly what the hesse questionnaire wants to achieve .
the state wants its would-be new citizens to possess an in-depth knowledge of german history , culture , politics and values - and be familiar not only with the works of goethe and schiller , but also with governmental structures and systems . the underlying principle is that the process of becoming german should be more than a mere formality .

" it 's reasonable to expect people to know about the country they want to live in .

" it 's reasonable to expect people to know about the country they want to live in .
but those people who do n't get the opportunity to go to school in germany , like many of the guest workers who came here , stayed and started a family , obviously are n't going to know anything about the reformation or which convention took place in 1848 . " in 1991 , gloria 's parents sought political asylum with the german embassy in the albanian capital of tirana .
they joined hundreds of others huddled in the office corridors before they were taken to germany .
gloria eventually gained german citizenship and now studies english and german at cologne university .
she agrees on the need for a test , but thinks the priorities need to be different . " the questions tend to concentrate very much on history , " she pointed out .
" of course a lot of those questions are very important especially when it comes to legal matters , but there 's no mention at all of contemporary german culture .
why are n't there any questions about modern pop music or hip hop ? " an opportunity germany 's young immigrants agree that anyone who decides to live in germany should also do their best to integrate - not just learning to read and write language , but also getting to grips with german culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moving to germany can be a culture shock " i learnt all about germany when i came here , " said sisi .
" it 's not like africa .
germans eat at specific times , they visit each other at specific times .
sunday is a day of rest , which is a custom we do n't have in africa .
i 've become very german in that respect - if i want to visit someone i call them first .
africans just drop by , " she said . " i did n't just assimilate german culture because i had to - but also because i wanted to , and i felt it was expected of me .
germany gives you the opportunity to belong , and i think you should use it . " sonila sand -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : citizenship tests a good idea for germany germany should introduce a test for immigrants seeking german citizenship .
but it should be the result of a national debate about what 's fair to demand of all foreigners - not just muslims , says dw 's deanne corbett .
-lrb- march 21 , 2006 -rrb- testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .
but do these new tests unfairly target muslims ?

so how do young immigrants feel about the test ? it 's abundantly clear that many of the immigrants who 've gained german citizenship would never have done so had they sat a test like the one planned in hesse . what 's even more obvious is that a good deal of germans would fail it too . nine years ago , 25-year-old sisi and her father fled angola for germany .
even though she went to school here and is now a trained retail saleswoman , she 's floored by questions on the planned citizenship test such as " what did german scientist otto hahn do in 1938 ? " or " in which german elections are eu citizens allowed to vote ? " feeling " more german " and she 's far from convinced that gaining german citizenship should depend on being able to answer such obscure questions . " it does n't necessarily mean you 're a proper german , " said sisi .
" it 's not bad to have that kind of general knowledge , whether you 're german or not .
but knowing the answers would n't make me feel more german . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe and schiller - part of germany 's cultural heritage but that 's exactly what the hesse questionnaire wants to achieve .
the state wants its would-be new citizens to possess an in-depth knowledge of german history , culture , politics and values - and be familiar not only with the works of goethe and schiller , but also with governmental structures and systems . the underlying principle is that the process of becoming german should be more than a mere formality .
but many of the country 's freshly-minted citizens say that identifying with their new home has little if not nothing to do with reading up on its philosophers or learning the national anthem by heart . wrong priorities ? gloria , who hails from albania but has lived here for 14 years , observes that feeling german is harder for some than it is for others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the younger generation has more chance of integrating " some of the questions make sense , and after all , other countries require immigrants applying for citizenship to sit a test , " she said .
" it 's reasonable to expect people to know about the country they want to live in .
but those people who do n't get the opportunity to go to school in germany , like many of the guest workers who came here , stayed and started a family , obviously are n't going to know anything about the reformation or which convention took place in 1848 . " in 1991 , gloria 's parents sought political asylum with the german embassy in the albanian capital of tirana .
they joined hundreds of others huddled in the office corridors before they were taken to germany .
gloria eventually gained german citizenship and now studies english and german at cologne university .
she agrees on the need for a test , but thinks the priorities need to be different . " the questions tend to concentrate very much on history , " she pointed out .
" of course a lot of those questions are very important especially when it comes to legal matters , but there 's no mention at all of contemporary german culture .
why are n't there any questions about modern pop music or hip hop ? " an opportunity germany 's young immigrants agree that anyone who decides to live in germany should also do their best to integrate - not just learning to read and write language , but also getting to grips with german culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moving to germany can be a culture shock " i learnt all about germany when i came here , " said sisi .
" it 's not like africa .
germans eat at specific times , they visit each other at specific times .
sunday is a day of rest , which is a custom we do n't have in africa .
i 've become very german in that respect - if i want to visit someone i call them first .
africans just drop by , " she said . " i did n't just assimilate german culture because i had to - but also because i wanted to , and i felt it was expected of me .
germany gives you the opportunity to belong , and i think you should use it .

but it should be the result of a national debate about what 's fair to demand of all foreigners - not just muslims , says dw 's deanne corbett .
-lrb- march 21 , 2006 -rrb- testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .

" the spd should not lose too many votes , " a close advisor to merkel recently told the conservative daily die welt .
" it is difficult as it is with the social democrats as partners . " pressure on spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sdp are in vulnerable shape any dip in support could turn up the pressure on the social democrats ' chief matthias platzeck to overhaul his strategy or perhaps give up one of the three posts he juggles : party leader on the national and state level and brandenburg state premier . a poll disaster for the social democrats could also complicate thorny talks on reform of the ailing health care system , the introduction of a minimum wage and laws protecting employees against layoffs . polls show the social democrats are vulnerable .
a survey released this week by independent institute forsa showed the party at 28 percent - far below the 34 percent they scored in the general election . conservative winning streak the christian democrats , meanwhile , are flying high at 39 percent , up from 35 percent . the conservatives are tipped to hold onto two of the three states - saxony-anhalt and baden-württemberg - while the social democrats expect to maintain power in rhineland-palatinate . saxony-anhalt is one of germany 's poorest states and plagued by problems common throughout the ex-communist east : chronic unemployment of more than 20 percent , a looming public deficit and the flight of young people to wealthier regions . but conservative state premier wolfgang böhmer , a 70-year-old gynecologist , is expected to dump his liberal partners , the free democrats , who are sinking in support in the state , and link up with social democrats in a mirror-image of merkel 's coalition . " i assume that reasonable talks will produce a cdu-spd majority in the end , " the social democrat candidate in saxony-anhalt , jens bullerjahn , said this week . strike repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck in baden-württemberg , an economic powerhouse and home to automakers such as porsche and daimlerchrysler , the conservatives are counting on a continuation of their half-century lock on power despite crippling public sector strikes that have been running for seven weeks . and in rhineland-palatinate , the country 's only - and remarkably harmonious - marriage of social democrats and free democrats is expected to continue under the leadership of popular premier kurt beck . pollsters will be watching the social democrats ' score closely in the state as beck is the party 's deputy national leader . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : 100 days of angela merkel becoming germany 's first female leader was not easy , but angela merkel has already carved her name high up in the popularity stakes .

" the united states deplores today 's use of force by belarussian authorities against peaceful demonstrators in minsk , " said us state department spokesman sean mccormack in a statement . the statement called " on belarussian authorities to refrain from further use of force and arrests against those exercising their legitimate rights to assembly and expression " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier demanded the release of opposition activists german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for the immediate release saturday of arrested belarussian opposition activists . " i condemn the imprisonment of opposition leader kozulin and i demand that he be immediately released along with the hundreds of other activists jailed over the past few days , " steinmeier said . " the fundamental rights of freedom of opinion and assembly should be assured in belarus , " said the foreign minister . " i urgently call upon the belarussian government to ensure without conditions , the safety of freedom of opposition leader alexander milinkevich . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition tent camp in minsk after police stormed it some 7,000 joined saturday 's rally to protest the reelection last week of alexander lukashenko to a third term in office , which the opposition claims was rigged . the european union and united states have also criticized the election , which western poll monitors said was neither free nor fair , and have vowed to impose sanctions after police cracked down friday on an opposition demonstration . wave of arrests and detentions meanwhile the belarussian opposition is searching for ways to regroup after the wave of arrests and clashes with police over the past days as they protest against lukashenko 's election to a third term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander kozulin relatives and supporters were unable to locate alexander kozulin , kozulin 's wife irina said .
" i looked for him all through the night , calling the interior ministry , the prosecutor , all possible institutions , but nowhere could they tell me where he was , " irina kozulina told afp . others in detention included the leader of the united civic party , anatoly lebedko , while the head of the belarussian popular front , vintsuk vyachorka , was in hiding , a relative of vyachorka told afp . ales bilatski , a leader of the viasna human rights group that monitors prisons and courts , estimated that as many as 100 people may have been detained in saturday evening 's clash , in which a number of people were injured . however there was no confirmation from the authorities on the number of arrests , after interior minister vladimir naumov said saturday that the most " active " part of the crowd kozulin had been leading had been detained . opposition seeks way forward saturday 's arrests followed arrests of hundreds of mainly young activists who camped out on minsk 's october square in a days-long protest .
most were convicted of hooliganism and handed relatively short sentences of up to two weeks . despite the blow dealt to the opposition , vyachorka 's deputy , viktor ivashkevich , said that plans were already well advanced on forming a new united opposition movement , " for freedom . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relatives and friends of arrested opposition supporters wait outside prison walls " many are now in prison but were convicted for 10-15 days and will come out and continue work , " ivashkevich told afp . " there 's been an explosion of activity , a new wave of young people and entrepreneurs who thought they could just work without getting involved in politics but realized it was impossible , that they had no prospects under the current authorities , " ivashkevich said . however political analyst sergei pankovsky said the opposition itself was still struggling to find its response to growing public discontent .

" the united states deplores today 's use of force by belarussian authorities against peaceful demonstrators in minsk , " said us state department spokesman sean mccormack in a statement . the statement called " on belarussian authorities to refrain from further use of force and arrests against those exercising their legitimate rights to assembly and expression " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier demanded the release of opposition activists german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for the immediate release saturday of arrested belarussian opposition activists . " i condemn the imprisonment of opposition leader kozulin and i demand that he be immediately released along with the hundreds of other activists jailed over the past few days , " steinmeier said . " the fundamental rights of freedom of opinion and assembly should be assured in belarus , " said the foreign minister . " i urgently call upon the belarussian government to ensure without conditions , the safety of freedom of opposition leader alexander milinkevich . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition tent camp in minsk after police stormed it some 7,000 joined saturday 's rally to protest the reelection last week of alexander lukashenko to a third term in office , which the opposition claims was rigged . the european union and united states have also criticized the election , which western poll monitors said was neither free nor fair , and have vowed to impose sanctions after police cracked down friday on an opposition demonstration . wave of arrests and detentions meanwhile the belarussian opposition is searching for ways to regroup after the wave of arrests and clashes with police over the past days as they protest against lukashenko 's election to a third term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander kozulin relatives and supporters were unable to locate alexander kozulin , kozulin 's wife irina said .
" i looked for him all through the night , calling the interior ministry , the prosecutor , all possible institutions , but nowhere could they tell me where he was , " irina kozulina told afp . others in detention included the leader of the united civic party , anatoly lebedko , while the head of the belarussian popular front , vintsuk vyachorka , was in hiding , a relative of vyachorka told afp . ales bilatski , a leader of the viasna human rights group that monitors prisons and courts , estimated that as many as 100 people may have been detained in saturday evening 's clash , in which a number of people were injured . however there was no confirmation from the authorities on the number of arrests , after interior minister vladimir naumov said saturday that the most " active " part of the crowd kozulin had been leading had been detained . opposition seeks way forward saturday 's arrests followed arrests of hundreds of mainly young activists who camped out on minsk 's october square in a days-long protest .
most were convicted of hooliganism and handed relatively short sentences of up to two weeks . despite the blow dealt to the opposition , vyachorka 's deputy , viktor ivashkevich , said that plans were already well advanced on forming a new united opposition movement , " for freedom . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relatives and friends of arrested opposition supporters wait outside prison walls " many are now in prison but were convicted for 10-15 days and will come out and continue work , " ivashkevich told afp . " there 's been an explosion of activity , a new wave of young people and entrepreneurs who thought they could just work without getting involved in politics but realized it was impossible , that they had no prospects under the current authorities , " ivashkevich said . however political analyst sergei pankovsky said the opposition itself was still struggling to find its response to growing public discontent . " what 's happening is the search for a way to use this popular discontent .
even under conditions of an information blockade , people came out onto the streets .
the opposition only aligned itself with them , " said pankovsky . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belarus opposition figure seized a high-profile belarussian opposition figure was arrested following a rally in minsk saturday , a day after eu leaders slapped sanctions on president alexander lukashenko .

" we will have victory , " said a relaxed , beaming yanukovych , who has promised economic prosperity , stability and improved ties with moscow during his campaign , after voting in central kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters cheer julia tymoshenko the last pre-election opinion polls released two weeks before the vote suggested anukovych 's regions party would get up to 30 percent of the vote and yushchenko 's our ukraine up to 20 percent , while julia tymoshenko , the president 's estranged " orange " partner , would come in third with up to 17 percent . russia watching poll closely russia and the west , which wrangled over the bitterly contested 2004 campaign , are once again keenly watching the poll in this strategic country . while the kremlin sees ukraine as its historic backyard , the west has encouraged yushchenko 's drive to enter its ranks , safe from an increasingly confident and authoritarian moscow .
ukraine is deeply split along the divide . " the ' oranges ' are hated , they have n't fulfilled the hopes of those who came out into the streets , they 've done nothing , " said olexander , a taxi driver in the eastern city of donetsk , the industrial heartland where russian-speaking voters complain of low wages and rising prices , and want to retain close ties to moscow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the our ukraine party campaign wave flags " we need yushchenko because that 's moving toward the future ... and the future of ukraine is in europe and nato , " 43-year-old mykola said after voting on the other side of the country in the western city of lviv , the nationalist bastion where ukrainian-speaking voters yearn for a clean break from the kremlin . complex battle the battle for seats in the legislature has been fierce , as whoever controls parliament will have expanded powers under constitutional changes that came into force this year . out of the 45 parties competing , between five and nine could pass the three percent barrier needed to get into the chamber , but none is expected to get enough votes to secure a majority , forcing the winners to form a coalition . thus yushchenko is facing a risky marriage of convenience with one of his two top political rivals .
joining forces with yanukovych will slow down reforms needed for ukraine to move toward membership in the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and nato .
reuniting with tymoshenko risks scaring investors who are wary of her interventionist methods and strident stand on re-nationalization . coalition talks and subsequent negotiations on naming a new prime minister and forming the government could drag on for months .
yushchenko said that former " orange revolution " allies would start their negotiations on reuniting on monday . in addition to casting ballots for the legislature - under a purely proportional system using party lists - voters are also deciding regional and local assemblies , and municipal heads . major queues formed outside polling stations as voters struggled to handle up to four different ballots , some of them up to a meter long , with some waiting several hours to vote . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bitter rivalries mark first ukrainian election since " revolution " the presidential election in ukraine on sunday will be a clash of personalities all vying for the splintered vote in a country which is far from united in spite of the " orange revolution " a year and a half ago .

the christian democrats have ruled the state for half a century and will probably continue their coalition with the liberal free democrats .
günther oettinger will remain state premier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an air of expectation in saxony-anhalt voters in the depressed eastern state of saxony-anhalt gave the christian democrats 36.2 percent of the vote , according to the official figures , and put the social democrats in third place behind the left party who won 24.1 percent . the conservatives ' partners in the state , the free democrats , failed to muster a score that would allow them to continue the alliance , increasing the likelihood of a link-up with the social democrats , who garnered about 21 percent , under the current conservative state premier , wolfgang böhmer . a " grand coalition " in saxony-anhalt would broaden the merkel coalition 's majority in the bundesrat upper house , helping it in an upcoming battle over a sweeping overhaul of germany 's federal system . meanwhile the social democrats scored a historic victory in wine-producing rhineland-palatinate thanks to the popularity of premier kurt beck , one of their leading figures at the national level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck was happy on sunday they drew 45.6 percent of the vote , again according to provisional official figures , possibly enough for an absolute majority and far ahead of the christian democrats , who suffered a crushing defeat with under 33 percent of the vote . frie n dly campaig n analysts noted before the polls that merkel 's christian democrats had little interest in a disaster for the social democrats in sunday 's polls , which could have undermined the already unwieldy alliance in berlin and cause the spd to lurch to the left on key issues . the two parties , traditional rivals , largely steered clear of all-out attacks during the campaigns to avoid jeopardizing their coalition in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all eyes are on merkel and her reform plans now the chancellor , who has enjoyed an extended political honeymoon since ousting gerhard schröder and is now germany 's most popular politician , said this month she would tackle key reform initiatives after these elections . they include efforts to shore up the creaking health-care system , the possible introduction of a minimum wage and plans to strip away laws protecting employees against sacking - all potentially divisive tests of the ruling coalition . lowest voter tur n out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few went voting like these two women in traditional costumes in baden-württemberg turnout levels were the lowest since the reunification of germany in 1990 , ranging from 44.4 percent in saxony-anhalt to 58.2 percent in rhineland-palatinate . the press saw sunday 's elections as a ringing endorsement of merkel 's government , and said it was now time to begin the urgent reforms required in europe 's biggest economy . the vote was " a sign that citizens have new confidence in the policy " of the government , the conservative fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g wrote in an editorial . " the grand coalition in berlin can exhale but now it has nothing more to hide behind , " the conservative daily die welt wrote .

" the center-left berli n er zeitu n g said the government could no longer drag its feet on the domestic agenda . " voters have shown that they are serious about the grand coalition , " it wrote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.03.2006 immigrants have doubts about citizenship test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many argue the citizenship test sets the bar too high the hesse state government plans to introduce citizenship tests for foreigners , including a list of 100 questions designed to evaluate familiarity with germany .
so how do young immigrants feel about the test ? it 's abundantly clear that many of the immigrants who 've gained german citizenship would never have done so had they sat a test like the one planned in hesse . what 's even more obvious is that a good deal of germans would fail it too . nine years ago , 25-year-old sisi and her father fled angola for germany .
even though she went to school here and is now a trained retail saleswoman , she 's floored by questions on the planned citizenship test such as " what did german scientist otto hahn do in 1938 ? " or " in which german elections are eu citizens allowed to vote ? " feeling " more german " and she 's far from convinced that gaining german citizenship should depend on being able to answer such obscure questions . " it does n't necessarily mean you 're a proper german , " said sisi .
" it 's not bad to have that kind of general knowledge , whether you 're german or not .
but knowing the answers would n't make me feel more german . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe and schiller - part of germany 's cultural heritage but that 's exactly what the hesse questionnaire wants to achieve .
the state wants its would-be new citizens to possess an in-depth knowledge of german history , culture , politics and values - and be familiar not only with the works of goethe and schiller , but also with governmental structures and systems . the underlying principle is that the process of becoming german should be more than a mere formality .
but many of the country 's freshly-minted citizens say that identifying with their new home has little if not nothing to do with reading up on its philosophers or learning the national anthem by heart . wrong priorities ? gloria , who hails from albania but has lived here for 14 years , observes that feeling german is harder for some than it is for others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the younger generation has more chance of integrating " some of the questions make sense , and after all , other countries require immigrants applying for citizenship to sit a test , " she said .
" it 's reasonable to expect people to know about the country they want to live in .
but those people who do n't get the opportunity to go to school in germany , like many of the guest workers who came here , stayed and started a family , obviously are n't going to know anything about the reformation or which convention took place in 1848 . " in 1991 , gloria 's parents sought political asylum with the german embassy in the albanian capital of tirana .
they joined hundreds of others huddled in the office corridors before they were taken to germany .
gloria eventually gained german citizenship and now studies english and german at cologne university .
she agrees on the need for a test , but thinks the priorities need to be different . " the questions tend to concentrate very much on history , " she pointed out .

so how do young immigrants feel about the test ? it 's abundantly clear that many of the immigrants who 've gained german citizenship would never have done so had they sat a test like the one planned in hesse . what 's even more obvious is that a good deal of germans would fail it too . nine years ago , 25-year-old sisi and her father fled angola for germany .
even though she went to school here and is now a trained retail saleswoman , she 's floored by questions on the planned citizenship test such as " what did german scientist otto hahn do in 1938 ? " or " in which german elections are eu citizens allowed to vote ? " feeling " more german " and she 's far from convinced that gaining german citizenship should depend on being able to answer such obscure questions . " it does n't necessarily mean you 're a proper german , " said sisi .
" it 's not bad to have that kind of general knowledge , whether you 're german or not .
but knowing the answers would n't make me feel more german . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe and schiller - part of germany 's cultural heritage but that 's exactly what the hesse questionnaire wants to achieve .
the state wants its would-be new citizens to possess an in-depth knowledge of german history , culture , politics and values - and be familiar not only with the works of goethe and schiller , but also with governmental structures and systems . the underlying principle is that the process of becoming german should be more than a mere formality .
but many of the country 's freshly-minted citizens say that identifying with their new home has little if not nothing to do with reading up on its philosophers or learning the national anthem by heart . wrong priorities ? gloria , who hails from albania but has lived here for 14 years , observes that feeling german is harder for some than it is for others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the younger generation has more chance of integrating " some of the questions make sense , and after all , other countries require immigrants applying for citizenship to sit a test , " she said .
" it 's reasonable to expect people to know about the country they want to live in .
but those people who do n't get the opportunity to go to school in germany , like many of the guest workers who came here , stayed and started a family , obviously are n't going to know anything about the reformation or which convention took place in 1848 .

they joined hundreds of others huddled in the office corridors before they were taken to germany .

so how do young immigrants feel about the test ? it 's abundantly clear that many of the immigrants who 've gained german citizenship would never have done so had they sat a test like the one planned in hesse . what 's even more obvious is that a good deal of germans would fail it too . nine years ago , 25-year-old sisi and her father fled angola for germany .
even though she went to school here and is now a trained retail saleswoman , she 's floored by questions on the planned citizenship test such as " what did german scientist otto hahn do in 1938 ? " or " in which german elections are eu citizens allowed to vote ? " feeling " more german " and she 's far from convinced that gaining german citizenship should depend on being able to answer such obscure questions . " it does n't necessarily mean you 're a proper german , " said sisi .
" it 's not bad to have that kind of general knowledge , whether you 're german or not .
but knowing the answers would n't make me feel more german . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe and schiller - part of germany 's cultural heritage but that 's exactly what the hesse questionnaire wants to achieve .
the state wants its would-be new citizens to possess an in-depth knowledge of german history , culture , politics and values - and be familiar not only with the works of goethe and schiller , but also with governmental structures and systems . the underlying principle is that the process of becoming german should be more than a mere formality .
but many of the country 's freshly-minted citizens say that identifying with their new home has little if not nothing to do with reading up on its philosophers or learning the national anthem by heart . wrong priorities ? gloria , who hails from albania but has lived here for 14 years , observes that feeling german is harder for some than it is for others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the younger generation has more chance of integrating " some of the questions make sense , and after all , other countries require immigrants applying for citizenship to sit a test , " she said .
" it 's reasonable to expect people to know about the country they want to live in .
but those people who do n't get the opportunity to go to school in germany , like many of the guest workers who came here , stayed and started a family , obviously are n't going to know anything about the reformation or which convention took place in 1848 . " in 1991 , gloria 's parents sought political asylum with the german embassy in the albanian capital of tirana .
they joined hundreds of others huddled in the office corridors before they were taken to germany .
gloria eventually gained german citizenship and now studies english and german at cologne university .
she agrees on the need for a test , but thinks the priorities need to be different . " the questions tend to concentrate very much on history , " she pointed out .

the christian democrats have ruled the state for half a century and will probably continue their coalition with the liberal free democrats .
günther oettinger will remain state premier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an air of expectation in saxony-anhalt voters in the depressed eastern state of saxony-anhalt gave the christian democrats 36.2 percent of the vote , according to the official figures , and put the social democrats in third place behind the left party who won 24.1 percent . the conservatives ' partners in the state , the free democrats , failed to muster a score that would allow them to continue the alliance , increasing the likelihood of a link-up with the social democrats , who garnered about 21 percent , under the current conservative state premier , wolfgang böhmer . a " grand coalition " in saxony-anhalt would broaden the merkel coalition 's majority in the bundesrat upper house , helping it in an upcoming battle over a sweeping overhaul of germany 's federal system . meanwhile the social democrats scored a historic victory in wine-producing rhineland-palatinate thanks to the popularity of premier kurt beck , one of their leading figures at the national level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck was happy on sunday they drew 45.6 percent of the vote , again according to provisional official figures , possibly enough for an absolute majority and far ahead of the christian democrats , who suffered a crushing defeat with under 33 percent of the vote . frie n dly campaig n analysts noted before the polls that merkel 's christian democrats had little interest in a disaster for the social democrats in sunday 's polls , which could have undermined the already unwieldy alliance in berlin and cause the spd to lurch to the left on key issues . the two parties , traditional rivals , largely steered clear of all-out attacks during the campaigns to avoid jeopardizing their coalition in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all eyes are on merkel and her reform plans now the chancellor , who has enjoyed an extended political honeymoon since ousting gerhard schröder and is now germany 's most popular politician , said this month she would tackle key reform initiatives after these elections . they include efforts to shore up the creaking health-care system , the possible introduction of a minimum wage and plans to strip away laws protecting employees against sacking - all potentially divisive tests of the ruling coalition . lowest voter tur n out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few went voting like these two women in traditional costumes in baden-württemberg turnout levels were the lowest since the reunification of germany in 1990 , ranging from 44.4 percent in saxony-anhalt to 58.2 percent in rhineland-palatinate . the press saw sunday 's elections as a ringing endorsement of merkel 's government , and said it was now time to begin the urgent reforms required in europe 's biggest economy . the vote was " a sign that citizens have new confidence in the policy " of the government , the conservative fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g wrote in an editorial . " the grand coalition in berlin can exhale but now it has nothing more to hide behind , " the conservative daily die welt wrote . " now the -lrb- conservatives -rrb- and the spd must show how far they want and are able to go together . " the center-left berli n er zeitu n g said the government could no longer drag its feet on the domestic agenda . " voters have shown that they are serious about the grand coalition , " it wrote .

" the spd should not lose too many votes , " a close advisor to merkel recently told the conservative daily die welt .
" it is difficult as it is with the social democrats as partners . " pressure on spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sdp are in vulnerable shape any dip in support could turn up the pressure on the social democrats ' chief matthias platzeck to overhaul his strategy or perhaps give up one of the three posts he juggles : party leader on the national and state level and brandenburg state premier . a poll disaster for the social democrats could also complicate thorny talks on reform of the ailing health care system , the introduction of a minimum wage and laws protecting employees against layoffs . polls show the social democrats are vulnerable .
a survey released this week by independent institute forsa showed the party at 28 percent - far below the 34 percent they scored in the general election . conservative winning streak the christian democrats , meanwhile , are flying high at 39 percent , up from 35 percent . the conservatives are tipped to hold onto two of the three states - saxony-anhalt and baden-württemberg - while the social democrats expect to maintain power in rhineland-palatinate . saxony-anhalt is one of germany 's poorest states and plagued by problems common throughout the ex-communist east : chronic unemployment of more than 20 percent , a looming public deficit and the flight of young people to wealthier regions . but conservative state premier wolfgang böhmer , a 70-year-old gynecologist , is expected to dump his liberal partners , the free democrats , who are sinking in support in the state , and link up with social democrats in a mirror-image of merkel 's coalition . " i assume that reasonable talks will produce a cdu-spd majority in the end , " the social democrat candidate in saxony-anhalt , jens bullerjahn , said this week . strike repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck in baden-württemberg , an economic powerhouse and home to automakers such as porsche and daimlerchrysler , the conservatives are counting on a continuation of their half-century lock on power despite crippling public sector strikes that have been running for seven weeks . and in rhineland-palatinate , the country 's only - and remarkably harmonious - marriage of social democrats and free democrats is expected to continue under the leadership of popular premier kurt beck . pollsters will be watching the social democrats ' score closely in the state as beck is the party 's deputy national leader . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : 100 days of angela merkel becoming germany 's first female leader was not easy , but angela merkel has already carved her name high up in the popularity stakes .

" the spd should not lose too many votes , " a close advisor to merkel recently told the conservative daily die welt .
" it is difficult as it is with the social democrats as partners . " pressure on spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sdp are in vulnerable shape any dip in support could turn up the pressure on the social democrats ' chief matthias platzeck to overhaul his strategy or perhaps give up one of the three posts he juggles : party leader on the national and state level and brandenburg state premier . a poll disaster for the social democrats could also complicate thorny talks on reform of the ailing health care system , the introduction of a minimum wage and laws protecting employees against layoffs . polls show the social democrats are vulnerable .
a survey released this week by independent institute forsa showed the party at 28 percent - far below the 34 percent they scored in the general election . conservative winning streak the christian democrats , meanwhile , are flying high at 39 percent , up from 35 percent . the conservatives are tipped to hold onto two of the three states - saxony-anhalt and baden-württemberg - while the social democrats expect to maintain power in rhineland-palatinate . saxony-anhalt is one of germany 's poorest states and plagued by problems common throughout the ex-communist east : chronic unemployment of more than 20 percent , a looming public deficit and the flight of young people to wealthier regions . but conservative state premier wolfgang böhmer , a 70-year-old gynecologist , is expected to dump his liberal partners , the free democrats , who are sinking in support in the state , and link up with social democrats in a mirror-image of merkel 's coalition . " i assume that reasonable talks will produce a cdu-spd majority in the end , " the social democrat candidate in saxony-anhalt , jens bullerjahn , said this week . strike repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck in baden-württemberg , an economic powerhouse and home to automakers such as porsche and daimlerchrysler , the conservatives are counting on a continuation of their half-century lock on power despite crippling public sector strikes that have been running for seven weeks . and in rhineland-palatinate , the country 's only - and remarkably harmonious - marriage of social democrats and free democrats is expected to continue under the leadership of popular premier kurt beck . pollsters will be watching the social democrats ' score closely in the state as beck is the party 's deputy national leader . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : 100 days of angela merkel becoming germany 's first female leader was not easy , but angela merkel has already carved her name high up in the popularity stakes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.03.2006 immigrants have doubts about citizenship test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many argue the citizenship test sets the bar too high the hesse state government plans to introduce citizenship tests for foreigners , including a list of 100 questions designed to evaluate familiarity with germany .
so how do young immigrants feel about the test ? it 's abundantly clear that many of the immigrants who 've gained german citizenship would never have done so had they sat a test like the one planned in hesse . what 's even more obvious is that a good deal of germans would fail it too . nine years ago , 25-year-old sisi and her father fled angola for germany .
even though she went to school here and is now a trained retail saleswoman , she 's floored by questions on the planned citizenship test such as " what did german scientist otto hahn do in 1938 ? " or " in which german elections are eu citizens allowed to vote ? " feeling " more german " and she 's far from convinced that gaining german citizenship should depend on being able to answer such obscure questions . " it does n't necessarily mean you 're a proper german , " said sisi .
" it 's not bad to have that kind of general knowledge , whether you 're german or not .
but knowing the answers would n't make me feel more german . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe and schiller - part of germany 's cultural heritage but that 's exactly what the hesse questionnaire wants to achieve .
the state wants its would-be new citizens to possess an in-depth knowledge of german history , culture , politics and values - and be familiar not only with the works of goethe and schiller , but also with governmental structures and systems . the underlying principle is that the process of becoming german should be more than a mere formality .
but many of the country 's freshly-minted citizens say that identifying with their new home has little if not nothing to do with reading up on its philosophers or learning the national anthem by heart . wrong priorities ? gloria , who hails from albania but has lived here for 14 years , observes that feeling german is harder for some than it is for others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the younger generation has more chance of integrating " some of the questions make sense , and after all , other countries require immigrants applying for citizenship to sit a test , " she said .
" it 's reasonable to expect people to know about the country they want to live in .
but those people who do n't get the opportunity to go to school in germany , like many of the guest workers who came here , stayed and started a family , obviously are n't going to know anything about the reformation or which convention took place in 1848 . " in 1991 , gloria 's parents sought political asylum with the german embassy in the albanian capital of tirana .
they joined hundreds of others huddled in the office corridors before they were taken to germany .
gloria eventually gained german citizenship and now studies english and german at cologne university .
she agrees on the need for a test , but thinks the priorities need to be different . " the questions tend to concentrate very much on history , " she pointed out .
" of course a lot of those questions are very important especially when it comes to legal matters , but there 's no mention at all of contemporary german culture .
why are n't there any questions about modern pop music or hip hop ? " an opportunity germany 's young immigrants agree that anyone who decides to live in germany should also do their best to integrate - not just learning to read and write language , but also getting to grips with german culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moving to germany can be a culture shock " i learnt all about germany when i came here , " said sisi .
" it 's not like africa .
germans eat at specific times , they visit each other at specific times .
sunday is a day of rest , which is a custom we do n't have in africa .
i 've become very german in that respect - if i want to visit someone i call them first .
africans just drop by , " she said . " i did n't just assimilate german culture because i had to - but also because i wanted to , and i felt it was expected of me .
germany gives you the opportunity to belong , and i think you should use it .

" the united states deplores today 's use of force by belarussian authorities against peaceful demonstrators in minsk , " said us state department spokesman sean mccormack in a statement . the statement called " on belarussian authorities to refrain from further use of force and arrests against those exercising their legitimate rights to assembly and expression " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier demanded the release of opposition activists german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for the immediate release saturday of arrested belarussian opposition activists . " i condemn the imprisonment of opposition leader kozulin and i demand that he be immediately released along with the hundreds of other activists jailed over the past few days , " steinmeier said . " the fundamental rights of freedom of opinion and assembly should be assured in belarus , " said the foreign minister . " i urgently call upon the belarussian government to ensure without conditions , the safety of freedom of opposition leader alexander milinkevich .

the christian democrats have ruled the state for half a century and will probably continue their coalition with the liberal free democrats .
günther oettinger will remain state premier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an air of expectation in saxony-anhalt voters in the depressed eastern state of saxony-anhalt gave the christian democrats 36.2 percent of the vote , according to the official figures , and put the social democrats in third place behind the left party who won 24.1 percent . the conservatives ' partners in the state , the free democrats , failed to muster a score that would allow them to continue the alliance , increasing the likelihood of a link-up with the social democrats , who garnered about 21 percent , under the current conservative state premier , wolfgang böhmer . a " grand coalition " in saxony-anhalt would broaden the merkel coalition 's majority in the bundesrat upper house , helping it in an upcoming battle over a sweeping overhaul of germany 's federal system . meanwhile the social democrats scored a historic victory in wine-producing rhineland-palatinate thanks to the popularity of premier kurt beck , one of their leading figures at the national level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck was happy on sunday they drew 45.6 percent of the vote , again according to provisional official figures , possibly enough for an absolute majority and far ahead of the christian democrats , who suffered a crushing defeat with under 33 percent of the vote . frie n dly campaig n analysts noted before the polls that merkel 's christian democrats had little interest in a disaster for the social democrats in sunday 's polls , which could have undermined the already unwieldy alliance in berlin and cause the spd to lurch to the left on key issues . the two parties , traditional rivals , largely steered clear of all-out attacks during the campaigns to avoid jeopardizing their coalition in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all eyes are on merkel and her reform plans now the chancellor , who has enjoyed an extended political honeymoon since ousting gerhard schröder and is now germany 's most popular politician , said this month she would tackle key reform initiatives after these elections . they include efforts to shore up the creaking health-care system , the possible introduction of a minimum wage and plans to strip away laws protecting employees against sacking - all potentially divisive tests of the ruling coalition . lowest voter tur n out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few went voting like these two women in traditional costumes in baden-württemberg turnout levels were the lowest since the reunification of germany in 1990 , ranging from 44.4 percent in saxony-anhalt to 58.2 percent in rhineland-palatinate . the press saw sunday 's elections as a ringing endorsement of merkel 's government , and said it was now time to begin the urgent reforms required in europe 's biggest economy . the vote was " a sign that citizens have new confidence in the policy " of the government , the conservative fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g wrote in an editorial . " the grand coalition in berlin can exhale but now it has nothing more to hide behind , " the conservative daily die welt wrote . " now the -lrb- conservatives -rrb- and the spd must show how far they want and are able to go together . " the center-left berli n er zeitu n g said the government could no longer drag its feet on the domestic agenda . " voters have shown that they are serious about the grand coalition , " it wrote .

so how do young immigrants feel about the test ? it 's abundantly clear that many of the immigrants who 've gained german citizenship would never have done so had they sat a test like the one planned in hesse . what 's even more obvious is that a good deal of germans would fail it too . nine years ago , 25-year-old sisi and her father fled angola for germany .
even though she went to school here and is now a trained retail saleswoman , she 's floored by questions on the planned citizenship test such as " what did german scientist otto hahn do in 1938 ?

" feeling " more german " and she 's far from convinced that gaining german citizenship should depend on being able to answer such obscure questions . " it does n't necessarily mean you 're a proper german , " said sisi .
" it 's not bad to have that kind of general knowledge , whether you 're german or not .
but knowing the answers would n't make me feel more german . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe and schiller - part of germany 's cultural heritage but that 's exactly what the hesse questionnaire wants to achieve .
the state wants its would-be new citizens to possess an in-depth knowledge of german history , culture , politics and values - and be familiar not only with the works of goethe and schiller , but also with governmental structures and systems . the underlying principle is that the process of becoming german should be more than a mere formality .
but many of the country 's freshly-minted citizens say that identifying with their new home has little if not nothing to do with reading up on its philosophers or learning the national anthem by heart . wrong priorities ? gloria , who hails from albania but has lived here for 14 years , observes that feeling german is harder for some than it is for others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the younger generation has more chance of integrating " some of the questions make sense , and after all , other countries require immigrants applying for citizenship to sit a test , " she said .
" it 's reasonable to expect people to know about the country they want to live in .
but those people who do n't get the opportunity to go to school in germany , like many of the guest workers who came here , stayed and started a family , obviously are n't going to know anything about the reformation or which convention took place in 1848 .

they joined hundreds of others huddled in the office corridors before they were taken to germany .
gloria eventually gained german citizenship and now studies english and german at cologne university .
she agrees on the need for a test , but thinks the priorities need to be different . " the questions tend to concentrate very much on history , " she pointed out .

" we will have victory , " said a relaxed , beaming yanukovych , who has promised economic prosperity , stability and improved ties with moscow during his campaign , after voting in central kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters cheer julia tymoshenko the last pre-election opinion polls released two weeks before the vote suggested anukovych 's regions party would get up to 30 percent of the vote and yushchenko 's our ukraine up to 20 percent , while julia tymoshenko , the president 's estranged " orange " partner , would come in third with up to 17 percent . russia watching poll closely russia and the west , which wrangled over the bitterly contested 2004 campaign , are once again keenly watching the poll in this strategic country . while the kremlin sees ukraine as its historic backyard , the west has encouraged yushchenko 's drive to enter its ranks , safe from an increasingly confident and authoritarian moscow .
ukraine is deeply split along the divide . " the ' oranges ' are hated , they have n't fulfilled the hopes of those who came out into the streets , they 've done nothing , " said olexander , a taxi driver in the eastern city of donetsk , the industrial heartland where russian-speaking voters complain of low wages and rising prices , and want to retain close ties to moscow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the our ukraine party campaign wave flags " we need yushchenko because that 's moving toward the future ... and the future of ukraine is in europe and nato , " 43-year-old mykola said after voting on the other side of the country in the western city of lviv , the nationalist bastion where ukrainian-speaking voters yearn for a clean break from the kremlin . complex battle the battle for seats in the legislature has been fierce , as whoever controls parliament will have expanded powers under constitutional changes that came into force this year . out of the 45 parties competing , between five and nine could pass the three percent barrier needed to get into the chamber , but none is expected to get enough votes to secure a majority , forcing the winners to form a coalition . thus yushchenko is facing a risky marriage of convenience with one of his two top political rivals .
joining forces with yanukovych will slow down reforms needed for ukraine to move toward membership in the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and nato .
reuniting with tymoshenko risks scaring investors who are wary of her interventionist methods and strident stand on re-nationalization . coalition talks and subsequent negotiations on naming a new prime minister and forming the government could drag on for months .
yushchenko said that former " orange revolution " allies would start their negotiations on reuniting on monday . in addition to casting ballots for the legislature - under a purely proportional system using party lists - voters are also deciding regional and local assemblies , and municipal heads . major queues formed outside polling stations as voters struggled to handle up to four different ballots , some of them up to a meter long , with some waiting several hours to vote . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bitter rivalries mark first ukrainian election since " revolution " the presidential election in ukraine on sunday will be a clash of personalities all vying for the splintered vote in a country which is far from united in spite of the " orange revolution " a year and a half ago .

so how do young immigrants feel about the test ? it 's abundantly clear that many of the immigrants who 've gained german citizenship would never have done so had they sat a test like the one planned in hesse . what 's even more obvious is that a good deal of germans would fail it too . nine years ago , 25-year-old sisi and her father fled angola for germany .

" it 's reasonable to expect people to know about the country they want to live in .
but those people who do n't get the opportunity to go to school in germany , like many of the guest workers who came here , stayed and started a family , obviously are n't going to know anything about the reformation or which convention took place in 1848 .

they joined hundreds of others huddled in the office corridors before they were taken to germany .

up to 325,000 young harp seal pups could be killed in the coming weeks .
celebrities such as former beatle sir paul mccartney and his wife have joined animal rights groups in condemning the cull as barbaric and unnecessary .
prime minister stephen harper said canada was victim of an " international propaganda campaign " , and insisted the cull would be carried out humanely .
harp seals found in north atlantic and arctic oceans feed on fish and crustaceans and spend much of year at sea pups born on the ice and nurse for two weeks , after which their mothers abandon them can be legally hunted only once their white coats darken , at about two weeks old the cull , which reportedly earns c $ 16.5m -lrb- £ 8.3m -rrb- in meat and pelt sales , is an important source of income for fishing communities in quebec and newfoundland that have been hit hard by dwindling fish stocks in the atlantic .
the hunt is " an annual harvest and it is based on economics ...
it is harvesting animals on a sustainable basis " , roger simone of the department of fisheries and oceans told the bbc .
the canadian government says the cull is also necessary to control seal numbers , saying the seal population is now almost six million , nearly triple the level of the 1970s .
it recently increased the total allowable catch by 5,000 , to 325,000 seals .
confrontations the first stage of the cull has begun in the gulf of st lawrence region in quebec .
some 90,000 seal pups in the area are expected to be killed before the hunt moves on to newfoundland , where thousands more will be culled .
on the first day , sealers and protesters came face to face , sparking confrontations .
at one point , a sealer flung the carcass of a skinned seal at an inflatable craft carrying protesters and journalists .
" they threw carcasses at our zodiac and they came rushing at us in their boat and tried to capsize us in the wake , " rebecca aldworth of the humane society of the united states told the ap news agency .
" this is standard behaviour out here .
the sealers feel that they 're completely above the law . "
but the sealers say they are misunderstood .
mark small , president of the northeast coast sealers cooperation , has been sealing in newfoundland waters for about 40 years .
" i think the canadian public realises these are coastal people who live off the sea and depend on the hunt to survive in small communities where the fish stocks are not there , " he told ap .
" coastal communities have to live , too . "
' shut the hunt ' the head of the international fund for animal welfare -lrb- ifaw -rrb- , fred o 'regan , said in a statement that the cull was a " cruel hunt for products that nobody needs " .
" canada is better than this .
it 's time for the new canadian government to shut down the seal hunt , " he said .
have your say " it is the market that is determining the amount of seals killed - if people did n't buy fur there would be no market " eric hovius , ontario , canada send us your comments ifaw has asked the canadian government to cancel this year 's hunt due to poor ice conditions , which it says means many pups will drown anyway .
sir paul and heather mccartney , who visited the region earlier this month to protest against the cull , made a last-minute video appeal .
" we are absolutely committed to making sure this is the last slaughter of baby seals in canada anyone will ever have to witness , " sir paul said .
they urged canada to consider a " win-win " plan to end the hunt while compensating fishermen for lost revenue .
celebrity campaigner brigitte bardot also asked the canadian government to halt the cull earlier this week .
" canada is a rich country .
it does n't need to sell skin , oil , fat and powdered seal penises to make aphrodisiacs for countries in asia ...
you can not continue a genocide of animals like this , " the 71-year-old actress said .
but mr harper , who refused a request to meet bardot , dismissed the suggestion .
" we do n't harvest the pups , " he said , referring to a 1987 ban on the killing of newborn seals with white coats pictured in many anti-hunt posters .
" unfortunately , we 're to some degree the victim of a bit of an international propaganda campaign ...
we believe the country is acting responsibly and we 'll make sure all rules are enforced . "

up to 325,000 young harp seal pups could be killed in the coming weeks .
celebrities such as former beatle sir paul mccartney and his wife have joined animal rights groups in condemning the cull as barbaric and unnecessary .
prime minister stephen harper said canada was victim of an " international propaganda campaign " , and insisted the cull would be carried out humanely .
harp seals found in north atlantic and arctic oceans feed on fish and crustaceans and spend much of year at sea pups born on the ice and nurse for two weeks , after which their mothers abandon them can be legally hunted only once their white coats darken , at about two weeks old the cull , which reportedly earns c $ 16.5m -lrb- £ 8.3m -rrb- in meat and pelt sales , is an important source of income for fishing communities in quebec and newfoundland that have been hit hard by dwindling fish stocks in the atlantic .
the hunt is " an annual harvest and it is based on economics ...
it is harvesting animals on a sustainable basis " , roger simone of the department of fisheries and oceans told the bbc .
the canadian government says the cull is also necessary to control seal numbers , saying the seal population is now almost six million , nearly triple the level of the 1970s .
it recently increased the total allowable catch by 5,000 , to 325,000 seals .
confrontations the first stage of the cull has begun in the gulf of st lawrence region in quebec .
some 90,000 seal pups in the area are expected to be killed before the hunt moves on to newfoundland , where thousands more will be culled .
on the first day , sealers and protesters came face to face , sparking confrontations .
at one point , a sealer flung the carcass of a skinned seal at an inflatable craft carrying protesters and journalists .
" they threw carcasses at our zodiac and they came rushing at us in their boat and tried to capsize us in the wake , " rebecca aldworth of the humane society of the united states told the ap news agency .
canada says it will not stop the controversial hunt " this is standard behaviour out here .
the sealers feel that they 're completely above the law . "
but the sealers say they are misunderstood .
mark small , president of the northeast coast sealers cooperation , has been sealing in newfoundland waters for about 40 years .
" i think the canadian public realises these are coastal people who live off the sea and depend on the hunt to survive in small communities where the fish stocks are not there , " he told ap .
" coastal communities have to live , too . "
' shut the hunt ' the head of the international fund for animal welfare -lrb- ifaw -rrb- , fred o 'regan , said in a statement that the cull was a " cruel hunt for products that nobody needs " .
" canada is better than this .
it 's time for the new canadian government to shut down the seal hunt , " he said .
have your say it is the market that is determining the amount of seals killed - if people did n't buy fur there would be no market eric hovius , ontario , canada send us your comments ifaw has asked the canadian government to cancel this year 's hunt due to poor ice conditions , which it says means many pups will drown anyway .
sir paul and heather mccartney , who visited the region earlier this month to protest against the cull , made a last-minute video appeal .
" we are absolutely committed to making sure this is the last slaughter of baby seals in canada anyone will ever have to witness , " sir paul said .
they urged canada to consider a " win-win " plan to end the hunt while compensating fishermen for lost revenue .
celebrity campaigner brigitte bardot also asked the canadian government to halt the cull earlier this week .
" canada is a rich country .
it does n't need to sell skin , oil , fat and powdered seal penises to make aphrodisiacs for countries in asia ...
you can not continue a genocide of animals like this , " the 71-year-old actress said .
but mr harper , who refused a request to meet bardot , dismissed the suggestion .
" we do n't harvest the pups , " he said , referring to a 1987 ban on the killing of newborn seals with white coats pictured in many anti-hunt posters .
" unfortunately , we 're to some degree the victim of a bit of an international propaganda campaign ...
we believe the country is acting responsibly and we 'll make sure all rules are enforced . "

but can it actually be tackled ?
in june 2000 , when police officers in dover began the distressing task of removing 58 dead chinese immigrants from the back of a tomato lorry , it was a scene they would never forget .
fast forward to february 2004 and britain witnessed its second major migration tragedy , the drowning of chinese cockle pickers on the treacherous tidal sands of morecombe bay .
what tied the tragedies and the many , many more unnoticed immigration enforcement raids in factories , restaurants , hotels and farmers ' fields is the reality of international organised immigration crime .
people-smuggling is big business and involves many different nationalities , working in different ways in different countries .
while there are 250,000 chinese people who are a part of british society , nobody knows how many other people from the country arrived unnoticed on the back of a lorry to work in the black economy .
demand for workers what lies behind illegal migration from china is an interesting tale .
the number of undeclared chinese workers is popularly thought to have begun rising in the mid-1990s .
by the 1990s , british-born chinese had emerged as one of the top groups in schools , consistently out-performing other ethnicities and often beating white children .
they had been listening to their parents and chosen going to university over a career in catering - and that led to a sudden demand for workers in the restaurant trade to take the jobs they might otherwise have filled .
the demand for more workers coincided with the sudden opening of routes from east to west after the collapse of the soviet union .
58 migrants were found suffocated in the back of a lorry meanwhile , in china itself , a growing economy and rural poverty led communities to club together to send young men abroad to work for the common good ; this in turn was very much part of an entrepreneurial , mercantile culture deeply rooted in some of china 's provinces .
as a wider and more diverse range of chinese people headed west , the opportunities they sought went beyond just working in takeaways .
police started noticing the rise of " snakehead " people-smuggler rackets .
far from being crude criminal enterprises , investigators came to realise that these were slick multinational networks with operations that ran like clockwork what made the difference compared with other immigration rackets , according to some experts , is the degree of co-operation that local officials provided in developing networks which they expected would bring foreign currency back into their areas .
the journey the individual stories of the migrants are , of course , all different .
but generally , a family or community will select someone to go overseas and earn as much money as possible to send home .
passage can take up to two years in a clandestine journey overland and by air into europe , using safe houses along the way some of the cocklers who died on morecombe bay paid £ 15,000 for their passage to england .
other migrants in britain have paid more than £ 30,000 to get here , with the going rate to reach the usa said to be about the same .
passage can take up to two years in a clandestine journey overland and by air into europe , using safe houses along the way .
senior police officers who have studied snakeheads say they are sufficiently business-minded to sub-contract transport to other ethnic groups -lrb- such as turkish smugglers on the border of asia and europe -rrb- if it will improve the profit margin .
the key step they do control , however , is arrival .
migrants who make it are allocated jobs by " recruiters " who have identified opportunities , be they in the chinese catering trade , sweatshop labour or picking cockles at morecombe bay .
but the handover to the recruiters turns the experience from a work-abroad scheme into something resembling kidnap .
many of these undocumented migrants quickly find themselves victims of extortion , with the price of the passage hiked and threats made to the families back home .
police officers who have raided restaurants , factories and businesses known to be using illegal workers have sometimes found up to 40 people sleeping in one room .
subtle humiliation techniques are often used , such as denial of shoes and socks , to maintain control over the workers .
what keeps them going is the fact that their earnings play a huge role in developing their home communities : a month 's pay packet in britain can be worth more than a year 's wages in poor rural communities .
historical problems while the system is simple , it is extremely difficult to smash .
illegal immigrants rarely make contact with any authorities at all - not even the nhs - meaning they can be difficult to identify and impossible to count .
how , then , do police forces deal with a situation where they know exploitation is going on - but where nobody will come forward because they fear deportation ?
today , major police investigations tend to target rackets by treating them as major commercial enterprises - rather than regarding the immigrant as the problem .
in london 's chinatown , workers blend quietly into communities this may sound odd , but it 's based on a simple principle .
people-smuggling is a business fulfilling demand in a market .
if you disrupt that market , business becomes more difficult .
techniques can include targeting weak points - money-brokers who take care of transactions between continents , hauliers who do the dirty work of transporting people and , most importantly of all , employers prepared to take on black-market labour .
but police forces are seeking to forge stronger links with communities themselves by emphasising that it is only with their help that they can attack organised crime .
another key element in this strategy is the long-awaited gangmaster licensing authority .
it begins work in earnest on 6 april and will very soon have legal powers in place to target those using illegal labour .
perhaps only then will we see the true scale of the phenomenon .
all of which leaves one unanswered question : what does the government do about all these people ?
the official line is apprehension and removal of illegal immigrants .
but , as a committee of mps recently pointed out , removing all failed asylum seekers alone - excluding black-market labourers - could take a decade .
some european countries have tried amnesties for illegal workers in the hope of cracking the criminal gangs .
but they also accept that individuals have put down roots and invested in the society , albeit in the twilight .
but while it means those who come forward start paying tax , there appears to be no guarantee that amnesties stop clandestine flows - and there is no sign of it appearing on the british political horizon .

but can it actually be tackled ?
in june 2000 , when police officers in dover began the distressing task of removing 58 dead chinese immigrants from the back of a tomato lorry , it was a scene they would never forget .
fast forward to february 2004 and britain witnessed its second major migration tragedy , the drowning of chinese cockle pickers on the treacherous tidal sands of morecombe bay .
what tied the tragedies and the many , many more unnoticed immigration enforcement raids in factories , restaurants , hotels and farmers ' fields is the reality of international organised immigration crime .
people-smuggling is big business and involves many different nationalities , working in different ways in different countries .
while there are 250,000 chinese people who are a part of british society , nobody knows how many other people from the country arrived unnoticed on the back of a lorry to work in the black economy .
demand for workers what lies behind illegal migration from china is an interesting tale .
the number of undeclared chinese workers is popularly thought to have begun rising in the mid-1990s .
by the 1990s , british-born chinese had emerged as one of the top groups in schools , consistently out-performing other ethnicities and often beating white children .
they had been listening to their parents and chosen going to university over a career in catering - and that led to a sudden demand for workers in the restaurant trade to take the jobs they might otherwise have filled .
the demand for more workers coincided with the sudden opening of routes from east to west after the collapse of the soviet union .
58 migrants were found suffocated in the back of a lorry meanwhile , in china itself , a growing economy and rural poverty led communities to club together to send young men abroad to work for the common good ; this in turn was very much part of an entrepreneurial , mercantile culture deeply rooted in some of china 's provinces .
as a wider and more diverse range of chinese people headed west , the opportunities they sought went beyond just working in takeaways .
police started noticing the rise of " snakehead " people-smuggler rackets .
far from being crude criminal enterprises , investigators came to realise that these were slick multinational networks with operations that ran like clockwork what made the difference compared with other immigration rackets , according to some experts , is the degree of co-operation that local officials provided in developing networks which they expected would bring foreign currency back into their areas .
the journey the individual stories of the migrants are , of course , all different .
but generally , a family or community will select someone to go overseas and earn as much money as possible to send home .
passage can take up to two years in a clandestine journey overland and by air into europe , using safe houses along the way some of the cocklers who died on morecombe bay paid £ 15,000 for their passage to england .
other migrants in britain have paid more than £ 30,000 to get here , with the going rate to reach the usa said to be about the same .
passage can take up to two years in a clandestine journey overland and by air into europe , using safe houses along the way .
senior police officers who have studied snakeheads say they are sufficiently business-minded to sub-contract transport to other ethnic groups -lrb- such as turkish smugglers on the border of asia and europe -rrb- if it will improve the profit margin .
the key step they do control , however , is arrival .
migrants who make it are allocated jobs by " recruiters " who have identified opportunities , be they in the chinese catering trade , sweatshop labour or picking cockles at morecombe bay .
but the handover to the recruiters turns the experience from a work-abroad scheme into something resembling kidnap .
many of these undocumented migrants quickly find themselves victims of extortion , with the price of the passage hiked and threats made to the families back home .
police officers who have raided restaurants , factories and businesses known to be using illegal workers have sometimes found up to 40 people sleeping in one room .
subtle humiliation techniques are often used , such as denial of shoes and socks , to maintain control over the workers .
what keeps them going is the fact that their earnings play a huge role in developing their home communities : a month 's pay packet in britain can be worth more than a year 's wages in poor rural communities .
historical problems while the system is simple , it is extremely difficult to smash .
illegal immigrants rarely make contact with any authorities at all - not even the nhs - meaning they can be difficult to identify and impossible to count .
how , then , do police forces deal with a situation where they know exploitation is going on - but where nobody will come forward because they fear deportation ?
today , major police investigations tend to target rackets by treating them as major commercial enterprises - rather than regarding the immigrant as the problem .
in london 's chinatown , workers blend quietly into communities this may sound odd , but it 's based on a simple principle .

what tied the tragedies and the many , many more unnoticed immigration enforcement raids in factories , restaurants , hotels and farmers ' fields is the reality of international organised immigration crime .
people-smuggling is big business and involves many different nationalities , working in different ways in different countries .
while there are 250,000 chinese people who are a part of british society , nobody knows how many other people from the country arrived unnoticed on the back of a lorry to work in the black economy .
demand for workers what lies behind illegal migration from china is an interesting tale .
the number of undeclared chinese workers is popularly thought to have begun rising in the mid-1990s .
by the 1990s , british-born chinese had emerged as one of the top groups in schools , consistently out-performing other ethnicities and often beating white children .
they had been listening to their parents and chosen going to university over a career in catering - and that led to a sudden demand for workers in the restaurant trade to take the jobs they might otherwise have filled .
the demand for more workers coincided with the sudden opening of routes from east to west after the collapse of the soviet union .
58 migrants were found suffocated in the back of a lorry meanwhile , in china itself , a growing economy and rural poverty led communities to club together to send young men abroad to work for the common good ; this in turn was very much part of an entrepreneurial , mercantile culture deeply rooted in some of china 's provinces .
as a wider and more diverse range of chinese people headed west , the opportunities they sought went beyond just working in takeaways .
police started noticing the rise of " snakehead " people-smuggler rackets .
far from being crude criminal enterprises , investigators came to realise that these were slick multinational networks with operations that ran like clockwork what made the difference compared with other immigration rackets , according to some experts , is the degree of co-operation that local officials provided in developing networks which they expected would bring foreign currency back into their areas .
the journey the individual stories of the migrants are , of course , all different .
but generally , a family or community will select someone to go overseas and earn as much money as possible to send home .
passage can take up to two years in a clandestine journey overland and by air into europe , using safe houses along the way some of the cocklers who died on morecombe bay paid £ 15,000 for their passage to england .
other migrants in britain have paid more than £ 30,000 to get here , with the going rate to reach the usa said to be about the same .
passage can take up to two years in a clandestine journey overland and by air into europe , using safe houses along the way .
senior police officers who have studied snakeheads say they are sufficiently business-minded to sub-contract transport to other ethnic groups -lrb- such as turkish smugglers on the border of asia and europe -rrb- if it will improve the profit margin .
the key step they do control , however , is arrival .
migrants who make it are allocated jobs by " recruiters " who have identified opportunities , be they in the chinese catering trade , sweatshop labour or picking cockles at morecombe bay .
but the handover to the recruiters turns the experience from a work-abroad scheme into something resembling kidnap .
many of these undocumented migrants quickly find themselves victims of extortion , with the price of the passage hiked and threats made to the families back home .
police officers who have raided restaurants , factories and businesses known to be using illegal workers have sometimes found up to 40 people sleeping in one room .
subtle humiliation techniques are often used , such as denial of shoes and socks , to maintain control over the workers .
what keeps them going is the fact that their earnings play a huge role in developing their home communities : a month 's pay packet in britain can be worth more than a year 's wages in poor rural communities .
historical problems while the system is simple , it is extremely difficult to smash .
illegal immigrants rarely make contact with any authorities at all - not even the nhs - meaning they can be difficult to identify and impossible to count .
how , then , do police forces deal with a situation where they know exploitation is going on - but where nobody will come forward because they fear deportation ?
today , major police investigations tend to target rackets by treating them as major commercial enterprises - rather than regarding the immigrant as the problem .
in london 's chinatown , workers blend quietly into communities this may sound odd , but it 's based on a simple principle .
people-smuggling is a business fulfilling demand in a market .
if you disrupt that market , business becomes more difficult .
techniques can include targeting weak points - money-brokers who take care of transactions between continents , hauliers who do the dirty work of transporting people and , most importantly of all , employers prepared to take on black-market labour .
but police forces are seeking to forge stronger links with communities themselves by emphasising that it is only with their help that they can attack organised crime .
another key element in this strategy is the long-awaited gangmaster licensing authority .
it begins work in earnest on 6 april and will very soon have legal powers in place to target those using illegal labour .
perhaps only then will we see the true scale of the phenomenon .
all of which leaves one unanswered question : what does the government do about all these people ?
the official line is apprehension and removal of illegal immigrants .
but , as a committee of mps recently pointed out , removing all failed asylum seekers alone - excluding black-market labourers - could take a decade .
some european countries have tried amnesties for illegal workers in the hope of cracking the criminal gangs .
but they also accept that individuals have put down roots and invested in the society , albeit in the twilight .
but while it means those who come forward start paying tax , there appears to be no guarantee that amnesties stop clandestine flows - and there is no sign of it appearing on the british political horizon .

but can it actually be tackled ?
in june 2000 , when police officers in dover began the distressing task of removing 58 dead chinese immigrants from the back of a tomato lorry , it was a scene they would never forget .
fast forward to february 2004 and britain witnessed its second major migration tragedy , the drowning of chinese cockle pickers on the treacherous tidal sands of morecombe bay .
what tied the tragedies and the many , many more unnoticed immigration enforcement raids in factories , restaurants , hotels and farmers ' fields is the reality of international organised immigration crime .
people-smuggling is big business and involves many different nationalities , working in different ways in different countries .
while there are 250,000 chinese people who are a part of british society , nobody knows how many other people from the country arrived unnoticed on the back of a lorry to work in the black economy .
demand for workers what lies behind illegal migration from china is an interesting tale .
the number of undeclared chinese workers is popularly thought to have begun rising in the mid-1990s .
by the 1990s , british-born chinese had emerged as one of the top groups in schools , consistently out-performing other ethnicities and often beating white children .
they had been listening to their parents and chosen going to university over a career in catering - and that led to a sudden demand for workers in the restaurant trade to take the jobs they might otherwise have filled .
the demand for more workers coincided with the sudden opening of routes from east to west after the collapse of the soviet union .
meanwhile , in china itself , a growing economy and rural poverty led communities to club together to send young men abroad to work for the common good ; this in turn was very much part of an entrepreneurial , mercantile culture deeply rooted in some of china 's provinces .
as a wider and more diverse range of chinese people headed west , the opportunities they sought went beyond just working in takeaways .
police started noticing the rise of " snakehead " people-smuggler rackets .
far from being crude criminal enterprises , investigators came to realise that these were slick multinational networks with operations that ran like clockwork what made the difference compared with other immigration rackets , according to some experts , is the degree of co-operation that local officials provided in developing networks which they expected would bring foreign currency back into their areas .
the journey the individual stories of the migrants are , of course , all different .
but generally , a family or community will select someone to go overseas and earn as much money as possible to send home . "
passage can take up to two years in a clandestine journey overland and by air into europe , using safe houses along the way " some of the cocklers who died on morecombe bay paid £ 15,000 for their passage to england .
other migrants in britain have paid more than £ 30,000 to get here , with the going rate to reach the usa said to be about the same .
passage can take up to two years in a clandestine journey overland and by air into europe , using safe houses along the way .
senior police officers who have studied snakeheads say they are sufficiently business-minded to sub-contract transport to other ethnic groups -lrb- such as turkish smugglers on the border of asia and europe -rrb- if it will improve the profit margin .
the key step they do control , however , is arrival .
migrants who make it are allocated jobs by " recruiters " who have identified opportunities , be they in the chinese catering trade , sweatshop labour or picking cockles at morecombe bay .
but the handover to the recruiters turns the experience from a work-abroad scheme into something resembling kidnap .
many of these undocumented migrants quickly find themselves victims of extortion , with the price of the passage hiked and threats made to the families back home .
police officers who have raided restaurants , factories and businesses known to be using illegal workers have sometimes found up to 40 people sleeping in one room .

here is reaction to the move .
first minister jack mcconnell " scotland will be proud that it has gone smoke-free ahead of any other part of the uk .
the smoking ban is absolutely the right way forward .
it is right for scotland , for our nation 's health , our nation 's economy and our tourist industry .
this country has always been a great place to live , to work , to bring up your children and even just to visit .
today , it just got better .
in the years ahead , people will look back on today as the day that scotland took the largest single step to improve its health for generations .
it is a day for all scots to be proud of our nation .
scotland - the best small country in the world . "
health minister andy kerr " scotland is now smoke-free .
as well as protecting people from the harmful effects of second-hand smoke , this far-reaching and ambitious step will help many people to give up smoking .
evidence from ireland and new york proves this .
there really has never been a better time to quit .
i know how difficult it is to stop smoking but it is the best decision a smoker can make .
stopping smoking is not only good for the health of the individual but scotland as a whole .
as a smoke-free nation , scotland can look forward to a healthier future .
a future where scots live longer , families stay together longer and our young people are fitter and better prepared to make the most of their ambitions .
it is a future that we can all look forward to and scotland should be proud that it 's leading the way in the uk . "
green msp eleanor scott " greens have supported the ban all along and believe it is a major step towards improving scotland 's health and a credit to the scottish parliament that it went for the full ban and not some wishy-washy unworkable compromise .
it will give a better social life to those 75 % of people who are non-smokers and who will no longer be exposed to second-hand smoke when they 're out trying to enjoy themselves .
it will protect the health of workers in the premises affected .
it will encourage the 80 % of smokers who want to quit and make quitting easier for them .
it will remove one of the key factors -lrb- " social smoking " -rrb- that starts young people on the road to becoming smokers .
scotland will be cleaner and healthier as a result . "
dr peter terry , bma scotland chairman " smoke-free legislation is a legacy that scotland has given to its future generations .
this will be remembered as the time scotland took a bold and politically courageous step to improve the health of people in scotland .
for years , scotland 's pubs , restaurants and workplaces have been filled with deadly smoke which has contributed to thousands of deaths from cancer , heart disease and stroke .
let us not forget that this legislation has been put in place to protect the public and employees from the hazards of second-hand smoke .
economic arguments around loss of trade are not proven and raise the question over what value employers place on the health and lives of their employees and customers .
on sunday , scotland clears the air , and in doing so it leads the way for other countries in the uk to follow suit next year .
on behalf of doctors across scotland , i thank the scottish parliament for introducing this legislation that will help save lives which , for too long , have been cut short by the deadly weed that is tobacco . "

british heart foundation 's david barker " sunday 26 march 2006 is a historic day for scotland .
it is extremely encouraging that devolution has allowed such tremendous advances in public health policy to take place , and also to see the scottish parliament and the scottish executive lead the way for the rest of the uk on this crucial issue .
we know that regular exposure to second-hand smoke increases the chances of developing heart disease by about 25 % .
no responsible government could allow such an appalling public health anomaly to continue .
this legislation will save many scottish lives that would have been lost purely because of the actions of others , and it has our unequivocal support . "
ash director deborah arnott " scotland is leading the united kingdom in protecting non-smokers from exposure to second-hand smoke at work and play .
but we urge the westminster parliament to bring forward the start of the ban to may 2007 and to set out its plan for implementing the ban with the utmost urgency .
all workers deserve protection from second-hand smoke regardless of their postcode .
they 've waited long enough already . "
forest spokesman neil rafferty " scotland will be a poorer place .
politicians and health campaigners have unprecedented power over our lives .
the ban will do nothing to improve the health of the nation , but it will give a warm glow to those who enjoy telling others what to do .
the anti-smoking fanatics will use the ban to victimise and stigmatise smokers even further .
they have used abusive and dishonest methods to make smokers feel bad about themselves , even comparing smokers to heroin addicts .
the executive and anti-smoking lobbyists have misled the scottish people .
they have exaggerated the effects of passive smoking , hidden the true economic costs , and ignored the fundamental issues of freedom and choice .
all along we advocated a policy which would have delivered genuine choice for smokers , non-smokers and bar workers and opinion polls showed that the majority of scots agreed with us .
it would be bad enough if the ban was being imposed by wise and responsible politicians , but this is the same bunch who spent £ 400m on a parliament building that is now falling to bits .
in years to come this ban will be seen as one more step on the road to surrendering our personal freedom to politicians . "
pub owner leon simms " it is the most stupid piece of legislation that jack mcconnell has ever conceived .
no matter what the executive says , there is going to be an economic impact .
we have talked to brewers who say that trade is down all over ireland since the ban came into force there .
i am quite happy for a smoking ban in places where food is served but not for a good old-fashioned boozer .
my bar staff are sad about the ban as they think it will have an impact on the local and social aspects of the bar .
personal freedom is being taken away .
the customer always has the choice .
nobody forces them to go into a pub and nobody forces staff to work there .
i am expecting some conflict , so i 'm not looking forward to sunday . "
independent msp brian monteith " the draconian nature of the total ban , where even some bus shelters are included , relies upon the public becoming snitches , while publicans will have to enforce the ban or face heavier fines than the smokers themselves .
the law is divisive , illiberal and counterproductive as it shall only lead to more people smoking at home rather than in bars and cafes with other smokers . "

here is reaction to the move .
first minister jack mcconnell scotland will be proud that it has gone smoke-free ahead of any other part of the uk .
the smoking ban is absolutely the right way forward .
it is right for scotland , for our nation 's health , our nation 's economy and our tourist industry .
this country has always been a great place to live , to work , to bring up your children and even just to visit .
today , it just got better .
in the years ahead , people will look back on today as the day that scotland took the largest single step to improve its health for generations .
it is a day for all scots to be proud of our nation .
scotland - the best small country in the world .
health minister andy kerr scotland is now smoke-free .
as well as protecting people from the harmful effects of second-hand smoke , this far-reaching and ambitious step will help many people to give up smoking .
evidence from ireland and new york proves this .
there really has never been a better time to quit .
i know how difficult it is to stop smoking but it is the best decision a smoker can make .
stopping smoking is not only good for the health of the individual but scotland as a whole .
as a smoke-free nation , scotland can look forward to a healthier future .
a future where scots live longer , families stay together longer and our young people are fitter and better prepared to make the most of their ambitions .
it is a future that we can all look forward to and scotland should be proud that it 's leading the way in the uk .
green msp eleanor scott greens have supported the ban all along and believe it is a major step towards improving scotland 's health and a credit to the scottish parliament that it went for the full ban and not some wishy-washy unworkable compromise .
it will give a better social life to those 75 % of people who are non-smokers and who will no longer be exposed to second-hand smoke when they 're out trying to enjoy themselves .
it will protect the health of workers in the premises affected .
it will encourage the 80 % of smokers who want to quit and make quitting easier for them .
it will remove one of the key factors -lrb- " social smoking " -rrb- that starts young people on the road to becoming smokers .

for years , scotland 's pubs , restaurants and workplaces have been filled with deadly smoke which has contributed to thousands of deaths from cancer , heart disease and stroke .
let us not forget that this legislation has been put in place to protect the public and employees from the hazards of second-hand smoke .
economic arguments around loss of trade are not proven and raise the question over what value employers place on the health and lives of their employees and customers .
on sunday , scotland clears the air , and in doing so it leads the way for other countries in the uk to follow suit next year .
on behalf of doctors across scotland , i thank the scottish parliament for introducing this legislation that will help save lives which , for too long , have been cut short by the deadly weed that is tobacco .

british heart foundation 's david barker sunday 26 march 2006 is a historic day for scotland .
it is extremely encouraging that devolution has allowed such tremendous advances in public health policy to take place , and also to see the scottish parliament and the scottish executive lead the way for the rest of the uk on this crucial issue .
we know that regular exposure to second-hand smoke increases the chances of developing heart disease by about 25 % .
no responsible government could allow such an appalling public health anomaly to continue .
this legislation will save many scottish lives that would have been lost purely because of the actions of others , and it has our unequivocal support .
ash director deborah arnott scotland is leading the united kingdom in protecting non-smokers from exposure to second-hand smoke at work and play .
but we urge the westminster parliament to bring forward the start of the ban to may 2007 and to set out its plan for implementing the ban with the utmost urgency .
all workers deserve protection from second-hand smoke regardless of their postcode .

the ban will do nothing to improve the health of the nation , but it will give a warm glow to those who enjoy telling others what to do .
the anti-smoking fanatics will use the ban to victimise and stigmatise smokers even further .
they have used abusive and dishonest methods to make smokers feel bad about themselves , even comparing smokers to heroin addicts .

here is reaction to the move .
first minister jack mcconnell scotland will be proud that it has gone smoke-free ahead of any other part of the uk .
the smoking ban is absolutely the right way forward .
it is right for scotland , for our nation 's health , our nation 's economy and our tourist industry .
this country has always been a great place to live , to work , to bring up your children and even just to visit .
today , it just got better .
in the years ahead , people will look back on today as the day that scotland took the largest single step to improve its health for generations .
it is a day for all scots to be proud of our nation .
scotland - the best small country in the world .
health minister andy kerr scotland is now smoke-free .
as well as protecting people from the harmful effects of second-hand smoke , this far-reaching and ambitious step will help many people to give up smoking .
evidence from ireland and new york proves this .
there really has never been a better time to quit .
i know how difficult it is to stop smoking but it is the best decision a smoker can make .
stopping smoking is not only good for the health of the individual but scotland as a whole .
as a smoke-free nation , scotland can look forward to a healthier future .
a future where scots live longer , families stay together longer and our young people are fitter and better prepared to make the most of their ambitions .
it is a future that we can all look forward to and scotland should be proud that it 's leading the way in the uk .
green msp eleanor scott greens have supported the ban all along and believe it is a major step towards improving scotland 's health and a credit to the scottish parliament that it went for the full ban and not some wishy-washy unworkable compromise .
it will give a better social life to those 75 % of people who are non-smokers and who will no longer be exposed to second-hand smoke when they 're out trying to enjoy themselves .
it will protect the health of workers in the premises affected .
it will encourage the 80 % of smokers who want to quit and make quitting easier for them .
it will remove one of the key factors -lrb- " social smoking " -rrb- that starts young people on the road to becoming smokers .
scotland will be cleaner and healthier as a result .
dr peter terry , bma scotland chairman smoke-free legislation is a legacy that scotland has given to its future generations .
this will be remembered as the time scotland took a bold and politically courageous step to improve the health of people in scotland .
for years , scotland 's pubs , restaurants and workplaces have been filled with deadly smoke which has contributed to thousands of deaths from cancer , heart disease and stroke .
let us not forget that this legislation has been put in place to protect the public and employees from the hazards of second-hand smoke .
economic arguments around loss of trade are not proven and raise the question over what value employers place on the health and lives of their employees and customers .
on sunday , scotland clears the air , and in doing so it leads the way for other countries in the uk to follow suit next year .
on behalf of doctors across scotland , i thank the scottish parliament for introducing this legislation that will help save lives which , for too long , have been cut short by the deadly weed that is tobacco .
glasgow gp dr stirling bruce significant progress can only be made to improve health in deprived areas if there is a major cultural shift in attitudes towards smoking .
i believe that this new law will help to enable this change .
throughout my career as a gp i have regularly witnessed the devastation that tobacco brings to families and in years to come i believe we will ask why did this take so long ?
british heart foundation 's david barker sunday 26 march 2006 is a historic day for scotland .
it is extremely encouraging that devolution has allowed such tremendous advances in public health policy to take place , and also to see the scottish parliament and the scottish executive lead the way for the rest of the uk on this crucial issue .
we know that regular exposure to second-hand smoke increases the chances of developing heart disease by about 25 % .
no responsible government could allow such an appalling public health anomaly to continue .
this legislation will save many scottish lives that would have been lost purely because of the actions of others , and it has our unequivocal support .
