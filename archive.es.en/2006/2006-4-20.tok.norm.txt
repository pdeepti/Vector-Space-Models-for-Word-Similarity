why is that ? helmut hirsch : a strengthening of any chain reaction that has begun forms a build-up in these reactors that can not be automatically lowered as it can in most western reactors .
the chain reaction gets stronger and stronger - this is the so-called bubble co-efficient - and in chernobyl 's case , led to the accident .
this is a weakness that has been worked on since the accident and while there have been some improvements , the problem has n't completely been solved .
the rbmk also has other disadvantages .
the pressure pipes that hold the fuel elements and containment weaknesses can become brittle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical failures can also affect modern reactors would you say that rbmk reactors are the most dangerous reactors active today ? i think that is correct .
there is also a very wide consensus that these reactors can not be retrofitted to meet western standards and that they need to be shut down . the vver 440/230 reactors also do not meet western standards .
what are the problems with these ? this is a different type of reactor that is seen as practically impossible to retrofit .
a major problem is that these reactors have practically no containment capability .
if there were an accident where radioactive steam inside such a reactor were released , it would simply escape .
there have been a few retrofittings , but this is really just tinkering and does n't really control the problem .
another problem is that these reactors ' emergency cooling systems are very weak .
there have also been efforts to improve this , but the problem is so serious that retrofitting is practically impossible . can you see a difference with improvements to another type of reactor , the vver 440/213 ? definitely .
the 213 's are the second generation of vver reactors and there were a series of improvements made .
the emergency cooling system is stronger , and they have a better containment structure , although it is still below western standards . the vver 440/213 does not have so-called full-pressure containment , but a containment system dependent on pressure release .
it 's very complicated and prone to breaking down .
there are also reports of material problems in these reactors , and there are problems with safety systems .
in the case of external hazards , for example , the danger that several safety systems fail is especially large .
you could say this type of reactor is clearly better than the first generation , but still has serious weaknesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 20 years , the long-term effects of chernobyl remain unknown the vver 1000 is comparable with western reactors from the 1970s .
does that mean they are safe ? no .
this reactor has full-pressure containment and its layout is comparable with western reactors , so you 'd have to say it is an improvement on the 213 series .
but the vver 1000 also has different problems .
protection from external hazards is considerably worse than modern systems .
there are also reports of material problems in the vver 1000 , especially when looking at the brittleness of the reactor 's pressure container , which is a key component . one specific problem with the vver 1000 is a construction flaw in the reactor building , where containment should be able to take place for some time in the event of an accident .
it is especially prone to melting down from below .
this means that if there is an accident in this type of reactor , the chances of a relatively quick containment malfunction are higher and the release would be larger than you 'd find in a german pressurized-water reactor what role does age play in an atomic reactor 's safety ? the aging process plays a large role and we have to assume that safety will decrease continually after 15 to 25 years of operation due to aging .
this can be partially counteracted when operators make the necessary efforts and replace parts that have aged .
but this does n't apply in every case .
the reactor pressure container , for example , can not be replaced .
this kind of aging management system is also complicated and expensive and there are some doubts as to whether the necessary measures are being taken , especially in eastern europe . after how many years do you think a reactor should be closed ? a running time of about 30 years is the maximum , after that there is a clear deterioration in the level of safety .
the risks also increase .
i 'd say between 25 and 30 years would be a general guide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hirsch said nuclear power plants should be closed after 30 years what other risks have to be considered when evaluating nuclear reactors ? every type of reactor operating today poses a threat of a catastrophic accident with a major release of radioactivity .
the likelihood is especially high in eastern europe 's old reactors , but technical failure or external influences - like natural earthquakes and floods or malicious acts by humans - pose a danger to even the most modern reactors . what should be done to increase security ? i think there are a lot of reasons for the long-term phasing out of atomic energy .
on the one hand nuclear power plants are vulnerable , and they can cause serious problems should a radioactive release occur .
on the other hand , nuclear technology is of military importance , which does not necessarily help achieve peaceful development on an international political level .
i think for those reasons , phasing out of nuclear energy is the best course of action . in the long-term , the only energy policy that actually meets the standards required for the survival of humanity will be based on renewable energy sources and a more rational use of energy . christine harjes interviewed helmut hirsch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 20.04.2006 song and dance : unesco protects living heritage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's famous schäfflertanz could be a candidate for un protection unesco 's world heritage program is known for protecting buildings or places such as cologne 's cathedral or the rhine river valley .
but a new convention has taken effect to safeguard intangible heritage as well . a new convention passed by the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organisation -lrb- unesco -rrb- went into effect on thursday to protect cultural heritage .
but unlike the numerous world heritage sites around the globe , the things listed in the convention on safeguarding intangible heritage will not be made of brick , stone or wood .
ratified by 30 nations since it was passed in october 2003 , the convention is intended to keep more fleeting elements of culture - folk songs , traditional costumes and dances , handcrafts and languages - from disappearing all together .
“ the main purpose is to support cultural diversity around the world , ” said dieter offenhäuser , press spokesman for germany ’ s unesco commission .
“ many developing nations do not have much in the way of material heritage , like historical buildings or monuments , and so on .
their cultures are determined by oral history and things like music , traditional dances and languages spoken by only a few people .
through the unesco program , this kind of intangible heritage will become known worldwide . ”
so far , there are 43 items on the unesco list - including everything from theatre and art to rituals and social practices , like bark-cloth making in uganda or the palestinian storytelling tradition , hikaye .
germany has yet to ratify in germany , however , the intangible heritage convention has yet to be ratified .
offenhäuser said that germany 's plethora of traditions and its federal system of cultural ministries may have stalled ratification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carnival traditions would be a likely candidate " we first need to evaluate whether there is a real necessity in germany to protect cultural heritage through the unesco convention , " offenhäuser said .
" and then there is the question of eligibility .
take the three big carnival traditions , for example : the cologne , the allemanic , and the rhineland-palatinate carnival .
they are all important to tradition , very much alive , and all different . "
marie-theres albert , professor of world heritage studies at the technical university in cottbus disagrees that the number of potential candidates should keep germany from upholding the convention .
" we need to establish guidelines and criteria , " albert said .
" there are many german traditions and customs from ethnic groups that have become part of german society which are just as important culturally as the dozens of physical world heritage sites .

but a new convention has taken effect to safeguard intangible heritage as well . a new convention passed by the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organisation -lrb- unesco -rrb- went into effect on thursday to protect cultural heritage .
but unlike the numerous world heritage sites around the globe , the things listed in the convention on safeguarding intangible heritage will not be made of brick , stone or wood .
ratified by 30 nations since it was passed in october 2003 , the convention is intended to keep more fleeting elements of culture - folk songs , traditional costumes and dances , handcrafts and languages - from disappearing all together .
“ the main purpose is to support cultural diversity around the world , ” said dieter offenhäuser , press spokesman for germany ’ s unesco commission .
“ many developing nations do not have much in the way of material heritage , like historical buildings or monuments , and so on .
their cultures are determined by oral history and things like music , traditional dances and languages spoken by only a few people .
through the unesco program , this kind of intangible heritage will become known worldwide . ”
so far , there are 43 items on the unesco list - including everything from theatre and art to rituals and social practices , like bark-cloth making in uganda or the palestinian storytelling tradition , hikaye .
germany has yet to ratify in germany , however , the intangible heritage convention has yet to be ratified .
offenhäuser said that germany 's plethora of traditions and its federal system of cultural ministries may have stalled ratification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carnival traditions would be a likely candidate " we first need to evaluate whether there is a real necessity in germany to protect cultural heritage through the unesco convention , " offenhäuser said .
" and then there is the question of eligibility .
take the three big carnival traditions , for example : the cologne , the allemanic , and the rhineland-palatinate carnival .
they are all important to tradition , very much alive , and all different . "
marie-theres albert , professor of world heritage studies at the technical university in cottbus disagrees that the number of potential candidates should keep germany from upholding the convention .
" we need to establish guidelines and criteria , " albert said .
" there are many german traditions and customs from ethnic groups that have become part of german society which are just as important culturally as the dozens of physical world heritage sites .

but a new convention has taken effect to safeguard intangible heritage as well . a new convention passed by the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organisation -lrb- unesco -rrb- went into effect on thursday to protect cultural heritage .
but unlike the numerous world heritage sites around the globe , the things listed in the convention on safeguarding intangible heritage will not be made of brick , stone or wood .
ratified by 30 nations since it was passed in october 2003 , the convention is intended to keep more fleeting elements of culture - folk songs , traditional costumes and dances , handcrafts and languages - from disappearing all together .
“ the main purpose is to support cultural diversity around the world , ” said dieter offenhäuser , press spokesman for germany ’ s unesco commission .
“ many developing nations do not have much in the way of material heritage , like historical buildings or monuments , and so on .
their cultures are determined by oral history and things like music , traditional dances and languages spoken by only a few people .
through the unesco program , this kind of intangible heritage will become known worldwide . ”
so far , there are 43 items on the unesco list - including everything from theatre and art to rituals and social practices , like bark-cloth making in uganda or the palestinian storytelling tradition , hikaye .
germany has yet to ratify in germany , however , the intangible heritage convention has yet to be ratified .
offenhäuser said that germany 's plethora of traditions and its federal system of cultural ministries may have stalled ratification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carnival traditions would be a likely candidate " we first need to evaluate whether there is a real necessity in germany to protect cultural heritage through the unesco convention , " offenhäuser said .
" and then there is the question of eligibility .
take the three big carnival traditions , for example : the cologne , the allemanic , and the rhineland-palatinate carnival .
they are all important to tradition , very much alive , and all different . "
marie-theres albert , professor of world heritage studies at the technical university in cottbus disagrees that the number of potential candidates should keep germany from upholding the convention .
" we need to establish guidelines and criteria , " albert said .
" there are many german traditions and customs from ethnic groups that have become part of german society which are just as important culturally as the dozens of physical world heritage sites .
as long as the customs continue to develop , without becoming tourist events or folklore , they should be protected . "
minority report ? there are four official minority groups in germany : the sorbs in lusatia near the polish and czech borders , the danish and frisian germans in the north of the country and the sinti / roma .
all of these groups receive governmental subsidies to uphold their languages and culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sorbs in traditional garb last year , the federal government and the states of brandenburg and saxony spent over 16 million euros -lrb- $ 19.8 million -rrb- on sorbian cultural interests such as bilingual sorbian kindergartens and school language programs , a theatre company and other sorbian institutions .
but this year , the government has already announced 500,000 euros in funding cuts .
sorbian officials fear even more to come during budget renegotiations in 2007 . should the german government ratify the unesco convention to safeguard intangible cultural heritage , it will have to decide how to fund what it intends to protect .
this may bring a kind of insurance for minority cultures like the sorbs .
but it could also bring other more " mainstream " cultural candidates to the table .
and that might mean even less of the shrinking pie of art and cultural subsidies for everyone . kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's struggling ethnic minority on a modest stretch of land in germany 's east saxony and south brandenburg regions , a tiny slavonic nation continues to fight its corner for cultural recognition and " sorb " survival .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.04.2006 " every type of reactor poses a threat " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phasing out atomic energy is the best course of action , according to hirsch the remaining soviet-era chernobyl-type nuclear reactors are especially dangerous but are n't the only risk when it comes to atomic power plants , helmut hirsch , physicist and consultant on nuclear safety told dw-world.de. dr. helmut hirsch is a physicist and scientific consultant for nuclear safety for a number of organizations including the austrian federal government and the environment ministry . dw-world.de : since the accident 20 years ago , it seems clear that the chernobyl-type rbmk reactors are especially dangerous .
why is that ? helmut hirsch : a strengthening of any chain reaction that has begun forms a build-up in these reactors that can not be automatically lowered as it can in most western reactors .
the chain reaction gets stronger and stronger - this is the so-called bubble co-efficient - and in chernobyl 's case , led to the accident .
this is a weakness that has been worked on since the accident and while there have been some improvements , the problem has n't completely been solved .
the rbmk also has other disadvantages .
the pressure pipes that hold the fuel elements and containment weaknesses can become brittle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical failures can also affect modern reactors would you say that rbmk reactors are the most dangerous reactors active today ? i think that is correct .
there is also a very wide consensus that these reactors can not be retrofitted to meet western standards and that they need to be shut down . the vver 440/230 reactors also do not meet western standards .
what are the problems with these ? this is a different type of reactor that is seen as practically impossible to retrofit .
a major problem is that these reactors have practically no containment capability .
if there were an accident where radioactive steam inside such a reactor were released , it would simply escape .
there have been a few retrofittings , but this is really just tinkering and does n't really control the problem .
another problem is that these reactors ' emergency cooling systems are very weak .
there have also been efforts to improve this , but the problem is so serious that retrofitting is practically impossible . can you see a difference with improvements to another type of reactor , the vver 440/213 ? definitely .
the 213 's are the second generation of vver reactors and there were a series of improvements made .
the emergency cooling system is stronger , and they have a better containment structure , although it is still below western standards . the vver 440/213 does not have so-called full-pressure containment , but a containment system dependent on pressure release .
it 's very complicated and prone to breaking down .
there are also reports of material problems in these reactors , and there are problems with safety systems .
in the case of external hazards , for example , the danger that several safety systems fail is especially large .
you could say this type of reactor is clearly better than the first generation , but still has serious weaknesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 20 years , the long-term effects of chernobyl remain unknown the vver 1000 is comparable with western reactors from the 1970s .
does that mean they are safe ? no .
this reactor has full-pressure containment and its layout is comparable with western reactors , so you 'd have to say it is an improvement on the 213 series .
but the vver 1000 also has different problems .
protection from external hazards is considerably worse than modern systems .
there are also reports of material problems in the vver 1000 , especially when looking at the brittleness of the reactor 's pressure container , which is a key component . one specific problem with the vver 1000 is a construction flaw in the reactor building , where containment should be able to take place for some time in the event of an accident .
it is especially prone to melting down from below .
this means that if there is an accident in this type of reactor , the chances of a relatively quick containment malfunction are higher and the release would be larger than you 'd find in a german pressurized-water reactor what role does age play in an atomic reactor 's safety ? the aging process plays a large role and we have to assume that safety will decrease continually after 15 to 25 years of operation due to aging .
this can be partially counteracted when operators make the necessary efforts and replace parts that have aged .
but this does n't apply in every case .
the reactor pressure container , for example , can not be replaced .
this kind of aging management system is also complicated and expensive and there are some doubts as to whether the necessary measures are being taken , especially in eastern europe . after how many years do you think a reactor should be closed ? a running time of about 30 years is the maximum , after that there is a clear deterioration in the level of safety .
the risks also increase .
i 'd say between 25 and 30 years would be a general guide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hirsch said nuclear power plants should be closed after 30 years what other risks have to be considered when evaluating nuclear reactors ? every type of reactor operating today poses a threat of a catastrophic accident with a major release of radioactivity .
the likelihood is especially high in eastern europe 's old reactors , but technical failure or external influences - like natural earthquakes and floods or malicious acts by humans - pose a danger to even the most modern reactors . what should be done to increase security ? i think there are a lot of reasons for the long-term phasing out of atomic energy .
on the one hand nuclear power plants are vulnerable , and they can cause serious problems should a radioactive release occur .
on the other hand , nuclear technology is of military importance , which does not necessarily help achieve peaceful development on an international political level .
i think for those reasons , phasing out of nuclear energy is the best course of action . in the long-term , the only energy policy that actually meets the standards required for the survival of humanity will be based on renewable energy sources and a more rational use of energy . christine harjes interviewed helmut hirsch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .
the number of victims will far surpass official figures , it said .

why is that ? helmut hirsch : a strengthening of any chain reaction that has begun forms a build-up in these reactors that can not be automatically lowered as it can in most western reactors .
the chain reaction gets stronger and stronger - this is the so-called bubble co-efficient - and in chernobyl 's case , led to the accident .
this is a weakness that has been worked on since the accident and while there have been some improvements , the problem has n't completely been solved .
the rbmk also has other disadvantages .
the pressure pipes that hold the fuel elements and containment weaknesses can become brittle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical failures can also affect modern reactors would you say that rbmk reactors are the most dangerous reactors active today ? i think that is correct .
there is also a very wide consensus that these reactors can not be retrofitted to meet western standards and that they need to be shut down . the vver 440/230 reactors also do not meet western standards .
what are the problems with these ? this is a different type of reactor that is seen as practically impossible to retrofit .
a major problem is that these reactors have practically no containment capability .
if there were an accident where radioactive steam inside such a reactor were released , it would simply escape .
there have been a few retrofittings , but this is really just tinkering and does n't really control the problem .
another problem is that these reactors ' emergency cooling systems are very weak .
there have also been efforts to improve this , but the problem is so serious that retrofitting is practically impossible . can you see a difference with improvements to another type of reactor , the vver 440/213 ? definitely .
the 213 's are the second generation of vver reactors and there were a series of improvements made .
the emergency cooling system is stronger , and they have a better containment structure , although it is still below western standards . the vver 440/213 does not have so-called full-pressure containment , but a containment system dependent on pressure release .
it 's very complicated and prone to breaking down .
there are also reports of material problems in these reactors , and there are problems with safety systems .
in the case of external hazards , for example , the danger that several safety systems fail is especially large .
you could say this type of reactor is clearly better than the first generation , but still has serious weaknesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 20 years , the long-term effects of chernobyl remain unknown the vver 1000 is comparable with western reactors from the 1970s .
does that mean they are safe ? no .
this reactor has full-pressure containment and its layout is comparable with western reactors , so you 'd have to say it is an improvement on the 213 series .
but the vver 1000 also has different problems .
protection from external hazards is considerably worse than modern systems .
there are also reports of material problems in the vver 1000 , especially when looking at the brittleness of the reactor 's pressure container , which is a key component . one specific problem with the vver 1000 is a construction flaw in the reactor building , where containment should be able to take place for some time in the event of an accident .
it is especially prone to melting down from below .
this means that if there is an accident in this type of reactor , the chances of a relatively quick containment malfunction are higher and the release would be larger than you 'd find in a german pressurized-water reactor what role does age play in an atomic reactor 's safety ? the aging process plays a large role and we have to assume that safety will decrease continually after 15 to 25 years of operation due to aging .
this can be partially counteracted when operators make the necessary efforts and replace parts that have aged .
but this does n't apply in every case .
the reactor pressure container , for example , can not be replaced .
this kind of aging management system is also complicated and expensive and there are some doubts as to whether the necessary measures are being taken , especially in eastern europe . after how many years do you think a reactor should be closed ? a running time of about 30 years is the maximum , after that there is a clear deterioration in the level of safety .
the risks also increase .
i 'd say between 25 and 30 years would be a general guide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hirsch said nuclear power plants should be closed after 30 years what other risks have to be considered when evaluating nuclear reactors ? every type of reactor operating today poses a threat of a catastrophic accident with a major release of radioactivity .
the likelihood is especially high in eastern europe 's old reactors , but technical failure or external influences - like natural earthquakes and floods or malicious acts by humans - pose a danger to even the most modern reactors . what should be done to increase security ? i think there are a lot of reasons for the long-term phasing out of atomic energy .
on the one hand nuclear power plants are vulnerable , and they can cause serious problems should a radioactive release occur .
on the other hand , nuclear technology is of military importance , which does not necessarily help achieve peaceful development on an international political level .
i think for those reasons , phasing out of nuclear energy is the best course of action . in the long-term , the only energy policy that actually meets the standards required for the survival of humanity will be based on renewable energy sources and a more rational use of energy . christine harjes interviewed helmut hirsch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 20.04.2006 trash art litters cologne großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " cologne people " next to the cathedral some say german artist ha schult likes to provoke .
he retorts that artists are society ’ s litmus test .
provocative or not , his trash people are relics of a distinctly human byproduct : garbage . " one man 's trash is another man 's treasure . "
artist ha schult takes that adage to the limit : he 's installed 1,000 figures made of debris in front of one of the world 's cultural treasures : the cologne cathedral .
" i started creating this kind of art long before it became fashionable , " schult told dw-world.de.
" back in the 1960s , i organized fashion shows atop trash depots to draw attention to our planet ’ s environmental imbalance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist ha schult trash people are life-size figures the artist began making in 1996 from rubbish collected at the municipal depot in cologne , the city where schult lives and works .
the figures ' faces are molded from tin cans , their chests constructed from computers , their limbs shaped from crushed plastic - all carefully formed into sculptures intended to remind people of the waste they constantly produce .
schult needed 30 assistants for over six months to help him create the figures .
they began with cleaning the rubbish ; the stench would have otherwise been unbearable .
grandiose venues for a pressing message ha schult does not lack modesty when it comes to his artistic vision .
" i told politicians long ago that the subject of the environment would make or break future elections , " schult said .
" we artists are the litmus test of society .
people can gain a sense of the state of society by looking at the works artists are producing .
the freedom of a society is measured by the freedom of its art . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash people near the matterhorn , switzerland schult 's monumental statements parallel his exhibition locations .
his trash people have been installed at some of the greatest sites in the world : on china 's great wall , near the egyptian pyramids , on moscow 's red square , at switzerland 's matterhorn mountain , at the grand place in brussels and la grande arche in paris .
cultural differences " in russia - where nuclear fuel rods are thrown into people 's backyards , people deal with trash and ecological imbalances differently than here in germany , " schult told dw-world.de.
" the swiss are a complete contrast to the egyptians , who just throw debris into a pit and let the poorest of society pick through it .
then they fill it up with sand and build a hilton hotel or kentucky fried chicken on top , " schult said .
but consciousness-raising and altruism toward mother earth were not the only reasons for bringing the show to cologne .
in brussels , the installation drew 1 million visitors , who also emptied their pockets in the city 's stores .
cologne - home to a world-renowned gothic cathedral - hopes the trash people , renamed " cologne people " for the occasion , will have a similar effect .
" it 's an appealing installation that parallels our attempts to beautify the cathedral plaza - out with the unsightly and in with art , " cologne mayor fritz schramma said .
apparently , the cologne people are not unsightly , even if they are composed of garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash people enjoying the view at the great wall of china the sculptures will also be fenced in and guarded in cologne - unlike in egypt , paris , china , or the matterhorn , " where hikers were just too tired to vandalize . "
so rather than walking freely among the cologne people , viewers will be guided through the installation .
alternatively , they can book a 50 euro -lrb- $ 61 -rrb- tour and spend a sunday afternoon with the artist .
there 's even a deluxe trash package for only 160 euros which includes breakfast , cocktails and dinner .
what more could trash-seekers ask for ?
the trash people , after all , have become valuable .
back in 1996 , schult paid the cologne dump 80,000 german marks -lrb- 41,000 euros -rrb- for rubbish to make 1,000 figures .
half of those have been sold and replaced by new ones , which currently sell for 6,000 euros .
doctors and dentists like to put them in their waiting rooms , schult said .
the sales fund the trash people 's journeys throughout the world .
with all the travel , the figures sometimes need a repair or two , or a good vacuum-cleaning .
" you should have seen them when they got back from the sahara .
there was sand in every crevice of their bodies ! "
schult quipped .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things can get dusty in the desert the trash people are on show in cologne from april 21 to may 1 , 2006 , after which they head to new york city and santiago de chile .
the antarctic will be their final station , after which schult says he will divide up the figures and give them to three different german cities . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de joseph beuys - artist who expanded art 's boundaries joseph beuys is considered one of the most important and controversial artists of the second half of the 20th century .
always on the cutting edge , beuys thought artists had a central role to play in society .

a few cans of paint .
a wall .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 20.04.2006 song and dance : unesco protects living heritage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's famous schäfflertanz could be a candidate for un protection unesco 's world heritage program is known for protecting buildings or places such as cologne 's cathedral or the rhine river valley .
but a new convention has taken effect to safeguard intangible heritage as well . a new convention passed by the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organisation -lrb- unesco -rrb- went into effect on thursday to protect cultural heritage .
but unlike the numerous world heritage sites around the globe , the things listed in the convention on safeguarding intangible heritage will not be made of brick , stone or wood .
ratified by 30 nations since it was passed in october 2003 , the convention is intended to keep more fleeting elements of culture - folk songs , traditional costumes and dances , handcrafts and languages - from disappearing all together .
“ the main purpose is to support cultural diversity around the world , ” said dieter offenhäuser , press spokesman for germany ’ s unesco commission .
“ many developing nations do not have much in the way of material heritage , like historical buildings or monuments , and so on .
their cultures are determined by oral history and things like music , traditional dances and languages spoken by only a few people .
through the unesco program , this kind of intangible heritage will become known worldwide . ”
so far , there are 43 items on the unesco list - including everything from theatre and art to rituals and social practices , like bark-cloth making in uganda or the palestinian storytelling tradition , hikaye .
germany has yet to ratify in germany , however , the intangible heritage convention has yet to be ratified .
offenhäuser said that germany 's plethora of traditions and its federal system of cultural ministries may have stalled ratification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carnival traditions would be a likely candidate " we first need to evaluate whether there is a real necessity in germany to protect cultural heritage through the unesco convention , " offenhäuser said .
" and then there is the question of eligibility .
take the three big carnival traditions , for example : the cologne , the allemanic , and the rhineland-palatinate carnival .
they are all important to tradition , very much alive , and all different . "
marie-theres albert , professor of world heritage studies at the technical university in cottbus disagrees that the number of potential candidates should keep germany from upholding the convention .
" we need to establish guidelines and criteria , " albert said .
" there are many german traditions and customs from ethnic groups that have become part of german society which are just as important culturally as the dozens of physical world heritage sites .

minority report ? there are four official minority groups in germany : the sorbs in lusatia near the polish and czech borders , the danish and frisian germans in the north of the country and the sinti / roma .
all of these groups receive governmental subsidies to uphold their languages and culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sorbs in traditional garb last year , the federal government and the states of brandenburg and saxony spent over 16 million euros -lrb- $ 19.8 million -rrb- on sorbian cultural interests such as bilingual sorbian kindergartens and school language programs , a theatre company and other sorbian institutions .
but this year , the government has already announced 500,000 euros in funding cuts .
sorbian officials fear even more to come during budget renegotiations in 2007 . should the german government ratify the unesco convention to safeguard intangible cultural heritage , it will have to decide how to fund what it intends to protect .
this may bring a kind of insurance for minority cultures like the sorbs .
but it could also bring other more " mainstream " cultural candidates to the table .

why is that ? helmut hirsch : a strengthening of any chain reaction that has begun forms a build-up in these reactors that can not be automatically lowered as it can in most western reactors .
the chain reaction gets stronger and stronger - this is the so-called bubble co-efficient - and in chernobyl 's case , led to the accident .
this is a weakness that has been worked on since the accident and while there have been some improvements , the problem has n't completely been solved .
the rbmk also has other disadvantages .
the pressure pipes that hold the fuel elements and containment weaknesses can become brittle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical failures can also affect modern reactors would you say that rbmk reactors are the most dangerous reactors active today ? i think that is correct .
there is also a very wide consensus that these reactors can not be retrofitted to meet western standards and that they need to be shut down . the vver 440/230 reactors also do not meet western standards .
what are the problems with these ? this is a different type of reactor that is seen as practically impossible to retrofit .
a major problem is that these reactors have practically no containment capability .
if there were an accident where radioactive steam inside such a reactor were released , it would simply escape .
there have been a few retrofittings , but this is really just tinkering and does n't really control the problem .
another problem is that these reactors ' emergency cooling systems are very weak .
there have also been efforts to improve this , but the problem is so serious that retrofitting is practically impossible . can you see a difference with improvements to another type of reactor , the vver 440/213 ? definitely .
the 213 's are the second generation of vver reactors and there were a series of improvements made .
the emergency cooling system is stronger , and they have a better containment structure , although it is still below western standards . the vver 440/213 does not have so-called full-pressure containment , but a containment system dependent on pressure release .
it 's very complicated and prone to breaking down .
there are also reports of material problems in these reactors , and there are problems with safety systems .
in the case of external hazards , for example , the danger that several safety systems fail is especially large .
you could say this type of reactor is clearly better than the first generation , but still has serious weaknesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 20 years , the long-term effects of chernobyl remain unknown the vver 1000 is comparable with western reactors from the 1970s .
does that mean they are safe ? no .
this reactor has full-pressure containment and its layout is comparable with western reactors , so you 'd have to say it is an improvement on the 213 series .
but the vver 1000 also has different problems .
protection from external hazards is considerably worse than modern systems .
there are also reports of material problems in the vver 1000 , especially when looking at the brittleness of the reactor 's pressure container , which is a key component . one specific problem with the vver 1000 is a construction flaw in the reactor building , where containment should be able to take place for some time in the event of an accident .
it is especially prone to melting down from below .
this means that if there is an accident in this type of reactor , the chances of a relatively quick containment malfunction are higher and the release would be larger than you 'd find in a german pressurized-water reactor what role does age play in an atomic reactor 's safety ? the aging process plays a large role and we have to assume that safety will decrease continually after 15 to 25 years of operation due to aging .
this can be partially counteracted when operators make the necessary efforts and replace parts that have aged .
but this does n't apply in every case .
the reactor pressure container , for example , can not be replaced .
this kind of aging management system is also complicated and expensive and there are some doubts as to whether the necessary measures are being taken , especially in eastern europe . after how many years do you think a reactor should be closed ? a running time of about 30 years is the maximum , after that there is a clear deterioration in the level of safety .
the risks also increase .
i 'd say between 25 and 30 years would be a general guide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hirsch said nuclear power plants should be closed after 30 years what other risks have to be considered when evaluating nuclear reactors ? every type of reactor operating today poses a threat of a catastrophic accident with a major release of radioactivity .
the likelihood is especially high in eastern europe 's old reactors , but technical failure or external influences - like natural earthquakes and floods or malicious acts by humans - pose a danger to even the most modern reactors . what should be done to increase security ? i think there are a lot of reasons for the long-term phasing out of atomic energy .
on the one hand nuclear power plants are vulnerable , and they can cause serious problems should a radioactive release occur .
on the other hand , nuclear technology is of military importance , which does not necessarily help achieve peaceful development on an international political level .
i think for those reasons , phasing out of nuclear energy is the best course of action . in the long-term , the only energy policy that actually meets the standards required for the survival of humanity will be based on renewable energy sources and a more rational use of energy . christine harjes interviewed helmut hirsch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .

police are still searching for leads as ermyas r. fights for his life in hospital . merkel condemned the attack as " abominable and inhuman , " government spokesman thomas steg said wednesday evening .
she wanted to make sure the government 's program against right-wing extremism would continue , steg said . police in potsdam , in the eastern state of brandenburg , have been collecting information volunteered by members of the population after a recording of the attackers was made public .
but they do n't yet have any hot leads , brandenburg interior minister jörg schönbohm said on wednesday . the two men 's voices were recorded on the telephone mailbox of ermyas r.

she said the delegation had decided to stay in berlin instead . police investigators on the case in potsdam , whose numbers have been increased from 12 to 25 , are reportedly focusing on numerous young people who were seen near the scene of the crime shortly before ermyas r. was attacked .

but a new convention has taken effect to safeguard intangible heritage as well . a new convention passed by the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organisation -lrb- unesco -rrb- went into effect on thursday to protect cultural heritage .
but unlike the numerous world heritage sites around the globe , the things listed in the convention on safeguarding intangible heritage will not be made of brick , stone or wood .
ratified by 30 nations since it was passed in october 2003 , the convention is intended to keep more fleeting elements of culture - folk songs , traditional costumes and dances , handcrafts and languages - from disappearing all together .
“ the main purpose is to support cultural diversity around the world , ” said dieter offenhäuser , press spokesman for germany ’ s unesco commission .
“ many developing nations do not have much in the way of material heritage , like historical buildings or monuments , and so on .
their cultures are determined by oral history and things like music , traditional dances and languages spoken by only a few people .
through the unesco program , this kind of intangible heritage will become known worldwide . ”
so far , there are 43 items on the unesco list - including everything from theatre and art to rituals and social practices , like bark-cloth making in uganda or the palestinian storytelling tradition , hikaye .
germany has yet to ratify in germany , however , the intangible heritage convention has yet to be ratified .
offenhäuser said that germany 's plethora of traditions and its federal system of cultural ministries may have stalled ratification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carnival traditions would be a likely candidate " we first need to evaluate whether there is a real necessity in germany to protect cultural heritage through the unesco convention , " offenhäuser said .
" and then there is the question of eligibility .
take the three big carnival traditions , for example : the cologne , the allemanic , and the rhineland-palatinate carnival .
they are all important to tradition , very much alive , and all different . "
marie-theres albert , professor of world heritage studies at the technical university in cottbus disagrees that the number of potential candidates should keep germany from upholding the convention .
" we need to establish guidelines and criteria , " albert said .
" there are many german traditions and customs from ethnic groups that have become part of german society which are just as important culturally as the dozens of physical world heritage sites .
as long as the customs continue to develop , without becoming tourist events or folklore , they should be protected . "
minority report ? there are four official minority groups in germany : the sorbs in lusatia near the polish and czech borders , the danish and frisian germans in the north of the country and the sinti / roma .
all of these groups receive governmental subsidies to uphold their languages and culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sorbs in traditional garb last year , the federal government and the states of brandenburg and saxony spent over 16 million euros -lrb- $ 19.8 million -rrb- on sorbian cultural interests such as bilingual sorbian kindergartens and school language programs , a theatre company and other sorbian institutions .
but this year , the government has already announced 500,000 euros in funding cuts .
sorbian officials fear even more to come during budget renegotiations in 2007 . should the german government ratify the unesco convention to safeguard intangible cultural heritage , it will have to decide how to fund what it intends to protect .
this may bring a kind of insurance for minority cultures like the sorbs .
but it could also bring other more " mainstream " cultural candidates to the table .
and that might mean even less of the shrinking pie of art and cultural subsidies for everyone . kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's struggling ethnic minority on a modest stretch of land in germany 's east saxony and south brandenburg regions , a tiny slavonic nation continues to fight its corner for cultural recognition and " sorb " survival .

but a new convention has taken effect to safeguard intangible heritage as well . a new convention passed by the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organisation -lrb- unesco -rrb- went into effect on thursday to protect cultural heritage .
but unlike the numerous world heritage sites around the globe , the things listed in the convention on safeguarding intangible heritage will not be made of brick , stone or wood .
ratified by 30 nations since it was passed in october 2003 , the convention is intended to keep more fleeting elements of culture - folk songs , traditional costumes and dances , handcrafts and languages - from disappearing all together .
“ the main purpose is to support cultural diversity around the world , ” said dieter offenhäuser , press spokesman for germany ’ s unesco commission .
“ many developing nations do not have much in the way of material heritage , like historical buildings or monuments , and so on .
their cultures are determined by oral history and things like music , traditional dances and languages spoken by only a few people .
through the unesco program , this kind of intangible heritage will become known worldwide . ”
so far , there are 43 items on the unesco list - including everything from theatre and art to rituals and social practices , like bark-cloth making in uganda or the palestinian storytelling tradition , hikaye .
germany has yet to ratify in germany , however , the intangible heritage convention has yet to be ratified .
offenhäuser said that germany 's plethora of traditions and its federal system of cultural ministries may have stalled ratification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carnival traditions would be a likely candidate " we first need to evaluate whether there is a real necessity in germany to protect cultural heritage through the unesco convention , " offenhäuser said .
" and then there is the question of eligibility .
take the three big carnival traditions , for example : the cologne , the allemanic , and the rhineland-palatinate carnival .
they are all important to tradition , very much alive , and all different . "
marie-theres albert , professor of world heritage studies at the technical university in cottbus disagrees that the number of potential candidates should keep germany from upholding the convention .
" we need to establish guidelines and criteria , " albert said .
" there are many german traditions and customs from ethnic groups that have become part of german society which are just as important culturally as the dozens of physical world heritage sites .
as long as the customs continue to develop , without becoming tourist events or folklore , they should be protected . "
minority report ? there are four official minority groups in germany : the sorbs in lusatia near the polish and czech borders , the danish and frisian germans in the north of the country and the sinti / roma .
all of these groups receive governmental subsidies to uphold their languages and culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sorbs in traditional garb last year , the federal government and the states of brandenburg and saxony spent over 16 million euros -lrb- $ 19.8 million -rrb- on sorbian cultural interests such as bilingual sorbian kindergartens and school language programs , a theatre company and other sorbian institutions .
but this year , the government has already announced 500,000 euros in funding cuts .
sorbian officials fear even more to come during budget renegotiations in 2007 . should the german government ratify the unesco convention to safeguard intangible cultural heritage , it will have to decide how to fund what it intends to protect .
this may bring a kind of insurance for minority cultures like the sorbs .
but it could also bring other more " mainstream " cultural candidates to the table .
and that might mean even less of the shrinking pie of art and cultural subsidies for everyone . kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's struggling ethnic minority on a modest stretch of land in germany 's east saxony and south brandenburg regions , a tiny slavonic nation continues to fight its corner for cultural recognition and " sorb " survival .

why is that ? helmut hirsch : a strengthening of any chain reaction that has begun forms a build-up in these reactors that can not be automatically lowered as it can in most western reactors .
the chain reaction gets stronger and stronger - this is the so-called bubble co-efficient - and in chernobyl 's case , led to the accident .
this is a weakness that has been worked on since the accident and while there have been some improvements , the problem has n't completely been solved .
the rbmk also has other disadvantages .
the pressure pipes that hold the fuel elements and containment weaknesses can become brittle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical failures can also affect modern reactors would you say that rbmk reactors are the most dangerous reactors active today ? i think that is correct .
there is also a very wide consensus that these reactors can not be retrofitted to meet western standards and that they need to be shut down . the vver 440/230 reactors also do not meet western standards .
what are the problems with these ? this is a different type of reactor that is seen as practically impossible to retrofit .
a major problem is that these reactors have practically no containment capability .
if there were an accident where radioactive steam inside such a reactor were released , it would simply escape .
there have been a few retrofittings , but this is really just tinkering and does n't really control the problem .
another problem is that these reactors ' emergency cooling systems are very weak .
there have also been efforts to improve this , but the problem is so serious that retrofitting is practically impossible . can you see a difference with improvements to another type of reactor , the vver 440/213 ? definitely .
the 213 's are the second generation of vver reactors and there were a series of improvements made .
the emergency cooling system is stronger , and they have a better containment structure , although it is still below western standards . the vver 440/213 does not have so-called full-pressure containment , but a containment system dependent on pressure release .
it 's very complicated and prone to breaking down .
there are also reports of material problems in these reactors , and there are problems with safety systems .
in the case of external hazards , for example , the danger that several safety systems fail is especially large .
you could say this type of reactor is clearly better than the first generation , but still has serious weaknesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 20 years , the long-term effects of chernobyl remain unknown the vver 1000 is comparable with western reactors from the 1970s .
does that mean they are safe ? no .
this reactor has full-pressure containment and its layout is comparable with western reactors , so you 'd have to say it is an improvement on the 213 series .
but the vver 1000 also has different problems .
protection from external hazards is considerably worse than modern systems .
there are also reports of material problems in the vver 1000 , especially when looking at the brittleness of the reactor 's pressure container , which is a key component . one specific problem with the vver 1000 is a construction flaw in the reactor building , where containment should be able to take place for some time in the event of an accident .
it is especially prone to melting down from below .
this means that if there is an accident in this type of reactor , the chances of a relatively quick containment malfunction are higher and the release would be larger than you 'd find in a german pressurized-water reactor what role does age play in an atomic reactor 's safety ? the aging process plays a large role and we have to assume that safety will decrease continually after 15 to 25 years of operation due to aging .
this can be partially counteracted when operators make the necessary efforts and replace parts that have aged .
but this does n't apply in every case .
the reactor pressure container , for example , can not be replaced .
this kind of aging management system is also complicated and expensive and there are some doubts as to whether the necessary measures are being taken , especially in eastern europe . after how many years do you think a reactor should be closed ? a running time of about 30 years is the maximum , after that there is a clear deterioration in the level of safety .
the risks also increase .
i 'd say between 25 and 30 years would be a general guide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hirsch said nuclear power plants should be closed after 30 years what other risks have to be considered when evaluating nuclear reactors ? every type of reactor operating today poses a threat of a catastrophic accident with a major release of radioactivity .
the likelihood is especially high in eastern europe 's old reactors , but technical failure or external influences - like natural earthquakes and floods or malicious acts by humans - pose a danger to even the most modern reactors . what should be done to increase security ? i think there are a lot of reasons for the long-term phasing out of atomic energy .
on the one hand nuclear power plants are vulnerable , and they can cause serious problems should a radioactive release occur .
on the other hand , nuclear technology is of military importance , which does not necessarily help achieve peaceful development on an international political level .
i think for those reasons , phasing out of nuclear energy is the best course of action . in the long-term , the only energy policy that actually meets the standards required for the survival of humanity will be based on renewable energy sources and a more rational use of energy . christine harjes interviewed helmut hirsch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .

why is that ? helmut hirsch : a strengthening of any chain reaction that has begun forms a build-up in these reactors that can not be automatically lowered as it can in most western reactors .
the chain reaction gets stronger and stronger - this is the so-called bubble co-efficient - and in chernobyl 's case , led to the accident .
this is a weakness that has been worked on since the accident and while there have been some improvements , the problem has n't completely been solved .
the rbmk also has other disadvantages .
the pressure pipes that hold the fuel elements and containment weaknesses can become brittle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical failures can also affect modern reactors would you say that rbmk reactors are the most dangerous reactors active today ? i think that is correct .
there is also a very wide consensus that these reactors can not be retrofitted to meet western standards and that they need to be shut down . the vver 440/230 reactors also do not meet western standards .
what are the problems with these ? this is a different type of reactor that is seen as practically impossible to retrofit .
a major problem is that these reactors have practically no containment capability .
if there were an accident where radioactive steam inside such a reactor were released , it would simply escape .
there have been a few retrofittings , but this is really just tinkering and does n't really control the problem .
another problem is that these reactors ' emergency cooling systems are very weak .
there have also been efforts to improve this , but the problem is so serious that retrofitting is practically impossible . can you see a difference with improvements to another type of reactor , the vver 440/213 ? definitely .
the 213 's are the second generation of vver reactors and there were a series of improvements made .
the emergency cooling system is stronger , and they have a better containment structure , although it is still below western standards . the vver 440/213 does not have so-called full-pressure containment , but a containment system dependent on pressure release .
it 's very complicated and prone to breaking down .
there are also reports of material problems in these reactors , and there are problems with safety systems .
in the case of external hazards , for example , the danger that several safety systems fail is especially large .
you could say this type of reactor is clearly better than the first generation , but still has serious weaknesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 20 years , the long-term effects of chernobyl remain unknown the vver 1000 is comparable with western reactors from the 1970s .
does that mean they are safe ? no .
this reactor has full-pressure containment and its layout is comparable with western reactors , so you 'd have to say it is an improvement on the 213 series .
but the vver 1000 also has different problems .
protection from external hazards is considerably worse than modern systems .
there are also reports of material problems in the vver 1000 , especially when looking at the brittleness of the reactor 's pressure container , which is a key component . one specific problem with the vver 1000 is a construction flaw in the reactor building , where containment should be able to take place for some time in the event of an accident .
it is especially prone to melting down from below .
this means that if there is an accident in this type of reactor , the chances of a relatively quick containment malfunction are higher and the release would be larger than you 'd find in a german pressurized-water reactor what role does age play in an atomic reactor 's safety ? the aging process plays a large role and we have to assume that safety will decrease continually after 15 to 25 years of operation due to aging .
this can be partially counteracted when operators make the necessary efforts and replace parts that have aged .
but this does n't apply in every case .
the reactor pressure container , for example , can not be replaced .
this kind of aging management system is also complicated and expensive and there are some doubts as to whether the necessary measures are being taken , especially in eastern europe . after how many years do you think a reactor should be closed ? a running time of about 30 years is the maximum , after that there is a clear deterioration in the level of safety .
the risks also increase .
i 'd say between 25 and 30 years would be a general guide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hirsch said nuclear power plants should be closed after 30 years what other risks have to be considered when evaluating nuclear reactors ? every type of reactor operating today poses a threat of a catastrophic accident with a major release of radioactivity .
the likelihood is especially high in eastern europe 's old reactors , but technical failure or external influences - like natural earthquakes and floods or malicious acts by humans - pose a danger to even the most modern reactors . what should be done to increase security ? i think there are a lot of reasons for the long-term phasing out of atomic energy .

but a new convention has taken effect to safeguard intangible heritage as well . a new convention passed by the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organisation -lrb- unesco -rrb- went into effect on thursday to protect cultural heritage .
but unlike the numerous world heritage sites around the globe , the things listed in the convention on safeguarding intangible heritage will not be made of brick , stone or wood .
ratified by 30 nations since it was passed in october 2003 , the convention is intended to keep more fleeting elements of culture - folk songs , traditional costumes and dances , handcrafts and languages - from disappearing all together .
“ the main purpose is to support cultural diversity around the world , ” said dieter offenhäuser , press spokesman for germany ’ s unesco commission .
“ many developing nations do not have much in the way of material heritage , like historical buildings or monuments , and so on .
their cultures are determined by oral history and things like music , traditional dances and languages spoken by only a few people .
through the unesco program , this kind of intangible heritage will become known worldwide . ”
so far , there are 43 items on the unesco list - including everything from theatre and art to rituals and social practices , like bark-cloth making in uganda or the palestinian storytelling tradition , hikaye .
germany has yet to ratify in germany , however , the intangible heritage convention has yet to be ratified .
offenhäuser said that germany 's plethora of traditions and its federal system of cultural ministries may have stalled ratification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carnival traditions would be a likely candidate " we first need to evaluate whether there is a real necessity in germany to protect cultural heritage through the unesco convention , " offenhäuser said .
" and then there is the question of eligibility .
take the three big carnival traditions , for example : the cologne , the allemanic , and the rhineland-palatinate carnival .

but a new convention has taken effect to safeguard intangible heritage as well . a new convention passed by the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organisation -lrb- unesco -rrb- went into effect on thursday to protect cultural heritage .
but unlike the numerous world heritage sites around the globe , the things listed in the convention on safeguarding intangible heritage will not be made of brick , stone or wood .
ratified by 30 nations since it was passed in october 2003 , the convention is intended to keep more fleeting elements of culture - folk songs , traditional costumes and dances , handcrafts and languages - from disappearing all together .
“ the main purpose is to support cultural diversity around the world , ” said dieter offenhäuser , press spokesman for germany ’ s unesco commission .
“ many developing nations do not have much in the way of material heritage , like historical buildings or monuments , and so on .
their cultures are determined by oral history and things like music , traditional dances and languages spoken by only a few people .
through the unesco program , this kind of intangible heritage will become known worldwide . ”
so far , there are 43 items on the unesco list - including everything from theatre and art to rituals and social practices , like bark-cloth making in uganda or the palestinian storytelling tradition , hikaye .
germany has yet to ratify in germany , however , the intangible heritage convention has yet to be ratified .
offenhäuser said that germany 's plethora of traditions and its federal system of cultural ministries may have stalled ratification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carnival traditions would be a likely candidate " we first need to evaluate whether there is a real necessity in germany to protect cultural heritage through the unesco convention , " offenhäuser said .
" and then there is the question of eligibility .
take the three big carnival traditions , for example : the cologne , the allemanic , and the rhineland-palatinate carnival .
they are all important to tradition , very much alive , and all different . "
marie-theres albert , professor of world heritage studies at the technical university in cottbus disagrees that the number of potential candidates should keep germany from upholding the convention .
" we need to establish guidelines and criteria , " albert said .
" there are many german traditions and customs from ethnic groups that have become part of german society which are just as important culturally as the dozens of physical world heritage sites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 20.04.2006 trash art litters cologne großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " cologne people " next to the cathedral some say german artist ha schult likes to provoke .
he retorts that artists are society ’ s litmus test .
provocative or not , his trash people are relics of a distinctly human byproduct : garbage . " one man 's trash is another man 's treasure . "
artist ha schult takes that adage to the limit : he 's installed 1,000 figures made of debris in front of one of the world 's cultural treasures : the cologne cathedral .
" i started creating this kind of art long before it became fashionable , " schult told dw-world.de.
" back in the 1960s , i organized fashion shows atop trash depots to draw attention to our planet ’ s environmental imbalance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist ha schult trash people are life-size figures the artist began making in 1996 from rubbish collected at the municipal depot in cologne , the city where schult lives and works .
the figures ' faces are molded from tin cans , their chests constructed from computers , their limbs shaped from crushed plastic - all carefully formed into sculptures intended to remind people of the waste they constantly produce .
schult needed 30 assistants for over six months to help him create the figures .
they began with cleaning the rubbish ; the stench would have otherwise been unbearable .
grandiose venues for a pressing message ha schult does not lack modesty when it comes to his artistic vision .
" i told politicians long ago that the subject of the environment would make or break future elections , " schult said .
" we artists are the litmus test of society .
people can gain a sense of the state of society by looking at the works artists are producing .
the freedom of a society is measured by the freedom of its art . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash people near the matterhorn , switzerland schult 's monumental statements parallel his exhibition locations .
his trash people have been installed at some of the greatest sites in the world : on china 's great wall , near the egyptian pyramids , on moscow 's red square , at switzerland 's matterhorn mountain , at the grand place in brussels and la grande arche in paris .
cultural differences " in russia - where nuclear fuel rods are thrown into people 's backyards , people deal with trash and ecological imbalances differently than here in germany , " schult told dw-world.de.
" the swiss are a complete contrast to the egyptians , who just throw debris into a pit and let the poorest of society pick through it .
then they fill it up with sand and build a hilton hotel or kentucky fried chicken on top , " schult said .
but consciousness-raising and altruism toward mother earth were not the only reasons for bringing the show to cologne .
in brussels , the installation drew 1 million visitors , who also emptied their pockets in the city 's stores .
cologne - home to a world-renowned gothic cathedral - hopes the trash people , renamed " cologne people " for the occasion , will have a similar effect .
" it 's an appealing installation that parallels our attempts to beautify the cathedral plaza - out with the unsightly and in with art , " cologne mayor fritz schramma said .
apparently , the cologne people are not unsightly , even if they are composed of garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash people enjoying the view at the great wall of china the sculptures will also be fenced in and guarded in cologne - unlike in egypt , paris , china , or the matterhorn , " where hikers were just too tired to vandalize . "
so rather than walking freely among the cologne people , viewers will be guided through the installation .
alternatively , they can book a 50 euro -lrb- $ 61 -rrb- tour and spend a sunday afternoon with the artist .
there 's even a deluxe trash package for only 160 euros which includes breakfast , cocktails and dinner .
what more could trash-seekers ask for ?
the trash people , after all , have become valuable .
back in 1996 , schult paid the cologne dump 80,000 german marks -lrb- 41,000 euros -rrb- for rubbish to make 1,000 figures .
half of those have been sold and replaced by new ones , which currently sell for 6,000 euros .
doctors and dentists like to put them in their waiting rooms , schult said .
the sales fund the trash people 's journeys throughout the world .
with all the travel , the figures sometimes need a repair or two , or a good vacuum-cleaning .
" you should have seen them when they got back from the sahara .
there was sand in every crevice of their bodies ! "
schult quipped .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things can get dusty in the desert the trash people are on show in cologne from april 21 to may 1 , 2006 , after which they head to new york city and santiago de chile .

but a new convention has taken effect to safeguard intangible heritage as well . a new convention passed by the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organisation -lrb- unesco -rrb- went into effect on thursday to protect cultural heritage .
but unlike the numerous world heritage sites around the globe , the things listed in the convention on safeguarding intangible heritage will not be made of brick , stone or wood .
ratified by 30 nations since it was passed in october 2003 , the convention is intended to keep more fleeting elements of culture - folk songs , traditional costumes and dances , handcrafts and languages - from disappearing all together .
“ the main purpose is to support cultural diversity around the world , ” said dieter offenhäuser , press spokesman for germany ’ s unesco commission .
“ many developing nations do not have much in the way of material heritage , like historical buildings or monuments , and so on .
their cultures are determined by oral history and things like music , traditional dances and languages spoken by only a few people .
through the unesco program , this kind of intangible heritage will become known worldwide . ”
so far , there are 43 items on the unesco list - including everything from theatre and art to rituals and social practices , like bark-cloth making in uganda or the palestinian storytelling tradition , hikaye .
germany has yet to ratify in germany , however , the intangible heritage convention has yet to be ratified .
offenhäuser said that germany 's plethora of traditions and its federal system of cultural ministries may have stalled ratification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carnival traditions would be a likely candidate " we first need to evaluate whether there is a real necessity in germany to protect cultural heritage through the unesco convention , " offenhäuser said .
" and then there is the question of eligibility .
take the three big carnival traditions , for example : the cologne , the allemanic , and the rhineland-palatinate carnival .
they are all important to tradition , very much alive , and all different . "
marie-theres albert , professor of world heritage studies at the technical university in cottbus disagrees that the number of potential candidates should keep germany from upholding the convention .
" we need to establish guidelines and criteria , " albert said .
" there are many german traditions and customs from ethnic groups that have become part of german society which are just as important culturally as the dozens of physical world heritage sites .
as long as the customs continue to develop , without becoming tourist events or folklore , they should be protected . "
minority report ? there are four official minority groups in germany : the sorbs in lusatia near the polish and czech borders , the danish and frisian germans in the north of the country and the sinti / roma .
all of these groups receive governmental subsidies to uphold their languages and culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sorbs in traditional garb last year , the federal government and the states of brandenburg and saxony spent over 16 million euros -lrb- $ 19.8 million -rrb- on sorbian cultural interests such as bilingual sorbian kindergartens and school language programs , a theatre company and other sorbian institutions .
but this year , the government has already announced 500,000 euros in funding cuts .
sorbian officials fear even more to come during budget renegotiations in 2007 . should the german government ratify the unesco convention to safeguard intangible cultural heritage , it will have to decide how to fund what it intends to protect .
this may bring a kind of insurance for minority cultures like the sorbs .
but it could also bring other more " mainstream " cultural candidates to the table .
and that might mean even less of the shrinking pie of art and cultural subsidies for everyone . kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's struggling ethnic minority on a modest stretch of land in germany 's east saxony and south brandenburg regions , a tiny slavonic nation continues to fight its corner for cultural recognition and " sorb " survival .

"
" it is like in school - ms von der leyen has failed , she did not pass the test , " kramer told the daily abendzeitung in the southern city of munich , adding that education on ethics should not be linked to a specific religion . the central council of muslims echoed the criticism .
" in the interest of the neutrality of the state , it is absolutely imperative that other religions are invited , " chairman ayyub axel köhler told the same newspaper . von der leyen , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and mother of seven , hit back at the complaints saying that the decision to invite the roman catholic and lutheran churches to participate in the " alliance for upbringing " was just a beginning .
von der leyen on the defensive " we made a first step with the two churches , but it is a start and others are invited to join this alliance , " she told public broadcaster wdr . she said a second stage of the program would begin later this year and that other religious organizations as well as family affairs associations and industry groups could then participate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen has seven children of her own " the idea is that we should give more of a priority to values-oriented upbringing , " she said , adding that the two churches had a wealth of experience in this area .
they run 74 percent of kindergartens and thus have the structures to ensure a broad base , she said .
germany 's culture is also based on christian values , she said . a heated debate about the state of german education and the integration of children from immigrant backgrounds resurfaced last month after reports of chaotic , violent conditions at a school in a working-class district of berlin . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration strategy demands words against sticks and stones as germany wonders why its teenagers have become such hoodlums , the government has announced a " national plan of action " to counter violence in schools .

he retorts that artists are society ’ s litmus test .
provocative or not , his trash people are relics of a distinctly human byproduct : garbage . " one man 's trash is another man 's treasure . "
artist ha schult takes that adage to the limit : he 's installed 1,000 figures made of debris in front of one of the world 's cultural treasures : the cologne cathedral .
" i started creating this kind of art long before it became fashionable , " schult told dw-world.de.
" back in the 1960s , i organized fashion shows atop trash depots to draw attention to our planet ’ s environmental imbalance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist ha schult trash people are life-size figures the artist began making in 1996 from rubbish collected at the municipal depot in cologne , the city where schult lives and works .
the figures ' faces are molded from tin cans , their chests constructed from computers , their limbs shaped from crushed plastic - all carefully formed into sculptures intended to remind people of the waste they constantly produce .
schult needed 30 assistants for over six months to help him create the figures .
they began with cleaning the rubbish ; the stench would have otherwise been unbearable .
grandiose venues for a pressing message ha schult does not lack modesty when it comes to his artistic vision .
" i told politicians long ago that the subject of the environment would make or break future elections , " schult said .
" we artists are the litmus test of society .
people can gain a sense of the state of society by looking at the works artists are producing .
the freedom of a society is measured by the freedom of its art . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash people near the matterhorn , switzerland schult 's monumental statements parallel his exhibition locations .
his trash people have been installed at some of the greatest sites in the world : on china 's great wall , near the egyptian pyramids , on moscow 's red square , at switzerland 's matterhorn mountain , at the grand place in brussels and la grande arche in paris .
cultural differences " in russia - where nuclear fuel rods are thrown into people 's backyards , people deal with trash and ecological imbalances differently than here in germany , " schult told dw-world.de.
" the swiss are a complete contrast to the egyptians , who just throw debris into a pit and let the poorest of society pick through it .
then they fill it up with sand and build a hilton hotel or kentucky fried chicken on top , " schult said .
but consciousness-raising and altruism toward mother earth were not the only reasons for bringing the show to cologne .
in brussels , the installation drew 1 million visitors , who also emptied their pockets in the city 's stores .
cologne - home to a world-renowned gothic cathedral - hopes the trash people , renamed " cologne people " for the occasion , will have a similar effect .
" it 's an appealing installation that parallels our attempts to beautify the cathedral plaza - out with the unsightly and in with art , " cologne mayor fritz schramma said .
apparently , the cologne people are not unsightly , even if they are composed of garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash people enjoying the view at the great wall of china the sculptures will also be fenced in and guarded in cologne - unlike in egypt , paris , china , or the matterhorn , " where hikers were just too tired to vandalize . "
so rather than walking freely among the cologne people , viewers will be guided through the installation .
alternatively , they can book a 50 euro -lrb- $ 61 -rrb- tour and spend a sunday afternoon with the artist .
there 's even a deluxe trash package for only 160 euros which includes breakfast , cocktails and dinner .
what more could trash-seekers ask for ?
the trash people , after all , have become valuable .
back in 1996 , schult paid the cologne dump 80,000 german marks -lrb- 41,000 euros -rrb- for rubbish to make 1,000 figures .
half of those have been sold and replaced by new ones , which currently sell for 6,000 euros .
doctors and dentists like to put them in their waiting rooms , schult said .
the sales fund the trash people 's journeys throughout the world .
with all the travel , the figures sometimes need a repair or two , or a good vacuum-cleaning .
" you should have seen them when they got back from the sahara .
there was sand in every crevice of their bodies ! "
schult quipped .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things can get dusty in the desert the trash people are on show in cologne from april 21 to may 1 , 2006 , after which they head to new york city and santiago de chile .

"
" it is like in school - ms von der leyen has failed , she did not pass the test , " kramer told the daily abendzeitung in the southern city of munich , adding that education on ethics should not be linked to a specific religion . the central council of muslims echoed the criticism .
" in the interest of the neutrality of the state , it is absolutely imperative that other religions are invited , " chairman ayyub axel köhler told the same newspaper . von der leyen , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and mother of seven , hit back at the complaints saying that the decision to invite the roman catholic and lutheran churches to participate in the " alliance for upbringing " was just a beginning .
von der leyen on the defensive " we made a first step with the two churches , but it is a start and others are invited to join this alliance , " she told public broadcaster wdr . she said a second stage of the program would begin later this year and that other religious organizations as well as family affairs associations and industry groups could then participate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen has seven children of her own " the idea is that we should give more of a priority to values-oriented upbringing , " she said , adding that the two churches had a wealth of experience in this area .
they run 74 percent of kindergartens and thus have the structures to ensure a broad base , she said .
germany 's culture is also based on christian values , she said . a heated debate about the state of german education and the integration of children from immigrant backgrounds resurfaced last month after reports of chaotic , violent conditions at a school in a working-class district of berlin . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration strategy demands words against sticks and stones as germany wonders why its teenagers have become such hoodlums , the government has announced a " national plan of action " to counter violence in schools .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.04.2006 " every type of reactor poses a threat " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phasing out atomic energy is the best course of action , according to hirsch the remaining soviet-era chernobyl-type nuclear reactors are especially dangerous but are n't the only risk when it comes to atomic power plants , helmut hirsch , physicist and consultant on nuclear safety told dw-world.de. dr. helmut hirsch is a physicist and scientific consultant for nuclear safety for a number of organizations including the austrian federal government and the environment ministry . dw-world.de : since the accident 20 years ago , it seems clear that the chernobyl-type rbmk reactors are especially dangerous .
why is that ? helmut hirsch : a strengthening of any chain reaction that has begun forms a build-up in these reactors that can not be automatically lowered as it can in most western reactors .
the chain reaction gets stronger and stronger - this is the so-called bubble co-efficient - and in chernobyl 's case , led to the accident .
this is a weakness that has been worked on since the accident and while there have been some improvements , the problem has n't completely been solved .
the rbmk also has other disadvantages .
the pressure pipes that hold the fuel elements and containment weaknesses can become brittle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical failures can also affect modern reactors would you say that rbmk reactors are the most dangerous reactors active today ? i think that is correct .
there is also a very wide consensus that these reactors can not be retrofitted to meet western standards and that they need to be shut down . the vver 440/230 reactors also do not meet western standards .
what are the problems with these ? this is a different type of reactor that is seen as practically impossible to retrofit .
a major problem is that these reactors have practically no containment capability .
if there were an accident where radioactive steam inside such a reactor were released , it would simply escape .
there have been a few retrofittings , but this is really just tinkering and does n't really control the problem .
another problem is that these reactors ' emergency cooling systems are very weak .
there have also been efforts to improve this , but the problem is so serious that retrofitting is practically impossible . can you see a difference with improvements to another type of reactor , the vver 440/213 ? definitely .
the 213 's are the second generation of vver reactors and there were a series of improvements made .
the emergency cooling system is stronger , and they have a better containment structure , although it is still below western standards . the vver 440/213 does not have so-called full-pressure containment , but a containment system dependent on pressure release .
it 's very complicated and prone to breaking down .
there are also reports of material problems in these reactors , and there are problems with safety systems .
in the case of external hazards , for example , the danger that several safety systems fail is especially large .
you could say this type of reactor is clearly better than the first generation , but still has serious weaknesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 20 years , the long-term effects of chernobyl remain unknown the vver 1000 is comparable with western reactors from the 1970s .
does that mean they are safe ? no .
this reactor has full-pressure containment and its layout is comparable with western reactors , so you 'd have to say it is an improvement on the 213 series .
but the vver 1000 also has different problems .
protection from external hazards is considerably worse than modern systems .
there are also reports of material problems in the vver 1000 , especially when looking at the brittleness of the reactor 's pressure container , which is a key component . one specific problem with the vver 1000 is a construction flaw in the reactor building , where containment should be able to take place for some time in the event of an accident .
it is especially prone to melting down from below .
this means that if there is an accident in this type of reactor , the chances of a relatively quick containment malfunction are higher and the release would be larger than you 'd find in a german pressurized-water reactor what role does age play in an atomic reactor 's safety ? the aging process plays a large role and we have to assume that safety will decrease continually after 15 to 25 years of operation due to aging .
this can be partially counteracted when operators make the necessary efforts and replace parts that have aged .
but this does n't apply in every case .
the reactor pressure container , for example , can not be replaced .
this kind of aging management system is also complicated and expensive and there are some doubts as to whether the necessary measures are being taken , especially in eastern europe . after how many years do you think a reactor should be closed ? a running time of about 30 years is the maximum , after that there is a clear deterioration in the level of safety .
the risks also increase .
i 'd say between 25 and 30 years would be a general guide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hirsch said nuclear power plants should be closed after 30 years what other risks have to be considered when evaluating nuclear reactors ? every type of reactor operating today poses a threat of a catastrophic accident with a major release of radioactivity .
the likelihood is especially high in eastern europe 's old reactors , but technical failure or external influences - like natural earthquakes and floods or malicious acts by humans - pose a danger to even the most modern reactors . what should be done to increase security ? i think there are a lot of reasons for the long-term phasing out of atomic energy .
on the one hand nuclear power plants are vulnerable , and they can cause serious problems should a radioactive release occur .
on the other hand , nuclear technology is of military importance , which does not necessarily help achieve peaceful development on an international political level .
i think for those reasons , phasing out of nuclear energy is the best course of action . in the long-term , the only energy policy that actually meets the standards required for the survival of humanity will be based on renewable energy sources and a more rational use of energy . christine harjes interviewed helmut hirsch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.04.2006 " every type of reactor poses a threat " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phasing out atomic energy is the best course of action , according to hirsch the remaining soviet-era chernobyl-type nuclear reactors are especially dangerous but are n't the only risk when it comes to atomic power plants , helmut hirsch , physicist and consultant on nuclear safety told dw-world.de. dr. helmut hirsch is a physicist and scientific consultant for nuclear safety for a number of organizations including the austrian federal government and the environment ministry . dw-world.de : since the accident 20 years ago , it seems clear that the chernobyl-type rbmk reactors are especially dangerous .
why is that ? helmut hirsch : a strengthening of any chain reaction that has begun forms a build-up in these reactors that can not be automatically lowered as it can in most western reactors .
the chain reaction gets stronger and stronger - this is the so-called bubble co-efficient - and in chernobyl 's case , led to the accident .
this is a weakness that has been worked on since the accident and while there have been some improvements , the problem has n't completely been solved .
the rbmk also has other disadvantages .
the pressure pipes that hold the fuel elements and containment weaknesses can become brittle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical failures can also affect modern reactors would you say that rbmk reactors are the most dangerous reactors active today ? i think that is correct .
there is also a very wide consensus that these reactors can not be retrofitted to meet western standards and that they need to be shut down . the vver 440/230 reactors also do not meet western standards .
what are the problems with these ? this is a different type of reactor that is seen as practically impossible to retrofit .
a major problem is that these reactors have practically no containment capability .
if there were an accident where radioactive steam inside such a reactor were released , it would simply escape .
there have been a few retrofittings , but this is really just tinkering and does n't really control the problem .
another problem is that these reactors ' emergency cooling systems are very weak .
there have also been efforts to improve this , but the problem is so serious that retrofitting is practically impossible . can you see a difference with improvements to another type of reactor , the vver 440/213 ? definitely .
the 213 's are the second generation of vver reactors and there were a series of improvements made .
the emergency cooling system is stronger , and they have a better containment structure , although it is still below western standards . the vver 440/213 does not have so-called full-pressure containment , but a containment system dependent on pressure release .
it 's very complicated and prone to breaking down .
there are also reports of material problems in these reactors , and there are problems with safety systems .
in the case of external hazards , for example , the danger that several safety systems fail is especially large .
you could say this type of reactor is clearly better than the first generation , but still has serious weaknesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 20 years , the long-term effects of chernobyl remain unknown the vver 1000 is comparable with western reactors from the 1970s .

he retorts that artists are society ’ s litmus test .
provocative or not , his trash people are relics of a distinctly human byproduct : garbage . " one man 's trash is another man 's treasure . "
artist ha schult takes that adage to the limit : he 's installed 1,000 figures made of debris in front of one of the world 's cultural treasures : the cologne cathedral .
" i started creating this kind of art long before it became fashionable , " schult told dw-world.de.
" back in the 1960s , i organized fashion shows atop trash depots to draw attention to our planet ’ s environmental imbalance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist ha schult trash people are life-size figures the artist began making in 1996 from rubbish collected at the municipal depot in cologne , the city where schult lives and works .
the figures ' faces are molded from tin cans , their chests constructed from computers , their limbs shaped from crushed plastic - all carefully formed into sculptures intended to remind people of the waste they constantly produce .
schult needed 30 assistants for over six months to help him create the figures .
they began with cleaning the rubbish ; the stench would have otherwise been unbearable .
grandiose venues for a pressing message ha schult does not lack modesty when it comes to his artistic vision .
" i told politicians long ago that the subject of the environment would make or break future elections , " schult said .
" we artists are the litmus test of society .
people can gain a sense of the state of society by looking at the works artists are producing .
the freedom of a society is measured by the freedom of its art . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash people near the matterhorn , switzerland schult 's monumental statements parallel his exhibition locations .
his trash people have been installed at some of the greatest sites in the world : on china 's great wall , near the egyptian pyramids , on moscow 's red square , at switzerland 's matterhorn mountain , at the grand place in brussels and la grande arche in paris .
cultural differences " in russia - where nuclear fuel rods are thrown into people 's backyards , people deal with trash and ecological imbalances differently than here in germany , " schult told dw-world.de.
" the swiss are a complete contrast to the egyptians , who just throw debris into a pit and let the poorest of society pick through it .
then they fill it up with sand and build a hilton hotel or kentucky fried chicken on top , " schult said .
but consciousness-raising and altruism toward mother earth were not the only reasons for bringing the show to cologne .
in brussels , the installation drew 1 million visitors , who also emptied their pockets in the city 's stores .
cologne - home to a world-renowned gothic cathedral - hopes the trash people , renamed " cologne people " for the occasion , will have a similar effect .
" it 's an appealing installation that parallels our attempts to beautify the cathedral plaza - out with the unsightly and in with art , " cologne mayor fritz schramma said .
apparently , the cologne people are not unsightly , even if they are composed of garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash people enjoying the view at the great wall of china the sculptures will also be fenced in and guarded in cologne - unlike in egypt , paris , china , or the matterhorn , " where hikers were just too tired to vandalize . "
so rather than walking freely among the cologne people , viewers will be guided through the installation .
alternatively , they can book a 50 euro -lrb- $ 61 -rrb- tour and spend a sunday afternoon with the artist .
there 's even a deluxe trash package for only 160 euros which includes breakfast , cocktails and dinner .
what more could trash-seekers ask for ?
the trash people , after all , have become valuable .
back in 1996 , schult paid the cologne dump 80,000 german marks -lrb- 41,000 euros -rrb- for rubbish to make 1,000 figures .
half of those have been sold and replaced by new ones , which currently sell for 6,000 euros .
doctors and dentists like to put them in their waiting rooms , schult said .
the sales fund the trash people 's journeys throughout the world .
with all the travel , the figures sometimes need a repair or two , or a good vacuum-cleaning .
" you should have seen them when they got back from the sahara .
there was sand in every crevice of their bodies ! "
schult quipped .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things can get dusty in the desert the trash people are on show in cologne from april 21 to may 1 , 2006 , after which they head to new york city and santiago de chile .
the antarctic will be their final station , after which schult says he will divide up the figures and give them to three different german cities . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de joseph beuys - artist who expanded art 's boundaries joseph beuys is considered one of the most important and controversial artists of the second half of the 20th century .
always on the cutting edge , beuys thought artists had a central role to play in society .
-lrb- jan .
23 , 2006 -rrb- doodling or art ?
a few cans of paint .
a wall .

he retorts that artists are society ’ s litmus test .
provocative or not , his trash people are relics of a distinctly human byproduct : garbage . " one man 's trash is another man 's treasure . "
artist ha schult takes that adage to the limit : he 's installed 1,000 figures made of debris in front of one of the world 's cultural treasures : the cologne cathedral .
" i started creating this kind of art long before it became fashionable , " schult told dw-world.de.
" back in the 1960s , i organized fashion shows atop trash depots to draw attention to our planet ’ s environmental imbalance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist ha schult trash people are life-size figures the artist began making in 1996 from rubbish collected at the municipal depot in cologne , the city where schult lives and works .
the figures ' faces are molded from tin cans , their chests constructed from computers , their limbs shaped from crushed plastic - all carefully formed into sculptures intended to remind people of the waste they constantly produce .
schult needed 30 assistants for over six months to help him create the figures .
they began with cleaning the rubbish ; the stench would have otherwise been unbearable .
grandiose venues for a pressing message ha schult does not lack modesty when it comes to his artistic vision .
" i told politicians long ago that the subject of the environment would make or break future elections , " schult said .
" we artists are the litmus test of society .
people can gain a sense of the state of society by looking at the works artists are producing .
the freedom of a society is measured by the freedom of its art . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash people near the matterhorn , switzerland schult 's monumental statements parallel his exhibition locations .
his trash people have been installed at some of the greatest sites in the world : on china 's great wall , near the egyptian pyramids , on moscow 's red square , at switzerland 's matterhorn mountain , at the grand place in brussels and la grande arche in paris .
cultural differences " in russia - where nuclear fuel rods are thrown into people 's backyards , people deal with trash and ecological imbalances differently than here in germany , " schult told dw-world.de.
" the swiss are a complete contrast to the egyptians , who just throw debris into a pit and let the poorest of society pick through it .
then they fill it up with sand and build a hilton hotel or kentucky fried chicken on top , " schult said .
but consciousness-raising and altruism toward mother earth were not the only reasons for bringing the show to cologne .
in brussels , the installation drew 1 million visitors , who also emptied their pockets in the city 's stores .
cologne - home to a world-renowned gothic cathedral - hopes the trash people , renamed " cologne people " for the occasion , will have a similar effect .
" it 's an appealing installation that parallels our attempts to beautify the cathedral plaza - out with the unsightly and in with art , " cologne mayor fritz schramma said .
apparently , the cologne people are not unsightly , even if they are composed of garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash people enjoying the view at the great wall of china the sculptures will also be fenced in and guarded in cologne - unlike in egypt , paris , china , or the matterhorn , " where hikers were just too tired to vandalize . "
so rather than walking freely among the cologne people , viewers will be guided through the installation .
alternatively , they can book a 50 euro -lrb- $ 61 -rrb- tour and spend a sunday afternoon with the artist .
there 's even a deluxe trash package for only 160 euros which includes breakfast , cocktails and dinner .
what more could trash-seekers ask for ?
the trash people , after all , have become valuable .
back in 1996 , schult paid the cologne dump 80,000 german marks -lrb- 41,000 euros -rrb- for rubbish to make 1,000 figures .
half of those have been sold and replaced by new ones , which currently sell for 6,000 euros .
doctors and dentists like to put them in their waiting rooms , schult said .
the sales fund the trash people 's journeys throughout the world .
with all the travel , the figures sometimes need a repair or two , or a good vacuum-cleaning .
" you should have seen them when they got back from the sahara .
there was sand in every crevice of their bodies ! "
schult quipped .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things can get dusty in the desert the trash people are on show in cologne from april 21 to may 1 , 2006 , after which they head to new york city and santiago de chile .

but a new convention has taken effect to safeguard intangible heritage as well . a new convention passed by the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organisation -lrb- unesco -rrb- went into effect on thursday to protect cultural heritage .
but unlike the numerous world heritage sites around the globe , the things listed in the convention on safeguarding intangible heritage will not be made of brick , stone or wood .
ratified by 30 nations since it was passed in october 2003 , the convention is intended to keep more fleeting elements of culture - folk songs , traditional costumes and dances , handcrafts and languages - from disappearing all together .
“ the main purpose is to support cultural diversity around the world , ” said dieter offenhäuser , press spokesman for germany ’ s unesco commission .
“ many developing nations do not have much in the way of material heritage , like historical buildings or monuments , and so on .
their cultures are determined by oral history and things like music , traditional dances and languages spoken by only a few people .
through the unesco program , this kind of intangible heritage will become known worldwide . ”
so far , there are 43 items on the unesco list - including everything from theatre and art to rituals and social practices , like bark-cloth making in uganda or the palestinian storytelling tradition , hikaye .
germany has yet to ratify in germany , however , the intangible heritage convention has yet to be ratified .
offenhäuser said that germany 's plethora of traditions and its federal system of cultural ministries may have stalled ratification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carnival traditions would be a likely candidate " we first need to evaluate whether there is a real necessity in germany to protect cultural heritage through the unesco convention , " offenhäuser said .
" and then there is the question of eligibility .
take the three big carnival traditions , for example : the cologne , the allemanic , and the rhineland-palatinate carnival .
they are all important to tradition , very much alive , and all different . "
marie-theres albert , professor of world heritage studies at the technical university in cottbus disagrees that the number of potential candidates should keep germany from upholding the convention .
" we need to establish guidelines and criteria , " albert said .
" there are many german traditions and customs from ethnic groups that have become part of german society which are just as important culturally as the dozens of physical world heritage sites .
as long as the customs continue to develop , without becoming tourist events or folklore , they should be protected . "
minority report ? there are four official minority groups in germany : the sorbs in lusatia near the polish and czech borders , the danish and frisian germans in the north of the country and the sinti / roma .
all of these groups receive governmental subsidies to uphold their languages and culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sorbs in traditional garb last year , the federal government and the states of brandenburg and saxony spent over 16 million euros -lrb- $ 19.8 million -rrb- on sorbian cultural interests such as bilingual sorbian kindergartens and school language programs , a theatre company and other sorbian institutions .
but this year , the government has already announced 500,000 euros in funding cuts .
sorbian officials fear even more to come during budget renegotiations in 2007 . should the german government ratify the unesco convention to safeguard intangible cultural heritage , it will have to decide how to fund what it intends to protect .

he retorts that artists are society ’ s litmus test .
provocative or not , his trash people are relics of a distinctly human byproduct : garbage . " one man 's trash is another man 's treasure . "
artist ha schult takes that adage to the limit : he 's installed 1,000 figures made of debris in front of one of the world 's cultural treasures : the cologne cathedral .
" i started creating this kind of art long before it became fashionable , " schult told dw-world.de.
" back in the 1960s , i organized fashion shows atop trash depots to draw attention to our planet ’ s environmental imbalance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist ha schult trash people are life-size figures the artist began making in 1996 from rubbish collected at the municipal depot in cologne , the city where schult lives and works .
the figures ' faces are molded from tin cans , their chests constructed from computers , their limbs shaped from crushed plastic - all carefully formed into sculptures intended to remind people of the waste they constantly produce .
schult needed 30 assistants for over six months to help him create the figures .
they began with cleaning the rubbish ; the stench would have otherwise been unbearable .
grandiose venues for a pressing message ha schult does not lack modesty when it comes to his artistic vision .
" i told politicians long ago that the subject of the environment would make or break future elections , " schult said .
" we artists are the litmus test of society .
people can gain a sense of the state of society by looking at the works artists are producing .
the freedom of a society is measured by the freedom of its art . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash people near the matterhorn , switzerland schult 's monumental statements parallel his exhibition locations .
his trash people have been installed at some of the greatest sites in the world : on china 's great wall , near the egyptian pyramids , on moscow 's red square , at switzerland 's matterhorn mountain , at the grand place in brussels and la grande arche in paris .
cultural differences " in russia - where nuclear fuel rods are thrown into people 's backyards , people deal with trash and ecological imbalances differently than here in germany , " schult told dw-world.de.
" the swiss are a complete contrast to the egyptians , who just throw debris into a pit and let the poorest of society pick through it .
then they fill it up with sand and build a hilton hotel or kentucky fried chicken on top , " schult said .
but consciousness-raising and altruism toward mother earth were not the only reasons for bringing the show to cologne .
in brussels , the installation drew 1 million visitors , who also emptied their pockets in the city 's stores .
cologne - home to a world-renowned gothic cathedral - hopes the trash people , renamed " cologne people " for the occasion , will have a similar effect .
" it 's an appealing installation that parallels our attempts to beautify the cathedral plaza - out with the unsightly and in with art , " cologne mayor fritz schramma said .
apparently , the cologne people are not unsightly , even if they are composed of garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash people enjoying the view at the great wall of china the sculptures will also be fenced in and guarded in cologne - unlike in egypt , paris , china , or the matterhorn , " where hikers were just too tired to vandalize . "

there 's even a deluxe trash package for only 160 euros which includes breakfast , cocktails and dinner .
what more could trash-seekers ask for ?
the trash people , after all , have become valuable .
back in 1996 , schult paid the cologne dump 80,000 german marks -lrb- 41,000 euros -rrb- for rubbish to make 1,000 figures .
half of those have been sold and replaced by new ones , which currently sell for 6,000 euros .

to him , it was all just useless paper .
so he flushed it down the toilet . what would you do if you had a small fortune in a defunct currency and you were convinced it was worthless ?
would you burn it ?
would you throw it in the trash ?
or would you take it the bank on the off chance that it could actually still be converted into legal tender ? well , a german pensioner who had been hoarding 60,000 deutsche marks since the currency was replaced by the euro in 2002 , did n't consider any of these options and instead decided to flush his considerable wad down the toilet . the 64-year-old from the northern city of kiel was apparently oblivious to the fact that the money could still be exchanged .
otherwise it is debatable whether he would have stuffed the equivalent of 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,000 -rrb- down the u-bend . " he flushed the cash down the loo because he did n't think it was worth anything , " said police spokesman uwe voigt . valuable deposit blocks up neighborhood sewer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : perhaps a new symbol " do not flush money " should be added ?
after blocking up his toilet and the nearby sewer system with his expensive deposit , the man called sewage workers who extracted about half the sodden currency from the pensioner 's plumbing .
the remaining notes created a bottleneck in local drains , where most were fished out by the incredulous workers . how much of the flushed fortune was actually recovered remains a mystery .
" there may have been more cash that got away , " said voigt .
but the pensioner still managed to save enough of the currency to help improve what the police called his " spartan " living arrangements . the pensioner dried out the notes that had been saved and deposited them at a local bank .
it was not clear whether he had washed them first . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flushed with german pride when american gis in iraq get the call of nature , they politely ask to be excused and tiptoe off to the ladies ' room .

the tickets contained the personal information of the original owner and the dfb refused at the time to transfer the tickets to the name of the new purchaser , prompting the original ticket holder to file a lawsuit against the federation . the court ruled in favor of the dfb , upholding its right to reject such transfers on the basis that the original ticket holder could have returned the tickets if they were not wanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn kracht is out of pocket and out of tickets only the person named on each ticket will be allowed access to the stadiums when the month-long world cup kicks off on june 9 , for security reasons . resales are now conducted via an official website , something that was not available at the time of the disputed transaction discussed in frankfurt .
on the website , the german organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- and fifa have set out seven possibilities for transfer : transfer within the family and partnerships illness of ticket holder / visitor ticket holder or visitor get no visa to travel to germany ticket holder or visitor is prohibited from traveling force majeure -lrb- e.g. acts of war , earthquake , terrorism , political upheavals , epidemics , natural catastrophes -rrb- death of ticket holder or visitor or case of death within the family of ticket holder / visitor hardship case even if the reason for the ticket exchange fits any of these seven points , further documentation may still be required . official channels the only acceptable way to exchange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone will have to use the official portal the ok has made it clear that tickets may only be returned or transferred to another person through the official channels on the portal and may not be exchanged directly between two customers online without ok consent .
any person transferring a ticket will have to pay a 10 euro fee . thursday ’ s court ruling will reinforce that dfb ’ s and ok ’ s stance that person-to-person transactions will not be tolerated . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup portal to offer ticket resale and transfer options from march 27 , tickets for world cup games can be traded and resold on a special online portal operated by the german organizing committee and fifa .

but a new convention has taken effect to safeguard intangible heritage as well . a new convention passed by the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organisation -lrb- unesco -rrb- went into effect on thursday to protect cultural heritage .
but unlike the numerous world heritage sites around the globe , the things listed in the convention on safeguarding intangible heritage will not be made of brick , stone or wood .
ratified by 30 nations since it was passed in october 2003 , the convention is intended to keep more fleeting elements of culture - folk songs , traditional costumes and dances , handcrafts and languages - from disappearing all together .
“ the main purpose is to support cultural diversity around the world , ” said dieter offenhäuser , press spokesman for germany ’ s unesco commission .
“ many developing nations do not have much in the way of material heritage , like historical buildings or monuments , and so on .
their cultures are determined by oral history and things like music , traditional dances and languages spoken by only a few people .
through the unesco program , this kind of intangible heritage will become known worldwide . ”
so far , there are 43 items on the unesco list - including everything from theatre and art to rituals and social practices , like bark-cloth making in uganda or the palestinian storytelling tradition , hikaye .
germany has yet to ratify in germany , however , the intangible heritage convention has yet to be ratified .
offenhäuser said that germany 's plethora of traditions and its federal system of cultural ministries may have stalled ratification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carnival traditions would be a likely candidate " we first need to evaluate whether there is a real necessity in germany to protect cultural heritage through the unesco convention , " offenhäuser said .
" and then there is the question of eligibility .
take the three big carnival traditions , for example : the cologne , the allemanic , and the rhineland-palatinate carnival .
they are all important to tradition , very much alive , and all different . "
marie-theres albert , professor of world heritage studies at the technical university in cottbus disagrees that the number of potential candidates should keep germany from upholding the convention .
" we need to establish guidelines and criteria , " albert said .
" there are many german traditions and customs from ethnic groups that have become part of german society which are just as important culturally as the dozens of physical world heritage sites .
as long as the customs continue to develop , without becoming tourist events or folklore , they should be protected . "
minority report ? there are four official minority groups in germany : the sorbs in lusatia near the polish and czech borders , the danish and frisian germans in the north of the country and the sinti / roma .
all of these groups receive governmental subsidies to uphold their languages and culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sorbs in traditional garb last year , the federal government and the states of brandenburg and saxony spent over 16 million euros -lrb- $ 19.8 million -rrb- on sorbian cultural interests such as bilingual sorbian kindergartens and school language programs , a theatre company and other sorbian institutions .
but this year , the government has already announced 500,000 euros in funding cuts .
sorbian officials fear even more to come during budget renegotiations in 2007 . should the german government ratify the unesco convention to safeguard intangible cultural heritage , it will have to decide how to fund what it intends to protect .
this may bring a kind of insurance for minority cultures like the sorbs .
but it could also bring other more " mainstream " cultural candidates to the table .

to him , it was all just useless paper .
so he flushed it down the toilet . what would you do if you had a small fortune in a defunct currency and you were convinced it was worthless ?
would you burn it ?
would you throw it in the trash ?
or would you take it the bank on the off chance that it could actually still be converted into legal tender ? well , a german pensioner who had been hoarding 60,000 deutsche marks since the currency was replaced by the euro in 2002 , did n't consider any of these options and instead decided to flush his considerable wad down the toilet . the 64-year-old from the northern city of kiel was apparently oblivious to the fact that the money could still be exchanged .
otherwise it is debatable whether he would have stuffed the equivalent of 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,000 -rrb- down the u-bend . " he flushed the cash down the loo because he did n't think it was worth anything , " said police spokesman uwe voigt . valuable deposit blocks up neighborhood sewer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : perhaps a new symbol " do not flush money " should be added ?
after blocking up his toilet and the nearby sewer system with his expensive deposit , the man called sewage workers who extracted about half the sodden currency from the pensioner 's plumbing .
the remaining notes created a bottleneck in local drains , where most were fished out by the incredulous workers . how much of the flushed fortune was actually recovered remains a mystery .
" there may have been more cash that got away , " said voigt .
but the pensioner still managed to save enough of the currency to help improve what the police called his " spartan " living arrangements . the pensioner dried out the notes that had been saved and deposited them at a local bank .
it was not clear whether he had washed them first . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flushed with german pride when american gis in iraq get the call of nature , they politely ask to be excused and tiptoe off to the ladies ' room .

"
" it is like in school - ms von der leyen has failed , she did not pass the test , " kramer told the daily abendzeitung in the southern city of munich , adding that education on ethics should not be linked to a specific religion . the central council of muslims echoed the criticism .
" in the interest of the neutrality of the state , it is absolutely imperative that other religions are invited , " chairman ayyub axel köhler told the same newspaper . von der leyen , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and mother of seven , hit back at the complaints saying that the decision to invite the roman catholic and lutheran churches to participate in the " alliance for upbringing " was just a beginning .
von der leyen on the defensive " we made a first step with the two churches , but it is a start and others are invited to join this alliance , " she told public broadcaster wdr . she said a second stage of the program would begin later this year and that other religious organizations as well as family affairs associations and industry groups could then participate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen has seven children of her own " the idea is that we should give more of a priority to values-oriented upbringing , " she said , adding that the two churches had a wealth of experience in this area .
they run 74 percent of kindergartens and thus have the structures to ensure a broad base , she said .
germany 's culture is also based on christian values , she said . a heated debate about the state of german education and the integration of children from immigrant backgrounds resurfaced last month after reports of chaotic , violent conditions at a school in a working-class district of berlin . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration strategy demands words against sticks and stones as germany wonders why its teenagers have become such hoodlums , the government has announced a " national plan of action " to counter violence in schools .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.04.2006 " every type of reactor poses a threat " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phasing out atomic energy is the best course of action , according to hirsch the remaining soviet-era chernobyl-type nuclear reactors are especially dangerous but are n't the only risk when it comes to atomic power plants , helmut hirsch , physicist and consultant on nuclear safety told dw-world.de. dr. helmut hirsch is a physicist and scientific consultant for nuclear safety for a number of organizations including the austrian federal government and the environment ministry . dw-world.de : since the accident 20 years ago , it seems clear that the chernobyl-type rbmk reactors are especially dangerous .
why is that ? helmut hirsch : a strengthening of any chain reaction that has begun forms a build-up in these reactors that can not be automatically lowered as it can in most western reactors .
the chain reaction gets stronger and stronger - this is the so-called bubble co-efficient - and in chernobyl 's case , led to the accident .
this is a weakness that has been worked on since the accident and while there have been some improvements , the problem has n't completely been solved .
the rbmk also has other disadvantages .
the pressure pipes that hold the fuel elements and containment weaknesses can become brittle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical failures can also affect modern reactors would you say that rbmk reactors are the most dangerous reactors active today ? i think that is correct .
there is also a very wide consensus that these reactors can not be retrofitted to meet western standards and that they need to be shut down . the vver 440/230 reactors also do not meet western standards .
what are the problems with these ? this is a different type of reactor that is seen as practically impossible to retrofit .
a major problem is that these reactors have practically no containment capability .
if there were an accident where radioactive steam inside such a reactor were released , it would simply escape .
there have been a few retrofittings , but this is really just tinkering and does n't really control the problem .
another problem is that these reactors ' emergency cooling systems are very weak .
there have also been efforts to improve this , but the problem is so serious that retrofitting is practically impossible . can you see a difference with improvements to another type of reactor , the vver 440/213 ? definitely .
the 213 's are the second generation of vver reactors and there were a series of improvements made .
the emergency cooling system is stronger , and they have a better containment structure , although it is still below western standards . the vver 440/213 does not have so-called full-pressure containment , but a containment system dependent on pressure release .
it 's very complicated and prone to breaking down .
there are also reports of material problems in these reactors , and there are problems with safety systems .
in the case of external hazards , for example , the danger that several safety systems fail is especially large .
you could say this type of reactor is clearly better than the first generation , but still has serious weaknesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 20 years , the long-term effects of chernobyl remain unknown the vver 1000 is comparable with western reactors from the 1970s .
does that mean they are safe ? no .
this reactor has full-pressure containment and its layout is comparable with western reactors , so you 'd have to say it is an improvement on the 213 series .
but the vver 1000 also has different problems .
protection from external hazards is considerably worse than modern systems .
there are also reports of material problems in the vver 1000 , especially when looking at the brittleness of the reactor 's pressure container , which is a key component . one specific problem with the vver 1000 is a construction flaw in the reactor building , where containment should be able to take place for some time in the event of an accident .
it is especially prone to melting down from below .
this means that if there is an accident in this type of reactor , the chances of a relatively quick containment malfunction are higher and the release would be larger than you 'd find in a german pressurized-water reactor what role does age play in an atomic reactor 's safety ? the aging process plays a large role and we have to assume that safety will decrease continually after 15 to 25 years of operation due to aging .
this can be partially counteracted when operators make the necessary efforts and replace parts that have aged .
but this does n't apply in every case .
the reactor pressure container , for example , can not be replaced .
this kind of aging management system is also complicated and expensive and there are some doubts as to whether the necessary measures are being taken , especially in eastern europe . after how many years do you think a reactor should be closed ? a running time of about 30 years is the maximum , after that there is a clear deterioration in the level of safety .
the risks also increase .
i 'd say between 25 and 30 years would be a general guide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hirsch said nuclear power plants should be closed after 30 years what other risks have to be considered when evaluating nuclear reactors ? every type of reactor operating today poses a threat of a catastrophic accident with a major release of radioactivity .
the likelihood is especially high in eastern europe 's old reactors , but technical failure or external influences - like natural earthquakes and floods or malicious acts by humans - pose a danger to even the most modern reactors . what should be done to increase security ? i think there are a lot of reasons for the long-term phasing out of atomic energy .
on the one hand nuclear power plants are vulnerable , and they can cause serious problems should a radioactive release occur .
on the other hand , nuclear technology is of military importance , which does not necessarily help achieve peaceful development on an international political level .
i think for those reasons , phasing out of nuclear energy is the best course of action . in the long-term , the only energy policy that actually meets the standards required for the survival of humanity will be based on renewable energy sources and a more rational use of energy . christine harjes interviewed helmut hirsch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .
the number of victims will far surpass official figures , it said .

this means that if there is an accident in this type of reactor , the chances of a relatively quick containment malfunction are higher and the release would be larger than you 'd find in a german pressurized-water reactor what role does age play in an atomic reactor 's safety ? the aging process plays a large role and we have to assume that safety will decrease continually after 15 to 25 years of operation due to aging .
this can be partially counteracted when operators make the necessary efforts and replace parts that have aged .
but this does n't apply in every case .
the reactor pressure container , for example , can not be replaced .
this kind of aging management system is also complicated and expensive and there are some doubts as to whether the necessary measures are being taken , especially in eastern europe . after how many years do you think a reactor should be closed ? a running time of about 30 years is the maximum , after that there is a clear deterioration in the level of safety .
the risks also increase .
i 'd say between 25 and 30 years would be a general guide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hirsch said nuclear power plants should be closed after 30 years what other risks have to be considered when evaluating nuclear reactors ? every type of reactor operating today poses a threat of a catastrophic accident with a major release of radioactivity .
the likelihood is especially high in eastern europe 's old reactors , but technical failure or external influences - like natural earthquakes and floods or malicious acts by humans - pose a danger to even the most modern reactors . what should be done to increase security ? i think there are a lot of reasons for the long-term phasing out of atomic energy .
on the one hand nuclear power plants are vulnerable , and they can cause serious problems should a radioactive release occur .
on the other hand , nuclear technology is of military importance , which does not necessarily help achieve peaceful development on an international political level .
i think for those reasons , phasing out of nuclear energy is the best course of action . in the long-term , the only energy policy that actually meets the standards required for the survival of humanity will be based on renewable energy sources and a more rational use of energy . christine harjes interviewed helmut hirsch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .

"
" it is like in school - ms von der leyen has failed , she did not pass the test , " kramer told the daily abendzeitung in the southern city of munich , adding that education on ethics should not be linked to a specific religion . the central council of muslims echoed the criticism .
" in the interest of the neutrality of the state , it is absolutely imperative that other religions are invited , " chairman ayyub axel köhler told the same newspaper . von der leyen , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and mother of seven , hit back at the complaints saying that the decision to invite the roman catholic and lutheran churches to participate in the " alliance for upbringing " was just a beginning .
von der leyen on the defensive " we made a first step with the two churches , but it is a start and others are invited to join this alliance , " she told public broadcaster wdr . she said a second stage of the program would begin later this year and that other religious organizations as well as family affairs associations and industry groups could then participate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen has seven children of her own " the idea is that we should give more of a priority to values-oriented upbringing , " she said , adding that the two churches had a wealth of experience in this area .
they run 74 percent of kindergartens and thus have the structures to ensure a broad base , she said .
germany 's culture is also based on christian values , she said . a heated debate about the state of german education and the integration of children from immigrant backgrounds resurfaced last month after reports of chaotic , violent conditions at a school in a working-class district of berlin . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration strategy demands words against sticks and stones as germany wonders why its teenagers have become such hoodlums , the government has announced a " national plan of action " to counter violence in schools .

he retorts that artists are society ’ s litmus test .
provocative or not , his trash people are relics of a distinctly human byproduct : garbage . " one man 's trash is another man 's treasure . "
artist ha schult takes that adage to the limit : he 's installed 1,000 figures made of debris in front of one of the world 's cultural treasures : the cologne cathedral .
" i started creating this kind of art long before it became fashionable , " schult told dw-world.de.
" back in the 1960s , i organized fashion shows atop trash depots to draw attention to our planet ’ s environmental imbalance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist ha schult trash people are life-size figures the artist began making in 1996 from rubbish collected at the municipal depot in cologne , the city where schult lives and works .
the figures ' faces are molded from tin cans , their chests constructed from computers , their limbs shaped from crushed plastic - all carefully formed into sculptures intended to remind people of the waste they constantly produce .
schult needed 30 assistants for over six months to help him create the figures .
they began with cleaning the rubbish ; the stench would have otherwise been unbearable .
grandiose venues for a pressing message ha schult does not lack modesty when it comes to his artistic vision .
" i told politicians long ago that the subject of the environment would make or break future elections , " schult said .
" we artists are the litmus test of society .
people can gain a sense of the state of society by looking at the works artists are producing .
the freedom of a society is measured by the freedom of its art . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash people near the matterhorn , switzerland schult 's monumental statements parallel his exhibition locations .
his trash people have been installed at some of the greatest sites in the world : on china 's great wall , near the egyptian pyramids , on moscow 's red square , at switzerland 's matterhorn mountain , at the grand place in brussels and la grande arche in paris .
cultural differences " in russia - where nuclear fuel rods are thrown into people 's backyards , people deal with trash and ecological imbalances differently than here in germany , " schult told dw-world.de.
" the swiss are a complete contrast to the egyptians , who just throw debris into a pit and let the poorest of society pick through it .
then they fill it up with sand and build a hilton hotel or kentucky fried chicken on top , " schult said .
but consciousness-raising and altruism toward mother earth were not the only reasons for bringing the show to cologne .
in brussels , the installation drew 1 million visitors , who also emptied their pockets in the city 's stores .
cologne - home to a world-renowned gothic cathedral - hopes the trash people , renamed " cologne people " for the occasion , will have a similar effect .
" it 's an appealing installation that parallels our attempts to beautify the cathedral plaza - out with the unsightly and in with art , " cologne mayor fritz schramma said .
apparently , the cologne people are not unsightly , even if they are composed of garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash people enjoying the view at the great wall of china the sculptures will also be fenced in and guarded in cologne - unlike in egypt , paris , china , or the matterhorn , " where hikers were just too tired to vandalize . "
so rather than walking freely among the cologne people , viewers will be guided through the installation .
alternatively , they can book a 50 euro -lrb- $ 61 -rrb- tour and spend a sunday afternoon with the artist .
there 's even a deluxe trash package for only 160 euros which includes breakfast , cocktails and dinner .
what more could trash-seekers ask for ?
the trash people , after all , have become valuable .
back in 1996 , schult paid the cologne dump 80,000 german marks -lrb- 41,000 euros -rrb- for rubbish to make 1,000 figures .
half of those have been sold and replaced by new ones , which currently sell for 6,000 euros .
doctors and dentists like to put them in their waiting rooms , schult said .
the sales fund the trash people 's journeys throughout the world .
with all the travel , the figures sometimes need a repair or two , or a good vacuum-cleaning .
" you should have seen them when they got back from the sahara .
there was sand in every crevice of their bodies ! "
schult quipped .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things can get dusty in the desert the trash people are on show in cologne from april 21 to may 1 , 2006 , after which they head to new york city and santiago de chile .

he retorts that artists are society ’ s litmus test .
provocative or not , his trash people are relics of a distinctly human byproduct : garbage . " one man 's trash is another man 's treasure . "
artist ha schult takes that adage to the limit : he 's installed 1,000 figures made of debris in front of one of the world 's cultural treasures : the cologne cathedral .
" i started creating this kind of art long before it became fashionable , " schult told dw-world.de.
" back in the 1960s , i organized fashion shows atop trash depots to draw attention to our planet ’ s environmental imbalance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist ha schult trash people are life-size figures the artist began making in 1996 from rubbish collected at the municipal depot in cologne , the city where schult lives and works .
the figures ' faces are molded from tin cans , their chests constructed from computers , their limbs shaped from crushed plastic - all carefully formed into sculptures intended to remind people of the waste they constantly produce .
schult needed 30 assistants for over six months to help him create the figures .
they began with cleaning the rubbish ; the stench would have otherwise been unbearable .
grandiose venues for a pressing message ha schult does not lack modesty when it comes to his artistic vision .
" i told politicians long ago that the subject of the environment would make or break future elections , " schult said .
" we artists are the litmus test of society .

the tickets contained the personal information of the original owner and the dfb refused at the time to transfer the tickets to the name of the new purchaser , prompting the original ticket holder to file a lawsuit against the federation . the court ruled in favor of the dfb , upholding its right to reject such transfers on the basis that the original ticket holder could have returned the tickets if they were not wanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn kracht is out of pocket and out of tickets only the person named on each ticket will be allowed access to the stadiums when the month-long world cup kicks off on june 9 , for security reasons . resales are now conducted via an official website , something that was not available at the time of the disputed transaction discussed in frankfurt .
on the website , the german organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- and fifa have set out seven possibilities for transfer : transfer within the family and partnerships illness of ticket holder / visitor ticket holder or visitor get no visa to travel to germany ticket holder or visitor is prohibited from traveling force majeure -lrb- e.g. acts of war , earthquake , terrorism , political upheavals , epidemics , natural catastrophes -rrb- death of ticket holder or visitor or case of death within the family of ticket holder / visitor hardship case even if the reason for the ticket exchange fits any of these seven points , further documentation may still be required . official channels the only acceptable way to exchange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone will have to use the official portal the ok has made it clear that tickets may only be returned or transferred to another person through the official channels on the portal and may not be exchanged directly between two customers online without ok consent .
any person transferring a ticket will have to pay a 10 euro fee . thursday ’ s court ruling will reinforce that dfb ’ s and ok ’ s stance that person-to-person transactions will not be tolerated . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup portal to offer ticket resale and transfer options from march 27 , tickets for world cup games can be traded and resold on a special online portal operated by the german organizing committee and fifa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 20.04.2006 song and dance : unesco protects living heritage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's famous schäfflertanz could be a candidate for un protection unesco 's world heritage program is known for protecting buildings or places such as cologne 's cathedral or the rhine river valley .
but a new convention has taken effect to safeguard intangible heritage as well . a new convention passed by the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organisation -lrb- unesco -rrb- went into effect on thursday to protect cultural heritage .
but unlike the numerous world heritage sites around the globe , the things listed in the convention on safeguarding intangible heritage will not be made of brick , stone or wood .
ratified by 30 nations since it was passed in october 2003 , the convention is intended to keep more fleeting elements of culture - folk songs , traditional costumes and dances , handcrafts and languages - from disappearing all together .
“ the main purpose is to support cultural diversity around the world , ” said dieter offenhäuser , press spokesman for germany ’ s unesco commission .
“ many developing nations do not have much in the way of material heritage , like historical buildings or monuments , and so on .
their cultures are determined by oral history and things like music , traditional dances and languages spoken by only a few people .
through the unesco program , this kind of intangible heritage will become known worldwide . ”
so far , there are 43 items on the unesco list - including everything from theatre and art to rituals and social practices , like bark-cloth making in uganda or the palestinian storytelling tradition , hikaye .
germany has yet to ratify in germany , however , the intangible heritage convention has yet to be ratified .
offenhäuser said that germany 's plethora of traditions and its federal system of cultural ministries may have stalled ratification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carnival traditions would be a likely candidate " we first need to evaluate whether there is a real necessity in germany to protect cultural heritage through the unesco convention , " offenhäuser said .
" and then there is the question of eligibility .
take the three big carnival traditions , for example : the cologne , the allemanic , and the rhineland-palatinate carnival .
they are all important to tradition , very much alive , and all different . "
marie-theres albert , professor of world heritage studies at the technical university in cottbus disagrees that the number of potential candidates should keep germany from upholding the convention .
" we need to establish guidelines and criteria , " albert said .
" there are many german traditions and customs from ethnic groups that have become part of german society which are just as important culturally as the dozens of physical world heritage sites .
as long as the customs continue to develop , without becoming tourist events or folklore , they should be protected . "
minority report ? there are four official minority groups in germany : the sorbs in lusatia near the polish and czech borders , the danish and frisian germans in the north of the country and the sinti / roma .
all of these groups receive governmental subsidies to uphold their languages and culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sorbs in traditional garb last year , the federal government and the states of brandenburg and saxony spent over 16 million euros -lrb- $ 19.8 million -rrb- on sorbian cultural interests such as bilingual sorbian kindergartens and school language programs , a theatre company and other sorbian institutions .
but this year , the government has already announced 500,000 euros in funding cuts .
sorbian officials fear even more to come during budget renegotiations in 2007 . should the german government ratify the unesco convention to safeguard intangible cultural heritage , it will have to decide how to fund what it intends to protect .
this may bring a kind of insurance for minority cultures like the sorbs .
but it could also bring other more " mainstream " cultural candidates to the table .
and that might mean even less of the shrinking pie of art and cultural subsidies for everyone . kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's struggling ethnic minority on a modest stretch of land in germany 's east saxony and south brandenburg regions , a tiny slavonic nation continues to fight its corner for cultural recognition and " sorb " survival .

but unlike the numerous world heritage sites around the globe , the things listed in the convention on safeguarding intangible heritage will not be made of brick , stone or wood .
ratified by 30 nations since it was passed in october 2003 , the convention is intended to keep more fleeting elements of culture - folk songs , traditional costumes and dances , handcrafts and languages - from disappearing all together .

“ many developing nations do not have much in the way of material heritage , like historical buildings or monuments , and so on .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.04.2006 " every type of reactor poses a threat " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phasing out atomic energy is the best course of action , according to hirsch the remaining soviet-era chernobyl-type nuclear reactors are especially dangerous but are n't the only risk when it comes to atomic power plants , helmut hirsch , physicist and consultant on nuclear safety told dw-world.de. dr. helmut hirsch is a physicist and scientific consultant for nuclear safety for a number of organizations including the austrian federal government and the environment ministry . dw-world.de : since the accident 20 years ago , it seems clear that the chernobyl-type rbmk reactors are especially dangerous .
why is that ? helmut hirsch : a strengthening of any chain reaction that has begun forms a build-up in these reactors that can not be automatically lowered as it can in most western reactors .
the chain reaction gets stronger and stronger - this is the so-called bubble co-efficient - and in chernobyl 's case , led to the accident .
this is a weakness that has been worked on since the accident and while there have been some improvements , the problem has n't completely been solved .
the rbmk also has other disadvantages .
the pressure pipes that hold the fuel elements and containment weaknesses can become brittle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical failures can also affect modern reactors would you say that rbmk reactors are the most dangerous reactors active today ? i think that is correct .
there is also a very wide consensus that these reactors can not be retrofitted to meet western standards and that they need to be shut down . the vver 440/230 reactors also do not meet western standards .
what are the problems with these ? this is a different type of reactor that is seen as practically impossible to retrofit .
a major problem is that these reactors have practically no containment capability .
if there were an accident where radioactive steam inside such a reactor were released , it would simply escape .
there have been a few retrofittings , but this is really just tinkering and does n't really control the problem .
another problem is that these reactors ' emergency cooling systems are very weak .
there have also been efforts to improve this , but the problem is so serious that retrofitting is practically impossible . can you see a difference with improvements to another type of reactor , the vver 440/213 ? definitely .
the 213 's are the second generation of vver reactors and there were a series of improvements made .
the emergency cooling system is stronger , and they have a better containment structure , although it is still below western standards . the vver 440/213 does not have so-called full-pressure containment , but a containment system dependent on pressure release .
it 's very complicated and prone to breaking down .
there are also reports of material problems in these reactors , and there are problems with safety systems .
in the case of external hazards , for example , the danger that several safety systems fail is especially large .
you could say this type of reactor is clearly better than the first generation , but still has serious weaknesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 20 years , the long-term effects of chernobyl remain unknown the vver 1000 is comparable with western reactors from the 1970s .
does that mean they are safe ? no .
this reactor has full-pressure containment and its layout is comparable with western reactors , so you 'd have to say it is an improvement on the 213 series .
but the vver 1000 also has different problems .
protection from external hazards is considerably worse than modern systems .
there are also reports of material problems in the vver 1000 , especially when looking at the brittleness of the reactor 's pressure container , which is a key component . one specific problem with the vver 1000 is a construction flaw in the reactor building , where containment should be able to take place for some time in the event of an accident .
it is especially prone to melting down from below .
this means that if there is an accident in this type of reactor , the chances of a relatively quick containment malfunction are higher and the release would be larger than you 'd find in a german pressurized-water reactor what role does age play in an atomic reactor 's safety ? the aging process plays a large role and we have to assume that safety will decrease continually after 15 to 25 years of operation due to aging .
this can be partially counteracted when operators make the necessary efforts and replace parts that have aged .
but this does n't apply in every case .
the reactor pressure container , for example , can not be replaced .
this kind of aging management system is also complicated and expensive and there are some doubts as to whether the necessary measures are being taken , especially in eastern europe . after how many years do you think a reactor should be closed ? a running time of about 30 years is the maximum , after that there is a clear deterioration in the level of safety .
the risks also increase .
i 'd say between 25 and 30 years would be a general guide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hirsch said nuclear power plants should be closed after 30 years what other risks have to be considered when evaluating nuclear reactors ? every type of reactor operating today poses a threat of a catastrophic accident with a major release of radioactivity .
the likelihood is especially high in eastern europe 's old reactors , but technical failure or external influences - like natural earthquakes and floods or malicious acts by humans - pose a danger to even the most modern reactors . what should be done to increase security ? i think there are a lot of reasons for the long-term phasing out of atomic energy .
on the one hand nuclear power plants are vulnerable , and they can cause serious problems should a radioactive release occur .
on the other hand , nuclear technology is of military importance , which does not necessarily help achieve peaceful development on an international political level .
i think for those reasons , phasing out of nuclear energy is the best course of action . in the long-term , the only energy policy that actually meets the standards required for the survival of humanity will be based on renewable energy sources and a more rational use of energy . christine harjes interviewed helmut hirsch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .

why is that ? helmut hirsch : a strengthening of any chain reaction that has begun forms a build-up in these reactors that can not be automatically lowered as it can in most western reactors .
the chain reaction gets stronger and stronger - this is the so-called bubble co-efficient - and in chernobyl 's case , led to the accident .
this is a weakness that has been worked on since the accident and while there have been some improvements , the problem has n't completely been solved .
the rbmk also has other disadvantages .
the pressure pipes that hold the fuel elements and containment weaknesses can become brittle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical failures can also affect modern reactors would you say that rbmk reactors are the most dangerous reactors active today ? i think that is correct .
there is also a very wide consensus that these reactors can not be retrofitted to meet western standards and that they need to be shut down . the vver 440/230 reactors also do not meet western standards .
what are the problems with these ? this is a different type of reactor that is seen as practically impossible to retrofit .
a major problem is that these reactors have practically no containment capability .
if there were an accident where radioactive steam inside such a reactor were released , it would simply escape .
there have been a few retrofittings , but this is really just tinkering and does n't really control the problem .
another problem is that these reactors ' emergency cooling systems are very weak .
there have also been efforts to improve this , but the problem is so serious that retrofitting is practically impossible . can you see a difference with improvements to another type of reactor , the vver 440/213 ? definitely .
the 213 's are the second generation of vver reactors and there were a series of improvements made .
the emergency cooling system is stronger , and they have a better containment structure , although it is still below western standards . the vver 440/213 does not have so-called full-pressure containment , but a containment system dependent on pressure release .
it 's very complicated and prone to breaking down .
there are also reports of material problems in these reactors , and there are problems with safety systems .
in the case of external hazards , for example , the danger that several safety systems fail is especially large .
you could say this type of reactor is clearly better than the first generation , but still has serious weaknesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 20 years , the long-term effects of chernobyl remain unknown the vver 1000 is comparable with western reactors from the 1970s .
does that mean they are safe ? no .
this reactor has full-pressure containment and its layout is comparable with western reactors , so you 'd have to say it is an improvement on the 213 series .
but the vver 1000 also has different problems .
protection from external hazards is considerably worse than modern systems .
there are also reports of material problems in the vver 1000 , especially when looking at the brittleness of the reactor 's pressure container , which is a key component . one specific problem with the vver 1000 is a construction flaw in the reactor building , where containment should be able to take place for some time in the event of an accident .
it is especially prone to melting down from below .
this means that if there is an accident in this type of reactor , the chances of a relatively quick containment malfunction are higher and the release would be larger than you 'd find in a german pressurized-water reactor what role does age play in an atomic reactor 's safety ? the aging process plays a large role and we have to assume that safety will decrease continually after 15 to 25 years of operation due to aging .
this can be partially counteracted when operators make the necessary efforts and replace parts that have aged .
but this does n't apply in every case .
the reactor pressure container , for example , can not be replaced .
this kind of aging management system is also complicated and expensive and there are some doubts as to whether the necessary measures are being taken , especially in eastern europe . after how many years do you think a reactor should be closed ? a running time of about 30 years is the maximum , after that there is a clear deterioration in the level of safety .
the risks also increase .
i 'd say between 25 and 30 years would be a general guide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hirsch said nuclear power plants should be closed after 30 years what other risks have to be considered when evaluating nuclear reactors ? every type of reactor operating today poses a threat of a catastrophic accident with a major release of radioactivity .
the likelihood is especially high in eastern europe 's old reactors , but technical failure or external influences - like natural earthquakes and floods or malicious acts by humans - pose a danger to even the most modern reactors . what should be done to increase security ? i think there are a lot of reasons for the long-term phasing out of atomic energy .
on the one hand nuclear power plants are vulnerable , and they can cause serious problems should a radioactive release occur .
on the other hand , nuclear technology is of military importance , which does not necessarily help achieve peaceful development on an international political level .
i think for those reasons , phasing out of nuclear energy is the best course of action . in the long-term , the only energy policy that actually meets the standards required for the survival of humanity will be based on renewable energy sources and a more rational use of energy . christine harjes interviewed helmut hirsch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .

why is that ? helmut hirsch : a strengthening of any chain reaction that has begun forms a build-up in these reactors that can not be automatically lowered as it can in most western reactors .
the chain reaction gets stronger and stronger - this is the so-called bubble co-efficient - and in chernobyl 's case , led to the accident .
this is a weakness that has been worked on since the accident and while there have been some improvements , the problem has n't completely been solved .
the rbmk also has other disadvantages .
the pressure pipes that hold the fuel elements and containment weaknesses can become brittle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical failures can also affect modern reactors would you say that rbmk reactors are the most dangerous reactors active today ? i think that is correct .
there is also a very wide consensus that these reactors can not be retrofitted to meet western standards and that they need to be shut down . the vver 440/230 reactors also do not meet western standards .
what are the problems with these ? this is a different type of reactor that is seen as practically impossible to retrofit .
a major problem is that these reactors have practically no containment capability .
if there were an accident where radioactive steam inside such a reactor were released , it would simply escape .
there have been a few retrofittings , but this is really just tinkering and does n't really control the problem .
another problem is that these reactors ' emergency cooling systems are very weak .
there have also been efforts to improve this , but the problem is so serious that retrofitting is practically impossible . can you see a difference with improvements to another type of reactor , the vver 440/213 ? definitely .
the 213 's are the second generation of vver reactors and there were a series of improvements made .
the emergency cooling system is stronger , and they have a better containment structure , although it is still below western standards . the vver 440/213 does not have so-called full-pressure containment , but a containment system dependent on pressure release .
it 's very complicated and prone to breaking down .
there are also reports of material problems in these reactors , and there are problems with safety systems .
in the case of external hazards , for example , the danger that several safety systems fail is especially large .
you could say this type of reactor is clearly better than the first generation , but still has serious weaknesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 20 years , the long-term effects of chernobyl remain unknown the vver 1000 is comparable with western reactors from the 1970s .
does that mean they are safe ? no .
this reactor has full-pressure containment and its layout is comparable with western reactors , so you 'd have to say it is an improvement on the 213 series .
but the vver 1000 also has different problems .
protection from external hazards is considerably worse than modern systems .
there are also reports of material problems in the vver 1000 , especially when looking at the brittleness of the reactor 's pressure container , which is a key component . one specific problem with the vver 1000 is a construction flaw in the reactor building , where containment should be able to take place for some time in the event of an accident .
it is especially prone to melting down from below .
this means that if there is an accident in this type of reactor , the chances of a relatively quick containment malfunction are higher and the release would be larger than you 'd find in a german pressurized-water reactor what role does age play in an atomic reactor 's safety ? the aging process plays a large role and we have to assume that safety will decrease continually after 15 to 25 years of operation due to aging .
this can be partially counteracted when operators make the necessary efforts and replace parts that have aged .
but this does n't apply in every case .
the reactor pressure container , for example , can not be replaced .
this kind of aging management system is also complicated and expensive and there are some doubts as to whether the necessary measures are being taken , especially in eastern europe . after how many years do you think a reactor should be closed ? a running time of about 30 years is the maximum , after that there is a clear deterioration in the level of safety .

he retorts that artists are society ’ s litmus test .
provocative or not , his trash people are relics of a distinctly human byproduct : garbage . " one man 's trash is another man 's treasure . "
artist ha schult takes that adage to the limit : he 's installed 1,000 figures made of debris in front of one of the world 's cultural treasures : the cologne cathedral .
" i started creating this kind of art long before it became fashionable , " schult told dw-world.de.
" back in the 1960s , i organized fashion shows atop trash depots to draw attention to our planet ’ s environmental imbalance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist ha schult trash people are life-size figures the artist began making in 1996 from rubbish collected at the municipal depot in cologne , the city where schult lives and works .
the figures ' faces are molded from tin cans , their chests constructed from computers , their limbs shaped from crushed plastic - all carefully formed into sculptures intended to remind people of the waste they constantly produce .
schult needed 30 assistants for over six months to help him create the figures .
they began with cleaning the rubbish ; the stench would have otherwise been unbearable .
grandiose venues for a pressing message ha schult does not lack modesty when it comes to his artistic vision .
" i told politicians long ago that the subject of the environment would make or break future elections , " schult said .
" we artists are the litmus test of society .
people can gain a sense of the state of society by looking at the works artists are producing .
the freedom of a society is measured by the freedom of its art . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash people near the matterhorn , switzerland schult 's monumental statements parallel his exhibition locations .
his trash people have been installed at some of the greatest sites in the world : on china 's great wall , near the egyptian pyramids , on moscow 's red square , at switzerland 's matterhorn mountain , at the grand place in brussels and la grande arche in paris .
cultural differences " in russia - where nuclear fuel rods are thrown into people 's backyards , people deal with trash and ecological imbalances differently than here in germany , " schult told dw-world.de.
" the swiss are a complete contrast to the egyptians , who just throw debris into a pit and let the poorest of society pick through it .
then they fill it up with sand and build a hilton hotel or kentucky fried chicken on top , " schult said .
but consciousness-raising and altruism toward mother earth were not the only reasons for bringing the show to cologne .
in brussels , the installation drew 1 million visitors , who also emptied their pockets in the city 's stores .
cologne - home to a world-renowned gothic cathedral - hopes the trash people , renamed " cologne people " for the occasion , will have a similar effect .
" it 's an appealing installation that parallels our attempts to beautify the cathedral plaza - out with the unsightly and in with art , " cologne mayor fritz schramma said .
apparently , the cologne people are not unsightly , even if they are composed of garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash people enjoying the view at the great wall of china the sculptures will also be fenced in and guarded in cologne - unlike in egypt , paris , china , or the matterhorn , " where hikers were just too tired to vandalize . "
so rather than walking freely among the cologne people , viewers will be guided through the installation .
alternatively , they can book a 50 euro -lrb- $ 61 -rrb- tour and spend a sunday afternoon with the artist .
there 's even a deluxe trash package for only 160 euros which includes breakfast , cocktails and dinner .
what more could trash-seekers ask for ?
the trash people , after all , have become valuable .
back in 1996 , schult paid the cologne dump 80,000 german marks -lrb- 41,000 euros -rrb- for rubbish to make 1,000 figures .
half of those have been sold and replaced by new ones , which currently sell for 6,000 euros .
doctors and dentists like to put them in their waiting rooms , schult said .
the sales fund the trash people 's journeys throughout the world .
with all the travel , the figures sometimes need a repair or two , or a good vacuum-cleaning .
" you should have seen them when they got back from the sahara .
there was sand in every crevice of their bodies ! "
schult quipped .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things can get dusty in the desert the trash people are on show in cologne from april 21 to may 1 , 2006 , after which they head to new york city and santiago de chile .

but a new convention has taken effect to safeguard intangible heritage as well . a new convention passed by the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organisation -lrb- unesco -rrb- went into effect on thursday to protect cultural heritage .
but unlike the numerous world heritage sites around the globe , the things listed in the convention on safeguarding intangible heritage will not be made of brick , stone or wood .
ratified by 30 nations since it was passed in october 2003 , the convention is intended to keep more fleeting elements of culture - folk songs , traditional costumes and dances , handcrafts and languages - from disappearing all together .
“ the main purpose is to support cultural diversity around the world , ” said dieter offenhäuser , press spokesman for germany ’ s unesco commission .
“ many developing nations do not have much in the way of material heritage , like historical buildings or monuments , and so on .
their cultures are determined by oral history and things like music , traditional dances and languages spoken by only a few people .
through the unesco program , this kind of intangible heritage will become known worldwide . ”
so far , there are 43 items on the unesco list - including everything from theatre and art to rituals and social practices , like bark-cloth making in uganda or the palestinian storytelling tradition , hikaye .

but a new convention has taken effect to safeguard intangible heritage as well . a new convention passed by the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organisation -lrb- unesco -rrb- went into effect on thursday to protect cultural heritage .
but unlike the numerous world heritage sites around the globe , the things listed in the convention on safeguarding intangible heritage will not be made of brick , stone or wood .
ratified by 30 nations since it was passed in october 2003 , the convention is intended to keep more fleeting elements of culture - folk songs , traditional costumes and dances , handcrafts and languages - from disappearing all together .
“ the main purpose is to support cultural diversity around the world , ” said dieter offenhäuser , press spokesman for germany ’ s unesco commission .
“ many developing nations do not have much in the way of material heritage , like historical buildings or monuments , and so on .
their cultures are determined by oral history and things like music , traditional dances and languages spoken by only a few people .
through the unesco program , this kind of intangible heritage will become known worldwide . ”
so far , there are 43 items on the unesco list - including everything from theatre and art to rituals and social practices , like bark-cloth making in uganda or the palestinian storytelling tradition , hikaye .

he retorts that artists are society ’ s litmus test .
provocative or not , his trash people are relics of a distinctly human byproduct : garbage . " one man 's trash is another man 's treasure . "
artist ha schult takes that adage to the limit : he 's installed 1,000 figures made of debris in front of one of the world 's cultural treasures : the cologne cathedral .
" i started creating this kind of art long before it became fashionable , " schult told dw-world.de.
" back in the 1960s , i organized fashion shows atop trash depots to draw attention to our planet ’ s environmental imbalance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist ha schult trash people are life-size figures the artist began making in 1996 from rubbish collected at the municipal depot in cologne , the city where schult lives and works .
the figures ' faces are molded from tin cans , their chests constructed from computers , their limbs shaped from crushed plastic - all carefully formed into sculptures intended to remind people of the waste they constantly produce .
schult needed 30 assistants for over six months to help him create the figures .
they began with cleaning the rubbish ; the stench would have otherwise been unbearable .
grandiose venues for a pressing message ha schult does not lack modesty when it comes to his artistic vision .
" i told politicians long ago that the subject of the environment would make or break future elections , " schult said .
" we artists are the litmus test of society .
people can gain a sense of the state of society by looking at the works artists are producing .
the freedom of a society is measured by the freedom of its art . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash people near the matterhorn , switzerland schult 's monumental statements parallel his exhibition locations .
his trash people have been installed at some of the greatest sites in the world : on china 's great wall , near the egyptian pyramids , on moscow 's red square , at switzerland 's matterhorn mountain , at the grand place in brussels and la grande arche in paris .
cultural differences " in russia - where nuclear fuel rods are thrown into people 's backyards , people deal with trash and ecological imbalances differently than here in germany , " schult told dw-world.de.
" the swiss are a complete contrast to the egyptians , who just throw debris into a pit and let the poorest of society pick through it .
then they fill it up with sand and build a hilton hotel or kentucky fried chicken on top , " schult said .
but consciousness-raising and altruism toward mother earth were not the only reasons for bringing the show to cologne .
in brussels , the installation drew 1 million visitors , who also emptied their pockets in the city 's stores .
cologne - home to a world-renowned gothic cathedral - hopes the trash people , renamed " cologne people " for the occasion , will have a similar effect .
" it 's an appealing installation that parallels our attempts to beautify the cathedral plaza - out with the unsightly and in with art , " cologne mayor fritz schramma said .
apparently , the cologne people are not unsightly , even if they are composed of garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash people enjoying the view at the great wall of china the sculptures will also be fenced in and guarded in cologne - unlike in egypt , paris , china , or the matterhorn , " where hikers were just too tired to vandalize . "
so rather than walking freely among the cologne people , viewers will be guided through the installation .
alternatively , they can book a 50 euro -lrb- $ 61 -rrb- tour and spend a sunday afternoon with the artist .
there 's even a deluxe trash package for only 160 euros which includes breakfast , cocktails and dinner .
what more could trash-seekers ask for ?
the trash people , after all , have become valuable .
back in 1996 , schult paid the cologne dump 80,000 german marks -lrb- 41,000 euros -rrb- for rubbish to make 1,000 figures .
half of those have been sold and replaced by new ones , which currently sell for 6,000 euros .
doctors and dentists like to put them in their waiting rooms , schult said .
the sales fund the trash people 's journeys throughout the world .
with all the travel , the figures sometimes need a repair or two , or a good vacuum-cleaning .
" you should have seen them when they got back from the sahara .
there was sand in every crevice of their bodies ! "
schult quipped .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things can get dusty in the desert the trash people are on show in cologne from april 21 to may 1 , 2006 , after which they head to new york city and santiago de chile .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash people enjoying the view at the great wall of china the sculptures will also be fenced in and guarded in cologne - unlike in egypt , paris , china , or the matterhorn , " where hikers were just too tired to vandalize . "
so rather than walking freely among the cologne people , viewers will be guided through the installation .
alternatively , they can book a 50 euro -lrb- $ 61 -rrb- tour and spend a sunday afternoon with the artist .
there 's even a deluxe trash package for only 160 euros which includes breakfast , cocktails and dinner .
what more could trash-seekers ask for ?
the trash people , after all , have become valuable .
back in 1996 , schult paid the cologne dump 80,000 german marks -lrb- 41,000 euros -rrb- for rubbish to make 1,000 figures .
half of those have been sold and replaced by new ones , which currently sell for 6,000 euros .
doctors and dentists like to put them in their waiting rooms , schult said .
the sales fund the trash people 's journeys throughout the world .
with all the travel , the figures sometimes need a repair or two , or a good vacuum-cleaning .
" you should have seen them when they got back from the sahara .
there was sand in every crevice of their bodies ! "
schult quipped .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things can get dusty in the desert the trash people are on show in cologne from april 21 to may 1 , 2006 , after which they head to new york city and santiago de chile .
the antarctic will be their final station , after which schult says he will divide up the figures and give them to three different german cities . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de joseph beuys - artist who expanded art 's boundaries joseph beuys is considered one of the most important and controversial artists of the second half of the 20th century .

a few cans of paint .
a wall .
and presto , there is graffiti .
but whether it is just doodling or art is a question an exhibition in nuremberg is hoping to shed light on .

"
" it is like in school - ms von der leyen has failed , she did not pass the test , " kramer told the daily abendzeitung in the southern city of munich , adding that education on ethics should not be linked to a specific religion . the central council of muslims echoed the criticism .
" in the interest of the neutrality of the state , it is absolutely imperative that other religions are invited , " chairman ayyub axel köhler told the same newspaper . von der leyen , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and mother of seven , hit back at the complaints saying that the decision to invite the roman catholic and lutheran churches to participate in the " alliance for upbringing " was just a beginning .
von der leyen on the defensive " we made a first step with the two churches , but it is a start and others are invited to join this alliance , " she told public broadcaster wdr . she said a second stage of the program would begin later this year and that other religious organizations as well as family affairs associations and industry groups could then participate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.04.2006 " every type of reactor poses a threat " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phasing out atomic energy is the best course of action , according to hirsch the remaining soviet-era chernobyl-type nuclear reactors are especially dangerous but are n't the only risk when it comes to atomic power plants , helmut hirsch , physicist and consultant on nuclear safety told dw-world.de. dr. helmut hirsch is a physicist and scientific consultant for nuclear safety for a number of organizations including the austrian federal government and the environment ministry . dw-world.de : since the accident 20 years ago , it seems clear that the chernobyl-type rbmk reactors are especially dangerous .
why is that ? helmut hirsch : a strengthening of any chain reaction that has begun forms a build-up in these reactors that can not be automatically lowered as it can in most western reactors .
the chain reaction gets stronger and stronger - this is the so-called bubble co-efficient - and in chernobyl 's case , led to the accident .
this is a weakness that has been worked on since the accident and while there have been some improvements , the problem has n't completely been solved .
the rbmk also has other disadvantages .
the pressure pipes that hold the fuel elements and containment weaknesses can become brittle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical failures can also affect modern reactors would you say that rbmk reactors are the most dangerous reactors active today ? i think that is correct .
there is also a very wide consensus that these reactors can not be retrofitted to meet western standards and that they need to be shut down . the vver 440/230 reactors also do not meet western standards .
what are the problems with these ? this is a different type of reactor that is seen as practically impossible to retrofit .
a major problem is that these reactors have practically no containment capability .
if there were an accident where radioactive steam inside such a reactor were released , it would simply escape .
there have been a few retrofittings , but this is really just tinkering and does n't really control the problem .
another problem is that these reactors ' emergency cooling systems are very weak .
there have also been efforts to improve this , but the problem is so serious that retrofitting is practically impossible . can you see a difference with improvements to another type of reactor , the vver 440/213 ? definitely .
the 213 's are the second generation of vver reactors and there were a series of improvements made .
the emergency cooling system is stronger , and they have a better containment structure , although it is still below western standards . the vver 440/213 does not have so-called full-pressure containment , but a containment system dependent on pressure release .
it 's very complicated and prone to breaking down .
there are also reports of material problems in these reactors , and there are problems with safety systems .
in the case of external hazards , for example , the danger that several safety systems fail is especially large .
you could say this type of reactor is clearly better than the first generation , but still has serious weaknesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 20 years , the long-term effects of chernobyl remain unknown the vver 1000 is comparable with western reactors from the 1970s .
does that mean they are safe ? no .
this reactor has full-pressure containment and its layout is comparable with western reactors , so you 'd have to say it is an improvement on the 213 series .
but the vver 1000 also has different problems .
protection from external hazards is considerably worse than modern systems .
there are also reports of material problems in the vver 1000 , especially when looking at the brittleness of the reactor 's pressure container , which is a key component . one specific problem with the vver 1000 is a construction flaw in the reactor building , where containment should be able to take place for some time in the event of an accident .
it is especially prone to melting down from below .
this means that if there is an accident in this type of reactor , the chances of a relatively quick containment malfunction are higher and the release would be larger than you 'd find in a german pressurized-water reactor what role does age play in an atomic reactor 's safety ? the aging process plays a large role and we have to assume that safety will decrease continually after 15 to 25 years of operation due to aging .
this can be partially counteracted when operators make the necessary efforts and replace parts that have aged .
but this does n't apply in every case .
the reactor pressure container , for example , can not be replaced .
this kind of aging management system is also complicated and expensive and there are some doubts as to whether the necessary measures are being taken , especially in eastern europe . after how many years do you think a reactor should be closed ? a running time of about 30 years is the maximum , after that there is a clear deterioration in the level of safety .
the risks also increase .
i 'd say between 25 and 30 years would be a general guide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hirsch said nuclear power plants should be closed after 30 years what other risks have to be considered when evaluating nuclear reactors ? every type of reactor operating today poses a threat of a catastrophic accident with a major release of radioactivity .
the likelihood is especially high in eastern europe 's old reactors , but technical failure or external influences - like natural earthquakes and floods or malicious acts by humans - pose a danger to even the most modern reactors . what should be done to increase security ? i think there are a lot of reasons for the long-term phasing out of atomic energy .
on the one hand nuclear power plants are vulnerable , and they can cause serious problems should a radioactive release occur .
on the other hand , nuclear technology is of military importance , which does not necessarily help achieve peaceful development on an international political level .
i think for those reasons , phasing out of nuclear energy is the best course of action . in the long-term , the only energy policy that actually meets the standards required for the survival of humanity will be based on renewable energy sources and a more rational use of energy . christine harjes interviewed helmut hirsch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.04.2006 " every type of reactor poses a threat " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phasing out atomic energy is the best course of action , according to hirsch the remaining soviet-era chernobyl-type nuclear reactors are especially dangerous but are n't the only risk when it comes to atomic power plants , helmut hirsch , physicist and consultant on nuclear safety told dw-world.de. dr. helmut hirsch is a physicist and scientific consultant for nuclear safety for a number of organizations including the austrian federal government and the environment ministry . dw-world.de : since the accident 20 years ago , it seems clear that the chernobyl-type rbmk reactors are especially dangerous .
why is that ? helmut hirsch : a strengthening of any chain reaction that has begun forms a build-up in these reactors that can not be automatically lowered as it can in most western reactors .
the chain reaction gets stronger and stronger - this is the so-called bubble co-efficient - and in chernobyl 's case , led to the accident .
this is a weakness that has been worked on since the accident and while there have been some improvements , the problem has n't completely been solved .
the rbmk also has other disadvantages .
the pressure pipes that hold the fuel elements and containment weaknesses can become brittle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical failures can also affect modern reactors would you say that rbmk reactors are the most dangerous reactors active today ? i think that is correct .
there is also a very wide consensus that these reactors can not be retrofitted to meet western standards and that they need to be shut down . the vver 440/230 reactors also do not meet western standards .
what are the problems with these ? this is a different type of reactor that is seen as practically impossible to retrofit .
a major problem is that these reactors have practically no containment capability .
if there were an accident where radioactive steam inside such a reactor were released , it would simply escape .
there have been a few retrofittings , but this is really just tinkering and does n't really control the problem .
another problem is that these reactors ' emergency cooling systems are very weak .
there have also been efforts to improve this , but the problem is so serious that retrofitting is practically impossible . can you see a difference with improvements to another type of reactor , the vver 440/213 ? definitely .
the 213 's are the second generation of vver reactors and there were a series of improvements made .
the emergency cooling system is stronger , and they have a better containment structure , although it is still below western standards . the vver 440/213 does not have so-called full-pressure containment , but a containment system dependent on pressure release .
it 's very complicated and prone to breaking down .
there are also reports of material problems in these reactors , and there are problems with safety systems .
in the case of external hazards , for example , the danger that several safety systems fail is especially large .
you could say this type of reactor is clearly better than the first generation , but still has serious weaknesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 20 years , the long-term effects of chernobyl remain unknown the vver 1000 is comparable with western reactors from the 1970s .
does that mean they are safe ? no .
this reactor has full-pressure containment and its layout is comparable with western reactors , so you 'd have to say it is an improvement on the 213 series .
but the vver 1000 also has different problems .
protection from external hazards is considerably worse than modern systems .
there are also reports of material problems in the vver 1000 , especially when looking at the brittleness of the reactor 's pressure container , which is a key component . one specific problem with the vver 1000 is a construction flaw in the reactor building , where containment should be able to take place for some time in the event of an accident .
it is especially prone to melting down from below .
this means that if there is an accident in this type of reactor , the chances of a relatively quick containment malfunction are higher and the release would be larger than you 'd find in a german pressurized-water reactor what role does age play in an atomic reactor 's safety ? the aging process plays a large role and we have to assume that safety will decrease continually after 15 to 25 years of operation due to aging .
this can be partially counteracted when operators make the necessary efforts and replace parts that have aged .
but this does n't apply in every case .
the reactor pressure container , for example , can not be replaced .
this kind of aging management system is also complicated and expensive and there are some doubts as to whether the necessary measures are being taken , especially in eastern europe . after how many years do you think a reactor should be closed ? a running time of about 30 years is the maximum , after that there is a clear deterioration in the level of safety .
the risks also increase .
i 'd say between 25 and 30 years would be a general guide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hirsch said nuclear power plants should be closed after 30 years what other risks have to be considered when evaluating nuclear reactors ? every type of reactor operating today poses a threat of a catastrophic accident with a major release of radioactivity .
the likelihood is especially high in eastern europe 's old reactors , but technical failure or external influences - like natural earthquakes and floods or malicious acts by humans - pose a danger to even the most modern reactors . what should be done to increase security ? i think there are a lot of reasons for the long-term phasing out of atomic energy .
on the one hand nuclear power plants are vulnerable , and they can cause serious problems should a radioactive release occur .
on the other hand , nuclear technology is of military importance , which does not necessarily help achieve peaceful development on an international political level .
i think for those reasons , phasing out of nuclear energy is the best course of action . in the long-term , the only energy policy that actually meets the standards required for the survival of humanity will be based on renewable energy sources and a more rational use of energy . christine harjes interviewed helmut hirsch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .

he retorts that artists are society ’ s litmus test .
provocative or not , his trash people are relics of a distinctly human byproduct : garbage . " one man 's trash is another man 's treasure . "
artist ha schult takes that adage to the limit : he 's installed 1,000 figures made of debris in front of one of the world 's cultural treasures : the cologne cathedral .
" i started creating this kind of art long before it became fashionable , " schult told dw-world.de.
" back in the 1960s , i organized fashion shows atop trash depots to draw attention to our planet ’ s environmental imbalance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist ha schult trash people are life-size figures the artist began making in 1996 from rubbish collected at the municipal depot in cologne , the city where schult lives and works .
the figures ' faces are molded from tin cans , their chests constructed from computers , their limbs shaped from crushed plastic - all carefully formed into sculptures intended to remind people of the waste they constantly produce .
schult needed 30 assistants for over six months to help him create the figures .
they began with cleaning the rubbish ; the stench would have otherwise been unbearable .
grandiose venues for a pressing message ha schult does not lack modesty when it comes to his artistic vision .
" i told politicians long ago that the subject of the environment would make or break future elections , " schult said .
" we artists are the litmus test of society .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash people near the matterhorn , switzerland schult 's monumental statements parallel his exhibition locations .
his trash people have been installed at some of the greatest sites in the world : on china 's great wall , near the egyptian pyramids , on moscow 's red square , at switzerland 's matterhorn mountain , at the grand place in brussels and la grande arche in paris .
cultural differences " in russia - where nuclear fuel rods are thrown into people 's backyards , people deal with trash and ecological imbalances differently than here in germany , " schult told dw-world.de.
" the swiss are a complete contrast to the egyptians , who just throw debris into a pit and let the poorest of society pick through it .
then they fill it up with sand and build a hilton hotel or kentucky fried chicken on top , " schult said .
but consciousness-raising and altruism toward mother earth were not the only reasons for bringing the show to cologne .
in brussels , the installation drew 1 million visitors , who also emptied their pockets in the city 's stores .
cologne - home to a world-renowned gothic cathedral - hopes the trash people , renamed " cologne people " for the occasion , will have a similar effect .
" it 's an appealing installation that parallels our attempts to beautify the cathedral plaza - out with the unsightly and in with art , " cologne mayor fritz schramma said .

why is that ? helmut hirsch : a strengthening of any chain reaction that has begun forms a build-up in these reactors that can not be automatically lowered as it can in most western reactors .
the chain reaction gets stronger and stronger - this is the so-called bubble co-efficient - and in chernobyl 's case , led to the accident .
this is a weakness that has been worked on since the accident and while there have been some improvements , the problem has n't completely been solved .
the rbmk also has other disadvantages .
the pressure pipes that hold the fuel elements and containment weaknesses can become brittle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical failures can also affect modern reactors would you say that rbmk reactors are the most dangerous reactors active today ? i think that is correct .
there is also a very wide consensus that these reactors can not be retrofitted to meet western standards and that they need to be shut down . the vver 440/230 reactors also do not meet western standards .
what are the problems with these ? this is a different type of reactor that is seen as practically impossible to retrofit .
a major problem is that these reactors have practically no containment capability .
if there were an accident where radioactive steam inside such a reactor were released , it would simply escape .
there have been a few retrofittings , but this is really just tinkering and does n't really control the problem .
another problem is that these reactors ' emergency cooling systems are very weak .
there have also been efforts to improve this , but the problem is so serious that retrofitting is practically impossible . can you see a difference with improvements to another type of reactor , the vver 440/213 ? definitely .
the 213 's are the second generation of vver reactors and there were a series of improvements made .
the emergency cooling system is stronger , and they have a better containment structure , although it is still below western standards . the vver 440/213 does not have so-called full-pressure containment , but a containment system dependent on pressure release .
it 's very complicated and prone to breaking down .
there are also reports of material problems in these reactors , and there are problems with safety systems .
in the case of external hazards , for example , the danger that several safety systems fail is especially large .
you could say this type of reactor is clearly better than the first generation , but still has serious weaknesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 20 years , the long-term effects of chernobyl remain unknown the vver 1000 is comparable with western reactors from the 1970s .
does that mean they are safe ? no .
this reactor has full-pressure containment and its layout is comparable with western reactors , so you 'd have to say it is an improvement on the 213 series .
but the vver 1000 also has different problems .
protection from external hazards is considerably worse than modern systems .
there are also reports of material problems in the vver 1000 , especially when looking at the brittleness of the reactor 's pressure container , which is a key component . one specific problem with the vver 1000 is a construction flaw in the reactor building , where containment should be able to take place for some time in the event of an accident .
it is especially prone to melting down from below .
this means that if there is an accident in this type of reactor , the chances of a relatively quick containment malfunction are higher and the release would be larger than you 'd find in a german pressurized-water reactor what role does age play in an atomic reactor 's safety ? the aging process plays a large role and we have to assume that safety will decrease continually after 15 to 25 years of operation due to aging .
this can be partially counteracted when operators make the necessary efforts and replace parts that have aged .
but this does n't apply in every case .
the reactor pressure container , for example , can not be replaced .
this kind of aging management system is also complicated and expensive and there are some doubts as to whether the necessary measures are being taken , especially in eastern europe . after how many years do you think a reactor should be closed ? a running time of about 30 years is the maximum , after that there is a clear deterioration in the level of safety .
the risks also increase .
i 'd say between 25 and 30 years would be a general guide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hirsch said nuclear power plants should be closed after 30 years what other risks have to be considered when evaluating nuclear reactors ? every type of reactor operating today poses a threat of a catastrophic accident with a major release of radioactivity .
the likelihood is especially high in eastern europe 's old reactors , but technical failure or external influences - like natural earthquakes and floods or malicious acts by humans - pose a danger to even the most modern reactors . what should be done to increase security ? i think there are a lot of reasons for the long-term phasing out of atomic energy .
on the one hand nuclear power plants are vulnerable , and they can cause serious problems should a radioactive release occur .
on the other hand , nuclear technology is of military importance , which does not necessarily help achieve peaceful development on an international political level .
i think for those reasons , phasing out of nuclear energy is the best course of action . in the long-term , the only energy policy that actually meets the standards required for the survival of humanity will be based on renewable energy sources and a more rational use of energy . christine harjes interviewed helmut hirsch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .

on the one hand nuclear power plants are vulnerable , and they can cause serious problems should a radioactive release occur .
on the other hand , nuclear technology is of military importance , which does not necessarily help achieve peaceful development on an international political level .
i think for those reasons , phasing out of nuclear energy is the best course of action . in the long-term , the only energy policy that actually meets the standards required for the survival of humanity will be based on renewable energy sources and a more rational use of energy . christine harjes interviewed helmut hirsch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .

-lrb- march 16 , 2006 -rrb- green light for german atomic waste facility a german court on wednesday gave the go-ahead for the construction of a storage facility for low- and medium-level radioactive nuclear waste , putting an end to a two-decade-long campaign to block the project .

but a new convention has taken effect to safeguard intangible heritage as well . a new convention passed by the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organisation -lrb- unesco -rrb- went into effect on thursday to protect cultural heritage .
but unlike the numerous world heritage sites around the globe , the things listed in the convention on safeguarding intangible heritage will not be made of brick , stone or wood .
ratified by 30 nations since it was passed in october 2003 , the convention is intended to keep more fleeting elements of culture - folk songs , traditional costumes and dances , handcrafts and languages - from disappearing all together .
“ the main purpose is to support cultural diversity around the world , ” said dieter offenhäuser , press spokesman for germany ’ s unesco commission .
“ many developing nations do not have much in the way of material heritage , like historical buildings or monuments , and so on .
their cultures are determined by oral history and things like music , traditional dances and languages spoken by only a few people .
through the unesco program , this kind of intangible heritage will become known worldwide . ”
so far , there are 43 items on the unesco list - including everything from theatre and art to rituals and social practices , like bark-cloth making in uganda or the palestinian storytelling tradition , hikaye .
germany has yet to ratify in germany , however , the intangible heritage convention has yet to be ratified .
offenhäuser said that germany 's plethora of traditions and its federal system of cultural ministries may have stalled ratification .

they are all important to tradition , very much alive , and all different . "
marie-theres albert , professor of world heritage studies at the technical university in cottbus disagrees that the number of potential candidates should keep germany from upholding the convention .
" we need to establish guidelines and criteria , " albert said .
" there are many german traditions and customs from ethnic groups that have become part of german society which are just as important culturally as the dozens of physical world heritage sites .
as long as the customs continue to develop , without becoming tourist events or folklore , they should be protected . "
minority report ? there are four official minority groups in germany : the sorbs in lusatia near the polish and czech borders , the danish and frisian germans in the north of the country and the sinti / roma .
all of these groups receive governmental subsidies to uphold their languages and culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sorbs in traditional garb last year , the federal government and the states of brandenburg and saxony spent over 16 million euros -lrb- $ 19.8 million -rrb- on sorbian cultural interests such as bilingual sorbian kindergartens and school language programs , a theatre company and other sorbian institutions .
but this year , the government has already announced 500,000 euros in funding cuts .
sorbian officials fear even more to come during budget renegotiations in 2007 . should the german government ratify the unesco convention to safeguard intangible cultural heritage , it will have to decide how to fund what it intends to protect .
this may bring a kind of insurance for minority cultures like the sorbs .

“ many developing nations do not have much in the way of material heritage , like historical buildings or monuments , and so on .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.04.2006 " every type of reactor poses a threat " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phasing out atomic energy is the best course of action , according to hirsch the remaining soviet-era chernobyl-type nuclear reactors are especially dangerous but are n't the only risk when it comes to atomic power plants , helmut hirsch , physicist and consultant on nuclear safety told dw-world.de. dr. helmut hirsch is a physicist and scientific consultant for nuclear safety for a number of organizations including the austrian federal government and the environment ministry . dw-world.de : since the accident 20 years ago , it seems clear that the chernobyl-type rbmk reactors are especially dangerous .
why is that ? helmut hirsch : a strengthening of any chain reaction that has begun forms a build-up in these reactors that can not be automatically lowered as it can in most western reactors .
the chain reaction gets stronger and stronger - this is the so-called bubble co-efficient - and in chernobyl 's case , led to the accident .
this is a weakness that has been worked on since the accident and while there have been some improvements , the problem has n't completely been solved .
the rbmk also has other disadvantages .
the pressure pipes that hold the fuel elements and containment weaknesses can become brittle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical failures can also affect modern reactors would you say that rbmk reactors are the most dangerous reactors active today ? i think that is correct .
there is also a very wide consensus that these reactors can not be retrofitted to meet western standards and that they need to be shut down . the vver 440/230 reactors also do not meet western standards .
what are the problems with these ? this is a different type of reactor that is seen as practically impossible to retrofit .
a major problem is that these reactors have practically no containment capability .
if there were an accident where radioactive steam inside such a reactor were released , it would simply escape .
there have been a few retrofittings , but this is really just tinkering and does n't really control the problem .
another problem is that these reactors ' emergency cooling systems are very weak .
there have also been efforts to improve this , but the problem is so serious that retrofitting is practically impossible . can you see a difference with improvements to another type of reactor , the vver 440/213 ? definitely .
the 213 's are the second generation of vver reactors and there were a series of improvements made .
the emergency cooling system is stronger , and they have a better containment structure , although it is still below western standards . the vver 440/213 does not have so-called full-pressure containment , but a containment system dependent on pressure release .
it 's very complicated and prone to breaking down .
there are also reports of material problems in these reactors , and there are problems with safety systems .
in the case of external hazards , for example , the danger that several safety systems fail is especially large .
you could say this type of reactor is clearly better than the first generation , but still has serious weaknesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 20 years , the long-term effects of chernobyl remain unknown the vver 1000 is comparable with western reactors from the 1970s .
does that mean they are safe ? no .
this reactor has full-pressure containment and its layout is comparable with western reactors , so you 'd have to say it is an improvement on the 213 series .
but the vver 1000 also has different problems .
protection from external hazards is considerably worse than modern systems .
there are also reports of material problems in the vver 1000 , especially when looking at the brittleness of the reactor 's pressure container , which is a key component . one specific problem with the vver 1000 is a construction flaw in the reactor building , where containment should be able to take place for some time in the event of an accident .
it is especially prone to melting down from below .
this means that if there is an accident in this type of reactor , the chances of a relatively quick containment malfunction are higher and the release would be larger than you 'd find in a german pressurized-water reactor what role does age play in an atomic reactor 's safety ? the aging process plays a large role and we have to assume that safety will decrease continually after 15 to 25 years of operation due to aging .
this can be partially counteracted when operators make the necessary efforts and replace parts that have aged .
but this does n't apply in every case .
the reactor pressure container , for example , can not be replaced .
this kind of aging management system is also complicated and expensive and there are some doubts as to whether the necessary measures are being taken , especially in eastern europe . after how many years do you think a reactor should be closed ? a running time of about 30 years is the maximum , after that there is a clear deterioration in the level of safety .
the risks also increase .
i 'd say between 25 and 30 years would be a general guide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hirsch said nuclear power plants should be closed after 30 years what other risks have to be considered when evaluating nuclear reactors ? every type of reactor operating today poses a threat of a catastrophic accident with a major release of radioactivity .
the likelihood is especially high in eastern europe 's old reactors , but technical failure or external influences - like natural earthquakes and floods or malicious acts by humans - pose a danger to even the most modern reactors . what should be done to increase security ? i think there are a lot of reasons for the long-term phasing out of atomic energy .
on the one hand nuclear power plants are vulnerable , and they can cause serious problems should a radioactive release occur .
on the other hand , nuclear technology is of military importance , which does not necessarily help achieve peaceful development on an international political level .
i think for those reasons , phasing out of nuclear energy is the best course of action . in the long-term , the only energy policy that actually meets the standards required for the survival of humanity will be based on renewable energy sources and a more rational use of energy . christine harjes interviewed helmut hirsch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .

"
" it is like in school - ms von der leyen has failed , she did not pass the test , " kramer told the daily abendzeitung in the southern city of munich , adding that education on ethics should not be linked to a specific religion . the central council of muslims echoed the criticism .
" in the interest of the neutrality of the state , it is absolutely imperative that other religions are invited , " chairman ayyub axel köhler told the same newspaper . von der leyen , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and mother of seven , hit back at the complaints saying that the decision to invite the roman catholic and lutheran churches to participate in the " alliance for upbringing " was just a beginning .
von der leyen on the defensive " we made a first step with the two churches , but it is a start and others are invited to join this alliance , " she told public broadcaster wdr . she said a second stage of the program would begin later this year and that other religious organizations as well as family affairs associations and industry groups could then participate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen has seven children of her own " the idea is that we should give more of a priority to values-oriented upbringing , " she said , adding that the two churches had a wealth of experience in this area .
they run 74 percent of kindergartens and thus have the structures to ensure a broad base , she said .
germany 's culture is also based on christian values , she said . a heated debate about the state of german education and the integration of children from immigrant backgrounds resurfaced last month after reports of chaotic , violent conditions at a school in a working-class district of berlin . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration strategy demands words against sticks and stones as germany wonders why its teenagers have become such hoodlums , the government has announced a " national plan of action " to counter violence in schools .

police are still searching for leads as ermyas r. fights for his life in hospital . merkel condemned the attack as " abominable and inhuman , " government spokesman thomas steg said wednesday evening .
she wanted to make sure the government 's program against right-wing extremism would continue , steg said . police in potsdam , in the eastern state of brandenburg , have been collecting information volunteered by members of the population after a recording of the attackers was made public .
but they do n't yet have any hot leads , brandenburg interior minister jörg schönbohm said on wednesday . the two men 's voices were recorded on the telephone mailbox of ermyas r. 's wife as the german man called for help during the attack . jumping to conclusions ? schönbohm said he was sure the attackers would be caught soon .
ninety percent of violent crimes were solved , he said in an interview with inforadio berlin-brandenburg .
schönbohm cautioned against drawing rash conclusions about the nature of the attack .
though the victim is black , there 's no way to say what exactly happened , he pointed out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schönbohm said the attack may not have been motivated by racism however , germany 's federal prosecutor , kay nehm , who has also opened an investigation , is assuming the attack was motivated by xenophobia because the perpetrators called ermyas r. " nigger " on the recording .

"
" it is like in school - ms von der leyen has failed , she did not pass the test , " kramer told the daily abendzeitung in the southern city of munich , adding that education on ethics should not be linked to a specific religion . the central council of muslims echoed the criticism .
" in the interest of the neutrality of the state , it is absolutely imperative that other religions are invited , " chairman ayyub axel köhler told the same newspaper . von der leyen , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and mother of seven , hit back at the complaints saying that the decision to invite the roman catholic and lutheran churches to participate in the " alliance for upbringing " was just a beginning .
von der leyen on the defensive " we made a first step with the two churches , but it is a start and others are invited to join this alliance , " she told public broadcaster wdr . she said a second stage of the program would begin later this year and that other religious organizations as well as family affairs associations and industry groups could then participate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen has seven children of her own " the idea is that we should give more of a priority to values-oriented upbringing , " she said , adding that the two churches had a wealth of experience in this area .
they run 74 percent of kindergartens and thus have the structures to ensure a broad base , she said .
germany 's culture is also based on christian values , she said . a heated debate about the state of german education and the integration of children from immigrant backgrounds resurfaced last month after reports of chaotic , violent conditions at a school in a working-class district of berlin . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration strategy demands words against sticks and stones as germany wonders why its teenagers have become such hoodlums , the government has announced a " national plan of action " to counter violence in schools .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.04.2006 " every type of reactor poses a threat " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phasing out atomic energy is the best course of action , according to hirsch the remaining soviet-era chernobyl-type nuclear reactors are especially dangerous but are n't the only risk when it comes to atomic power plants , helmut hirsch , physicist and consultant on nuclear safety told dw-world.de. dr. helmut hirsch is a physicist and scientific consultant for nuclear safety for a number of organizations including the austrian federal government and the environment ministry . dw-world.de : since the accident 20 years ago , it seems clear that the chernobyl-type rbmk reactors are especially dangerous .
why is that ? helmut hirsch : a strengthening of any chain reaction that has begun forms a build-up in these reactors that can not be automatically lowered as it can in most western reactors .
the chain reaction gets stronger and stronger - this is the so-called bubble co-efficient - and in chernobyl 's case , led to the accident .
this is a weakness that has been worked on since the accident and while there have been some improvements , the problem has n't completely been solved .
the rbmk also has other disadvantages .
the pressure pipes that hold the fuel elements and containment weaknesses can become brittle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical failures can also affect modern reactors would you say that rbmk reactors are the most dangerous reactors active today ? i think that is correct .
there is also a very wide consensus that these reactors can not be retrofitted to meet western standards and that they need to be shut down . the vver 440/230 reactors also do not meet western standards .
what are the problems with these ? this is a different type of reactor that is seen as practically impossible to retrofit .
a major problem is that these reactors have practically no containment capability .
if there were an accident where radioactive steam inside such a reactor were released , it would simply escape .
there have been a few retrofittings , but this is really just tinkering and does n't really control the problem .
another problem is that these reactors ' emergency cooling systems are very weak .
there have also been efforts to improve this , but the problem is so serious that retrofitting is practically impossible . can you see a difference with improvements to another type of reactor , the vver 440/213 ? definitely .
the 213 's are the second generation of vver reactors and there were a series of improvements made .
the emergency cooling system is stronger , and they have a better containment structure , although it is still below western standards . the vver 440/213 does not have so-called full-pressure containment , but a containment system dependent on pressure release .
it 's very complicated and prone to breaking down .
there are also reports of material problems in these reactors , and there are problems with safety systems .
in the case of external hazards , for example , the danger that several safety systems fail is especially large .
you could say this type of reactor is clearly better than the first generation , but still has serious weaknesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 20 years , the long-term effects of chernobyl remain unknown the vver 1000 is comparable with western reactors from the 1970s .
does that mean they are safe ? no .
this reactor has full-pressure containment and its layout is comparable with western reactors , so you 'd have to say it is an improvement on the 213 series .
but the vver 1000 also has different problems .
protection from external hazards is considerably worse than modern systems .
there are also reports of material problems in the vver 1000 , especially when looking at the brittleness of the reactor 's pressure container , which is a key component . one specific problem with the vver 1000 is a construction flaw in the reactor building , where containment should be able to take place for some time in the event of an accident .
it is especially prone to melting down from below .
this means that if there is an accident in this type of reactor , the chances of a relatively quick containment malfunction are higher and the release would be larger than you 'd find in a german pressurized-water reactor what role does age play in an atomic reactor 's safety ? the aging process plays a large role and we have to assume that safety will decrease continually after 15 to 25 years of operation due to aging .
this can be partially counteracted when operators make the necessary efforts and replace parts that have aged .
but this does n't apply in every case .
the reactor pressure container , for example , can not be replaced .
this kind of aging management system is also complicated and expensive and there are some doubts as to whether the necessary measures are being taken , especially in eastern europe . after how many years do you think a reactor should be closed ? a running time of about 30 years is the maximum , after that there is a clear deterioration in the level of safety .
the risks also increase .
i 'd say between 25 and 30 years would be a general guide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hirsch said nuclear power plants should be closed after 30 years what other risks have to be considered when evaluating nuclear reactors ? every type of reactor operating today poses a threat of a catastrophic accident with a major release of radioactivity .
the likelihood is especially high in eastern europe 's old reactors , but technical failure or external influences - like natural earthquakes and floods or malicious acts by humans - pose a danger to even the most modern reactors . what should be done to increase security ? i think there are a lot of reasons for the long-term phasing out of atomic energy .
on the one hand nuclear power plants are vulnerable , and they can cause serious problems should a radioactive release occur .
on the other hand , nuclear technology is of military importance , which does not necessarily help achieve peaceful development on an international political level .
i think for those reasons , phasing out of nuclear energy is the best course of action . in the long-term , the only energy policy that actually meets the standards required for the survival of humanity will be based on renewable energy sources and a more rational use of energy . christine harjes interviewed helmut hirsch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .

why is that ? helmut hirsch : a strengthening of any chain reaction that has begun forms a build-up in these reactors that can not be automatically lowered as it can in most western reactors .
the chain reaction gets stronger and stronger - this is the so-called bubble co-efficient - and in chernobyl 's case , led to the accident .
this is a weakness that has been worked on since the accident and while there have been some improvements , the problem has n't completely been solved .
the rbmk also has other disadvantages .
the pressure pipes that hold the fuel elements and containment weaknesses can become brittle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical failures can also affect modern reactors would you say that rbmk reactors are the most dangerous reactors active today ? i think that is correct .
there is also a very wide consensus that these reactors can not be retrofitted to meet western standards and that they need to be shut down . the vver 440/230 reactors also do not meet western standards .
what are the problems with these ? this is a different type of reactor that is seen as practically impossible to retrofit .
a major problem is that these reactors have practically no containment capability .
if there were an accident where radioactive steam inside such a reactor were released , it would simply escape .
there have been a few retrofittings , but this is really just tinkering and does n't really control the problem .
another problem is that these reactors ' emergency cooling systems are very weak .
there have also been efforts to improve this , but the problem is so serious that retrofitting is practically impossible . can you see a difference with improvements to another type of reactor , the vver 440/213 ? definitely .
the 213 's are the second generation of vver reactors and there were a series of improvements made .
the emergency cooling system is stronger , and they have a better containment structure , although it is still below western standards . the vver 440/213 does not have so-called full-pressure containment , but a containment system dependent on pressure release .
it 's very complicated and prone to breaking down .
there are also reports of material problems in these reactors , and there are problems with safety systems .
in the case of external hazards , for example , the danger that several safety systems fail is especially large .
you could say this type of reactor is clearly better than the first generation , but still has serious weaknesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 20 years , the long-term effects of chernobyl remain unknown the vver 1000 is comparable with western reactors from the 1970s .
does that mean they are safe ? no .
this reactor has full-pressure containment and its layout is comparable with western reactors , so you 'd have to say it is an improvement on the 213 series .
but the vver 1000 also has different problems .
protection from external hazards is considerably worse than modern systems .
there are also reports of material problems in the vver 1000 , especially when looking at the brittleness of the reactor 's pressure container , which is a key component . one specific problem with the vver 1000 is a construction flaw in the reactor building , where containment should be able to take place for some time in the event of an accident .
it is especially prone to melting down from below .
this means that if there is an accident in this type of reactor , the chances of a relatively quick containment malfunction are higher and the release would be larger than you 'd find in a german pressurized-water reactor what role does age play in an atomic reactor 's safety ? the aging process plays a large role and we have to assume that safety will decrease continually after 15 to 25 years of operation due to aging .
this can be partially counteracted when operators make the necessary efforts and replace parts that have aged .
but this does n't apply in every case .
the reactor pressure container , for example , can not be replaced .
this kind of aging management system is also complicated and expensive and there are some doubts as to whether the necessary measures are being taken , especially in eastern europe . after how many years do you think a reactor should be closed ? a running time of about 30 years is the maximum , after that there is a clear deterioration in the level of safety .
the risks also increase .
i 'd say between 25 and 30 years would be a general guide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hirsch said nuclear power plants should be closed after 30 years what other risks have to be considered when evaluating nuclear reactors ? every type of reactor operating today poses a threat of a catastrophic accident with a major release of radioactivity .
the likelihood is especially high in eastern europe 's old reactors , but technical failure or external influences - like natural earthquakes and floods or malicious acts by humans - pose a danger to even the most modern reactors . what should be done to increase security ? i think there are a lot of reasons for the long-term phasing out of atomic energy .
on the one hand nuclear power plants are vulnerable , and they can cause serious problems should a radioactive release occur .
on the other hand , nuclear technology is of military importance , which does not necessarily help achieve peaceful development on an international political level .
i think for those reasons , phasing out of nuclear energy is the best course of action . in the long-term , the only energy policy that actually meets the standards required for the survival of humanity will be based on renewable energy sources and a more rational use of energy . christine harjes interviewed helmut hirsch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .

apparently , the cologne people are not unsightly , even if they are composed of garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash people enjoying the view at the great wall of china the sculptures will also be fenced in and guarded in cologne - unlike in egypt , paris , china , or the matterhorn , " where hikers were just too tired to vandalize . "
so rather than walking freely among the cologne people , viewers will be guided through the installation .
alternatively , they can book a 50 euro -lrb- $ 61 -rrb- tour and spend a sunday afternoon with the artist .
there 's even a deluxe trash package for only 160 euros which includes breakfast , cocktails and dinner .
what more could trash-seekers ask for ?
the trash people , after all , have become valuable .
back in 1996 , schult paid the cologne dump 80,000 german marks -lrb- 41,000 euros -rrb- for rubbish to make 1,000 figures .
half of those have been sold and replaced by new ones , which currently sell for 6,000 euros .
doctors and dentists like to put them in their waiting rooms , schult said .
the sales fund the trash people 's journeys throughout the world .
with all the travel , the figures sometimes need a repair or two , or a good vacuum-cleaning .
" you should have seen them when they got back from the sahara .
there was sand in every crevice of their bodies ! "
schult quipped .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things can get dusty in the desert the trash people are on show in cologne from april 21 to may 1 , 2006 , after which they head to new york city and santiago de chile .

"
" it is like in school - ms von der leyen has failed , she did not pass the test , " kramer told the daily abendzeitung in the southern city of munich , adding that education on ethics should not be linked to a specific religion . the central council of muslims echoed the criticism .
" in the interest of the neutrality of the state , it is absolutely imperative that other religions are invited , " chairman ayyub axel köhler told the same newspaper . von der leyen , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and mother of seven , hit back at the complaints saying that the decision to invite the roman catholic and lutheran churches to participate in the " alliance for upbringing " was just a beginning .
von der leyen on the defensive " we made a first step with the two churches , but it is a start and others are invited to join this alliance , " she told public broadcaster wdr . she said a second stage of the program would begin later this year and that other religious organizations as well as family affairs associations and industry groups could then participate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen has seven children of her own " the idea is that we should give more of a priority to values-oriented upbringing , " she said , adding that the two churches had a wealth of experience in this area .

germany 's culture is also based on christian values , she said . a heated debate about the state of german education and the integration of children from immigrant backgrounds resurfaced last month after reports of chaotic , violent conditions at a school in a working-class district of berlin . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration strategy demands words against sticks and stones as germany wonders why its teenagers have become such hoodlums , the government has announced a " national plan of action " to counter violence in schools .

he retorts that artists are society ’ s litmus test .
provocative or not , his trash people are relics of a distinctly human byproduct : garbage . " one man 's trash is another man 's treasure . "
artist ha schult takes that adage to the limit : he 's installed 1,000 figures made of debris in front of one of the world 's cultural treasures : the cologne cathedral .
" i started creating this kind of art long before it became fashionable , " schult told dw-world.de.
" back in the 1960s , i organized fashion shows atop trash depots to draw attention to our planet ’ s environmental imbalance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist ha schult trash people are life-size figures the artist began making in 1996 from rubbish collected at the municipal depot in cologne , the city where schult lives and works .
the figures ' faces are molded from tin cans , their chests constructed from computers , their limbs shaped from crushed plastic - all carefully formed into sculptures intended to remind people of the waste they constantly produce .
schult needed 30 assistants for over six months to help him create the figures .
they began with cleaning the rubbish ; the stench would have otherwise been unbearable .
grandiose venues for a pressing message ha schult does not lack modesty when it comes to his artistic vision .
" i told politicians long ago that the subject of the environment would make or break future elections , " schult said .
" we artists are the litmus test of society .
people can gain a sense of the state of society by looking at the works artists are producing .
the freedom of a society is measured by the freedom of its art . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash people near the matterhorn , switzerland schult 's monumental statements parallel his exhibition locations .
his trash people have been installed at some of the greatest sites in the world : on china 's great wall , near the egyptian pyramids , on moscow 's red square , at switzerland 's matterhorn mountain , at the grand place in brussels and la grande arche in paris .
cultural differences " in russia - where nuclear fuel rods are thrown into people 's backyards , people deal with trash and ecological imbalances differently than here in germany , " schult told dw-world.de.
" the swiss are a complete contrast to the egyptians , who just throw debris into a pit and let the poorest of society pick through it .
then they fill it up with sand and build a hilton hotel or kentucky fried chicken on top , " schult said .
but consciousness-raising and altruism toward mother earth were not the only reasons for bringing the show to cologne .
in brussels , the installation drew 1 million visitors , who also emptied their pockets in the city 's stores .
cologne - home to a world-renowned gothic cathedral - hopes the trash people , renamed " cologne people " for the occasion , will have a similar effect .
" it 's an appealing installation that parallels our attempts to beautify the cathedral plaza - out with the unsightly and in with art , " cologne mayor fritz schramma said .
apparently , the cologne people are not unsightly , even if they are composed of garbage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash people enjoying the view at the great wall of china the sculptures will also be fenced in and guarded in cologne - unlike in egypt , paris , china , or the matterhorn , " where hikers were just too tired to vandalize . "
so rather than walking freely among the cologne people , viewers will be guided through the installation .
alternatively , they can book a 50 euro -lrb- $ 61 -rrb- tour and spend a sunday afternoon with the artist .
there 's even a deluxe trash package for only 160 euros which includes breakfast , cocktails and dinner .
what more could trash-seekers ask for ?
the trash people , after all , have become valuable .
back in 1996 , schult paid the cologne dump 80,000 german marks -lrb- 41,000 euros -rrb- for rubbish to make 1,000 figures .
half of those have been sold and replaced by new ones , which currently sell for 6,000 euros .
doctors and dentists like to put them in their waiting rooms , schult said .
the sales fund the trash people 's journeys throughout the world .
with all the travel , the figures sometimes need a repair or two , or a good vacuum-cleaning .
" you should have seen them when they got back from the sahara .
there was sand in every crevice of their bodies ! "
schult quipped .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things can get dusty in the desert the trash people are on show in cologne from april 21 to may 1 , 2006 , after which they head to new york city and santiago de chile .
the antarctic will be their final station , after which schult says he will divide up the figures and give them to three different german cities . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : joseph beuys - artist who expanded art 's boundaries joseph beuys is considered one of the most important and controversial artists of the second half of the 20th century .

" the motor industry in this country is probably stronger than it has been for decades , " the seasoned industry executive said in an interview with the bbc news website .
last year about 1.6 million cars were made here , not far short of record production levels reached during the industry 's heyday in the 1970s , and pretty much all the remaining car factories in the uk are currently profitable .
contrary to popular belief , mr robertson - who started out with rover and has worked in the industry for 27 years - insists the uk has become a very good location for car makers .
not only is there a large pool of skilled and flexible labour in the uk , but the infrastructure here is also very good with an efficient motorway network and good access to ports , he says . "
it is inconceivable that renault or peugeot would shut up shop in france ; that volkswagen , bmw and mercedes would close all their manufacturing plants in germany " kevin morley automotive industry analyst uk car industry at risk the uk government has also " initiated some change " to create a more favourable framework for car companies to operate in , and trade unions have done much to improve communication with car industry executives , he adds .
" relations between trade unions and management has moved on over the last 25 years , " mr robertson says .
" there is now a common purpose ; to secure the future of the british motor industry . "
as such , labour cost is just one of several factors determining where car makers set up their factories .
attractive location almost half the cars made in the uk are produced by the japanese groups toyota , nissan , and honda .
in addition , the us giants general motors and ford have factories here , as does volkswagen which owns the bentley factory in crewe .
" they are all making big investments in the uk at the moment , " mr robertson says .
the same is true for bmw group , the german parent of rolls-royce and owner of the mini factory in cowley , oxford .
" we -lsb- the bmw group -rsb- are continuing to make very significant investments in this country , " mr robertson says .
he points out that £ 100m is being invested in the mini factory to lift production from 200,000 to 250,000 cars per year , and fresh investment is being pumped into new rolls-royce models .
the group is even producing all of its small bmw engines at its factory in birmingham .
" the british framework has been very effective , " mr robertson says .
" there are very many flames of success . "
committed investors investment by foreign carmakers has been of great benefit to the british economy , he points out .

" investment was being made in an industry that had not seen the right level of investment for many , many years . "
the trend has continued , with much investment still coming in from japanese , american and german car makers .
and those who are here today are generally committed to staying here for many years , mr robertson believes .
there are no plans to manufacture rolls-royce or minis outside britain , he says .
successful sector a bmw-commissioned report by oxford economic forecasting backs mr robertson 's belief that the car industry remains a powerful force in the uk economy .
" the direct contribution of bmw group to uk gross domestic product was ... £ 1bn in 2004 , " the report , which was published in february this year , says .
add to that its " indirect contribution " to the economy - that bmw 's purchasing of raw materials , components , capital equipment and business services from uk suppliers , as well as the consumption by its workers in the uk - and the overall contribution rises sharply , oxford economic forecasting says .
" we estimate that in total bmw group contributed around £ 2.5bn to uk gdp in 2004 , " the report adds .
on top of that there are the similarly massive contributions made by bmw group 's rivals , thus oxford economics ' conclusion belies the myth that the uk car industry is in trouble .
" the automotive sector in the uk has been much more successful than manufacturing as a whole over the last 20 years , " oxford economic forecasting points out .

" the motor industry in this country is probably stronger than it has been for decades , " the seasoned industry executive said in an interview with the bbc news website .
last year about 1.6 million cars were made here , not far short of record production levels reached during the industry 's heyday in the 1970s , and pretty much all the remaining car factories in the uk are currently profitable .
contrary to popular belief , mr robertson - who started out with rover and has worked in the industry for 27 years - insists the uk has become a very good location for car makers .
not only is there a large pool of skilled and flexible labour in the uk , but the infrastructure here is also very good with an efficient motorway network and good access to ports , he says .

" we -lsb- the bmw group -rsb- are continuing to make very significant investments in this country , " mr robertson says .
he points out that £ 100m is being invested in the mini factory to lift production from 200,000 to 250,000 cars per year , and fresh investment is being pumped into new rolls-royce models .
the group is even producing all of its small bmw engines at its factory in birmingham .

on top of that there are the similarly massive contributions made by bmw group 's rivals , thus oxford economics ' conclusion belies the myth that the uk car industry is in trouble .
" the automotive sector in the uk has been much more successful than manufacturing as a whole over the last 20 years , " oxford economic forecasting points out .

by will smale bbc news business reporter four out of every five pints of fosters are now brewed by a uk firm foster 's lager has an image that is the envy of its rivals .
in a global beer industry ever more dominated by giant brands , the " amber nectar " is instantly recognisable as a refreshing glass of sun-soaked , fun-loving australian flavour .
backed by a thoroughly successful advertising campaign , fosters seems more australian than having a barbecue on bondi beach while a mob of happy kangaroos leap past .
well , that 's the image - the reality is a fair bit less antipodean .
long brewed under licence in the uk by british beer firm scottish and newcastle -lrb- s & n -rrb- , it was recently announced that s & n was buying the foster 's brand across europe for £ 313m .
so foster 's bought in the uk is now not only brewed here , it is also owned by a british firm .
in terms of its nationality , it now appears more rain , pies and crisps , than sun , vegemite and barbequed prawns alfresco .
australian recipe but does it really matter ?
most of the global beer giants today have their products brewed under licence overseas , and s & n argues that foster 's remains firmly australian .
budweiser budvar has the same protection as champagne " it is the same original foster 's taste and quality , " says s & n head of communications robert ballantyne .
" it is very much still an australian beer brewed to an australian recipe , but we are obviously not going to brew it in australia as that is a long way to ship it . "
foster 's group , the australian firm that has sold foster 's to s & n in europe , agrees that the beer will continue to be australian regardless of where it is actually brewed .
" foster 's will always be ' australian for beer ' and continue to represent the australian way of life in more than 150 countries around the world , " says foster 's group chief executive trevor o 'hoy .
yet s & n today brews four out of every five pints of foster 's , and to a lesser strength than the australian-made original .
geographical protection but to be fair to s & n , as we have already said , brewing overseas is common practice in the global beer industry .
the eu offers protection to food and drink producers guinness for example , the famous irish stout , is actually brewed in more than 50 countries worldwide .
furthermore , guinness is owned by global drinks giant diageo , which is headquartered in london and listed on both the london and new york stock exchanges .
to name but two more brands : denmark 's carlsberg and belgium 's stella artois have both long been brewed in the uk .
if foster 's brand essence is its australian heritage , then s & n might have a problem ... if it 's the taste , then buying the brand makes total sense brand expert jim boulton however , there are a number of brewers who are passionately defending their origins , such as czech firm budweiser budvar , which should not be confused with its american near namesake .
budweiser budvar now has protected geographical indication -lrb- pgi -rrb- status .
granted by the european union , pgi gives budweiser budvar the same legal protection against imitation as that enjoyed by champagne wine , camembert cheese , welsh lamb or parma ham .
gaining pgi also means that budweiser budvar can only be brewed in its home town of budweis .
coincidentally , s & n has pgi protection for its famous newcastle brown ale .
while budweiser budvar has protected its heritage , other czech beers are more relaxed about being brewed elsewhere .
pilsner urquell for example - famous for being the world 's very first lager-style beer - is now also brewed in poland .
its owner , global brewing giant sab miller , insists it takes every possible step to ensure there is no difference between the beer brewed in the czech republic , and that from poland .
good taste british beer pressure group camra -lrb- campaign for real ale -rrb- , says it has long called for lager drinkers to take more interest in the actual origin of their brand of choice .
all heineken sold in the uk is now brewed in the netherlands " most of the so-called foreign lager brands on the bars of british pubs are actually brewed here , " says camra research and information manager iain loe .
" and while they are n't bad , it is n't the same .
" some of the big brewers are changing their ways though , such as heineken .

jim boulton , managing director of london-based brand experts large design , warns global beer firms that for a brand to be successful in the long term , it has to be authentic .

artists , headed by brit nominees bryn terfel and karl jenkins , claim pupils learning music face a " lottery " .
this week , education inspection body estyn said music teaching faced an uncertain future after a £ 17m assembly-back fund was dropped .
the assembly government said it was for local authorities to decide the place of music teaching in their priorities .
thirty-two high-profile music performers , composers and teachers have put their names to a letter to first minister rhodri morgan , saying wales needs to maintain its place as a " pioneering nation in the field of youth music " .
signatories include classical artists such as composer alun hoddinott , harpists catrin finch and elinor bennett and the conductor owain arwel hughes as well as the indie rock band super furry animals .
communal music-making and singing , like sport , instils in young people a sense of togetherness , loyalty and discipline karl jenkins , composer they said they could not stand by while " youth music in wales stagnates and declines " .
the letter condemns the abolition of the assembly government-backed music development fund , which ran from 1999 to 2005 , and financed a growth in musical activities by more than 60,000 young people through workshops and master classes .
the fund was ring-fenced to ensure local authorities , which contributed 40 % of the money , had to spend all of it on music education provision .
last year the fund had an additional £ 1.14m from the assembly but lost its ring-fenced status when it became part of the general funding for wales ' 22 local authorities .
the music fund scheme helped thousands of young people in a statement , the musicians said : " the extent to which this funding is allocated to music is very much in the hands of individual councils and as such has become a lottery .
" this has had a profoundly destructive effect on youth music . "
composer karl jenkins said his career , which had " exported wales around the world " , would not have happened without the " wonderful and supportive music education i had as a boy at gowerton grammar school " .
he said : " music education , and free music education at that , was seen as being fundamental to an enriched and cultured life , regardless of the fact as to whether one chose music as a career or not .
" quite apart from the enrichment that it brings to one 's life , communal music-making and singing , like sport , instils in young people a sense of togetherness , loyalty and discipline . "
' positive impact ' estyn 's report , published on monday , said the end of the funding programme may leave many local authorities unable to support music programmes at levels which have brought success .
it said nearly all of wales ' 22 local authorities have made cuts in their music service provision .
a welsh assembly government spokeswoman welcomed estyn 's report , claiming it showed the fund had been " clearly successful " .
she said the transfer of the fund to local authorities ' direct control meant it was for them to decide what music services to offer in their area " based on their understanding of local needs and priorities " .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- what is driving oil prices so high ?

crude oil prices have surged to record levels of over $ 72 a barrel - a rise of more than 18 % in 2006 , and a threefold gain over the past three years .
the effect is to heighten fears about inflation in importing countries - and to exacerbate international tensions .
the price of us-traded light , sweet crude hit a record of $ 72.40 on 19 april , while uk-traded brent crude from the north sea has raced to an all-time high of $ 74 .
bbc news looks at the factors that are driving oil prices higher .
rising demand the biggest catalyst for oil 's seemingly remorseless rise in recent years has been the simplest economic driver there is : the balance between demand and a supply .
for starters , oil demand is at an all-time high .
the big change has been the continued breakneck economic expansion of the developing world 's biggest economies , india and china .
with more than a billion people each , and sustained annual growth rates of 7 % in india and 9 % in china , manufacturers and consumers are sucking in energy at an ever-increasing rate .
but on top of that , there is little sign that demand from industrialised countries is flagging .
in the us in particular , the gas-guzzling sports utility vehicle -lrb- suv -rrb- still dominates the car market .
economic growth rates , already strong in the us , are likely to pick up in europe this year .
oil producers ' group opec says demand is up a million barrels a day over the past year - a little more than 1 % .
but some projections suggest that over the next quarter of a century , demand could soar from the current 90 million barrels a day to as much as 140 million .
security fears more recently , though , security threats to the world oil supply have risen up the agenda .
predictions that iraq 's oil production would increase dramatically following the us-led invasion of iraq have proved over-optimistic due to the deteriorating security situation in that country .
nigeria , another key member of oil producers ' group opec , has its own security problems .
much of its oil comes from the niger delta region , and local activists demanding a bigger share of revenues have repeatedly shut down production , invaded platforms and refineries , and even taken foreign workers hostage .
now , though , it is iran , another of the world 's biggest oil producers , which dominates the headlines .
the country 's push to acquire nuclear power and , many believe , nuclear weapons has sparked concern in the international community - and raised the spectre that iran could use its own oil supplies as a bargaining chip at best and a weapon at worst .
and barely-veiled threats from the us suggesting that military action remains a live option have further accentuated fears .
supply trends the reason the security concerns play directly onto oil prices is that they threaten supply and roil the oil markets .
but more general supply trends play their own part in pushing up prices .
big oil companies are having a harder and harder time replenishing their reserves , and must look further afield and in more hard-to-reach locations .
at the same time , calls for more efficient use of resources and better returns for shareholders has led them to run down stocks - and push the construction of new refineries down their agenda .
the result has been to tighten supply just as demand has soared .
a more controversial concern is the so-called " peak oil " theory : the idea that the world has reached the natural limits of oil exploitation , and that there is little more to be found in the ground whatever the price .
although many in the business dismiss the concept , energy planners in several countries are nonetheless beginning to take it into account .
suppliers ' strategies most of the headlines about oil prices look at the issue from the consumption perspective : the pain which high energy costs is causing .
but on the other side of the fence , producers are having a wonderful time .
in south america , for instance , oil revenues are underpinning president hugo chavez 's efforts to reshape venezuela , allowing him to fund extensive social programmes and reject us criticism of his economic policies .
opec , the source of about a third of the world 's oil , has a theoretical target price of about $ 30 a barrel for oil - but mr chavez thinks his fellow member states should push that up to $ 50 .
and apart from saudi arabia , which remains by far the world 's biggest supplier , few in opec have either much of a stomach for increasing production - or much capacity to spare .
meanwhile , outside opec , russia 's oil and gas bonanza has underwritten efforts by president vladimir putin to centralise and even renationalise the country 's energy sector .
and several african countries are riding high on oil demand .
the tiny states of equatorial guinea and sao tome & principe are high on the list of popular destinations for oil firms these days - although their populations seem unlikely to see the kind of benefits that many venezuelans are now enjoying .

crude oil prices have surged to record levels of over $ 72 a barrel - a rise of more than 18 % in 2006 , and a threefold gain over the past three years .
no sign yet of oil prices dropping back to earth the effect is to heighten fears about inflation in importing countries - and to exacerbate international tensions .
the price of us-traded light , sweet crude hit a record of $ 72.40 on 19 april , while uk-traded brent crude from the north sea has raced to an all-time high of $ 74 .
bbc news looks at the factors that are driving oil prices higher .
rising demand the biggest catalyst for oil 's seemingly remorseless rise in recent years has been the simplest economic driver there is : the balance between demand and a supply .
for starters , oil demand is at an all-time high .
the big change has been the continued breakneck economic expansion of the developing world 's biggest economies , india and china .
with more than a billion people each , and sustained annual growth rates of 7 % in india and 9 % in china , manufacturers and consumers are sucking in energy at an ever-increasing rate .
but on top of that , there is little sign that demand from industrialised countries is flagging .
in the us in particular , the gas-guzzling sports utility vehicle -lrb- suv -rrb- still dominates the car market .
economic growth rates , already strong in the us , are likely to pick up in europe this year .
oil producers ' group opec says demand is up a million barrels a day over the past year - a little more than 1 % .
but some projections suggest that over the next quarter of a century , demand could soar from the current 90 million barrels a day to as much as 140 million .
security fears more recently , though , security threats to the world oil supply have risen up the agenda .
predictions that iraq 's oil production would increase dramatically following the us-led invasion of iraq have proved over-optimistic due to the deteriorating security situation in that country .
nigeria , another key member of oil producers ' group opec , has its own security problems .
much of its oil comes from the niger delta region , and local activists demanding a bigger share of revenues have repeatedly shut down production , invaded platforms and refineries , and even taken foreign workers hostage .
china 's booming economy is sucking in a huge amount of oil now , though , it is iran , another of the world 's biggest oil producers , which dominates the headlines .
the country 's push to acquire nuclear power and , many believe , nuclear weapons has sparked concern in the international community - and raised the spectre that iran could use its own oil supplies as a bargaining chip at best and a weapon at worst .
and barely-veiled threats from the us suggesting that military action remains a live option have further accentuated fears .

brian heale , 71 , criticised cardiff bus ' " petty " rules when he was refused entry for carrying paint last week .
now relatives of betty andrews , 79 , has said she walked over two miles home after a similar incident last year .
having received an apology for the " wholly unacceptable " incident , her family said the bus company should communicate regulations more clearly .
but cardiff bus said that it was not possible to " plaster " posters detailing health and safety regulations on their buses .
mrs andrews tried to get on a bus on crwys road , in the cathays area of cardiff , but was told by the driver that carrying paint on buses was against regulations .
the pensioner 's granddaughter , verity andrews , said : " the driver turned around and said ' you ca n't come on here with that ' .
i think she was rather shocked .
they are allowing things like personal stereos and mobile phones on buses - but not a pensioner holding a tin of paint peter andrews " she did not know what to say , so she just got off the bus .
because she could not get on one bus , she thought she would not be allowed on another and she walked home to colwill road . "
mrs andrews ' son , peter , said his mother had been in a " hell of a state " by the time she got back to her home in llandaff north .
he told the bbc news website : " my major criticism is that they fail to communicate what you can or can not carry on a bus .
" they are allowing things like personal stereos and mobile phones on buses - but not a pensioner holding a tin of paint . "
mr andrews said that cardiff bus subsequently apologised to mrs andrews and sent his mother a bunch of flowers .
a letter from managing director david brown said he was " extremely disappointed " to hear about the incident which he said was " wholly unacceptable " .
a spokesman for the bus company said a leaflet had since been produced with information about what could or could not be carried on buses .
paint-carrying oap thrown off bus but the spokesman said it was impossible to communicate all conditions of travel to customers .
" there is no benefit or gain to be had by putting posters all over the place , because we ca n't plaster cardiff buses with posters giving the minutiae of what can or ca n't be done on buses - of which carrying paint is just one of many , " he said .
cardiff bus said " serious consideration " was given to all complaints and that an apology had been made following the september incident .
the spokesman added : " in the same month , two brand new and sealed tins of paint were dropped by another passenger on a no 61 bus , which caused considerable damage to the bus and inconvenience to many passengers because it had to be taken out of service for extensive cleaning .
" accidents with paint cans then do happen on buses , which is why they are included in the uk-wide list of hazardous materials on public transport .
" we can , however , assure all passengers that our mission statement and customer care philosophy endeavours to strike a balance between complying with uk-wide safety regulations on and the common sense transportation needs of passengers - especially the elderly . "

the exclusion zone around the chernobyl nuclear power station is teeming with life .
as humans were evacuated from the area 20 years ago , animals moved in .
existing populations multiplied and species not seen for decades , such as the lynx and eagle owl , began to return .
there are even tantalising footprints of a bear , an animal that has not trodden this part of ukraine for centuries .
" animals do n't seem to sense radiation and will occupy an area regardless of the radiation condition , " says radioecologist sergey gaschak .
" a lot of birds are nesting inside the sarcophagus , " he adds , referring to the steel and concrete shield erected over the reactor that exploded in 1986 .
" starlings , pigeons , swallows , redstart - i saw nests , and i found eggs . "
there may be plutonium in the zone , but there is no herbicide or pesticide , no industry , no traffic , and marshlands are no longer being drained .
there is nothing to disturb the wild boar - said to have multiplied eightfold between 1986 and 1988 - except its similarly resurgent predator , the wolf .
inedible the picture was not quite so rosy in the first weeks and months after of the disaster , when radiation levels were much , much higher .
four square kilometres of pine forest in the immediate vicinity of the reactor went ginger brown and died , earning the name of the red forest .
some animals in the worst-hit areas also died or stopped reproducing .
mice embryos simply dissolved , while horses left on an island 6km from the power plant died when their thyroid glands disintegrated .
cattle on the same island were stunted due to thyroid damage , but the next generation were found to be surprisingly normal .
now it 's typical for animals to be radioactive - too radioactive for humans to eat safely - but otherwise healthy .
adaptation there is a distinction to be made between animals which stay in one place , such as mice , and larger animals - elks , say - which move in and out of contaminated land as they range over large areas .
the animals that wander widely end up with a lower dose of radiation than animals stuck in a radiation hotspot .
but there are signs that these unfortunate creatures can adapt to their circumstances .
sergey gaschak has experimented on mice in the red forest , parts of which are slowly growing back , albeit with stunted and misshapen trees .
" we marked animals then recaptured them again much later , " he says .
" and we found they lived as long as animals in relatively clean areas . "
the next step was to take these other mice and put them in an enclosure in the red forest .
" they felt not very well , " sergey says .
" the distinction between the local and newcomer animals was very evident . "
mutation in all his research , sergey has only found one mouse with cancer-like symptoms .
zone dwellers reappeared : lynx , eagle owl , great white egret , nesting swans , and possibly a bear introduced : european bison , przewalski 's horse booming mammals : badger , beaver , boar , deer , elk , fox , hare , otter , raccoon dog , wolf booming birds : aquatic warbler , azure tit , black grouse , black stork , crane , white-tailed eagle he has found ample evidence of dna mutations , but nothing that affected the animals ' physiology or reproductive ability .
" nothing with two heads , " he says .
mary mycio , author of wormwood forest , a natural history of the chernobyl zone , points out that a mutant animal in the wild will usually die and be eaten before scientists can observe it .
and in general , she notes , scientists study populations as a whole , and are not that interested in what happens to particular individuals .
nuclear guardian but she too argues that the benefits to wildlife of removing people from the zone , have far outweighed any harm from radiation .
in her book she quotes the british scientist and environmentalist james lovelock , who wrote approvingly in the daily telegraph in 2001 of the " unscheduled appearance " of wildlife at chernobyl .
he went on : " i have wondered if the small volumes of nuclear waste from power production should be stored in tropical forests and other habitats in need of a reliable guardian against their destruction by greedy developers " .
a large part of the chernobyl zone within belarus has already officially been turned into a nature reserve .
sergey gaschak wants ukraine to follow suit and to turn its 2,500 sq km of evacuated land into a reserve or national park .
unlike the ukrainian green party , he is not bothered if the government goes ahead with plans to build a deep deposit in the zone for nuclear waste from all over the country .
he says the eagle owl will not care two hoots .

on 17 april that year , about 1,500 cia-trained cuban exiles invaded the bay on the southern coast of cuba .
mr castro 's army vastly outnumbered the exiles and president john f kennedy decided not to provide air support .
elian in audience a huge banner in the havana theatre declared that the battle was yankee imperialism 's first military defeat in the americas .
the main event of the evening was a speech by the man who led cuba 's defence then and has led the country ever since .
president castro drew parallels between the bay of pigs and what he portrayed as continued american aggression around the world , particularly in the middle east .
the 79-year-old leader also swapped jokes with some of the elderly members of the audience .
" we might die old in years , " he assured them , " but we will be young at heart . "
some of those attending the event were born well after the 1960s .
among them was elian gonzalez , the young boy shipwrecked when he left cuba on a raft six years ago and who was later subject to a bitter custody battle between his relatives in cuba and the us .
also listening to the speech was a large group of cuban students who are studying social work .
they have been recruited by the cuban leadership as the frontline in an ongoing battle against corruption across the country .
