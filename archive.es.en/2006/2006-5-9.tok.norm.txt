meiwes was originally given a lighter sentence . meiwes , 44 , had told the court that his victim , an engineer from berlin , had a death wish and begged to be killed .
" he had wanted everything just the way it eventually happened , " the man known as the " cannibal of rotenburg " said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes ' crime was international news it was the second time meiwes was tried for killing bernd jürgen brandes in rotenburg in western germany in march 2001 .
he was originally convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to eight and a half years in prison in 2004 . judges says sentence too light but on appeal , a federal judge dismissed the sentence as too lenient and ordered a retrial on the higher charge of murder . meiwes , a computer technician , met brandes after advertising on the internet for a " slaughter victim " and invited him to his farm house .
the two men had sex before meiwes severed brandes ' penis , which they then fried and tried to eat .
he later stabbed his bleeding , unconscious victim in the throat and cut away other parts of his body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victim , bernd jürgen brandes meiwes admitted that he eventually ate some 20 kilograms -lrb- 44 pounds -rrb- of brandes ' flesh , accompanied by potatoes and a pepper or wine sauce , served on " good crockery . " his lawyers had argued that he was not guilty of murder but rather of the crime of " killing on demand " which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison . " the ultimate kick " but what has fascinated the media and the public was the testimony in which meiwes revealed his obsessions and lifted the lid on an underworld of cannibalism , which meiwes claims counts about 800 members in germany . meiwes has told the court he regretted killing brandes and has apologized to his victim 's boyfriend .
but he has remained unrepentant about eating his flesh , saying it was the " ultimate kick " both of them were seeking . psychologists have told the court meiwes was a mentally sane , if lonely , man who held down a steady job .
the accused has said that his cannibal fantasies began in his childhood , when his father abandoned his family , and he dreamt of eating one of his school friends so that somebody would stay with him forever . he has also said that from his prison cell he still fantasized about killing people when he saw attractive young bodies on television or in magazines . " i find this extremely worrying , " state prosecutor annette von schmiedeberg told the court last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film he videotaped his meeting with brandes , in what prosecutors said was a bid to make sure he could watch it again later to satisfy his fantasies . the case inspired a us-made horror film titled " butterfly , a grimm love story , " but meiwes succeeded in blocking its release on the grounds that it infringed on his privacy . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannibal of rotenburg faces life sentence as retrial nears end a german state prosecutor on wednesday demanded a life sentence for self-confessed cannibal armin meiwes , saying he killed and ate a man to fulfill his sexual urges .

" we need to make sure we do n't start something we can not stop and which could get out of control afterwards , " steinmeier said on tuesday in an interview with german public television station zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says there are unanswered questions when it comes to iran he said " five or six questions are still open " before a draft resolution could be concluded calling for iran to halt its uranium enrichment . zdf said steinmeier had estimated it could take two weeks before they resolved their differences , but did n't provide any details from the german foreign minister supporting that timeframe .
russia and china have resisted the draft resolution . " important and difficult meeting " earlier britain 's new foreign secretary margaret beckett , making her debut on the international scene , called the session an " important and difficult meeting . " " everyone believed iran must give up its nuclear enrichment program , " beckett told reporters .
" it 's the way to achieve that we have to agree -lrb- on -rrb- . " participants said the ministers , who met for two hours on monday without aides before going into dinner , agreed on the need to keep iran from using its civilian nuclear program to develop atomic bombs . but a senior us official reported no progress in melting russian and chinese resistance to american calls for tough action under chapter seven of the un charter , which would authorize sanctions or the use of force . " there is not yet agreement on the tactics and what 's most pronounced is that there is no agreement yet that this should be a chapter seven resolution , " said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
" based on tonight 's meeting , i would not expect a resolution to be voted on and adopted this week . " further talks needed russian news agencies quoted moscow 's top envoy , sergei lavrov , as calling for further negotiations , including more direct talks between major powers and iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister lavrov , left with condoleezza rice " there was general agreement on the need to create conditions for resuming direct negotiations on iran 's nuclear program , " interfax news agency quoted lavrov as telling russian reporters in new york . france 's chief diplomat philippe douste-blazy said the ministers discussed " incentives and dissuasive measures according to the iranian response " in the confrontation . among the incentives raised by the french minister were cooperation in civilian nuclear energy , increased commercial and technological ties and security guarantees that the united states has refused to provide . us secretary of sate condoleezza rice had earlier monday billed the talks as " a time for the international community to come together and say with very great clarity it 's time for iran to accede to the demands of the international community . " us unimpressed by ahmadinejad 's letter the ministers also discussed the letter made public monday from iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad offering to seek ways to ease tensions with the united states . us officials said the 18-page rambling letter was more a philosophical treatise than a political overture and did not change washington 's position in the nuclear dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us says ahmadinejad 's letter contains nothing new " there is nothing in this letter that in any way addresses any of the issues really that are on the table in the international community , " rice told the editorial board of the associated press news agency monday . " it is most assuredly not a proposal , " she said , according to a state department transcript .
" there is nothing in here that would suggest that we 're on any different course than we were before we got the letter .

debate over quotes comparing the genocide of the jews and of the sinti and roma had stalled construction . the government will finance the 2 million euro -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- memorial , which is to be built between the reichstag and brandenburg gate in central berlin .
federal culture secretary bernd neumann announced to journalists on monday that construction would begin quickly , pending agreement from the social democrats . romani rose , head of the central council of german sinti and roma , said the agreement is an " important step " toward officially recognizing the genocide committed on the minority group .
he said he was " very happy " about the agreement . debate about a central inscription on the memorial has raged for years , hampering the memorial 's construction .

the murder of hundreds of thousands of sinti and roma is considered the second-largest act of genocide carried out by nazis in europe , following the killing of millions of jews . the final information panel is to contain quotes by former german president roman herzog and former chancellor helmut schmidt .
the central council has long insisted that the quote from herzog be used in which he drew parallels between the annihilation of the sinti and roma and the holocaust of the jews .
schmidt deemed the killing of the sinti and roma genocide in 1982 . another association of sinti , called the " sinti alliance , " has been at odds with the central council .

meiwes was originally given a lighter sentence . meiwes , 44 , had told the court that his victim , an engineer from berlin , had a death wish and begged to be killed .
" he had wanted everything just the way it eventually happened , " the man known as the " cannibal of rotenburg " said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes ' crime was international news it was the second time meiwes was tried for killing bernd jürgen brandes in rotenburg in western germany in march 2001 .
he was originally convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to eight and a half years in prison in 2004 . judges says sentence too light but on appeal , a federal judge dismissed the sentence as too lenient and ordered a retrial on the higher charge of murder . meiwes , a computer technician , met brandes after advertising on the internet for a " slaughter victim " and invited him to his farm house .
the two men had sex before meiwes severed brandes ' penis , which they then fried and tried to eat .
he later stabbed his bleeding , unconscious victim in the throat and cut away other parts of his body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victim , bernd jürgen brandes meiwes admitted that he eventually ate some 20 kilograms -lrb- 44 pounds -rrb- of brandes ' flesh , accompanied by potatoes and a pepper or wine sauce , served on " good crockery . " his lawyers had argued that he was not guilty of murder but rather of the crime of " killing on demand " which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison . " the ultimate kick " but what has fascinated the media and the public was the testimony in which meiwes revealed his obsessions and lifted the lid on an underworld of cannibalism , which meiwes claims counts about 800 members in germany . meiwes has told the court he regretted killing brandes and has apologized to his victim 's boyfriend .
but he has remained unrepentant about eating his flesh , saying it was the " ultimate kick " both of them were seeking . psychologists have told the court meiwes was a mentally sane , if lonely , man who held down a steady job .
the accused has said that his cannibal fantasies began in his childhood , when his father abandoned his family , and he dreamt of eating one of his school friends so that somebody would stay with him forever . he has also said that from his prison cell he still fantasized about killing people when he saw attractive young bodies on television or in magazines . " i find this extremely worrying , " state prosecutor annette von schmiedeberg told the court last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film he videotaped his meeting with brandes , in what prosecutors said was a bid to make sure he could watch it again later to satisfy his fantasies . the case inspired a us-made horror film titled " butterfly , a grimm love story , " but meiwes succeeded in blocking its release on the grounds that it infringed on his privacy . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannibal of rotenburg faces life sentence as retrial nears end a german state prosecutor on wednesday demanded a life sentence for self-confessed cannibal armin meiwes , saying he killed and ate a man to fulfill his sexual urges .

meiwes was originally given a lighter sentence . meiwes , 44 , had told the court that his victim , an engineer from berlin , had a death wish and begged to be killed .
" he had wanted everything just the way it eventually happened , " the man known as the " cannibal of rotenburg " said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes ' crime was international news it was the second time meiwes was tried for killing bernd jürgen brandes in rotenburg in western germany in march 2001 .
he was originally convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to eight and a half years in prison in 2004 . judges says sentence too light but on appeal , a federal judge dismissed the sentence as too lenient and ordered a retrial on the higher charge of murder . meiwes , a computer technician , met brandes after advertising on the internet for a " slaughter victim " and invited him to his farm house .
the two men had sex before meiwes severed brandes ' penis , which they then fried and tried to eat .
he later stabbed his bleeding , unconscious victim in the throat and cut away other parts of his body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victim , bernd jürgen brandes meiwes admitted that he eventually ate some 20 kilograms -lrb- 44 pounds -rrb- of brandes ' flesh , accompanied by potatoes and a pepper or wine sauce , served on " good crockery .

" the ultimate kick " but what has fascinated the media and the public was the testimony in which meiwes revealed his obsessions and lifted the lid on an underworld of cannibalism , which meiwes claims counts about 800 members in germany . meiwes has told the court he regretted killing brandes and has apologized to his victim 's boyfriend .
but he has remained unrepentant about eating his flesh , saying it was the " ultimate kick " both of them were seeking . psychologists have told the court meiwes was a mentally sane , if lonely , man who held down a steady job .
the accused has said that his cannibal fantasies began in his childhood , when his father abandoned his family , and he dreamt of eating one of his school friends so that somebody would stay with him forever . he has also said that from his prison cell he still fantasized about killing people when he saw attractive young bodies on television or in magazines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's foreign intelligence agency in the spotlight germany ’ s foreign intelligence agency turns 50 german politicians to face grilling as bnd inquiry begins europe -pipe- 09.05.2006 cia affair becoming a sharper thorn in transatlantic relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain , germany and others are investigating " extraordinary rendition " flights european investigations into secret cia flights and interrogation centers go on as mounting evidence showing they existed on european soil continues to be a diplomatic headache . in a statement that generated little public interest on thursday , the us announced that it would brief european officials about secret intelligence activities such as rendition flights allegedly carried out on european soil . but within diplomatic circles , the statement by us attorney general alberto gonzales pledging to brief a european parliament delegation to washington this week on clandestine intelligence activities caused a stir . " it signals that the us is feeling pressure over an issue they thought would die down and has n't , " said one german diplomat familiar with the issue . european officials pushing harder european leaders were initially slow to react to allegations of secret flights carrying suspected terrorists landing on their soil after reports of them first leaked in november .
experts say that is because european governments were more informed than they wanted to admit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giovanni claudio fava says the flights were not " tourist " flights but since eu commission officials first downplayed the issue late last year , the council of europe , a human rights watchdog , has continued to investigate .
at the same time , countries such as germany and italy are probing the issue - the bundestag will hold more hearings this week to find out what german officials knew .
most officials say it is unlikely that european governments were kept in the dark . meanwhile , an eu parliamentary committee issued a report last month saying that the cia carried out as many as 1,000 secret flights in the past five years , transporting suspected terrorists to third countries .
and parliamentarians took eu foreign policy chief javier solana to task for failing to probe the issue more aggressively during a parliamentary inquiry last week where he condemned such activities but said he did not have the jurisdiction to demand answers . " i have no information whatsoever that tells me with certainty that any of the accusations , allegations , rumors , etcetera that have taken place in the last year 's time are true , " he told parliamentarians . deputies shook their heads at such evasive responses . " i regret profoundly you say that you do n't intend to take any leadership role here , " one deputy responded .
" you are in a way washing your hands of responsibility . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german khalid al-masri told eu deputies of his alleged abduction by the cia the european parliament is an elected body and is considered more representative of european public opinion than other eu institutions .
and since the public has kept this issue in the forefront , officials such as italian eu parliament member giovanni claudio fava , a member of the special inquiry committee , said the eu parliament will continue to push hard for answers .
already , they have heard testimony from people such as kuwaiti-born german citizen khalid al-masri , who said he was detained by foreign agents in macedonia on dec .
31 , 2003 , while on holiday , flown to afghanistan and tortured . " our job is to find out the truth , and if the truth is that there have been illegal cia flights on our territory we ca n't remain silent , " he told reporters .
" these were not tourist flights . " no longer a wall of silence at first , us officials said little about the issue .
but experts in transatlantic relations say that increased european pressure and fears of weakened intelligence cooperation is changing that . last week , gonzales said that " rendition is an activity that is practiced by the united states and other countries . " and john bellinger , advisor to us secretary of state condoleezza rice , flew to brussels to meet with eu and nato officials last week and admitted that there had been secret intelligence flights even as he dismissed the number .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the topic did n't come up during merkel 's us visit last week " these allegations that there have been thousands of flights with the implication that they all have got detainees on them and worse , detainees bound for mistreatment is simply absurd , " he said during a press conference .
" there have been , as we have said , very few cases of rendition , the last one about three years ago .
many of these flights that have occurred may be carrying analysts , officials engaged in counter-terrorism cooperation and forensic evidence . " hurting intelligence cooperation us officials say that the rumors and furor over the flights are hurting intelligence cooperation . " this furor over renditions , and the furor over the flights alone , and the suggestion that flights alone are somehow improper or engaged in illegal activity is undermining intelligence cooperation , " bellinger said .
" next time , the us may be reluctant to bring people to europe or exchange information . " but european willingness to cooperate has also been threatened . " there is still interest in ongoing cooperation but only if the suspicion is eliminated that the cia has betrayed its european partners , " said henning riecke , an expert on transatlantic relations and security policy at the german council on foreign relations . regardless , eu parliamentarians will meet with us officials such as us assistant secretary of state daniel fried and bellinger this week to get more details .
but us officials caution that they will not tell eu officials the details of every flight because of security concerns . " intelligence activities by their very nature are simply carried out in secret , " bellinger said . jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lawmakers probe macedonia 's role in cia prisoner affair european lawmakers probing allegations that cia planes secretly transported prisoners through european countries are in macedonia to investigate the role of the balkan nation .

" it signals that the us is feeling pressure over an issue they thought would die down and has n't , " said one german diplomat familiar with the issue . european officials pushing harder european leaders were initially slow to react to allegations of secret flights carrying suspected terrorists landing on their soil after reports of them first leaked in november .
experts say that is because european governments were more informed than they wanted to admit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giovanni claudio fava says the flights were not " tourist " flights but since eu commission officials first downplayed the issue late last year , the council of europe , a human rights watchdog , has continued to investigate .
at the same time , countries such as germany and italy are probing the issue - the bundestag will hold more hearings this week to find out what german officials knew .
most officials say it is unlikely that european governments were kept in the dark . meanwhile , an eu parliamentary committee issued a report last month saying that the cia carried out as many as 1,000 secret flights in the past five years , transporting suspected terrorists to third countries .
and parliamentarians took eu foreign policy chief javier solana to task for failing to probe the issue more aggressively during a parliamentary inquiry last week where he condemned such activities but said he did not have the jurisdiction to demand answers . " i have no information whatsoever that tells me with certainty that any of the accusations , allegations , rumors , etcetera that have taken place in the last year 's time are true , " he told parliamentarians . deputies shook their heads at such evasive responses . " i regret profoundly you say that you do n't intend to take any leadership role here , " one deputy responded .
" you are in a way washing your hands of responsibility . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german khalid al-masri told eu deputies of his alleged abduction by the cia the european parliament is an elected body and is considered more representative of european public opinion than other eu institutions .
and since the public has kept this issue in the forefront , officials such as italian eu parliament member giovanni claudio fava , a member of the special inquiry committee , said the eu parliament will continue to push hard for answers .
already , they have heard testimony from people such as kuwaiti-born german citizen khalid al-masri , who said he was detained by foreign agents in macedonia on dec .
31 , 2003 , while on holiday , flown to afghanistan and tortured . " our job is to find out the truth , and if the truth is that there have been illegal cia flights on our territory we ca n't remain silent , " he told reporters .
" these were not tourist flights . " no longer a wall of silence at first , us officials said little about the issue .
but experts in transatlantic relations say that increased european pressure and fears of weakened intelligence cooperation is changing that . last week , gonzales said that " rendition is an activity that is practiced by the united states and other countries . " and john bellinger , advisor to us secretary of state condoleezza rice , flew to brussels to meet with eu and nato officials last week and admitted that there had been secret intelligence flights even as he dismissed the number .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the topic did n't come up during merkel 's us visit last week " these allegations that there have been thousands of flights with the implication that they all have got detainees on them and worse , detainees bound for mistreatment is simply absurd , " he said during a press conference .
" there have been , as we have said , very few cases of rendition , the last one about three years ago .
many of these flights that have occurred may be carrying analysts , officials engaged in counter-terrorism cooperation and forensic evidence . " hurting intelligence cooperation us officials say that the rumors and furor over the flights are hurting intelligence cooperation . " this furor over renditions , and the furor over the flights alone , and the suggestion that flights alone are somehow improper or engaged in illegal activity is undermining intelligence cooperation , " bellinger said .
" next time , the us may be reluctant to bring people to europe or exchange information . " but european willingness to cooperate has also been threatened . " there is still interest in ongoing cooperation but only if the suspicion is eliminated that the cia has betrayed its european partners , " said henning riecke , an expert on transatlantic relations and security policy at the german council on foreign relations . regardless , eu parliamentarians will meet with us officials such as us assistant secretary of state daniel fried and bellinger this week to get more details .
but us officials caution that they will not tell eu officials the details of every flight because of security concerns . " intelligence activities by their very nature are simply carried out in secret , " bellinger said . jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lawmakers probe macedonia 's role in cia prisoner affair european lawmakers probing allegations that cia planes secretly transported prisoners through european countries are in macedonia to investigate the role of the balkan nation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 09.05.2006 bush and merkel changing face of us-german relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel invited bush back to germany on her second visit to the usa dw-world.de readers commented on the status of us-german ties and the effects of the transatlantic relationship in the rest of the world , especially in the middle east . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i think germany should remain leery of bush 's overtures toward germany and chancellor merkel .
he and his administration still have the " you 're with us or against us " mentality .
i think one need only to look at current domestic policy in the us to confirm the continuation of the black or white policy .
beware of the snake charmer .
thomas jones , los angeles , usa bush wants to win any country which is not firm in its foreign policy and make it do his .
for the last years germany aroused respect and it will be a pity if it kneels before the us . - cheludmila454 chancellor merkel absolutely deserves the credit for the vastly improved relationship between germany and the us .
she gets total respect from george bush and here is why .
she is consistent : she does n't say one thing now and another thing later , or to a different audience .
she is good-tempered and does n't show anger when being firm .
instead she is level and steady and does n't try to be showy .
she knows how to disagree without being disagreeable - and she does disagree , and she does hold firm and get her way .
but she makes bush feel ok about it .
bush acts like he 's got more sense when he 's around her .
i think this lady really has good sense and a wonderful personality for her position , and is the best thing to happen to foreign policy dynamics in a long time . - wiley horne , usa americans were going to be happy with anyone other than schröder .
people outside the united states , must understand that america and her citizens do not regret iraq .
it was a reaction to a decade-plus of hostilities from the arab world .
it may have nothing to do with sept.11 , however it allowed us to remove a long standing enemy .
americans are realizing that europe is for itself and that only a few countries like israel and australia are her true allies .
americans are returning to isolation and the world is not prepared for it . - bryan hobbs the woman is too stupid to realize that she is being used by the usa .
her mind is as drab as her dress , and she is a menace to germany 's relations with the middle east .
the woman fails to realize the implications of the gas pipeline being directly laid across the baltic to germany .
germany needs to keep clear of all middle east confrontations .
the future of germany , as the major power and leader in europe , lies in the east with trade , which will lead to the reduction of german unemployment and economic salvation as the industrial giant of europe . - kevin hendstock , australia compiled by dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : beware of the crocodile 's smile angela merkel received many plaudits during her recent visit to washington .
but the hospitality afforded her may be part of a ruse to lure germany into the us foreign policy fold , according to dw 's peter philipp .
-lrb- may 8 , 2006 -rrb- bush : germany plays decisive role in war on terror us president george w. bush has told a german paper that germany plays a decisive role in the war on terrorism and that chancellor angela merkel 's actions on the iranian nuclear issue had been key .
-lrb- may 7 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : merkel knows how to be friendly but firm germany 's chancellor has headed to the us for the second time in four months , proving that german-american ties are warmer than they 've been for years .
dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says all the credit goes to angela merkel .

adidas is an official sponsor of the competition and is to provide the official match ball as well as kit sponsorship for six of the leading national teams in the competition . on the basis of a surge in demand for world cup merchandise , hainer announced that adidas expected to sell football equipment valued at 1.2 billion euros this year , rather than the previously expected 1.0 billion euros .

adidas enthusiastic about reebock commenting on results for the first-quarter , hainer also pointed to the integration during the period of us brand reebok , which was acquired by adidas in january for more than 3.0 billion euros . " the adidas group has got off to a powerful start in the first quarter 2006 , " said company chief executive herbert hainer .
" we have made important progress in successfully integrating reebok within the adidas group and are well positioned for the world cup , which is only a month away . " the group maintained its forecasts for 2006 of growth of at least 10 percent in sales and net profit .
in morning trading on the frankfurt stock exchange , shares in adidas gained 2.11 percent to 170.93 euros in a broadly weaker market .

" i regret profoundly you say that you do n't intend to take any leadership role here , " one deputy responded .
" you are in a way washing your hands of responsibility . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german khalid al-masri told eu deputies of his alleged abduction by the cia the european parliament is an elected body and is considered more representative of european public opinion than other eu institutions .
and since the public has kept this issue in the forefront , officials such as italian eu parliament member giovanni claudio fava , a member of the special inquiry committee , said the eu parliament will continue to push hard for answers .
already , they have heard testimony from people such as kuwaiti-born german citizen khalid al-masri , who said he was detained by foreign agents in macedonia on dec .
31 , 2003 , while on holiday , flown to afghanistan and tortured . " our job is to find out the truth , and if the truth is that there have been illegal cia flights on our territory we ca n't remain silent , " he told reporters .
" these were not tourist flights . " no longer a wall of silence at first , us officials said little about the issue .
but experts in transatlantic relations say that increased european pressure and fears of weakened intelligence cooperation is changing that . last week , gonzales said that " rendition is an activity that is practiced by the united states and other countries . " and john bellinger , advisor to us secretary of state condoleezza rice , flew to brussels to meet with eu and nato officials last week and admitted that there had been secret intelligence flights even as he dismissed the number .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the topic did n't come up during merkel 's us visit last week " these allegations that there have been thousands of flights with the implication that they all have got detainees on them and worse , detainees bound for mistreatment is simply absurd , " he said during a press conference .
" there have been , as we have said , very few cases of rendition , the last one about three years ago .
many of these flights that have occurred may be carrying analysts , officials engaged in counter-terrorism cooperation and forensic evidence . " hurting intelligence cooperation us officials say that the rumors and furor over the flights are hurting intelligence cooperation . " this furor over renditions , and the furor over the flights alone , and the suggestion that flights alone are somehow improper or engaged in illegal activity is undermining intelligence cooperation , " bellinger said .
" next time , the us may be reluctant to bring people to europe or exchange information . " but european willingness to cooperate has also been threatened . " there is still interest in ongoing cooperation but only if the suspicion is eliminated that the cia has betrayed its european partners , " said henning riecke , an expert on transatlantic relations and security policy at the german council on foreign relations . regardless , eu parliamentarians will meet with us officials such as us assistant secretary of state daniel fried and bellinger this week to get more details .
but us officials caution that they will not tell eu officials the details of every flight because of security concerns . " intelligence activities by their very nature are simply carried out in secret , " bellinger said . jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lawmakers probe macedonia 's role in cia prisoner affair european lawmakers probing allegations that cia planes secretly transported prisoners through european countries are in macedonia to investigate the role of the balkan nation .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i think germany should remain leery of bush 's overtures toward germany and chancellor merkel .
he and his administration still have the " you 're with us or against us " mentality .
i think one need only to look at current domestic policy in the us to confirm the continuation of the black or white policy .
beware of the snake charmer .
thomas jones , los angeles , usa bush wants to win any country which is not firm in its foreign policy and make it do his .
for the last years germany aroused respect and it will be a pity if it kneels before the us . - cheludmila454 chancellor merkel absolutely deserves the credit for the vastly improved relationship between germany and the us .
she gets total respect from george bush and here is why .
she is consistent : she does n't say one thing now and another thing later , or to a different audience .
she is good-tempered and does n't show anger when being firm .
instead she is level and steady and does n't try to be showy .
she knows how to disagree without being disagreeable - and she does disagree , and she does hold firm and get her way .
but she makes bush feel ok about it .
bush acts like he 's got more sense when he 's around her .
i think this lady really has good sense and a wonderful personality for her position , and is the best thing to happen to foreign policy dynamics in a long time . - wiley horne , usa americans were going to be happy with anyone other than schröder .
people outside the united states , must understand that america and her citizens do not regret iraq .
it was a reaction to a decade-plus of hostilities from the arab world .
it may have nothing to do with sept.11 , however it allowed us to remove a long standing enemy .
americans are realizing that europe is for itself and that only a few countries like israel and australia are her true allies .
americans are returning to isolation and the world is not prepared for it . - bryan hobbs the woman is too stupid to realize that she is being used by the usa .
her mind is as drab as her dress , and she is a menace to germany 's relations with the middle east .
the woman fails to realize the implications of the gas pipeline being directly laid across the baltic to germany .
germany needs to keep clear of all middle east confrontations .
the future of germany , as the major power and leader in europe , lies in the east with trade , which will lead to the reduction of german unemployment and economic salvation as the industrial giant of europe . - kevin hendstock , australia compiled by dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : beware of the crocodile 's smile angela merkel received many plaudits during her recent visit to washington .

" we need to make sure we do n't start something we can not stop and which could get out of control afterwards , " steinmeier said on tuesday in an interview with german public television station zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says there are unanswered questions when it comes to iran he said " five or six questions are still open " before a draft resolution could be concluded calling for iran to halt its uranium enrichment . zdf said steinmeier had estimated it could take two weeks before they resolved their differences , but did n't provide any details from the german foreign minister supporting that timeframe .
russia and china have resisted the draft resolution . " important and difficult meeting " earlier britain 's new foreign secretary margaret beckett , making her debut on the international scene , called the session an " important and difficult meeting . " " everyone believed iran must give up its nuclear enrichment program , " beckett told reporters .
" it 's the way to achieve that we have to agree -lrb- on -rrb- . " participants said the ministers , who met for two hours on monday without aides before going into dinner , agreed on the need to keep iran from using its civilian nuclear program to develop atomic bombs . but a senior us official reported no progress in melting russian and chinese resistance to american calls for tough action under chapter seven of the un charter , which would authorize sanctions or the use of force . " there is not yet agreement on the tactics and what 's most pronounced is that there is no agreement yet that this should be a chapter seven resolution , " said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .

sales in the first quarter totaled 2.459 billion euros , an increase of 47 percent .

adidas is an official sponsor of the competition and is to provide the official match ball as well as kit sponsorship for six of the leading national teams in the competition . on the basis of a surge in demand for world cup merchandise , hainer announced that adidas expected to sell football equipment valued at 1.2 billion euros this year , rather than the previously expected 1.0 billion euros .

adidas enthusiastic about reebock commenting on results for the first-quarter , hainer also pointed to the integration during the period of us brand reebok , which was acquired by adidas in january for more than 3.0 billion euros . " the adidas group has got off to a powerful start in the first quarter 2006 , " said company chief executive herbert hainer .
" we have made important progress in successfully integrating reebok within the adidas group and are well positioned for the world cup , which is only a month away . " the group maintained its forecasts for 2006 of growth of at least 10 percent in sales and net profit .

debate over quotes comparing the genocide of the jews and of the sinti and roma had stalled construction . the government will finance the 2 million euro -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- memorial , which is to be built between the reichstag and brandenburg gate in central berlin .
federal culture secretary bernd neumann announced to journalists on monday that construction would begin quickly , pending agreement from the social democrats . romani rose , head of the central council of german sinti and roma , said the agreement is an " important step " toward officially recognizing the genocide committed on the minority group .
he said he was " very happy " about the agreement . debate about a central inscription on the memorial has raged for years , hampering the memorial 's construction .
now , the various sides agreed that the memorial , which will be designed by artist dani karavan and shaped like a fountain , will not contain an inscription .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazis used face masks of sinti and roma to " prove racial inferiority " instead , the names of the nazi concentration camps auschwitz , treblinka and buchenwald will be chiseled into the slabs leading up to the memorial .
an additional tablet will display the sentence " we commemorate all the roma who were victims of the systematic genocide in nazi-occupied europe . "
schmidt recognized genocide information panels will display a chronology of the exclusion , persecution and annihilation of the sinti and roma .
the murder of hundreds of thousands of sinti and roma is considered the second-largest act of genocide carried out by nazis in europe , following the killing of millions of jews . the final information panel is to contain quotes by former german president roman herzog and former chancellor helmut schmidt .
the central council has long insisted that the quote from herzog be used in which he drew parallels between the annihilation of the sinti and roma and the holocaust of the jews .
schmidt deemed the killing of the sinti and roma genocide in 1982 . another association of sinti , called the " sinti alliance , " has been at odds with the central council .

debate over quotes comparing the genocide of the jews and of the sinti and roma had stalled construction . the government will finance the 2 million euro -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- memorial , which is to be built between the reichstag and brandenburg gate in central berlin .
federal culture secretary bernd neumann announced to journalists on monday that construction would begin quickly , pending agreement from the social democrats . romani rose , head of the central council of german sinti and roma , said the agreement is an " important step " toward officially recognizing the genocide committed on the minority group .
he said he was " very happy " about the agreement . debate about a central inscription on the memorial has raged for years , hampering the memorial 's construction .
now , the various sides agreed that the memorial , which will be designed by artist dani karavan and shaped like a fountain , will not contain an inscription .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazis used face masks of sinti and roma to " prove racial inferiority " instead , the names of the nazi concentration camps auschwitz , treblinka and buchenwald will be chiseled into the slabs leading up to the memorial .
an additional tablet will display the sentence " we commemorate all the roma who were victims of the systematic genocide in nazi-occupied europe . "
schmidt recognized genocide information panels will display a chronology of the exclusion , persecution and annihilation of the sinti and roma .
the murder of hundreds of thousands of sinti and roma is considered the second-largest act of genocide carried out by nazis in europe , following the killing of millions of jews . the final information panel is to contain quotes by former german president roman herzog and former chancellor helmut schmidt .
the central council has long insisted that the quote from herzog be used in which he drew parallels between the annihilation of the sinti and roma and the holocaust of the jews .
schmidt deemed the killing of the sinti and roma genocide in 1982 . another association of sinti , called the " sinti alliance , " has been at odds with the central council .
the group would like to see other " gypsy ethnic groups " mentioned as victims of nazi violence . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de holocaust remembrance day more relevant than ever jan .

he 's right , says dw 's mirjam gehrke . part of frank-walter steinmeier 's journey involved preparations for the european union-latin america summit to take place in vienna in mid-may .
yet it was the foreign minister 's comment that germany and the european union should focus its gaze more on latin american countries that must have been music to the ears of his partners in dialogue . latin america has been feeling neglected by europe for nearly two decades .
just as the era of military dictatorships was coming to a close at the end of the 1980s and the countries in the region were slowly starting to pave the way to democracy , the wall came down in berlin .
with the cold war over , europe - and germany , in particular - began focusing on the east . latin america back on the map now , it is high time to put latin america back on the agenda again .
while the united states has been concentrating its entire political and military attention on afghanistan , iraq and iran , over the past years a shift to the left has been occurring south of the rio grande .
the changes in each country must be viewed in differentiated fashion .
however , they all have a common denominator : the countries ' inhabitants are disappointed and angry about the consequences of the neo-liberal economic order that has hardly helped to overcome poverty in latin america .
quite the contrary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin america has set its sights on europe the united states ' policy on latin america has failed .
the best proof of that are the plans for the free trade area of the americas - ftaa - which have been put on hold .
us president george w. bush 's administration would have liked to have seen the plans to unite the economies of the americas into a single free-trade area go into effect back in 2005 . european union has been a beacon for mercosur now , the european union is enjoying its hour of glory : european integration is viewed by argentina and brazil as a model for mercosur .
this economic association , to which uruguay and paraguay also belong and to which venezuela will become a full member at the end of 2006 , could offer exciting impulses for the creation of a single south american market .
the european union even beats the united states as mercosur 's most important trading partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivian president evo morales threatened to evict foreign companies unless they gave bolivia control of gas production however , it is not only the economic cooperation that can and must be expanded .
criticism of decisions such as that of bolivian president evo morales ' decision to dispatch soldiers to the country 's oil and gas posts is certainly appropriate in political dialogue . yet a more differentiated view is also required here : those who make blanket statements about leftist populism in light of the nationalization of the bolivian gas reserves - rather than entering into a constructive critical dialogue - are ignoring the democratically articulated will of an entire people .
and just as important as fighting poverty in latin america is overcoming the political-institutional crisis and reinforcing democracy . latin america needs more than lip service countries like peru , ecuador , but also venezuela , are far from achieving what chile , brazil and argentina have already accomplished .
if europe wants to expand its trade relations with latin america , then it can not avoid conducting a constructive political dialogue with countries like bolivia as well .
in fact , it must conduct a dialogue precisely with such countries . the eu-latin america summit in vienna this week will reveal whether or not steinmeier was merely paying lip service to latin america .
politicians , however , should not just leave that agenda up to the economy and the interests of multi-national corporations . mirjam gehrke -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier concerned about bolivian nationalization plans during a trip to latin america , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has voiced concerns over plans to nationalize bolivia 's oil and gas industry by the country 's new president , evo morales .

he 's right , says dw 's mirjam gehrke . part of frank-walter steinmeier 's journey involved preparations for the european union-latin america summit to take place in vienna in mid-may .
yet it was the foreign minister 's comment that germany and the european union should focus its gaze more on latin american countries that must have been music to the ears of his partners in dialogue . latin america has been feeling neglected by europe for nearly two decades .
just as the era of military dictatorships was coming to a close at the end of the 1980s and the countries in the region were slowly starting to pave the way to democracy , the wall came down in berlin .
with the cold war over , europe - and germany , in particular - began focusing on the east . latin america back on the map now , it is high time to put latin america back on the agenda again .
while the united states has been concentrating its entire political and military attention on afghanistan , iraq and iran , over the past years a shift to the left has been occurring south of the rio grande .
the changes in each country must be viewed in differentiated fashion .
however , they all have a common denominator : the countries ' inhabitants are disappointed and angry about the consequences of the neo-liberal economic order that has hardly helped to overcome poverty in latin america .
quite the contrary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin america has set its sights on europe the united states ' policy on latin america has failed .
the best proof of that are the plans for the free trade area of the americas - ftaa - which have been put on hold .
us president george w. bush 's administration would have liked to have seen the plans to unite the economies of the americas into a single free-trade area go into effect back in 2005 . european union has been a beacon for mercosur now , the european union is enjoying its hour of glory : european integration is viewed by argentina and brazil as a model for mercosur .
this economic association , to which uruguay and paraguay also belong and to which venezuela will become a full member at the end of 2006 , could offer exciting impulses for the creation of a single south american market .
the european union even beats the united states as mercosur 's most important trading partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivian president evo morales threatened to evict foreign companies unless they gave bolivia control of gas production however , it is not only the economic cooperation that can and must be expanded .
criticism of decisions such as that of bolivian president evo morales ' decision to dispatch soldiers to the country 's oil and gas posts is certainly appropriate in political dialogue . yet a more differentiated view is also required here : those who make blanket statements about leftist populism in light of the nationalization of the bolivian gas reserves - rather than entering into a constructive critical dialogue - are ignoring the democratically articulated will of an entire people .
and just as important as fighting poverty in latin america is overcoming the political-institutional crisis and reinforcing democracy . latin america needs more than lip service countries like peru , ecuador , but also venezuela , are far from achieving what chile , brazil and argentina have already accomplished .
if europe wants to expand its trade relations with latin america , then it can not avoid conducting a constructive political dialogue with countries like bolivia as well .
in fact , it must conduct a dialogue precisely with such countries . the eu-latin america summit in vienna this week will reveal whether or not steinmeier was merely paying lip service to latin america .
politicians , however , should not just leave that agenda up to the economy and the interests of multi-national corporations . mirjam gehrke -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier concerned about bolivian nationalization plans during a trip to latin america , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has voiced concerns over plans to nationalize bolivia 's oil and gas industry by the country 's new president , evo morales .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's foreign intelligence agency in the spotlight germany ’ s foreign intelligence agency turns 50 german politicians to face grilling as bnd inquiry begins europe -pipe- 09.05.2006 cia affair becoming a sharper thorn in transatlantic relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain , germany and others are investigating " extraordinary rendition " flights european investigations into secret cia flights and interrogation centers go on as mounting evidence showing they existed on european soil continues to be a diplomatic headache . in a statement that generated little public interest on thursday , the us announced that it would brief european officials about secret intelligence activities such as rendition flights allegedly carried out on european soil . but within diplomatic circles , the statement by us attorney general alberto gonzales pledging to brief a european parliament delegation to washington this week on clandestine intelligence activities caused a stir . " it signals that the us is feeling pressure over an issue they thought would die down and has n't , " said one german diplomat familiar with the issue . european officials pushing harder european leaders were initially slow to react to allegations of secret flights carrying suspected terrorists landing on their soil after reports of them first leaked in november .
experts say that is because european governments were more informed than they wanted to admit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giovanni claudio fava says the flights were not " tourist " flights but since eu commission officials first downplayed the issue late last year , the council of europe , a human rights watchdog , has continued to investigate .
at the same time , countries such as germany and italy are probing the issue - the bundestag will hold more hearings this week to find out what german officials knew .
most officials say it is unlikely that european governments were kept in the dark . meanwhile , an eu parliamentary committee issued a report last month saying that the cia carried out as many as 1,000 secret flights in the past five years , transporting suspected terrorists to third countries .
and parliamentarians took eu foreign policy chief javier solana to task for failing to probe the issue more aggressively during a parliamentary inquiry last week where he condemned such activities but said he did not have the jurisdiction to demand answers . " i have no information whatsoever that tells me with certainty that any of the accusations , allegations , rumors , etcetera that have taken place in the last year 's time are true , " he told parliamentarians . deputies shook their heads at such evasive responses . " i regret profoundly you say that you do n't intend to take any leadership role here , " one deputy responded .
" you are in a way washing your hands of responsibility . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german khalid al-masri told eu deputies of his alleged abduction by the cia the european parliament is an elected body and is considered more representative of european public opinion than other eu institutions .
and since the public has kept this issue in the forefront , officials such as italian eu parliament member giovanni claudio fava , a member of the special inquiry committee , said the eu parliament will continue to push hard for answers .
already , they have heard testimony from people such as kuwaiti-born german citizen khalid al-masri , who said he was detained by foreign agents in macedonia on dec .
31 , 2003 , while on holiday , flown to afghanistan and tortured . " our job is to find out the truth , and if the truth is that there have been illegal cia flights on our territory we ca n't remain silent , " he told reporters .
" these were not tourist flights . " no longer a wall of silence at first , us officials said little about the issue .
but experts in transatlantic relations say that increased european pressure and fears of weakened intelligence cooperation is changing that . last week , gonzales said that " rendition is an activity that is practiced by the united states and other countries . " and john bellinger , advisor to us secretary of state condoleezza rice , flew to brussels to meet with eu and nato officials last week and admitted that there had been secret intelligence flights even as he dismissed the number .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the topic did n't come up during merkel 's us visit last week " these allegations that there have been thousands of flights with the implication that they all have got detainees on them and worse , detainees bound for mistreatment is simply absurd , " he said during a press conference .
" there have been , as we have said , very few cases of rendition , the last one about three years ago .
many of these flights that have occurred may be carrying analysts , officials engaged in counter-terrorism cooperation and forensic evidence . " hurting intelligence cooperation us officials say that the rumors and furor over the flights are hurting intelligence cooperation . " this furor over renditions , and the furor over the flights alone , and the suggestion that flights alone are somehow improper or engaged in illegal activity is undermining intelligence cooperation , " bellinger said .
" next time , the us may be reluctant to bring people to europe or exchange information . " but european willingness to cooperate has also been threatened . " there is still interest in ongoing cooperation but only if the suspicion is eliminated that the cia has betrayed its european partners , " said henning riecke , an expert on transatlantic relations and security policy at the german council on foreign relations . regardless , eu parliamentarians will meet with us officials such as us assistant secretary of state daniel fried and bellinger this week to get more details .
but us officials caution that they will not tell eu officials the details of every flight because of security concerns . " intelligence activities by their very nature are simply carried out in secret , " bellinger said . jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lawmakers probe macedonia 's role in cia prisoner affair european lawmakers probing allegations that cia planes secretly transported prisoners through european countries are in macedonia to investigate the role of the balkan nation .

debate over quotes comparing the genocide of the jews and of the sinti and roma had stalled construction . the government will finance the 2 million euro -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- memorial , which is to be built between the reichstag and brandenburg gate in central berlin .
federal culture secretary bernd neumann announced to journalists on monday that construction would begin quickly , pending agreement from the social democrats . romani rose , head of the central council of german sinti and roma , said the agreement is an " important step " toward officially recognizing the genocide committed on the minority group .
he said he was " very happy " about the agreement . debate about a central inscription on the memorial has raged for years , hampering the memorial 's construction .
now , the various sides agreed that the memorial , which will be designed by artist dani karavan and shaped like a fountain , will not contain an inscription .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazis used face masks of sinti and roma to " prove racial inferiority " instead , the names of the nazi concentration camps auschwitz , treblinka and buchenwald will be chiseled into the slabs leading up to the memorial .
an additional tablet will display the sentence " we commemorate all the roma who were victims of the systematic genocide in nazi-occupied europe . "
schmidt recognized genocide information panels will display a chronology of the exclusion , persecution and annihilation of the sinti and roma .
the murder of hundreds of thousands of sinti and roma is considered the second-largest act of genocide carried out by nazis in europe , following the killing of millions of jews . the final information panel is to contain quotes by former german president roman herzog and former chancellor helmut schmidt .
the central council has long insisted that the quote from herzog be used in which he drew parallels between the annihilation of the sinti and roma and the holocaust of the jews .
schmidt deemed the killing of the sinti and roma genocide in 1982 . another association of sinti , called the " sinti alliance , " has been at odds with the central council .

meiwes was originally given a lighter sentence . meiwes , 44 , had told the court that his victim , an engineer from berlin , had a death wish and begged to be killed .

but he has remained unrepentant about eating his flesh , saying it was the " ultimate kick " both of them were seeking . psychologists have told the court meiwes was a mentally sane , if lonely , man who held down a steady job .
the accused has said that his cannibal fantasies began in his childhood , when his father abandoned his family , and he dreamt of eating one of his school friends so that somebody would stay with him forever . he has also said that from his prison cell he still fantasized about killing people when he saw attractive young bodies on television or in magazines .

he 's right , says dw 's mirjam gehrke . part of frank-walter steinmeier 's journey involved preparations for the european union-latin america summit to take place in vienna in mid-may .
yet it was the foreign minister 's comment that germany and the european union should focus its gaze more on latin american countries that must have been music to the ears of his partners in dialogue . latin america has been feeling neglected by europe for nearly two decades .
just as the era of military dictatorships was coming to a close at the end of the 1980s and the countries in the region were slowly starting to pave the way to democracy , the wall came down in berlin .
with the cold war over , europe - and germany , in particular - began focusing on the east . latin america back on the map now , it is high time to put latin america back on the agenda again .
while the united states has been concentrating its entire political and military attention on afghanistan , iraq and iran , over the past years a shift to the left has been occurring south of the rio grande .
the changes in each country must be viewed in differentiated fashion .
however , they all have a common denominator : the countries ' inhabitants are disappointed and angry about the consequences of the neo-liberal economic order that has hardly helped to overcome poverty in latin america .
quite the contrary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin america has set its sights on europe the united states ' policy on latin america has failed .
the best proof of that are the plans for the free trade area of the americas - ftaa - which have been put on hold .
us president george w. bush 's administration would have liked to have seen the plans to unite the economies of the americas into a single free-trade area go into effect back in 2005 . european union has been a beacon for mercosur now , the european union is enjoying its hour of glory : european integration is viewed by argentina and brazil as a model for mercosur .
this economic association , to which uruguay and paraguay also belong and to which venezuela will become a full member at the end of 2006 , could offer exciting impulses for the creation of a single south american market .
the european union even beats the united states as mercosur 's most important trading partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivian president evo morales threatened to evict foreign companies unless they gave bolivia control of gas production however , it is not only the economic cooperation that can and must be expanded .
criticism of decisions such as that of bolivian president evo morales ' decision to dispatch soldiers to the country 's oil and gas posts is certainly appropriate in political dialogue . yet a more differentiated view is also required here : those who make blanket statements about leftist populism in light of the nationalization of the bolivian gas reserves - rather than entering into a constructive critical dialogue - are ignoring the democratically articulated will of an entire people .
and just as important as fighting poverty in latin america is overcoming the political-institutional crisis and reinforcing democracy . latin america needs more than lip service countries like peru , ecuador , but also venezuela , are far from achieving what chile , brazil and argentina have already accomplished .
if europe wants to expand its trade relations with latin america , then it can not avoid conducting a constructive political dialogue with countries like bolivia as well .
in fact , it must conduct a dialogue precisely with such countries . the eu-latin america summit in vienna this week will reveal whether or not steinmeier was merely paying lip service to latin america .
politicians , however , should not just leave that agenda up to the economy and the interests of multi-national corporations . mirjam gehrke -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier concerned about bolivian nationalization plans during a trip to latin america , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has voiced concerns over plans to nationalize bolivia 's oil and gas industry by the country 's new president , evo morales .

meiwes was originally given a lighter sentence . meiwes , 44 , had told the court that his victim , an engineer from berlin , had a death wish and begged to be killed .
" he had wanted everything just the way it eventually happened , " the man known as the " cannibal of rotenburg " said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes ' crime was international news it was the second time meiwes was tried for killing bernd jürgen brandes in rotenburg in western germany in march 2001 .
he was originally convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to eight and a half years in prison in 2004 . judges says sentence too light but on appeal , a federal judge dismissed the sentence as too lenient and ordered a retrial on the higher charge of murder . meiwes , a computer technician , met brandes after advertising on the internet for a " slaughter victim " and invited him to his farm house .
the two men had sex before meiwes severed brandes ' penis , which they then fried and tried to eat .
he later stabbed his bleeding , unconscious victim in the throat and cut away other parts of his body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victim , bernd jürgen brandes meiwes admitted that he eventually ate some 20 kilograms -lrb- 44 pounds -rrb- of brandes ' flesh , accompanied by potatoes and a pepper or wine sauce , served on " good crockery . " his lawyers had argued that he was not guilty of murder but rather of the crime of " killing on demand " which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison . " the ultimate kick " but what has fascinated the media and the public was the testimony in which meiwes revealed his obsessions and lifted the lid on an underworld of cannibalism , which meiwes claims counts about 800 members in germany . meiwes has told the court he regretted killing brandes and has apologized to his victim 's boyfriend .
but he has remained unrepentant about eating his flesh , saying it was the " ultimate kick " both of them were seeking . psychologists have told the court meiwes was a mentally sane , if lonely , man who held down a steady job .
the accused has said that his cannibal fantasies began in his childhood , when his father abandoned his family , and he dreamt of eating one of his school friends so that somebody would stay with him forever . he has also said that from his prison cell he still fantasized about killing people when he saw attractive young bodies on television or in magazines .

" we need to make sure we do n't start something we can not stop and which could get out of control afterwards , " steinmeier said on tuesday in an interview with german public television station zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says there are unanswered questions when it comes to iran he said " five or six questions are still open " before a draft resolution could be concluded calling for iran to halt its uranium enrichment . zdf said steinmeier had estimated it could take two weeks before they resolved their differences , but did n't provide any details from the german foreign minister supporting that timeframe .
russia and china have resisted the draft resolution . " important and difficult meeting " earlier britain 's new foreign secretary margaret beckett , making her debut on the international scene , called the session an " important and difficult meeting . " " everyone believed iran must give up its nuclear enrichment program , " beckett told reporters .
" it 's the way to achieve that we have to agree -lrb- on -rrb- . " participants said the ministers , who met for two hours on monday without aides before going into dinner , agreed on the need to keep iran from using its civilian nuclear program to develop atomic bombs . but a senior us official reported no progress in melting russian and chinese resistance to american calls for tough action under chapter seven of the un charter , which would authorize sanctions or the use of force . " there is not yet agreement on the tactics and what 's most pronounced is that there is no agreement yet that this should be a chapter seven resolution , " said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
" based on tonight 's meeting , i would not expect a resolution to be voted on and adopted this week . " further talks needed russian news agencies quoted moscow 's top envoy , sergei lavrov , as calling for further negotiations , including more direct talks between major powers and iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister lavrov , left with condoleezza rice " there was general agreement on the need to create conditions for resuming direct negotiations on iran 's nuclear program , " interfax news agency quoted lavrov as telling russian reporters in new york . france 's chief diplomat philippe douste-blazy said the ministers discussed " incentives and dissuasive measures according to the iranian response " in the confrontation . among the incentives raised by the french minister were cooperation in civilian nuclear energy , increased commercial and technological ties and security guarantees that the united states has refused to provide . us secretary of sate condoleezza rice had earlier monday billed the talks as " a time for the international community to come together and say with very great clarity it 's time for iran to accede to the demands of the international community . " us unimpressed by ahmadinejad 's letter the ministers also discussed the letter made public monday from iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad offering to seek ways to ease tensions with the united states . us officials said the 18-page rambling letter was more a philosophical treatise than a political overture and did not change washington 's position in the nuclear dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us says ahmadinejad 's letter contains nothing new " there is nothing in this letter that in any way addresses any of the issues really that are on the table in the international community , " rice told the editorial board of the associated press news agency monday . " it is most assuredly not a proposal , " she said , according to a state department transcript .

even today , the response to the site is divided , acknowledged lea rosh , the activist who fought for years to establish a german memorial to european jews killed by the nazis . looking back at the year , salomon korn , a member of the memorial 's board of trustees , admitted the memorial was not to everyone 's liking .
but , he said , the number of visitors attested to the monument 's power . the memorial , not far from the brandenburg gate , consists of an open space covered with 2,700 gray cement columns of different heights , and an underground information center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizer lea rosh with architect peter eisenman uwe neumärker , who heads up the foundation that created the memorial - officially the foundation for the memorial to the murdered jews - acknowledges that the 3.5 million visitor number is just an estimate .
still , the underground information center had 490,000 registered visitors , making the site a " tourism magnet , " he said . respectful treatment despite fears of vandalism , the monument has been treated with respect , neumärker said .
and in the underground documentation center , which contains historical information on the genocide perpetrated by the nazis , the people are " well behaved and quiet , without us having to tell them , " he added . the monument was designed by us architect peter eisenman , at a total cost of 27 million euros -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- .
it opened with a ceremony on may 10 , 2005 , in the presence of 1,200 guests .
two days later , it was opened to the public .
this year , on may 13 a " long night of memorial , " with readings , discussions and theater performances , is planned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monument is located near the reichstag the association 's korn , speaking on germany 's national deutschlandradio , said the strength of the field of pillars is that it does n't have a single given message , but rather is open to interpretation from everyone . and criticism of the plan - for instance , that it is unfair to have a monument only to murdered jews and not to other groups that were persecuted by the nazis , like the sinti-roma or homosexuals - has died down somewhat , acknowledged initiator rosh . " it is wonderful for us to see so many people going there , " she said .
and , she noted , visitors did not seem to have an attitude that the holocaust was something no longer important and best left in the past . little vandalism up to now , there have been five cases of swastikas being painted on the memorial 's pillars , and one star of david .
neumärker discounted the vandalism , calling it " basically , nothing . " during the creation of the monument , rosh set off an outcry when she said she planned to bury the tooth of a holocaust victim under one of the columns .
there was also a discussion over appropriate monument behavior , given the penchant of certain younger visitors to hop from pillar to pillar . a sausage stand at the monument 's edge -lrb- it is accessible from all sides , and open around the clock , seven days a week -rrb- also came under heavy fire .
now , a private builder has set up a disputed pavilion that houses a café , bookstore and snack stand . " there is always debate over this monument .
and that 's a good thing .

sales in the first quarter totaled 2.459 billion euros , an increase of 47 percent . " we are clearly market leaders in the biggest markets , therefore it 's quite logical that we are the number one , " said adidas chief executive herbert hainer during a conference call with journalists . however , figures from nike at the end of march showed the us group remains ahead on a financial basis with net profit of $ 325.8 million , -lrb- about 256 million euros -rrb- , and sales of $ 3.3 billion for the period of december to february . the claim from adidas is a sign of an intensifying battle between the companies ahead of the soccer world cup 2006 , which begins in germany next month and which is vital for both brands .
adidas is an official sponsor of the competition and is to provide the official match ball as well as kit sponsorship for six of the leading national teams in the competition . on the basis of a surge in demand for world cup merchandise , hainer announced that adidas expected to sell football equipment valued at 1.2 billion euros this year , rather than the previously expected 1.0 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both adidas-salomon and nike expect big profits from the world cup " demand for this -lrb- official -rrb- ball and other world cup products is very big , " said hainer " we 've scored on all product categories . "
adidas enthusiastic about reebock commenting on results for the first-quarter , hainer also pointed to the integration during the period of us brand reebok , which was acquired by adidas in january for more than 3.0 billion euros . " the adidas group has got off to a powerful start in the first quarter 2006 , " said company chief executive herbert hainer .
" we have made important progress in successfully integrating reebok within the adidas group and are well positioned for the world cup , which is only a month away . " the group maintained its forecasts for 2006 of growth of at least 10 percent in sales and net profit .
in morning trading on the frankfurt stock exchange , shares in adidas gained 2.11 percent to 170.93 euros in a broadly weaker market .

he said he was " very happy " about the agreement . debate about a central inscription on the memorial has raged for years , hampering the memorial 's construction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.05.2006 opinion : german foreign minister rediscovers latin america großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier in chile : now is the time for the eu to focus on latin america german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has completed his first trip to south america and concluded that the continent deserves more attention from the eu .
he 's right , says dw 's mirjam gehrke . part of frank-walter steinmeier 's journey involved preparations for the european union-latin america summit to take place in vienna in mid-may .
yet it was the foreign minister 's comment that germany and the european union should focus its gaze more on latin american countries that must have been music to the ears of his partners in dialogue . latin america has been feeling neglected by europe for nearly two decades .
just as the era of military dictatorships was coming to a close at the end of the 1980s and the countries in the region were slowly starting to pave the way to democracy , the wall came down in berlin .
with the cold war over , europe - and germany , in particular - began focusing on the east . latin america back on the map now , it is high time to put latin america back on the agenda again .
while the united states has been concentrating its entire political and military attention on afghanistan , iraq and iran , over the past years a shift to the left has been occurring south of the rio grande .
the changes in each country must be viewed in differentiated fashion .
however , they all have a common denominator : the countries ' inhabitants are disappointed and angry about the consequences of the neo-liberal economic order that has hardly helped to overcome poverty in latin america .
quite the contrary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin america has set its sights on europe the united states ' policy on latin america has failed .
the best proof of that are the plans for the free trade area of the americas - ftaa - which have been put on hold .
us president george w. bush 's administration would have liked to have seen the plans to unite the economies of the americas into a single free-trade area go into effect back in 2005 . european union has been a beacon for mercosur now , the european union is enjoying its hour of glory : european integration is viewed by argentina and brazil as a model for mercosur .
this economic association , to which uruguay and paraguay also belong and to which venezuela will become a full member at the end of 2006 , could offer exciting impulses for the creation of a single south american market .
the european union even beats the united states as mercosur 's most important trading partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivian president evo morales threatened to evict foreign companies unless they gave bolivia control of gas production however , it is not only the economic cooperation that can and must be expanded .
criticism of decisions such as that of bolivian president evo morales ' decision to dispatch soldiers to the country 's oil and gas posts is certainly appropriate in political dialogue . yet a more differentiated view is also required here : those who make blanket statements about leftist populism in light of the nationalization of the bolivian gas reserves - rather than entering into a constructive critical dialogue - are ignoring the democratically articulated will of an entire people .
and just as important as fighting poverty in latin america is overcoming the political-institutional crisis and reinforcing democracy . latin america needs more than lip service countries like peru , ecuador , but also venezuela , are far from achieving what chile , brazil and argentina have already accomplished .
if europe wants to expand its trade relations with latin america , then it can not avoid conducting a constructive political dialogue with countries like bolivia as well .
in fact , it must conduct a dialogue precisely with such countries . the eu-latin america summit in vienna this week will reveal whether or not steinmeier was merely paying lip service to latin america .
politicians , however , should not just leave that agenda up to the economy and the interests of multi-national corporations . mirjam gehrke -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier concerned about bolivian nationalization plans during a trip to latin america , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has voiced concerns over plans to nationalize bolivia 's oil and gas industry by the country 's new president , evo morales .

he 's right , says dw 's mirjam gehrke . part of frank-walter steinmeier 's journey involved preparations for the european union-latin america summit to take place in vienna in mid-may .
yet it was the foreign minister 's comment that germany and the european union should focus its gaze more on latin american countries that must have been music to the ears of his partners in dialogue . latin america has been feeling neglected by europe for nearly two decades .
just as the era of military dictatorships was coming to a close at the end of the 1980s and the countries in the region were slowly starting to pave the way to democracy , the wall came down in berlin .
with the cold war over , europe - and germany , in particular - began focusing on the east . latin america back on the map now , it is high time to put latin america back on the agenda again .
while the united states has been concentrating its entire political and military attention on afghanistan , iraq and iran , over the past years a shift to the left has been occurring south of the rio grande .
the changes in each country must be viewed in differentiated fashion .
however , they all have a common denominator : the countries ' inhabitants are disappointed and angry about the consequences of the neo-liberal economic order that has hardly helped to overcome poverty in latin america .
quite the contrary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin america has set its sights on europe the united states ' policy on latin america has failed .
the best proof of that are the plans for the free trade area of the americas - ftaa - which have been put on hold .
us president george w. bush 's administration would have liked to have seen the plans to unite the economies of the americas into a single free-trade area go into effect back in 2005 . european union has been a beacon for mercosur now , the european union is enjoying its hour of glory : european integration is viewed by argentina and brazil as a model for mercosur .
this economic association , to which uruguay and paraguay also belong and to which venezuela will become a full member at the end of 2006 , could offer exciting impulses for the creation of a single south american market .
the european union even beats the united states as mercosur 's most important trading partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivian president evo morales threatened to evict foreign companies unless they gave bolivia control of gas production however , it is not only the economic cooperation that can and must be expanded .
criticism of decisions such as that of bolivian president evo morales ' decision to dispatch soldiers to the country 's oil and gas posts is certainly appropriate in political dialogue . yet a more differentiated view is also required here : those who make blanket statements about leftist populism in light of the nationalization of the bolivian gas reserves - rather than entering into a constructive critical dialogue - are ignoring the democratically articulated will of an entire people .
and just as important as fighting poverty in latin america is overcoming the political-institutional crisis and reinforcing democracy . latin america needs more than lip service countries like peru , ecuador , but also venezuela , are far from achieving what chile , brazil and argentina have already accomplished .
if europe wants to expand its trade relations with latin america , then it can not avoid conducting a constructive political dialogue with countries like bolivia as well .
in fact , it must conduct a dialogue precisely with such countries . the eu-latin america summit in vienna this week will reveal whether or not steinmeier was merely paying lip service to latin america .
politicians , however , should not just leave that agenda up to the economy and the interests of multi-national corporations . mirjam gehrke -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier concerned about bolivian nationalization plans during a trip to latin america , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has voiced concerns over plans to nationalize bolivia 's oil and gas industry by the country 's new president , evo morales .

meiwes was originally given a lighter sentence . meiwes , 44 , had told the court that his victim , an engineer from berlin , had a death wish and begged to be killed .
" he had wanted everything just the way it eventually happened , " the man known as the " cannibal of rotenburg " said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes ' crime was international news it was the second time meiwes was tried for killing bernd jürgen brandes in rotenburg in western germany in march 2001 .
he was originally convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to eight and a half years in prison in 2004 . judges says sentence too light but on appeal , a federal judge dismissed the sentence as too lenient and ordered a retrial on the higher charge of murder . meiwes , a computer technician , met brandes after advertising on the internet for a " slaughter victim " and invited him to his farm house .
the two men had sex before meiwes severed brandes ' penis , which they then fried and tried to eat .
he later stabbed his bleeding , unconscious victim in the throat and cut away other parts of his body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victim , bernd jürgen brandes meiwes admitted that he eventually ate some 20 kilograms -lrb- 44 pounds -rrb- of brandes ' flesh , accompanied by potatoes and a pepper or wine sauce , served on " good crockery . " his lawyers had argued that he was not guilty of murder but rather of the crime of " killing on demand " which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison . " the ultimate kick " but what has fascinated the media and the public was the testimony in which meiwes revealed his obsessions and lifted the lid on an underworld of cannibalism , which meiwes claims counts about 800 members in germany . meiwes has told the court he regretted killing brandes and has apologized to his victim 's boyfriend .
but he has remained unrepentant about eating his flesh , saying it was the " ultimate kick " both of them were seeking . psychologists have told the court meiwes was a mentally sane , if lonely , man who held down a steady job .
the accused has said that his cannibal fantasies began in his childhood , when his father abandoned his family , and he dreamt of eating one of his school friends so that somebody would stay with him forever . he has also said that from his prison cell he still fantasized about killing people when he saw attractive young bodies on television or in magazines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 09.05.2006 bush and merkel changing face of us-german relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel invited bush back to germany on her second visit to the usa dw-world.de readers commented on the status of us-german ties and the effects of the transatlantic relationship in the rest of the world , especially in the middle east . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i think germany should remain leery of bush 's overtures toward germany and chancellor merkel .
he and his administration still have the " you 're with us or against us " mentality .
i think one need only to look at current domestic policy in the us to confirm the continuation of the black or white policy .
beware of the snake charmer .
thomas jones , los angeles , usa bush wants to win any country which is not firm in its foreign policy and make it do his .
for the last years germany aroused respect and it will be a pity if it kneels before the us . - cheludmila454 chancellor merkel absolutely deserves the credit for the vastly improved relationship between germany and the us .
she gets total respect from george bush and here is why .
she is consistent : she does n't say one thing now and another thing later , or to a different audience .
she is good-tempered and does n't show anger when being firm .
instead she is level and steady and does n't try to be showy .
she knows how to disagree without being disagreeable - and she does disagree , and she does hold firm and get her way .
but she makes bush feel ok about it .
bush acts like he 's got more sense when he 's around her .
i think this lady really has good sense and a wonderful personality for her position , and is the best thing to happen to foreign policy dynamics in a long time . - wiley horne , usa americans were going to be happy with anyone other than schröder .
people outside the united states , must understand that america and her citizens do not regret iraq .
it was a reaction to a decade-plus of hostilities from the arab world .
it may have nothing to do with sept.11 , however it allowed us to remove a long standing enemy .
americans are realizing that europe is for itself and that only a few countries like israel and australia are her true allies .
americans are returning to isolation and the world is not prepared for it . - bryan hobbs the woman is too stupid to realize that she is being used by the usa .
her mind is as drab as her dress , and she is a menace to germany 's relations with the middle east .
the woman fails to realize the implications of the gas pipeline being directly laid across the baltic to germany .
germany needs to keep clear of all middle east confrontations .
the future of germany , as the major power and leader in europe , lies in the east with trade , which will lead to the reduction of german unemployment and economic salvation as the industrial giant of europe . - kevin hendstock , australia compiled by dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : beware of the crocodile 's smile angela merkel received many plaudits during her recent visit to washington .
but the hospitality afforded her may be part of a ruse to lure germany into the us foreign policy fold , according to dw 's peter philipp .
-lrb- may 8 , 2006 -rrb- bush : germany plays decisive role in war on terror us president george w. bush has told a german paper that germany plays a decisive role in the war on terrorism and that chancellor angela merkel 's actions on the iranian nuclear issue had been key .
-lrb- may 7 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : merkel knows how to be friendly but firm germany 's chancellor has headed to the us for the second time in four months , proving that german-american ties are warmer than they 've been for years .
dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says all the credit goes to angela merkel .

meiwes was originally given a lighter sentence . meiwes , 44 , had told the court that his victim , an engineer from berlin , had a death wish and begged to be killed .
" he had wanted everything just the way it eventually happened , " the man known as the " cannibal of rotenburg " said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes ' crime was international news it was the second time meiwes was tried for killing bernd jürgen brandes in rotenburg in western germany in march 2001 .
he was originally convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to eight and a half years in prison in 2004 . judges says sentence too light but on appeal , a federal judge dismissed the sentence as too lenient and ordered a retrial on the higher charge of murder . meiwes , a computer technician , met brandes after advertising on the internet for a " slaughter victim " and invited him to his farm house .
the two men had sex before meiwes severed brandes ' penis , which they then fried and tried to eat .
he later stabbed his bleeding , unconscious victim in the throat and cut away other parts of his body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victim , bernd jürgen brandes meiwes admitted that he eventually ate some 20 kilograms -lrb- 44 pounds -rrb- of brandes ' flesh , accompanied by potatoes and a pepper or wine sauce , served on " good crockery . " his lawyers had argued that he was not guilty of murder but rather of the crime of " killing on demand " which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison . " the ultimate kick " but what has fascinated the media and the public was the testimony in which meiwes revealed his obsessions and lifted the lid on an underworld of cannibalism , which meiwes claims counts about 800 members in germany . meiwes has told the court he regretted killing brandes and has apologized to his victim 's boyfriend .
but he has remained unrepentant about eating his flesh , saying it was the " ultimate kick " both of them were seeking . psychologists have told the court meiwes was a mentally sane , if lonely , man who held down a steady job .
the accused has said that his cannibal fantasies began in his childhood , when his father abandoned his family , and he dreamt of eating one of his school friends so that somebody would stay with him forever . he has also said that from his prison cell he still fantasized about killing people when he saw attractive young bodies on television or in magazines . " i find this extremely worrying , " state prosecutor annette von schmiedeberg told the court last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film he videotaped his meeting with brandes , in what prosecutors said was a bid to make sure he could watch it again later to satisfy his fantasies . the case inspired a us-made horror film titled " butterfly , a grimm love story , " but meiwes succeeded in blocking its release on the grounds that it infringed on his privacy . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannibal of rotenburg faces life sentence as retrial nears end a german state prosecutor on wednesday demanded a life sentence for self-confessed cannibal armin meiwes , saying he killed and ate a man to fulfill his sexual urges .

" we need to make sure we do n't start something we can not stop and which could get out of control afterwards , " steinmeier said on tuesday in an interview with german public television station zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says there are unanswered questions when it comes to iran he said " five or six questions are still open " before a draft resolution could be concluded calling for iran to halt its uranium enrichment . zdf said steinmeier had estimated it could take two weeks before they resolved their differences , but did n't provide any details from the german foreign minister supporting that timeframe .
russia and china have resisted the draft resolution . " important and difficult meeting " earlier britain 's new foreign secretary margaret beckett , making her debut on the international scene , called the session an " important and difficult meeting . " " everyone believed iran must give up its nuclear enrichment program , " beckett told reporters .
" it 's the way to achieve that we have to agree -lrb- on -rrb- . " participants said the ministers , who met for two hours on monday without aides before going into dinner , agreed on the need to keep iran from using its civilian nuclear program to develop atomic bombs . but a senior us official reported no progress in melting russian and chinese resistance to american calls for tough action under chapter seven of the un charter , which would authorize sanctions or the use of force . " there is not yet agreement on the tactics and what 's most pronounced is that there is no agreement yet that this should be a chapter seven resolution , " said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
" based on tonight 's meeting , i would not expect a resolution to be voted on and adopted this week . " further talks needed russian news agencies quoted moscow 's top envoy , sergei lavrov , as calling for further negotiations , including more direct talks between major powers and iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister lavrov , left with condoleezza rice " there was general agreement on the need to create conditions for resuming direct negotiations on iran 's nuclear program , " interfax news agency quoted lavrov as telling russian reporters in new york . france 's chief diplomat philippe douste-blazy said the ministers discussed " incentives and dissuasive measures according to the iranian response " in the confrontation . among the incentives raised by the french minister were cooperation in civilian nuclear energy , increased commercial and technological ties and security guarantees that the united states has refused to provide . us secretary of sate condoleezza rice had earlier monday billed the talks as " a time for the international community to come together and say with very great clarity it 's time for iran to accede to the demands of the international community . " us unimpressed by ahmadinejad 's letter the ministers also discussed the letter made public monday from iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad offering to seek ways to ease tensions with the united states . us officials said the 18-page rambling letter was more a philosophical treatise than a political overture and did not change washington 's position in the nuclear dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us says ahmadinejad 's letter contains nothing new " there is nothing in this letter that in any way addresses any of the issues really that are on the table in the international community , " rice told the editorial board of the associated press news agency monday . " it is most assuredly not a proposal , " she said , according to a state department transcript .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i think germany should remain leery of bush 's overtures toward germany and chancellor merkel .
he and his administration still have the " you 're with us or against us " mentality .
i think one need only to look at current domestic policy in the us to confirm the continuation of the black or white policy .
beware of the snake charmer .
thomas jones , los angeles , usa bush wants to win any country which is not firm in its foreign policy and make it do his .
for the last years germany aroused respect and it will be a pity if it kneels before the us . - cheludmila454 chancellor merkel absolutely deserves the credit for the vastly improved relationship between germany and the us .
she gets total respect from george bush and here is why .
she is consistent : she does n't say one thing now and another thing later , or to a different audience .
she is good-tempered and does n't show anger when being firm .
instead she is level and steady and does n't try to be showy .
she knows how to disagree without being disagreeable - and she does disagree , and she does hold firm and get her way .
but she makes bush feel ok about it .
bush acts like he 's got more sense when he 's around her .
i think this lady really has good sense and a wonderful personality for her position , and is the best thing to happen to foreign policy dynamics in a long time . - wiley horne , usa americans were going to be happy with anyone other than schröder .
people outside the united states , must understand that america and her citizens do not regret iraq .
it was a reaction to a decade-plus of hostilities from the arab world .
it may have nothing to do with sept.11 , however it allowed us to remove a long standing enemy .
americans are realizing that europe is for itself and that only a few countries like israel and australia are her true allies .
americans are returning to isolation and the world is not prepared for it . - bryan hobbs the woman is too stupid to realize that she is being used by the usa .
her mind is as drab as her dress , and she is a menace to germany 's relations with the middle east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's foreign intelligence agency in the spotlight germany ’ s foreign intelligence agency turns 50 german politicians to face grilling as bnd inquiry begins europe -pipe- 09.05.2006 cia affair becoming a sharper thorn in transatlantic relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain , germany and others are investigating " extraordinary rendition " flights european investigations into secret cia flights and interrogation centers go on as mounting evidence showing they existed on european soil continues to be a diplomatic headache . in a statement that generated little public interest on thursday , the us announced that it would brief european officials about secret intelligence activities such as rendition flights allegedly carried out on european soil . but within diplomatic circles , the statement by us attorney general alberto gonzales pledging to brief a european parliament delegation to washington this week on clandestine intelligence activities caused a stir . " it signals that the us is feeling pressure over an issue they thought would die down and has n't , " said one german diplomat familiar with the issue . european officials pushing harder european leaders were initially slow to react to allegations of secret flights carrying suspected terrorists landing on their soil after reports of them first leaked in november .
experts say that is because european governments were more informed than they wanted to admit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giovanni claudio fava says the flights were not " tourist " flights but since eu commission officials first downplayed the issue late last year , the council of europe , a human rights watchdog , has continued to investigate .
at the same time , countries such as germany and italy are probing the issue - the bundestag will hold more hearings this week to find out what german officials knew .
most officials say it is unlikely that european governments were kept in the dark . meanwhile , an eu parliamentary committee issued a report last month saying that the cia carried out as many as 1,000 secret flights in the past five years , transporting suspected terrorists to third countries .
and parliamentarians took eu foreign policy chief javier solana to task for failing to probe the issue more aggressively during a parliamentary inquiry last week where he condemned such activities but said he did not have the jurisdiction to demand answers . " i have no information whatsoever that tells me with certainty that any of the accusations , allegations , rumors , etcetera that have taken place in the last year 's time are true , " he told parliamentarians . deputies shook their heads at such evasive responses . " i regret profoundly you say that you do n't intend to take any leadership role here , " one deputy responded .
" you are in a way washing your hands of responsibility . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german khalid al-masri told eu deputies of his alleged abduction by the cia the european parliament is an elected body and is considered more representative of european public opinion than other eu institutions .
and since the public has kept this issue in the forefront , officials such as italian eu parliament member giovanni claudio fava , a member of the special inquiry committee , said the eu parliament will continue to push hard for answers .
already , they have heard testimony from people such as kuwaiti-born german citizen khalid al-masri , who said he was detained by foreign agents in macedonia on dec .
31 , 2003 , while on holiday , flown to afghanistan and tortured . " our job is to find out the truth , and if the truth is that there have been illegal cia flights on our territory we ca n't remain silent , " he told reporters .
" these were not tourist flights . " no longer a wall of silence at first , us officials said little about the issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's foreign intelligence agency in the spotlight germany ’ s foreign intelligence agency turns 50 german politicians to face grilling as bnd inquiry begins europe -pipe- 09.05.2006 cia affair becoming a sharper thorn in transatlantic relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain , germany and others are investigating " extraordinary rendition " flights european investigations into secret cia flights and interrogation centers go on as mounting evidence showing they existed on european soil continues to be a diplomatic headache . in a statement that generated little public interest on thursday , the us announced that it would brief european officials about secret intelligence activities such as rendition flights allegedly carried out on european soil . but within diplomatic circles , the statement by us attorney general alberto gonzales pledging to brief a european parliament delegation to washington this week on clandestine intelligence activities caused a stir . " it signals that the us is feeling pressure over an issue they thought would die down and has n't , " said one german diplomat familiar with the issue . european officials pushing harder european leaders were initially slow to react to allegations of secret flights carrying suspected terrorists landing on their soil after reports of them first leaked in november .
experts say that is because european governments were more informed than they wanted to admit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giovanni claudio fava says the flights were not " tourist " flights but since eu commission officials first downplayed the issue late last year , the council of europe , a human rights watchdog , has continued to investigate .
at the same time , countries such as germany and italy are probing the issue - the bundestag will hold more hearings this week to find out what german officials knew .
most officials say it is unlikely that european governments were kept in the dark . meanwhile , an eu parliamentary committee issued a report last month saying that the cia carried out as many as 1,000 secret flights in the past five years , transporting suspected terrorists to third countries .
and parliamentarians took eu foreign policy chief javier solana to task for failing to probe the issue more aggressively during a parliamentary inquiry last week where he condemned such activities but said he did not have the jurisdiction to demand answers . " i have no information whatsoever that tells me with certainty that any of the accusations , allegations , rumors , etcetera that have taken place in the last year 's time are true , " he told parliamentarians . deputies shook their heads at such evasive responses . " i regret profoundly you say that you do n't intend to take any leadership role here , " one deputy responded .
" you are in a way washing your hands of responsibility . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german khalid al-masri told eu deputies of his alleged abduction by the cia the european parliament is an elected body and is considered more representative of european public opinion than other eu institutions .
and since the public has kept this issue in the forefront , officials such as italian eu parliament member giovanni claudio fava , a member of the special inquiry committee , said the eu parliament will continue to push hard for answers .
already , they have heard testimony from people such as kuwaiti-born german citizen khalid al-masri , who said he was detained by foreign agents in macedonia on dec .
31 , 2003 , while on holiday , flown to afghanistan and tortured . " our job is to find out the truth , and if the truth is that there have been illegal cia flights on our territory we ca n't remain silent , " he told reporters .
" these were not tourist flights . " no longer a wall of silence at first , us officials said little about the issue .
but experts in transatlantic relations say that increased european pressure and fears of weakened intelligence cooperation is changing that . last week , gonzales said that " rendition is an activity that is practiced by the united states and other countries . " and john bellinger , advisor to us secretary of state condoleezza rice , flew to brussels to meet with eu and nato officials last week and admitted that there had been secret intelligence flights even as he dismissed the number .

" we are clearly market leaders in the biggest markets , therefore it 's quite logical that we are the number one , " said adidas chief executive herbert hainer during a conference call with journalists . however , figures from nike at the end of march showed the us group remains ahead on a financial basis with net profit of $ 325.8 million , -lrb- about 256 million euros -rrb- , and sales of $ 3.3 billion for the period of december to february . the claim from adidas is a sign of an intensifying battle between the companies ahead of the soccer world cup 2006 , which begins in germany next month and which is vital for both brands .
adidas is an official sponsor of the competition and is to provide the official match ball as well as kit sponsorship for six of the leading national teams in the competition . on the basis of a surge in demand for world cup merchandise , hainer announced that adidas expected to sell football equipment valued at 1.2 billion euros this year , rather than the previously expected 1.0 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both adidas-salomon and nike expect big profits from the world cup " demand for this -lrb- official -rrb- ball and other world cup products is very big , " said hainer " we 've scored on all product categories . "
adidas enthusiastic about reebock commenting on results for the first-quarter , hainer also pointed to the integration during the period of us brand reebok , which was acquired by adidas in january for more than 3.0 billion euros . " the adidas group has got off to a powerful start in the first quarter 2006 , " said company chief executive herbert hainer .
" we have made important progress in successfully integrating reebok within the adidas group and are well positioned for the world cup , which is only a month away . " the group maintained its forecasts for 2006 of growth of at least 10 percent in sales and net profit .
in morning trading on the frankfurt stock exchange , shares in adidas gained 2.11 percent to 170.93 euros in a broadly weaker market .

meiwes was originally given a lighter sentence . meiwes , 44 , had told the court that his victim , an engineer from berlin , had a death wish and begged to be killed .
" he had wanted everything just the way it eventually happened , " the man known as the " cannibal of rotenburg " said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes ' crime was international news it was the second time meiwes was tried for killing bernd jürgen brandes in rotenburg in western germany in march 2001 .
he was originally convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to eight and a half years in prison in 2004 . judges says sentence too light but on appeal , a federal judge dismissed the sentence as too lenient and ordered a retrial on the higher charge of murder . meiwes , a computer technician , met brandes after advertising on the internet for a " slaughter victim " and invited him to his farm house .
the two men had sex before meiwes severed brandes ' penis , which they then fried and tried to eat .
he later stabbed his bleeding , unconscious victim in the throat and cut away other parts of his body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victim , bernd jürgen brandes meiwes admitted that he eventually ate some 20 kilograms -lrb- 44 pounds -rrb- of brandes ' flesh , accompanied by potatoes and a pepper or wine sauce , served on " good crockery . " his lawyers had argued that he was not guilty of murder but rather of the crime of " killing on demand " which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison . " the ultimate kick " but what has fascinated the media and the public was the testimony in which meiwes revealed his obsessions and lifted the lid on an underworld of cannibalism , which meiwes claims counts about 800 members in germany . meiwes has told the court he regretted killing brandes and has apologized to his victim 's boyfriend .
but he has remained unrepentant about eating his flesh , saying it was the " ultimate kick " both of them were seeking . psychologists have told the court meiwes was a mentally sane , if lonely , man who held down a steady job .
the accused has said that his cannibal fantasies began in his childhood , when his father abandoned his family , and he dreamt of eating one of his school friends so that somebody would stay with him forever . he has also said that from his prison cell he still fantasized about killing people when he saw attractive young bodies on television or in magazines . " i find this extremely worrying , " state prosecutor annette von schmiedeberg told the court last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film he videotaped his meeting with brandes , in what prosecutors said was a bid to make sure he could watch it again later to satisfy his fantasies . the case inspired a us-made horror film titled " butterfly , a grimm love story , " but meiwes succeeded in blocking its release on the grounds that it infringed on his privacy . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannibal of rotenburg faces life sentence as retrial nears end a german state prosecutor on wednesday demanded a life sentence for self-confessed cannibal armin meiwes , saying he killed and ate a man to fulfill his sexual urges .

even today , the response to the site is divided , acknowledged lea rosh , the activist who fought for years to establish a german memorial to european jews killed by the nazis . looking back at the year , salomon korn , a member of the memorial 's board of trustees , admitted the memorial was not to everyone 's liking .
but , he said , the number of visitors attested to the monument 's power . the memorial , not far from the brandenburg gate , consists of an open space covered with 2,700 gray cement columns of different heights , and an underground information center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizer lea rosh with architect peter eisenman uwe neumärker , who heads up the foundation that created the memorial - officially the foundation for the memorial to the murdered jews - acknowledges that the 3.5 million visitor number is just an estimate .
still , the underground information center had 490,000 registered visitors , making the site a " tourism magnet , " he said . respectful treatment despite fears of vandalism , the monument has been treated with respect , neumärker said .
and in the underground documentation center , which contains historical information on the genocide perpetrated by the nazis , the people are " well behaved and quiet , without us having to tell them , " he added . the monument was designed by us architect peter eisenman , at a total cost of 27 million euros -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- .
it opened with a ceremony on may 10 , 2005 , in the presence of 1,200 guests .
two days later , it was opened to the public .
this year , on may 13 a " long night of memorial , " with readings , discussions and theater performances , is planned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monument is located near the reichstag the association 's korn , speaking on germany 's national deutschlandradio , said the strength of the field of pillars is that it does n't have a single given message , but rather is open to interpretation from everyone . and criticism of the plan - for instance , that it is unfair to have a monument only to murdered jews and not to other groups that were persecuted by the nazis , like the sinti-roma or homosexuals - has died down somewhat , acknowledged initiator rosh . " it is wonderful for us to see so many people going there , " she said .
and , she noted , visitors did not seem to have an attitude that the holocaust was something no longer important and best left in the past . little vandalism up to now , there have been five cases of swastikas being painted on the memorial 's pillars , and one star of david .
neumärker discounted the vandalism , calling it " basically , nothing . " during the creation of the monument , rosh set off an outcry when she said she planned to bury the tooth of a holocaust victim under one of the columns .
there was also a discussion over appropriate monument behavior , given the penchant of certain younger visitors to hop from pillar to pillar . a sausage stand at the monument 's edge -lrb- it is accessible from all sides , and open around the clock , seven days a week -rrb- also came under heavy fire .
now , a private builder has set up a disputed pavilion that houses a café , bookstore and snack stand . " there is always debate over this monument .
and that 's a good thing .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i think germany should remain leery of bush 's overtures toward germany and chancellor merkel .
he and his administration still have the " you 're with us or against us " mentality .
i think one need only to look at current domestic policy in the us to confirm the continuation of the black or white policy .
beware of the snake charmer .
thomas jones , los angeles , usa bush wants to win any country which is not firm in its foreign policy and make it do his .
for the last years germany aroused respect and it will be a pity if it kneels before the us . - cheludmila454 chancellor merkel absolutely deserves the credit for the vastly improved relationship between germany and the us .
she gets total respect from george bush and here is why .
she is consistent : she does n't say one thing now and another thing later , or to a different audience .
she is good-tempered and does n't show anger when being firm .
instead she is level and steady and does n't try to be showy .
she knows how to disagree without being disagreeable - and she does disagree , and she does hold firm and get her way .
but she makes bush feel ok about it .
bush acts like he 's got more sense when he 's around her .
i think this lady really has good sense and a wonderful personality for her position , and is the best thing to happen to foreign policy dynamics in a long time . - wiley horne , usa americans were going to be happy with anyone other than schröder .
people outside the united states , must understand that america and her citizens do not regret iraq .
it was a reaction to a decade-plus of hostilities from the arab world .
it may have nothing to do with sept.11 , however it allowed us to remove a long standing enemy .
americans are realizing that europe is for itself and that only a few countries like israel and australia are her true allies .
americans are returning to isolation and the world is not prepared for it . - bryan hobbs the woman is too stupid to realize that she is being used by the usa .
her mind is as drab as her dress , and she is a menace to germany 's relations with the middle east .
the woman fails to realize the implications of the gas pipeline being directly laid across the baltic to germany .
germany needs to keep clear of all middle east confrontations .
the future of germany , as the major power and leader in europe , lies in the east with trade , which will lead to the reduction of german unemployment and economic salvation as the industrial giant of europe . - kevin hendstock , australia compiled by dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : beware of the crocodile 's smile angela merkel received many plaudits during her recent visit to washington .

" we need to make sure we do n't start something we can not stop and which could get out of control afterwards , " steinmeier said on tuesday in an interview with german public television station zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says there are unanswered questions when it comes to iran he said " five or six questions are still open " before a draft resolution could be concluded calling for iran to halt its uranium enrichment . zdf said steinmeier had estimated it could take two weeks before they resolved their differences , but did n't provide any details from the german foreign minister supporting that timeframe .
russia and china have resisted the draft resolution . " important and difficult meeting " earlier britain 's new foreign secretary margaret beckett , making her debut on the international scene , called the session an " important and difficult meeting .

" there is not yet agreement on the tactics and what 's most pronounced is that there is no agreement yet that this should be a chapter seven resolution , " said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
" based on tonight 's meeting , i would not expect a resolution to be voted on and adopted this week . " further talks needed russian news agencies quoted moscow 's top envoy , sergei lavrov , as calling for further negotiations , including more direct talks between major powers and iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister lavrov , left with condoleezza rice " there was general agreement on the need to create conditions for resuming direct negotiations on iran 's nuclear program , " interfax news agency quoted lavrov as telling russian reporters in new york . france 's chief diplomat philippe douste-blazy said the ministers discussed " incentives and dissuasive measures according to the iranian response " in the confrontation . among the incentives raised by the french minister were cooperation in civilian nuclear energy , increased commercial and technological ties and security guarantees that the united states has refused to provide . us secretary of sate condoleezza rice had earlier monday billed the talks as " a time for the international community to come together and say with very great clarity it 's time for iran to accede to the demands of the international community . " us unimpressed by ahmadinejad 's letter the ministers also discussed the letter made public monday from iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad offering to seek ways to ease tensions with the united states . us officials said the 18-page rambling letter was more a philosophical treatise than a political overture and did not change washington 's position in the nuclear dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us says ahmadinejad 's letter contains nothing new " there is nothing in this letter that in any way addresses any of the issues really that are on the table in the international community , " rice told the editorial board of the associated press news agency monday .

" we need to make sure we do n't start something we can not stop and which could get out of control afterwards , " steinmeier said on tuesday in an interview with german public television station zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says there are unanswered questions when it comes to iran he said " five or six questions are still open " before a draft resolution could be concluded calling for iran to halt its uranium enrichment . zdf said steinmeier had estimated it could take two weeks before they resolved their differences , but did n't provide any details from the german foreign minister supporting that timeframe .
russia and china have resisted the draft resolution . " important and difficult meeting " earlier britain 's new foreign secretary margaret beckett , making her debut on the international scene , called the session an " important and difficult meeting . " " everyone believed iran must give up its nuclear enrichment program , " beckett told reporters .
" it 's the way to achieve that we have to agree -lrb- on -rrb- . " participants said the ministers , who met for two hours on monday without aides before going into dinner , agreed on the need to keep iran from using its civilian nuclear program to develop atomic bombs . but a senior us official reported no progress in melting russian and chinese resistance to american calls for tough action under chapter seven of the un charter , which would authorize sanctions or the use of force . " there is not yet agreement on the tactics and what 's most pronounced is that there is no agreement yet that this should be a chapter seven resolution , " said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
" based on tonight 's meeting , i would not expect a resolution to be voted on and adopted this week . " further talks needed russian news agencies quoted moscow 's top envoy , sergei lavrov , as calling for further negotiations , including more direct talks between major powers and iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister lavrov , left with condoleezza rice " there was general agreement on the need to create conditions for resuming direct negotiations on iran 's nuclear program , " interfax news agency quoted lavrov as telling russian reporters in new york . france 's chief diplomat philippe douste-blazy said the ministers discussed " incentives and dissuasive measures according to the iranian response " in the confrontation . among the incentives raised by the french minister were cooperation in civilian nuclear energy , increased commercial and technological ties and security guarantees that the united states has refused to provide . us secretary of sate condoleezza rice had earlier monday billed the talks as " a time for the international community to come together and say with very great clarity it 's time for iran to accede to the demands of the international community . " us unimpressed by ahmadinejad 's letter the ministers also discussed the letter made public monday from iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad offering to seek ways to ease tensions with the united states . us officials said the 18-page rambling letter was more a philosophical treatise than a political overture and did not change washington 's position in the nuclear dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us says ahmadinejad 's letter contains nothing new " there is nothing in this letter that in any way addresses any of the issues really that are on the table in the international community , " rice told the editorial board of the associated press news agency monday . " it is most assuredly not a proposal , " she said , according to a state department transcript .
" there is nothing in here that would suggest that we 're on any different course than we were before we got the letter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.05.2006 opinion : german foreign minister rediscovers latin america großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier in chile : now is the time for the eu to focus on latin america german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has completed his first trip to south america and concluded that the continent deserves more attention from the eu .
he 's right , says dw 's mirjam gehrke . part of frank-walter steinmeier 's journey involved preparations for the european union-latin america summit to take place in vienna in mid-may .
yet it was the foreign minister 's comment that germany and the european union should focus its gaze more on latin american countries that must have been music to the ears of his partners in dialogue . latin america has been feeling neglected by europe for nearly two decades .
just as the era of military dictatorships was coming to a close at the end of the 1980s and the countries in the region were slowly starting to pave the way to democracy , the wall came down in berlin .
with the cold war over , europe - and germany , in particular - began focusing on the east . latin america back on the map now , it is high time to put latin america back on the agenda again .
while the united states has been concentrating its entire political and military attention on afghanistan , iraq and iran , over the past years a shift to the left has been occurring south of the rio grande .
the changes in each country must be viewed in differentiated fashion .
however , they all have a common denominator : the countries ' inhabitants are disappointed and angry about the consequences of the neo-liberal economic order that has hardly helped to overcome poverty in latin america .
quite the contrary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin america has set its sights on europe the united states ' policy on latin america has failed .
the best proof of that are the plans for the free trade area of the americas - ftaa - which have been put on hold .
us president george w. bush 's administration would have liked to have seen the plans to unite the economies of the americas into a single free-trade area go into effect back in 2005 . european union has been a beacon for mercosur now , the european union is enjoying its hour of glory : european integration is viewed by argentina and brazil as a model for mercosur .
this economic association , to which uruguay and paraguay also belong and to which venezuela will become a full member at the end of 2006 , could offer exciting impulses for the creation of a single south american market .
the european union even beats the united states as mercosur 's most important trading partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivian president evo morales threatened to evict foreign companies unless they gave bolivia control of gas production however , it is not only the economic cooperation that can and must be expanded .
criticism of decisions such as that of bolivian president evo morales ' decision to dispatch soldiers to the country 's oil and gas posts is certainly appropriate in political dialogue . yet a more differentiated view is also required here : those who make blanket statements about leftist populism in light of the nationalization of the bolivian gas reserves - rather than entering into a constructive critical dialogue - are ignoring the democratically articulated will of an entire people .

he 's right , says dw 's mirjam gehrke . part of frank-walter steinmeier 's journey involved preparations for the european union-latin america summit to take place in vienna in mid-may .
yet it was the foreign minister 's comment that germany and the european union should focus its gaze more on latin american countries that must have been music to the ears of his partners in dialogue . latin america has been feeling neglected by europe for nearly two decades .
just as the era of military dictatorships was coming to a close at the end of the 1980s and the countries in the region were slowly starting to pave the way to democracy , the wall came down in berlin .
with the cold war over , europe - and germany , in particular - began focusing on the east . latin america back on the map now , it is high time to put latin america back on the agenda again .
while the united states has been concentrating its entire political and military attention on afghanistan , iraq and iran , over the past years a shift to the left has been occurring south of the rio grande .
the changes in each country must be viewed in differentiated fashion .
however , they all have a common denominator : the countries ' inhabitants are disappointed and angry about the consequences of the neo-liberal economic order that has hardly helped to overcome poverty in latin america .
quite the contrary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin america has set its sights on europe the united states ' policy on latin america has failed .
the best proof of that are the plans for the free trade area of the americas - ftaa - which have been put on hold .
us president george w. bush 's administration would have liked to have seen the plans to unite the economies of the americas into a single free-trade area go into effect back in 2005 . european union has been a beacon for mercosur now , the european union is enjoying its hour of glory : european integration is viewed by argentina and brazil as a model for mercosur .
this economic association , to which uruguay and paraguay also belong and to which venezuela will become a full member at the end of 2006 , could offer exciting impulses for the creation of a single south american market .
the european union even beats the united states as mercosur 's most important trading partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivian president evo morales threatened to evict foreign companies unless they gave bolivia control of gas production however , it is not only the economic cooperation that can and must be expanded .
criticism of decisions such as that of bolivian president evo morales ' decision to dispatch soldiers to the country 's oil and gas posts is certainly appropriate in political dialogue . yet a more differentiated view is also required here : those who make blanket statements about leftist populism in light of the nationalization of the bolivian gas reserves - rather than entering into a constructive critical dialogue - are ignoring the democratically articulated will of an entire people .
and just as important as fighting poverty in latin america is overcoming the political-institutional crisis and reinforcing democracy . latin america needs more than lip service countries like peru , ecuador , but also venezuela , are far from achieving what chile , brazil and argentina have already accomplished .
if europe wants to expand its trade relations with latin america , then it can not avoid conducting a constructive political dialogue with countries like bolivia as well .
in fact , it must conduct a dialogue precisely with such countries . the eu-latin america summit in vienna this week will reveal whether or not steinmeier was merely paying lip service to latin america .

" we need to make sure we do n't start something we can not stop and which could get out of control afterwards , " steinmeier said on tuesday in an interview with german public television station zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says there are unanswered questions when it comes to iran he said " five or six questions are still open " before a draft resolution could be concluded calling for iran to halt its uranium enrichment . zdf said steinmeier had estimated it could take two weeks before they resolved their differences , but did n't provide any details from the german foreign minister supporting that timeframe .
russia and china have resisted the draft resolution .

" there is not yet agreement on the tactics and what 's most pronounced is that there is no agreement yet that this should be a chapter seven resolution , " said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
" based on tonight 's meeting , i would not expect a resolution to be voted on and adopted this week .

even today , the response to the site is divided , acknowledged lea rosh , the activist who fought for years to establish a german memorial to european jews killed by the nazis . looking back at the year , salomon korn , a member of the memorial 's board of trustees , admitted the memorial was not to everyone 's liking .

" it is wonderful for us to see so many people going there , " she said .
and , she noted , visitors did not seem to have an attitude that the holocaust was something no longer important and best left in the past . little vandalism up to now , there have been five cases of swastikas being painted on the memorial 's pillars , and one star of david .
neumärker discounted the vandalism , calling it " basically , nothing . " during the creation of the monument , rosh set off an outcry when she said she planned to bury the tooth of a holocaust victim under one of the columns .

he 's right , says dw 's mirjam gehrke . part of frank-walter steinmeier 's journey involved preparations for the european union-latin america summit to take place in vienna in mid-may .
yet it was the foreign minister 's comment that germany and the european union should focus its gaze more on latin american countries that must have been music to the ears of his partners in dialogue . latin america has been feeling neglected by europe for nearly two decades .
just as the era of military dictatorships was coming to a close at the end of the 1980s and the countries in the region were slowly starting to pave the way to democracy , the wall came down in berlin .
with the cold war over , europe - and germany , in particular - began focusing on the east . latin america back on the map now , it is high time to put latin america back on the agenda again .
while the united states has been concentrating its entire political and military attention on afghanistan , iraq and iran , over the past years a shift to the left has been occurring south of the rio grande .
the changes in each country must be viewed in differentiated fashion .
however , they all have a common denominator : the countries ' inhabitants are disappointed and angry about the consequences of the neo-liberal economic order that has hardly helped to overcome poverty in latin america .
quite the contrary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin america has set its sights on europe the united states ' policy on latin america has failed .
the best proof of that are the plans for the free trade area of the americas - ftaa - which have been put on hold .
us president george w. bush 's administration would have liked to have seen the plans to unite the economies of the americas into a single free-trade area go into effect back in 2005 . european union has been a beacon for mercosur now , the european union is enjoying its hour of glory : european integration is viewed by argentina and brazil as a model for mercosur .
this economic association , to which uruguay and paraguay also belong and to which venezuela will become a full member at the end of 2006 , could offer exciting impulses for the creation of a single south american market .
the european union even beats the united states as mercosur 's most important trading partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivian president evo morales threatened to evict foreign companies unless they gave bolivia control of gas production however , it is not only the economic cooperation that can and must be expanded .
criticism of decisions such as that of bolivian president evo morales ' decision to dispatch soldiers to the country 's oil and gas posts is certainly appropriate in political dialogue . yet a more differentiated view is also required here : those who make blanket statements about leftist populism in light of the nationalization of the bolivian gas reserves - rather than entering into a constructive critical dialogue - are ignoring the democratically articulated will of an entire people .
and just as important as fighting poverty in latin america is overcoming the political-institutional crisis and reinforcing democracy . latin america needs more than lip service countries like peru , ecuador , but also venezuela , are far from achieving what chile , brazil and argentina have already accomplished .
if europe wants to expand its trade relations with latin america , then it can not avoid conducting a constructive political dialogue with countries like bolivia as well .
in fact , it must conduct a dialogue precisely with such countries . the eu-latin america summit in vienna this week will reveal whether or not steinmeier was merely paying lip service to latin america .
politicians , however , should not just leave that agenda up to the economy and the interests of multi-national corporations . mirjam gehrke -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier concerned about bolivian nationalization plans during a trip to latin america , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has voiced concerns over plans to nationalize bolivia 's oil and gas industry by the country 's new president , evo morales .

he 's right , says dw 's mirjam gehrke . part of frank-walter steinmeier 's journey involved preparations for the european union-latin america summit to take place in vienna in mid-may .
yet it was the foreign minister 's comment that germany and the european union should focus its gaze more on latin american countries that must have been music to the ears of his partners in dialogue . latin america has been feeling neglected by europe for nearly two decades .
just as the era of military dictatorships was coming to a close at the end of the 1980s and the countries in the region were slowly starting to pave the way to democracy , the wall came down in berlin .
with the cold war over , europe - and germany , in particular - began focusing on the east . latin america back on the map now , it is high time to put latin america back on the agenda again .
while the united states has been concentrating its entire political and military attention on afghanistan , iraq and iran , over the past years a shift to the left has been occurring south of the rio grande .
the changes in each country must be viewed in differentiated fashion .
however , they all have a common denominator : the countries ' inhabitants are disappointed and angry about the consequences of the neo-liberal economic order that has hardly helped to overcome poverty in latin america .
quite the contrary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin america has set its sights on europe the united states ' policy on latin america has failed .
the best proof of that are the plans for the free trade area of the americas - ftaa - which have been put on hold .
us president george w. bush 's administration would have liked to have seen the plans to unite the economies of the americas into a single free-trade area go into effect back in 2005 . european union has been a beacon for mercosur now , the european union is enjoying its hour of glory : european integration is viewed by argentina and brazil as a model for mercosur .
this economic association , to which uruguay and paraguay also belong and to which venezuela will become a full member at the end of 2006 , could offer exciting impulses for the creation of a single south american market .
the european union even beats the united states as mercosur 's most important trading partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivian president evo morales threatened to evict foreign companies unless they gave bolivia control of gas production however , it is not only the economic cooperation that can and must be expanded .
criticism of decisions such as that of bolivian president evo morales ' decision to dispatch soldiers to the country 's oil and gas posts is certainly appropriate in political dialogue . yet a more differentiated view is also required here : those who make blanket statements about leftist populism in light of the nationalization of the bolivian gas reserves - rather than entering into a constructive critical dialogue - are ignoring the democratically articulated will of an entire people .
and just as important as fighting poverty in latin america is overcoming the political-institutional crisis and reinforcing democracy . latin america needs more than lip service countries like peru , ecuador , but also venezuela , are far from achieving what chile , brazil and argentina have already accomplished .
if europe wants to expand its trade relations with latin america , then it can not avoid conducting a constructive political dialogue with countries like bolivia as well .
in fact , it must conduct a dialogue precisely with such countries . the eu-latin america summit in vienna this week will reveal whether or not steinmeier was merely paying lip service to latin america .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's foreign intelligence agency in the spotlight germany ’ s foreign intelligence agency turns 50 german politicians to face grilling as bnd inquiry begins europe -pipe- 09.05.2006 cia affair becoming a sharper thorn in transatlantic relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain , germany and others are investigating " extraordinary rendition " flights european investigations into secret cia flights and interrogation centers go on as mounting evidence showing they existed on european soil continues to be a diplomatic headache . in a statement that generated little public interest on thursday , the us announced that it would brief european officials about secret intelligence activities such as rendition flights allegedly carried out on european soil . but within diplomatic circles , the statement by us attorney general alberto gonzales pledging to brief a european parliament delegation to washington this week on clandestine intelligence activities caused a stir . " it signals that the us is feeling pressure over an issue they thought would die down and has n't , " said one german diplomat familiar with the issue . european officials pushing harder european leaders were initially slow to react to allegations of secret flights carrying suspected terrorists landing on their soil after reports of them first leaked in november .
experts say that is because european governments were more informed than they wanted to admit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giovanni claudio fava says the flights were not " tourist " flights but since eu commission officials first downplayed the issue late last year , the council of europe , a human rights watchdog , has continued to investigate .
at the same time , countries such as germany and italy are probing the issue - the bundestag will hold more hearings this week to find out what german officials knew .
most officials say it is unlikely that european governments were kept in the dark . meanwhile , an eu parliamentary committee issued a report last month saying that the cia carried out as many as 1,000 secret flights in the past five years , transporting suspected terrorists to third countries .
and parliamentarians took eu foreign policy chief javier solana to task for failing to probe the issue more aggressively during a parliamentary inquiry last week where he condemned such activities but said he did not have the jurisdiction to demand answers .

" we need to make sure we do n't start something we can not stop and which could get out of control afterwards , " steinmeier said on tuesday in an interview with german public television station zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says there are unanswered questions when it comes to iran he said " five or six questions are still open " before a draft resolution could be concluded calling for iran to halt its uranium enrichment . zdf said steinmeier had estimated it could take two weeks before they resolved their differences , but did n't provide any details from the german foreign minister supporting that timeframe .
russia and china have resisted the draft resolution . " important and difficult meeting " earlier britain 's new foreign secretary margaret beckett , making her debut on the international scene , called the session an " important and difficult meeting .

" there is not yet agreement on the tactics and what 's most pronounced is that there is no agreement yet that this should be a chapter seven resolution , " said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
" based on tonight 's meeting , i would not expect a resolution to be voted on and adopted this week . " further talks needed russian news agencies quoted moscow 's top envoy , sergei lavrov , as calling for further negotiations , including more direct talks between major powers and iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister lavrov , left with condoleezza rice " there was general agreement on the need to create conditions for resuming direct negotiations on iran 's nuclear program , " interfax news agency quoted lavrov as telling russian reporters in new york . france 's chief diplomat philippe douste-blazy said the ministers discussed " incentives and dissuasive measures according to the iranian response " in the confrontation . among the incentives raised by the french minister were cooperation in civilian nuclear energy , increased commercial and technological ties and security guarantees that the united states has refused to provide . us secretary of sate condoleezza rice had earlier monday billed the talks as " a time for the international community to come together and say with very great clarity it 's time for iran to accede to the demands of the international community . " us unimpressed by ahmadinejad 's letter the ministers also discussed the letter made public monday from iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad offering to seek ways to ease tensions with the united states . us officials said the 18-page rambling letter was more a philosophical treatise than a political overture and did not change washington 's position in the nuclear dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us says ahmadinejad 's letter contains nothing new " there is nothing in this letter that in any way addresses any of the issues really that are on the table in the international community , " rice told the editorial board of the associated press news agency monday . " it is most assuredly not a proposal , " she said , according to a state department transcript .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.05.2006 creators praise popularity of berlin holocaust monument großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers admit not everyone likes the site but they 're happy with the turnout as the holocaust memorial in berlin nears its first anniversary , initiators looked back at a year of controversy - and success . the memorial to the murdered jews in europe in berlin was visited by 3.5 million people in its first year , organizers said , but nonetheless it remains controversial .
even today , the response to the site is divided , acknowledged lea rosh , the activist who fought for years to establish a german memorial to european jews killed by the nazis . looking back at the year , salomon korn , a member of the memorial 's board of trustees , admitted the memorial was not to everyone 's liking .
but , he said , the number of visitors attested to the monument 's power . the memorial , not far from the brandenburg gate , consists of an open space covered with 2,700 gray cement columns of different heights , and an underground information center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizer lea rosh with architect peter eisenman uwe neumärker , who heads up the foundation that created the memorial - officially the foundation for the memorial to the murdered jews - acknowledges that the 3.5 million visitor number is just an estimate .
still , the underground information center had 490,000 registered visitors , making the site a " tourism magnet , " he said . respectful treatment despite fears of vandalism , the monument has been treated with respect , neumärker said .
and in the underground documentation center , which contains historical information on the genocide perpetrated by the nazis , the people are " well behaved and quiet , without us having to tell them , " he added . the monument was designed by us architect peter eisenman , at a total cost of 27 million euros -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- .
it opened with a ceremony on may 10 , 2005 , in the presence of 1,200 guests .
two days later , it was opened to the public .
this year , on may 13 a " long night of memorial , " with readings , discussions and theater performances , is planned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monument is located near the reichstag the association 's korn , speaking on germany 's national deutschlandradio , said the strength of the field of pillars is that it does n't have a single given message , but rather is open to interpretation from everyone . and criticism of the plan - for instance , that it is unfair to have a monument only to murdered jews and not to other groups that were persecuted by the nazis , like the sinti-roma or homosexuals - has died down somewhat , acknowledged initiator rosh . " it is wonderful for us to see so many people going there , " she said .
and , she noted , visitors did not seem to have an attitude that the holocaust was something no longer important and best left in the past . little vandalism up to now , there have been five cases of swastikas being painted on the memorial 's pillars , and one star of david .
neumärker discounted the vandalism , calling it " basically , nothing . " during the creation of the monument , rosh set off an outcry when she said she planned to bury the tooth of a holocaust victim under one of the columns .
there was also a discussion over appropriate monument behavior , given the penchant of certain younger visitors to hop from pillar to pillar . a sausage stand at the monument 's edge -lrb- it is accessible from all sides , and open around the clock , seven days a week -rrb- also came under heavy fire .
now , a private builder has set up a disputed pavilion that houses a café , bookstore and snack stand . " there is always debate over this monument .
and that 's a good thing .
as long as people are talking about it , it will stay alive , " neumärker said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to allow opening of huge holocaust archive germany agreed tuesday to support opening a massive trove of world war ii records on 17.5 million victims of the nazi regime , after six decades of highly restricted access .

debate over quotes comparing the genocide of the jews and of the sinti and roma had stalled construction . the government will finance the 2 million euro -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- memorial , which is to be built between the reichstag and brandenburg gate in central berlin .
federal culture secretary bernd neumann announced to journalists on monday that construction would begin quickly , pending agreement from the social democrats . romani rose , head of the central council of german sinti and roma , said the agreement is an " important step " toward officially recognizing the genocide committed on the minority group .
he said he was " very happy " about the agreement . debate about a central inscription on the memorial has raged for years , hampering the memorial 's construction .
now , the various sides agreed that the memorial , which will be designed by artist dani karavan and shaped like a fountain , will not contain an inscription .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazis used face masks of sinti and roma to " prove racial inferiority " instead , the names of the nazi concentration camps auschwitz , treblinka and buchenwald will be chiseled into the slabs leading up to the memorial .
an additional tablet will display the sentence " we commemorate all the roma who were victims of the systematic genocide in nazi-occupied europe . "
schmidt recognized genocide information panels will display a chronology of the exclusion , persecution and annihilation of the sinti and roma .
the murder of hundreds of thousands of sinti and roma is considered the second-largest act of genocide carried out by nazis in europe , following the killing of millions of jews . the final information panel is to contain quotes by former german president roman herzog and former chancellor helmut schmidt .
the central council has long insisted that the quote from herzog be used in which he drew parallels between the annihilation of the sinti and roma and the holocaust of the jews .
schmidt deemed the killing of the sinti and roma genocide in 1982 . another association of sinti , called the " sinti alliance , " has been at odds with the central council .
the group would like to see other " gypsy ethnic groups " mentioned as victims of nazi violence . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de holocaust remembrance day more relevant than ever jan .

" we need to make sure we do n't start something we can not stop and which could get out of control afterwards , " steinmeier said on tuesday in an interview with german public television station zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says there are unanswered questions when it comes to iran he said " five or six questions are still open " before a draft resolution could be concluded calling for iran to halt its uranium enrichment . zdf said steinmeier had estimated it could take two weeks before they resolved their differences , but did n't provide any details from the german foreign minister supporting that timeframe .
russia and china have resisted the draft resolution . " important and difficult meeting " earlier britain 's new foreign secretary margaret beckett , making her debut on the international scene , called the session an " important and difficult meeting . " " everyone believed iran must give up its nuclear enrichment program , " beckett told reporters .
" it 's the way to achieve that we have to agree -lrb- on -rrb- . " participants said the ministers , who met for two hours on monday without aides before going into dinner , agreed on the need to keep iran from using its civilian nuclear program to develop atomic bombs . but a senior us official reported no progress in melting russian and chinese resistance to american calls for tough action under chapter seven of the un charter , which would authorize sanctions or the use of force . " there is not yet agreement on the tactics and what 's most pronounced is that there is no agreement yet that this should be a chapter seven resolution , " said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
" based on tonight 's meeting , i would not expect a resolution to be voted on and adopted this week . " further talks needed russian news agencies quoted moscow 's top envoy , sergei lavrov , as calling for further negotiations , including more direct talks between major powers and iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister lavrov , left with condoleezza rice " there was general agreement on the need to create conditions for resuming direct negotiations on iran 's nuclear program , " interfax news agency quoted lavrov as telling russian reporters in new york . france 's chief diplomat philippe douste-blazy said the ministers discussed " incentives and dissuasive measures according to the iranian response " in the confrontation . among the incentives raised by the french minister were cooperation in civilian nuclear energy , increased commercial and technological ties and security guarantees that the united states has refused to provide . us secretary of sate condoleezza rice had earlier monday billed the talks as " a time for the international community to come together and say with very great clarity it 's time for iran to accede to the demands of the international community . " us unimpressed by ahmadinejad 's letter the ministers also discussed the letter made public monday from iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad offering to seek ways to ease tensions with the united states . us officials said the 18-page rambling letter was more a philosophical treatise than a political overture and did not change washington 's position in the nuclear dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us says ahmadinejad 's letter contains nothing new " there is nothing in this letter that in any way addresses any of the issues really that are on the table in the international community , " rice told the editorial board of the associated press news agency monday . " it is most assuredly not a proposal , " she said , according to a state department transcript .
" there is nothing in here that would suggest that we 're on any different course than we were before we got the letter .

even today , the response to the site is divided , acknowledged lea rosh , the activist who fought for years to establish a german memorial to european jews killed by the nazis . looking back at the year , salomon korn , a member of the memorial 's board of trustees , admitted the memorial was not to everyone 's liking .
but , he said , the number of visitors attested to the monument 's power . the memorial , not far from the brandenburg gate , consists of an open space covered with 2,700 gray cement columns of different heights , and an underground information center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizer lea rosh with architect peter eisenman uwe neumärker , who heads up the foundation that created the memorial - officially the foundation for the memorial to the murdered jews - acknowledges that the 3.5 million visitor number is just an estimate .
still , the underground information center had 490,000 registered visitors , making the site a " tourism magnet , " he said . respectful treatment despite fears of vandalism , the monument has been treated with respect , neumärker said .
and in the underground documentation center , which contains historical information on the genocide perpetrated by the nazis , the people are " well behaved and quiet , without us having to tell them , " he added . the monument was designed by us architect peter eisenman , at a total cost of 27 million euros -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- .

" it is wonderful for us to see so many people going there , " she said .
and , she noted , visitors did not seem to have an attitude that the holocaust was something no longer important and best left in the past . little vandalism up to now , there have been five cases of swastikas being painted on the memorial 's pillars , and one star of david .
neumärker discounted the vandalism , calling it " basically , nothing . " during the creation of the monument , rosh set off an outcry when she said she planned to bury the tooth of a holocaust victim under one of the columns .
there was also a discussion over appropriate monument behavior , given the penchant of certain younger visitors to hop from pillar to pillar . a sausage stand at the monument 's edge -lrb- it is accessible from all sides , and open around the clock , seven days a week -rrb- also came under heavy fire .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's foreign intelligence agency in the spotlight germany ’ s foreign intelligence agency turns 50 german politicians to face grilling as bnd inquiry begins europe -pipe- 09.05.2006 cia affair becoming a sharper thorn in transatlantic relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain , germany and others are investigating " extraordinary rendition " flights european investigations into secret cia flights and interrogation centers go on as mounting evidence showing they existed on european soil continues to be a diplomatic headache . in a statement that generated little public interest on thursday , the us announced that it would brief european officials about secret intelligence activities such as rendition flights allegedly carried out on european soil . but within diplomatic circles , the statement by us attorney general alberto gonzales pledging to brief a european parliament delegation to washington this week on clandestine intelligence activities caused a stir . " it signals that the us is feeling pressure over an issue they thought would die down and has n't , " said one german diplomat familiar with the issue . european officials pushing harder european leaders were initially slow to react to allegations of secret flights carrying suspected terrorists landing on their soil after reports of them first leaked in november .
experts say that is because european governments were more informed than they wanted to admit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giovanni claudio fava says the flights were not " tourist " flights but since eu commission officials first downplayed the issue late last year , the council of europe , a human rights watchdog , has continued to investigate .
at the same time , countries such as germany and italy are probing the issue - the bundestag will hold more hearings this week to find out what german officials knew .
most officials say it is unlikely that european governments were kept in the dark . meanwhile , an eu parliamentary committee issued a report last month saying that the cia carried out as many as 1,000 secret flights in the past five years , transporting suspected terrorists to third countries .
and parliamentarians took eu foreign policy chief javier solana to task for failing to probe the issue more aggressively during a parliamentary inquiry last week where he condemned such activities but said he did not have the jurisdiction to demand answers . " i have no information whatsoever that tells me with certainty that any of the accusations , allegations , rumors , etcetera that have taken place in the last year 's time are true , " he told parliamentarians . deputies shook their heads at such evasive responses . " i regret profoundly you say that you do n't intend to take any leadership role here , " one deputy responded .
" you are in a way washing your hands of responsibility . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german khalid al-masri told eu deputies of his alleged abduction by the cia the european parliament is an elected body and is considered more representative of european public opinion than other eu institutions .
and since the public has kept this issue in the forefront , officials such as italian eu parliament member giovanni claudio fava , a member of the special inquiry committee , said the eu parliament will continue to push hard for answers .
already , they have heard testimony from people such as kuwaiti-born german citizen khalid al-masri , who said he was detained by foreign agents in macedonia on dec .
31 , 2003 , while on holiday , flown to afghanistan and tortured . " our job is to find out the truth , and if the truth is that there have been illegal cia flights on our territory we ca n't remain silent , " he told reporters .
" these were not tourist flights . " no longer a wall of silence at first , us officials said little about the issue .
but experts in transatlantic relations say that increased european pressure and fears of weakened intelligence cooperation is changing that . last week , gonzales said that " rendition is an activity that is practiced by the united states and other countries . " and john bellinger , advisor to us secretary of state condoleezza rice , flew to brussels to meet with eu and nato officials last week and admitted that there had been secret intelligence flights even as he dismissed the number .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the topic did n't come up during merkel 's us visit last week " these allegations that there have been thousands of flights with the implication that they all have got detainees on them and worse , detainees bound for mistreatment is simply absurd , " he said during a press conference .
" there have been , as we have said , very few cases of rendition , the last one about three years ago .
many of these flights that have occurred may be carrying analysts , officials engaged in counter-terrorism cooperation and forensic evidence . " hurting intelligence cooperation us officials say that the rumors and furor over the flights are hurting intelligence cooperation . " this furor over renditions , and the furor over the flights alone , and the suggestion that flights alone are somehow improper or engaged in illegal activity is undermining intelligence cooperation , " bellinger said .
" next time , the us may be reluctant to bring people to europe or exchange information . " but european willingness to cooperate has also been threatened . " there is still interest in ongoing cooperation but only if the suspicion is eliminated that the cia has betrayed its european partners , " said henning riecke , an expert on transatlantic relations and security policy at the german council on foreign relations . regardless , eu parliamentarians will meet with us officials such as us assistant secretary of state daniel fried and bellinger this week to get more details .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's foreign intelligence agency in the spotlight germany ’ s foreign intelligence agency turns 50 german politicians to face grilling as bnd inquiry begins europe -pipe- 09.05.2006 cia affair becoming a sharper thorn in transatlantic relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain , germany and others are investigating " extraordinary rendition " flights european investigations into secret cia flights and interrogation centers go on as mounting evidence showing they existed on european soil continues to be a diplomatic headache . in a statement that generated little public interest on thursday , the us announced that it would brief european officials about secret intelligence activities such as rendition flights allegedly carried out on european soil . but within diplomatic circles , the statement by us attorney general alberto gonzales pledging to brief a european parliament delegation to washington this week on clandestine intelligence activities caused a stir . " it signals that the us is feeling pressure over an issue they thought would die down and has n't , " said one german diplomat familiar with the issue . european officials pushing harder european leaders were initially slow to react to allegations of secret flights carrying suspected terrorists landing on their soil after reports of them first leaked in november .
experts say that is because european governments were more informed than they wanted to admit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giovanni claudio fava says the flights were not " tourist " flights but since eu commission officials first downplayed the issue late last year , the council of europe , a human rights watchdog , has continued to investigate .
at the same time , countries such as germany and italy are probing the issue - the bundestag will hold more hearings this week to find out what german officials knew .
most officials say it is unlikely that european governments were kept in the dark . meanwhile , an eu parliamentary committee issued a report last month saying that the cia carried out as many as 1,000 secret flights in the past five years , transporting suspected terrorists to third countries .
and parliamentarians took eu foreign policy chief javier solana to task for failing to probe the issue more aggressively during a parliamentary inquiry last week where he condemned such activities but said he did not have the jurisdiction to demand answers . " i have no information whatsoever that tells me with certainty that any of the accusations , allegations , rumors , etcetera that have taken place in the last year 's time are true , " he told parliamentarians . deputies shook their heads at such evasive responses . " i regret profoundly you say that you do n't intend to take any leadership role here , " one deputy responded .
" you are in a way washing your hands of responsibility . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german khalid al-masri told eu deputies of his alleged abduction by the cia the european parliament is an elected body and is considered more representative of european public opinion than other eu institutions .
and since the public has kept this issue in the forefront , officials such as italian eu parliament member giovanni claudio fava , a member of the special inquiry committee , said the eu parliament will continue to push hard for answers .
already , they have heard testimony from people such as kuwaiti-born german citizen khalid al-masri , who said he was detained by foreign agents in macedonia on dec .
31 , 2003 , while on holiday , flown to afghanistan and tortured . " our job is to find out the truth , and if the truth is that there have been illegal cia flights on our territory we ca n't remain silent , " he told reporters .
" these were not tourist flights . " no longer a wall of silence at first , us officials said little about the issue .
but experts in transatlantic relations say that increased european pressure and fears of weakened intelligence cooperation is changing that . last week , gonzales said that " rendition is an activity that is practiced by the united states and other countries . " and john bellinger , advisor to us secretary of state condoleezza rice , flew to brussels to meet with eu and nato officials last week and admitted that there had been secret intelligence flights even as he dismissed the number .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the topic did n't come up during merkel 's us visit last week " these allegations that there have been thousands of flights with the implication that they all have got detainees on them and worse , detainees bound for mistreatment is simply absurd , " he said during a press conference .
" there have been , as we have said , very few cases of rendition , the last one about three years ago .
many of these flights that have occurred may be carrying analysts , officials engaged in counter-terrorism cooperation and forensic evidence . " hurting intelligence cooperation us officials say that the rumors and furor over the flights are hurting intelligence cooperation . " this furor over renditions , and the furor over the flights alone , and the suggestion that flights alone are somehow improper or engaged in illegal activity is undermining intelligence cooperation , " bellinger said .
" next time , the us may be reluctant to bring people to europe or exchange information . " but european willingness to cooperate has also been threatened .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.05.2006 opinion : german foreign minister rediscovers latin america großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier in chile : now is the time for the eu to focus on latin america german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has completed his first trip to south america and concluded that the continent deserves more attention from the eu .
he 's right , says dw 's mirjam gehrke . part of frank-walter steinmeier 's journey involved preparations for the european union-latin america summit to take place in vienna in mid-may .
yet it was the foreign minister 's comment that germany and the european union should focus its gaze more on latin american countries that must have been music to the ears of his partners in dialogue . latin america has been feeling neglected by europe for nearly two decades .
just as the era of military dictatorships was coming to a close at the end of the 1980s and the countries in the region were slowly starting to pave the way to democracy , the wall came down in berlin .
with the cold war over , europe - and germany , in particular - began focusing on the east . latin america back on the map now , it is high time to put latin america back on the agenda again .
while the united states has been concentrating its entire political and military attention on afghanistan , iraq and iran , over the past years a shift to the left has been occurring south of the rio grande .
the changes in each country must be viewed in differentiated fashion .
however , they all have a common denominator : the countries ' inhabitants are disappointed and angry about the consequences of the neo-liberal economic order that has hardly helped to overcome poverty in latin america .
quite the contrary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin america has set its sights on europe the united states ' policy on latin america has failed .
the best proof of that are the plans for the free trade area of the americas - ftaa - which have been put on hold .
us president george w. bush 's administration would have liked to have seen the plans to unite the economies of the americas into a single free-trade area go into effect back in 2005 . european union has been a beacon for mercosur now , the european union is enjoying its hour of glory : european integration is viewed by argentina and brazil as a model for mercosur .
this economic association , to which uruguay and paraguay also belong and to which venezuela will become a full member at the end of 2006 , could offer exciting impulses for the creation of a single south american market .
the european union even beats the united states as mercosur 's most important trading partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivian president evo morales threatened to evict foreign companies unless they gave bolivia control of gas production however , it is not only the economic cooperation that can and must be expanded .
criticism of decisions such as that of bolivian president evo morales ' decision to dispatch soldiers to the country 's oil and gas posts is certainly appropriate in political dialogue . yet a more differentiated view is also required here : those who make blanket statements about leftist populism in light of the nationalization of the bolivian gas reserves - rather than entering into a constructive critical dialogue - are ignoring the democratically articulated will of an entire people .
and just as important as fighting poverty in latin america is overcoming the political-institutional crisis and reinforcing democracy . latin america needs more than lip service countries like peru , ecuador , but also venezuela , are far from achieving what chile , brazil and argentina have already accomplished .
if europe wants to expand its trade relations with latin america , then it can not avoid conducting a constructive political dialogue with countries like bolivia as well .
in fact , it must conduct a dialogue precisely with such countries . the eu-latin america summit in vienna this week will reveal whether or not steinmeier was merely paying lip service to latin america .
politicians , however , should not just leave that agenda up to the economy and the interests of multi-national corporations . mirjam gehrke -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier concerned about bolivian nationalization plans during a trip to latin america , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has voiced concerns over plans to nationalize bolivia 's oil and gas industry by the country 's new president , evo morales .

he 's right , says dw 's mirjam gehrke . part of frank-walter steinmeier 's journey involved preparations for the european union-latin america summit to take place in vienna in mid-may .
yet it was the foreign minister 's comment that germany and the european union should focus its gaze more on latin american countries that must have been music to the ears of his partners in dialogue . latin america has been feeling neglected by europe for nearly two decades .
just as the era of military dictatorships was coming to a close at the end of the 1980s and the countries in the region were slowly starting to pave the way to democracy , the wall came down in berlin .
with the cold war over , europe - and germany , in particular - began focusing on the east . latin america back on the map now , it is high time to put latin america back on the agenda again .
while the united states has been concentrating its entire political and military attention on afghanistan , iraq and iran , over the past years a shift to the left has been occurring south of the rio grande .
the changes in each country must be viewed in differentiated fashion .
however , they all have a common denominator : the countries ' inhabitants are disappointed and angry about the consequences of the neo-liberal economic order that has hardly helped to overcome poverty in latin america .
quite the contrary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin america has set its sights on europe the united states ' policy on latin america has failed .
the best proof of that are the plans for the free trade area of the americas - ftaa - which have been put on hold .
us president george w. bush 's administration would have liked to have seen the plans to unite the economies of the americas into a single free-trade area go into effect back in 2005 . european union has been a beacon for mercosur now , the european union is enjoying its hour of glory : european integration is viewed by argentina and brazil as a model for mercosur .
this economic association , to which uruguay and paraguay also belong and to which venezuela will become a full member at the end of 2006 , could offer exciting impulses for the creation of a single south american market .
the european union even beats the united states as mercosur 's most important trading partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivian president evo morales threatened to evict foreign companies unless they gave bolivia control of gas production however , it is not only the economic cooperation that can and must be expanded .
criticism of decisions such as that of bolivian president evo morales ' decision to dispatch soldiers to the country 's oil and gas posts is certainly appropriate in political dialogue . yet a more differentiated view is also required here : those who make blanket statements about leftist populism in light of the nationalization of the bolivian gas reserves - rather than entering into a constructive critical dialogue - are ignoring the democratically articulated will of an entire people .
and just as important as fighting poverty in latin america is overcoming the political-institutional crisis and reinforcing democracy . latin america needs more than lip service countries like peru , ecuador , but also venezuela , are far from achieving what chile , brazil and argentina have already accomplished .
if europe wants to expand its trade relations with latin america , then it can not avoid conducting a constructive political dialogue with countries like bolivia as well .
in fact , it must conduct a dialogue precisely with such countries . the eu-latin america summit in vienna this week will reveal whether or not steinmeier was merely paying lip service to latin america .
politicians , however , should not just leave that agenda up to the economy and the interests of multi-national corporations . mirjam gehrke -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier concerned about bolivian nationalization plans during a trip to latin america , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has voiced concerns over plans to nationalize bolivia 's oil and gas industry by the country 's new president , evo morales .

he 's right , says dw 's mirjam gehrke . part of frank-walter steinmeier 's journey involved preparations for the european union-latin america summit to take place in vienna in mid-may .
yet it was the foreign minister 's comment that germany and the european union should focus its gaze more on latin american countries that must have been music to the ears of his partners in dialogue . latin america has been feeling neglected by europe for nearly two decades .
just as the era of military dictatorships was coming to a close at the end of the 1980s and the countries in the region were slowly starting to pave the way to democracy , the wall came down in berlin .
with the cold war over , europe - and germany , in particular - began focusing on the east . latin america back on the map now , it is high time to put latin america back on the agenda again .
while the united states has been concentrating its entire political and military attention on afghanistan , iraq and iran , over the past years a shift to the left has been occurring south of the rio grande .
the changes in each country must be viewed in differentiated fashion .
however , they all have a common denominator : the countries ' inhabitants are disappointed and angry about the consequences of the neo-liberal economic order that has hardly helped to overcome poverty in latin america .
quite the contrary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin america has set its sights on europe the united states ' policy on latin america has failed .
the best proof of that are the plans for the free trade area of the americas - ftaa - which have been put on hold .
us president george w. bush 's administration would have liked to have seen the plans to unite the economies of the americas into a single free-trade area go into effect back in 2005 . european union has been a beacon for mercosur now , the european union is enjoying its hour of glory : european integration is viewed by argentina and brazil as a model for mercosur .
this economic association , to which uruguay and paraguay also belong and to which venezuela will become a full member at the end of 2006 , could offer exciting impulses for the creation of a single south american market .
the european union even beats the united states as mercosur 's most important trading partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivian president evo morales threatened to evict foreign companies unless they gave bolivia control of gas production however , it is not only the economic cooperation that can and must be expanded .
criticism of decisions such as that of bolivian president evo morales ' decision to dispatch soldiers to the country 's oil and gas posts is certainly appropriate in political dialogue . yet a more differentiated view is also required here : those who make blanket statements about leftist populism in light of the nationalization of the bolivian gas reserves - rather than entering into a constructive critical dialogue - are ignoring the democratically articulated will of an entire people .
and just as important as fighting poverty in latin america is overcoming the political-institutional crisis and reinforcing democracy . latin america needs more than lip service countries like peru , ecuador , but also venezuela , are far from achieving what chile , brazil and argentina have already accomplished .
if europe wants to expand its trade relations with latin america , then it can not avoid conducting a constructive political dialogue with countries like bolivia as well .
in fact , it must conduct a dialogue precisely with such countries . the eu-latin america summit in vienna this week will reveal whether or not steinmeier was merely paying lip service to latin america .
politicians , however , should not just leave that agenda up to the economy and the interests of multi-national corporations . mirjam gehrke -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier concerned about bolivian nationalization plans during a trip to latin america , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has voiced concerns over plans to nationalize bolivia 's oil and gas industry by the country 's new president , evo morales .

even today , the response to the site is divided , acknowledged lea rosh , the activist who fought for years to establish a german memorial to european jews killed by the nazis . looking back at the year , salomon korn , a member of the memorial 's board of trustees , admitted the memorial was not to everyone 's liking .
but , he said , the number of visitors attested to the monument 's power . the memorial , not far from the brandenburg gate , consists of an open space covered with 2,700 gray cement columns of different heights , and an underground information center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizer lea rosh with architect peter eisenman uwe neumärker , who heads up the foundation that created the memorial - officially the foundation for the memorial to the murdered jews - acknowledges that the 3.5 million visitor number is just an estimate .
still , the underground information center had 490,000 registered visitors , making the site a " tourism magnet , " he said . respectful treatment despite fears of vandalism , the monument has been treated with respect , neumärker said .
and in the underground documentation center , which contains historical information on the genocide perpetrated by the nazis , the people are " well behaved and quiet , without us having to tell them , " he added . the monument was designed by us architect peter eisenman , at a total cost of 27 million euros -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- .
it opened with a ceremony on may 10 , 2005 , in the presence of 1,200 guests .
two days later , it was opened to the public .

" it is wonderful for us to see so many people going there , " she said .
and , she noted , visitors did not seem to have an attitude that the holocaust was something no longer important and best left in the past . little vandalism up to now , there have been five cases of swastikas being painted on the memorial 's pillars , and one star of david .
neumärker discounted the vandalism , calling it " basically , nothing . " during the creation of the monument , rosh set off an outcry when she said she planned to bury the tooth of a holocaust victim under one of the columns .
there was also a discussion over appropriate monument behavior , given the penchant of certain younger visitors to hop from pillar to pillar . a sausage stand at the monument 's edge -lrb- it is accessible from all sides , and open around the clock , seven days a week -rrb- also came under heavy fire .

sales in the first quarter totaled 2.459 billion euros , an increase of 47 percent . " we are clearly market leaders in the biggest markets , therefore it 's quite logical that we are the number one , " said adidas chief executive herbert hainer during a conference call with journalists . however , figures from nike at the end of march showed the us group remains ahead on a financial basis with net profit of $ 325.8 million , -lrb- about 256 million euros -rrb- , and sales of $ 3.3 billion for the period of december to february . the claim from adidas is a sign of an intensifying battle between the companies ahead of the soccer world cup 2006 , which begins in germany next month and which is vital for both brands .
adidas is an official sponsor of the competition and is to provide the official match ball as well as kit sponsorship for six of the leading national teams in the competition . on the basis of a surge in demand for world cup merchandise , hainer announced that adidas expected to sell football equipment valued at 1.2 billion euros this year , rather than the previously expected 1.0 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both adidas-salomon and nike expect big profits from the world cup " demand for this -lrb- official -rrb- ball and other world cup products is very big , " said hainer " we 've scored on all product categories . "
adidas enthusiastic about reebock commenting on results for the first-quarter , hainer also pointed to the integration during the period of us brand reebok , which was acquired by adidas in january for more than 3.0 billion euros . " the adidas group has got off to a powerful start in the first quarter 2006 , " said company chief executive herbert hainer .
" we have made important progress in successfully integrating reebok within the adidas group and are well positioned for the world cup , which is only a month away . " the group maintained its forecasts for 2006 of growth of at least 10 percent in sales and net profit .
in morning trading on the frankfurt stock exchange , shares in adidas gained 2.11 percent to 170.93 euros in a broadly weaker market .

sales in the first quarter totaled 2.459 billion euros , an increase of 47 percent . " we are clearly market leaders in the biggest markets , therefore it 's quite logical that we are the number one , " said adidas chief executive herbert hainer during a conference call with journalists . however , figures from nike at the end of march showed the us group remains ahead on a financial basis with net profit of $ 325.8 million , -lrb- about 256 million euros -rrb- , and sales of $ 3.3 billion for the period of december to february . the claim from adidas is a sign of an intensifying battle between the companies ahead of the soccer world cup 2006 , which begins in germany next month and which is vital for both brands .
adidas is an official sponsor of the competition and is to provide the official match ball as well as kit sponsorship for six of the leading national teams in the competition . on the basis of a surge in demand for world cup merchandise , hainer announced that adidas expected to sell football equipment valued at 1.2 billion euros this year , rather than the previously expected 1.0 billion euros .

" the adidas group has got off to a powerful start in the first quarter 2006 , " said company chief executive herbert hainer .
" we have made important progress in successfully integrating reebok within the adidas group and are well positioned for the world cup , which is only a month away . " the group maintained its forecasts for 2006 of growth of at least 10 percent in sales and net profit .
in morning trading on the frankfurt stock exchange , shares in adidas gained 2.11 percent to 170.93 euros in a broadly weaker market .

sales in the first quarter totaled 2.459 billion euros , an increase of 47 percent . " we are clearly market leaders in the biggest markets , therefore it 's quite logical that we are the number one , " said adidas chief executive herbert hainer during a conference call with journalists . however , figures from nike at the end of march showed the us group remains ahead on a financial basis with net profit of $ 325.8 million , -lrb- about 256 million euros -rrb- , and sales of $ 3.3 billion for the period of december to february . the claim from adidas is a sign of an intensifying battle between the companies ahead of the soccer world cup 2006 , which begins in germany next month and which is vital for both brands .
adidas is an official sponsor of the competition and is to provide the official match ball as well as kit sponsorship for six of the leading national teams in the competition . on the basis of a surge in demand for world cup merchandise , hainer announced that adidas expected to sell football equipment valued at 1.2 billion euros this year , rather than the previously expected 1.0 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both adidas-salomon and nike expect big profits from the world cup " demand for this -lrb- official -rrb- ball and other world cup products is very big , " said hainer " we 've scored on all product categories . "
adidas enthusiastic about reebock commenting on results for the first-quarter , hainer also pointed to the integration during the period of us brand reebok , which was acquired by adidas in january for more than 3.0 billion euros . " the adidas group has got off to a powerful start in the first quarter 2006 , " said company chief executive herbert hainer .
" we have made important progress in successfully integrating reebok within the adidas group and are well positioned for the world cup , which is only a month away . " the group maintained its forecasts for 2006 of growth of at least 10 percent in sales and net profit .
in morning trading on the frankfurt stock exchange , shares in adidas gained 2.11 percent to 170.93 euros in a broadly weaker market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.05.2006 opinion : german foreign minister rediscovers latin america großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier in chile : now is the time for the eu to focus on latin america german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has completed his first trip to south america and concluded that the continent deserves more attention from the eu .
he 's right , says dw 's mirjam gehrke . part of frank-walter steinmeier 's journey involved preparations for the european union-latin america summit to take place in vienna in mid-may .
yet it was the foreign minister 's comment that germany and the european union should focus its gaze more on latin american countries that must have been music to the ears of his partners in dialogue . latin america has been feeling neglected by europe for nearly two decades .
just as the era of military dictatorships was coming to a close at the end of the 1980s and the countries in the region were slowly starting to pave the way to democracy , the wall came down in berlin .
with the cold war over , europe - and germany , in particular - began focusing on the east . latin america back on the map now , it is high time to put latin america back on the agenda again .
while the united states has been concentrating its entire political and military attention on afghanistan , iraq and iran , over the past years a shift to the left has been occurring south of the rio grande .
the changes in each country must be viewed in differentiated fashion .
however , they all have a common denominator : the countries ' inhabitants are disappointed and angry about the consequences of the neo-liberal economic order that has hardly helped to overcome poverty in latin america .
quite the contrary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin america has set its sights on europe the united states ' policy on latin america has failed .
the best proof of that are the plans for the free trade area of the americas - ftaa - which have been put on hold .
us president george w. bush 's administration would have liked to have seen the plans to unite the economies of the americas into a single free-trade area go into effect back in 2005 . european union has been a beacon for mercosur now , the european union is enjoying its hour of glory : european integration is viewed by argentina and brazil as a model for mercosur .
this economic association , to which uruguay and paraguay also belong and to which venezuela will become a full member at the end of 2006 , could offer exciting impulses for the creation of a single south american market .
the european union even beats the united states as mercosur 's most important trading partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivian president evo morales threatened to evict foreign companies unless they gave bolivia control of gas production however , it is not only the economic cooperation that can and must be expanded .
criticism of decisions such as that of bolivian president evo morales ' decision to dispatch soldiers to the country 's oil and gas posts is certainly appropriate in political dialogue . yet a more differentiated view is also required here : those who make blanket statements about leftist populism in light of the nationalization of the bolivian gas reserves - rather than entering into a constructive critical dialogue - are ignoring the democratically articulated will of an entire people .
and just as important as fighting poverty in latin america is overcoming the political-institutional crisis and reinforcing democracy . latin america needs more than lip service countries like peru , ecuador , but also venezuela , are far from achieving what chile , brazil and argentina have already accomplished .
if europe wants to expand its trade relations with latin america , then it can not avoid conducting a constructive political dialogue with countries like bolivia as well .
in fact , it must conduct a dialogue precisely with such countries . the eu-latin america summit in vienna this week will reveal whether or not steinmeier was merely paying lip service to latin america .
politicians , however , should not just leave that agenda up to the economy and the interests of multi-national corporations . mirjam gehrke -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier concerned about bolivian nationalization plans during a trip to latin america , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has voiced concerns over plans to nationalize bolivia 's oil and gas industry by the country 's new president , evo morales .

he 's right , says dw 's mirjam gehrke . part of frank-walter steinmeier 's journey involved preparations for the european union-latin america summit to take place in vienna in mid-may .
yet it was the foreign minister 's comment that germany and the european union should focus its gaze more on latin american countries that must have been music to the ears of his partners in dialogue . latin america has been feeling neglected by europe for nearly two decades .
just as the era of military dictatorships was coming to a close at the end of the 1980s and the countries in the region were slowly starting to pave the way to democracy , the wall came down in berlin .
with the cold war over , europe - and germany , in particular - began focusing on the east . latin america back on the map now , it is high time to put latin america back on the agenda again .
while the united states has been concentrating its entire political and military attention on afghanistan , iraq and iran , over the past years a shift to the left has been occurring south of the rio grande .
the changes in each country must be viewed in differentiated fashion .
however , they all have a common denominator : the countries ' inhabitants are disappointed and angry about the consequences of the neo-liberal economic order that has hardly helped to overcome poverty in latin america .
quite the contrary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin america has set its sights on europe the united states ' policy on latin america has failed .
the best proof of that are the plans for the free trade area of the americas - ftaa - which have been put on hold .
us president george w. bush 's administration would have liked to have seen the plans to unite the economies of the americas into a single free-trade area go into effect back in 2005 . european union has been a beacon for mercosur now , the european union is enjoying its hour of glory : european integration is viewed by argentina and brazil as a model for mercosur .
this economic association , to which uruguay and paraguay also belong and to which venezuela will become a full member at the end of 2006 , could offer exciting impulses for the creation of a single south american market .
the european union even beats the united states as mercosur 's most important trading partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivian president evo morales threatened to evict foreign companies unless they gave bolivia control of gas production however , it is not only the economic cooperation that can and must be expanded .
criticism of decisions such as that of bolivian president evo morales ' decision to dispatch soldiers to the country 's oil and gas posts is certainly appropriate in political dialogue . yet a more differentiated view is also required here : those who make blanket statements about leftist populism in light of the nationalization of the bolivian gas reserves - rather than entering into a constructive critical dialogue - are ignoring the democratically articulated will of an entire people .
and just as important as fighting poverty in latin america is overcoming the political-institutional crisis and reinforcing democracy . latin america needs more than lip service countries like peru , ecuador , but also venezuela , are far from achieving what chile , brazil and argentina have already accomplished .
if europe wants to expand its trade relations with latin america , then it can not avoid conducting a constructive political dialogue with countries like bolivia as well .
in fact , it must conduct a dialogue precisely with such countries . the eu-latin america summit in vienna this week will reveal whether or not steinmeier was merely paying lip service to latin america .
politicians , however , should not just leave that agenda up to the economy and the interests of multi-national corporations . mirjam gehrke -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier concerned about bolivian nationalization plans during a trip to latin america , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has voiced concerns over plans to nationalize bolivia 's oil and gas industry by the country 's new president , evo morales .

meiwes was originally given a lighter sentence . meiwes , 44 , had told the court that his victim , an engineer from berlin , had a death wish and begged to be killed .
" he had wanted everything just the way it eventually happened , " the man known as the " cannibal of rotenburg " said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes ' crime was international news it was the second time meiwes was tried for killing bernd jürgen brandes in rotenburg in western germany in march 2001 .
he was originally convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to eight and a half years in prison in 2004 . judges says sentence too light but on appeal , a federal judge dismissed the sentence as too lenient and ordered a retrial on the higher charge of murder . meiwes , a computer technician , met brandes after advertising on the internet for a " slaughter victim " and invited him to his farm house .
the two men had sex before meiwes severed brandes ' penis , which they then fried and tried to eat .
he later stabbed his bleeding , unconscious victim in the throat and cut away other parts of his body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victim , bernd jürgen brandes meiwes admitted that he eventually ate some 20 kilograms -lrb- 44 pounds -rrb- of brandes ' flesh , accompanied by potatoes and a pepper or wine sauce , served on " good crockery . " his lawyers had argued that he was not guilty of murder but rather of the crime of " killing on demand " which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison . " the ultimate kick " but what has fascinated the media and the public was the testimony in which meiwes revealed his obsessions and lifted the lid on an underworld of cannibalism , which meiwes claims counts about 800 members in germany . meiwes has told the court he regretted killing brandes and has apologized to his victim 's boyfriend .
but he has remained unrepentant about eating his flesh , saying it was the " ultimate kick " both of them were seeking . psychologists have told the court meiwes was a mentally sane , if lonely , man who held down a steady job .
the accused has said that his cannibal fantasies began in his childhood , when his father abandoned his family , and he dreamt of eating one of his school friends so that somebody would stay with him forever . he has also said that from his prison cell he still fantasized about killing people when he saw attractive young bodies on television or in magazines .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i think germany should remain leery of bush 's overtures toward germany and chancellor merkel .
he and his administration still have the " you 're with us or against us " mentality .
i think one need only to look at current domestic policy in the us to confirm the continuation of the black or white policy .
beware of the snake charmer .
thomas jones , los angeles , usa bush wants to win any country which is not firm in its foreign policy and make it do his .
for the last years germany aroused respect and it will be a pity if it kneels before the us . - cheludmila454 chancellor merkel absolutely deserves the credit for the vastly improved relationship between germany and the us .
she gets total respect from george bush and here is why .
she is consistent : she does n't say one thing now and another thing later , or to a different audience .
she is good-tempered and does n't show anger when being firm .
instead she is level and steady and does n't try to be showy .
she knows how to disagree without being disagreeable - and she does disagree , and she does hold firm and get her way .
but she makes bush feel ok about it .
bush acts like he 's got more sense when he 's around her .
i think this lady really has good sense and a wonderful personality for her position , and is the best thing to happen to foreign policy dynamics in a long time . - wiley horne , usa americans were going to be happy with anyone other than schröder .
people outside the united states , must understand that america and her citizens do not regret iraq .
it was a reaction to a decade-plus of hostilities from the arab world .
it may have nothing to do with sept.11 , however it allowed us to remove a long standing enemy .
americans are realizing that europe is for itself and that only a few countries like israel and australia are her true allies .
americans are returning to isolation and the world is not prepared for it . - bryan hobbs the woman is too stupid to realize that she is being used by the usa .
her mind is as drab as her dress , and she is a menace to germany 's relations with the middle east .
the woman fails to realize the implications of the gas pipeline being directly laid across the baltic to germany .
germany needs to keep clear of all middle east confrontations .
the future of germany , as the major power and leader in europe , lies in the east with trade , which will lead to the reduction of german unemployment and economic salvation as the industrial giant of europe . - kevin hendstock , australia compiled by dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : beware of the crocodile 's smile angela merkel received many plaudits during her recent visit to washington .
but the hospitality afforded her may be part of a ruse to lure germany into the us foreign policy fold , according to dw 's peter philipp .
-lrb- may 8 , 2006 -rrb- bush : germany plays decisive role in war on terror us president george w. bush has told a german paper that germany plays a decisive role in the war on terrorism and that chancellor angela merkel 's actions on the iranian nuclear issue had been key .
-lrb- may 7 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : merkel knows how to be friendly but firm germany 's chancellor has headed to the us for the second time in four months , proving that german-american ties are warmer than they 've been for years .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i think germany should remain leery of bush 's overtures toward germany and chancellor merkel .
he and his administration still have the " you 're with us or against us " mentality .
i think one need only to look at current domestic policy in the us to confirm the continuation of the black or white policy .
beware of the snake charmer .
thomas jones , los angeles , usa bush wants to win any country which is not firm in its foreign policy and make it do his .
for the last years germany aroused respect and it will be a pity if it kneels before the us . - cheludmila454 chancellor merkel absolutely deserves the credit for the vastly improved relationship between germany and the us .
she gets total respect from george bush and here is why .
she is consistent : she does n't say one thing now and another thing later , or to a different audience .
she is good-tempered and does n't show anger when being firm .
instead she is level and steady and does n't try to be showy .
she knows how to disagree without being disagreeable - and she does disagree , and she does hold firm and get her way .
but she makes bush feel ok about it .
bush acts like he 's got more sense when he 's around her .
i think this lady really has good sense and a wonderful personality for her position , and is the best thing to happen to foreign policy dynamics in a long time . - wiley horne , usa americans were going to be happy with anyone other than schröder .
people outside the united states , must understand that america and her citizens do not regret iraq .
it was a reaction to a decade-plus of hostilities from the arab world .
it may have nothing to do with sept.11 , however it allowed us to remove a long standing enemy .
americans are realizing that europe is for itself and that only a few countries like israel and australia are her true allies .
americans are returning to isolation and the world is not prepared for it . - bryan hobbs the woman is too stupid to realize that she is being used by the usa .
her mind is as drab as her dress , and she is a menace to germany 's relations with the middle east .
the woman fails to realize the implications of the gas pipeline being directly laid across the baltic to germany .
germany needs to keep clear of all middle east confrontations .
the future of germany , as the major power and leader in europe , lies in the east with trade , which will lead to the reduction of german unemployment and economic salvation as the industrial giant of europe . - kevin hendstock , australia compiled by dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : beware of the crocodile 's smile angela merkel received many plaudits during her recent visit to washington .
but the hospitality afforded her may be part of a ruse to lure germany into the us foreign policy fold , according to dw 's peter philipp .
-lrb- may 8 , 2006 -rrb- bush : germany plays decisive role in war on terror us president george w. bush has told a german paper that germany plays a decisive role in the war on terrorism and that chancellor angela merkel 's actions on the iranian nuclear issue had been key .
-lrb- may 7 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : merkel knows how to be friendly but firm germany 's chancellor has headed to the us for the second time in four months , proving that german-american ties are warmer than they 've been for years .
dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says all the credit goes to angela merkel .

adidas is an official sponsor of the competition and is to provide the official match ball as well as kit sponsorship for six of the leading national teams in the competition . on the basis of a surge in demand for world cup merchandise , hainer announced that adidas expected to sell football equipment valued at 1.2 billion euros this year , rather than the previously expected 1.0 billion euros .

adidas enthusiastic about reebock commenting on results for the first-quarter , hainer also pointed to the integration during the period of us brand reebok , which was acquired by adidas in january for more than 3.0 billion euros . " the adidas group has got off to a powerful start in the first quarter 2006 , " said company chief executive herbert hainer .
" we have made important progress in successfully integrating reebok within the adidas group and are well positioned for the world cup , which is only a month away . " the group maintained its forecasts for 2006 of growth of at least 10 percent in sales and net profit .
in morning trading on the frankfurt stock exchange , shares in adidas gained 2.11 percent to 170.93 euros in a broadly weaker market .

he 's right , says dw 's mirjam gehrke . part of frank-walter steinmeier 's journey involved preparations for the european union-latin america summit to take place in vienna in mid-may .
yet it was the foreign minister 's comment that germany and the european union should focus its gaze more on latin american countries that must have been music to the ears of his partners in dialogue . latin america has been feeling neglected by europe for nearly two decades .
just as the era of military dictatorships was coming to a close at the end of the 1980s and the countries in the region were slowly starting to pave the way to democracy , the wall came down in berlin .
with the cold war over , europe - and germany , in particular - began focusing on the east . latin america back on the map now , it is high time to put latin america back on the agenda again .
while the united states has been concentrating its entire political and military attention on afghanistan , iraq and iran , over the past years a shift to the left has been occurring south of the rio grande .
the changes in each country must be viewed in differentiated fashion .
however , they all have a common denominator : the countries ' inhabitants are disappointed and angry about the consequences of the neo-liberal economic order that has hardly helped to overcome poverty in latin america .
quite the contrary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin america has set its sights on europe the united states ' policy on latin america has failed .
the best proof of that are the plans for the free trade area of the americas - ftaa - which have been put on hold .
us president george w. bush 's administration would have liked to have seen the plans to unite the economies of the americas into a single free-trade area go into effect back in 2005 . european union has been a beacon for mercosur now , the european union is enjoying its hour of glory : european integration is viewed by argentina and brazil as a model for mercosur .
this economic association , to which uruguay and paraguay also belong and to which venezuela will become a full member at the end of 2006 , could offer exciting impulses for the creation of a single south american market .
the european union even beats the united states as mercosur 's most important trading partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivian president evo morales threatened to evict foreign companies unless they gave bolivia control of gas production however , it is not only the economic cooperation that can and must be expanded .
criticism of decisions such as that of bolivian president evo morales ' decision to dispatch soldiers to the country 's oil and gas posts is certainly appropriate in political dialogue . yet a more differentiated view is also required here : those who make blanket statements about leftist populism in light of the nationalization of the bolivian gas reserves - rather than entering into a constructive critical dialogue - are ignoring the democratically articulated will of an entire people .
and just as important as fighting poverty in latin america is overcoming the political-institutional crisis and reinforcing democracy . latin america needs more than lip service countries like peru , ecuador , but also venezuela , are far from achieving what chile , brazil and argentina have already accomplished .
if europe wants to expand its trade relations with latin america , then it can not avoid conducting a constructive political dialogue with countries like bolivia as well .
in fact , it must conduct a dialogue precisely with such countries . the eu-latin america summit in vienna this week will reveal whether or not steinmeier was merely paying lip service to latin america .
politicians , however , should not just leave that agenda up to the economy and the interests of multi-national corporations . mirjam gehrke -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier concerned about bolivian nationalization plans during a trip to latin america , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has voiced concerns over plans to nationalize bolivia 's oil and gas industry by the country 's new president , evo morales .

meiwes was originally given a lighter sentence . meiwes , 44 , had told the court that his victim , an engineer from berlin , had a death wish and begged to be killed .
" he had wanted everything just the way it eventually happened , " the man known as the " cannibal of rotenburg " said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes ' crime was international news it was the second time meiwes was tried for killing bernd jürgen brandes in rotenburg in western germany in march 2001 .
he was originally convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to eight and a half years in prison in 2004 . judges says sentence too light but on appeal , a federal judge dismissed the sentence as too lenient and ordered a retrial on the higher charge of murder . meiwes , a computer technician , met brandes after advertising on the internet for a " slaughter victim " and invited him to his farm house .
the two men had sex before meiwes severed brandes ' penis , which they then fried and tried to eat .
he later stabbed his bleeding , unconscious victim in the throat and cut away other parts of his body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victim , bernd jürgen brandes meiwes admitted that he eventually ate some 20 kilograms -lrb- 44 pounds -rrb- of brandes ' flesh , accompanied by potatoes and a pepper or wine sauce , served on " good crockery . " his lawyers had argued that he was not guilty of murder but rather of the crime of " killing on demand " which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison . " the ultimate kick " but what has fascinated the media and the public was the testimony in which meiwes revealed his obsessions and lifted the lid on an underworld of cannibalism , which meiwes claims counts about 800 members in germany . meiwes has told the court he regretted killing brandes and has apologized to his victim 's boyfriend .
but he has remained unrepentant about eating his flesh , saying it was the " ultimate kick " both of them were seeking . psychologists have told the court meiwes was a mentally sane , if lonely , man who held down a steady job .
the accused has said that his cannibal fantasies began in his childhood , when his father abandoned his family , and he dreamt of eating one of his school friends so that somebody would stay with him forever . he has also said that from his prison cell he still fantasized about killing people when he saw attractive young bodies on television or in magazines . " i find this extremely worrying , " state prosecutor annette von schmiedeberg told the court last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film he videotaped his meeting with brandes , in what prosecutors said was a bid to make sure he could watch it again later to satisfy his fantasies . the case inspired a us-made horror film titled " butterfly , a grimm love story , " but meiwes succeeded in blocking its release on the grounds that it infringed on his privacy . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannibal of rotenburg faces life sentence as retrial nears end a german state prosecutor on wednesday demanded a life sentence for self-confessed cannibal armin meiwes , saying he killed and ate a man to fulfill his sexual urges .

meiwes was originally given a lighter sentence . meiwes , 44 , had told the court that his victim , an engineer from berlin , had a death wish and begged to be killed .
" he had wanted everything just the way it eventually happened , " the man known as the " cannibal of rotenburg " said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes ' crime was international news it was the second time meiwes was tried for killing bernd jürgen brandes in rotenburg in western germany in march 2001 .
he was originally convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to eight and a half years in prison in 2004 . judges says sentence too light but on appeal , a federal judge dismissed the sentence as too lenient and ordered a retrial on the higher charge of murder . meiwes , a computer technician , met brandes after advertising on the internet for a " slaughter victim " and invited him to his farm house .
the two men had sex before meiwes severed brandes ' penis , which they then fried and tried to eat .
he later stabbed his bleeding , unconscious victim in the throat and cut away other parts of his body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victim , bernd jürgen brandes meiwes admitted that he eventually ate some 20 kilograms -lrb- 44 pounds -rrb- of brandes ' flesh , accompanied by potatoes and a pepper or wine sauce , served on " good crockery . " his lawyers had argued that he was not guilty of murder but rather of the crime of " killing on demand " which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison . " the ultimate kick " but what has fascinated the media and the public was the testimony in which meiwes revealed his obsessions and lifted the lid on an underworld of cannibalism , which meiwes claims counts about 800 members in germany . meiwes has told the court he regretted killing brandes and has apologized to his victim 's boyfriend .
but he has remained unrepentant about eating his flesh , saying it was the " ultimate kick " both of them were seeking . psychologists have told the court meiwes was a mentally sane , if lonely , man who held down a steady job .
the accused has said that his cannibal fantasies began in his childhood , when his father abandoned his family , and he dreamt of eating one of his school friends so that somebody would stay with him forever . he has also said that from his prison cell he still fantasized about killing people when he saw attractive young bodies on television or in magazines . " i find this extremely worrying , " state prosecutor annette von schmiedeberg told the court last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film he videotaped his meeting with brandes , in what prosecutors said was a bid to make sure he could watch it again later to satisfy his fantasies . the case inspired a us-made horror film titled " butterfly , a grimm love story , " but meiwes succeeded in blocking its release on the grounds that it infringed on his privacy . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannibal of rotenburg faces life sentence as retrial nears end a german state prosecutor on wednesday demanded a life sentence for self-confessed cannibal armin meiwes , saying he killed and ate a man to fulfill his sexual urges .

he 's right , says dw 's mirjam gehrke . part of frank-walter steinmeier 's journey involved preparations for the european union-latin america summit to take place in vienna in mid-may .
yet it was the foreign minister 's comment that germany and the european union should focus its gaze more on latin american countries that must have been music to the ears of his partners in dialogue . latin america has been feeling neglected by europe for nearly two decades .
just as the era of military dictatorships was coming to a close at the end of the 1980s and the countries in the region were slowly starting to pave the way to democracy , the wall came down in berlin .
with the cold war over , europe - and germany , in particular - began focusing on the east . latin america back on the map now , it is high time to put latin america back on the agenda again .
while the united states has been concentrating its entire political and military attention on afghanistan , iraq and iran , over the past years a shift to the left has been occurring south of the rio grande .
the changes in each country must be viewed in differentiated fashion .
however , they all have a common denominator : the countries ' inhabitants are disappointed and angry about the consequences of the neo-liberal economic order that has hardly helped to overcome poverty in latin america .
quite the contrary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin america has set its sights on europe the united states ' policy on latin america has failed .
the best proof of that are the plans for the free trade area of the americas - ftaa - which have been put on hold .
us president george w. bush 's administration would have liked to have seen the plans to unite the economies of the americas into a single free-trade area go into effect back in 2005 . european union has been a beacon for mercosur now , the european union is enjoying its hour of glory : european integration is viewed by argentina and brazil as a model for mercosur .
this economic association , to which uruguay and paraguay also belong and to which venezuela will become a full member at the end of 2006 , could offer exciting impulses for the creation of a single south american market .
the european union even beats the united states as mercosur 's most important trading partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivian president evo morales threatened to evict foreign companies unless they gave bolivia control of gas production however , it is not only the economic cooperation that can and must be expanded .
criticism of decisions such as that of bolivian president evo morales ' decision to dispatch soldiers to the country 's oil and gas posts is certainly appropriate in political dialogue . yet a more differentiated view is also required here : those who make blanket statements about leftist populism in light of the nationalization of the bolivian gas reserves - rather than entering into a constructive critical dialogue - are ignoring the democratically articulated will of an entire people .
and just as important as fighting poverty in latin america is overcoming the political-institutional crisis and reinforcing democracy . latin america needs more than lip service countries like peru , ecuador , but also venezuela , are far from achieving what chile , brazil and argentina have already accomplished .
if europe wants to expand its trade relations with latin america , then it can not avoid conducting a constructive political dialogue with countries like bolivia as well .
in fact , it must conduct a dialogue precisely with such countries . the eu-latin america summit in vienna this week will reveal whether or not steinmeier was merely paying lip service to latin america .
politicians , however , should not just leave that agenda up to the economy and the interests of multi-national corporations . mirjam gehrke -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier concerned about bolivian nationalization plans during a trip to latin america , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has voiced concerns over plans to nationalize bolivia 's oil and gas industry by the country 's new president , evo morales .

" there is not yet agreement on the tactics and what 's most pronounced is that there is no agreement yet that this should be a chapter seven resolution , " said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .

even today , the response to the site is divided , acknowledged lea rosh , the activist who fought for years to establish a german memorial to european jews killed by the nazis . looking back at the year , salomon korn , a member of the memorial 's board of trustees , admitted the memorial was not to everyone 's liking .
but , he said , the number of visitors attested to the monument 's power . the memorial , not far from the brandenburg gate , consists of an open space covered with 2,700 gray cement columns of different heights , and an underground information center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizer lea rosh with architect peter eisenman uwe neumärker , who heads up the foundation that created the memorial - officially the foundation for the memorial to the murdered jews - acknowledges that the 3.5 million visitor number is just an estimate .
still , the underground information center had 490,000 registered visitors , making the site a " tourism magnet , " he said . respectful treatment despite fears of vandalism , the monument has been treated with respect , neumärker said .

sales in the first quarter totaled 2.459 billion euros , an increase of 47 percent . " we are clearly market leaders in the biggest markets , therefore it 's quite logical that we are the number one , " said adidas chief executive herbert hainer during a conference call with journalists . however , figures from nike at the end of march showed the us group remains ahead on a financial basis with net profit of $ 325.8 million , -lrb- about 256 million euros -rrb- , and sales of $ 3.3 billion for the period of december to february . the claim from adidas is a sign of an intensifying battle between the companies ahead of the soccer world cup 2006 , which begins in germany next month and which is vital for both brands .
adidas is an official sponsor of the competition and is to provide the official match ball as well as kit sponsorship for six of the leading national teams in the competition . on the basis of a surge in demand for world cup merchandise , hainer announced that adidas expected to sell football equipment valued at 1.2 billion euros this year , rather than the previously expected 1.0 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both adidas-salomon and nike expect big profits from the world cup " demand for this -lrb- official -rrb- ball and other world cup products is very big , " said hainer " we 've scored on all product categories . "
adidas enthusiastic about reebock commenting on results for the first-quarter , hainer also pointed to the integration during the period of us brand reebok , which was acquired by adidas in january for more than 3.0 billion euros . " the adidas group has got off to a powerful start in the first quarter 2006 , " said company chief executive herbert hainer .
" we have made important progress in successfully integrating reebok within the adidas group and are well positioned for the world cup , which is only a month away . " the group maintained its forecasts for 2006 of growth of at least 10 percent in sales and net profit .
in morning trading on the frankfurt stock exchange , shares in adidas gained 2.11 percent to 170.93 euros in a broadly weaker market .

" he had wanted everything just the way it eventually happened , " the man known as the " cannibal of rotenburg " said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes ' crime was international news it was the second time meiwes was tried for killing bernd jürgen brandes in rotenburg in western germany in march 2001 .
he was originally convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to eight and a half years in prison in 2004 . judges says sentence too light but on appeal , a federal judge dismissed the sentence as too lenient and ordered a retrial on the higher charge of murder . meiwes , a computer technician , met brandes after advertising on the internet for a " slaughter victim " and invited him to his farm house .
the two men had sex before meiwes severed brandes ' penis , which they then fried and tried to eat .
he later stabbed his bleeding , unconscious victim in the throat and cut away other parts of his body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victim , bernd jürgen brandes meiwes admitted that he eventually ate some 20 kilograms -lrb- 44 pounds -rrb- of brandes ' flesh , accompanied by potatoes and a pepper or wine sauce , served on " good crockery . " his lawyers had argued that he was not guilty of murder but rather of the crime of " killing on demand " which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison . " the ultimate kick " but what has fascinated the media and the public was the testimony in which meiwes revealed his obsessions and lifted the lid on an underworld of cannibalism , which meiwes claims counts about 800 members in germany . meiwes has told the court he regretted killing brandes and has apologized to his victim 's boyfriend .
but he has remained unrepentant about eating his flesh , saying it was the " ultimate kick " both of them were seeking . psychologists have told the court meiwes was a mentally sane , if lonely , man who held down a steady job .
the accused has said that his cannibal fantasies began in his childhood , when his father abandoned his family , and he dreamt of eating one of his school friends so that somebody would stay with him forever . he has also said that from his prison cell he still fantasized about killing people when he saw attractive young bodies on television or in magazines . " i find this extremely worrying , " state prosecutor annette von schmiedeberg told the court last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film he videotaped his meeting with brandes , in what prosecutors said was a bid to make sure he could watch it again later to satisfy his fantasies . the case inspired a us-made horror film titled " butterfly , a grimm love story , " but meiwes succeeded in blocking its release on the grounds that it infringed on his privacy . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannibal of rotenburg faces life sentence as retrial nears end a german state prosecutor on wednesday demanded a life sentence for self-confessed cannibal armin meiwes , saying he killed and ate a man to fulfill his sexual urges .

even today , the response to the site is divided , acknowledged lea rosh , the activist who fought for years to establish a german memorial to european jews killed by the nazis . looking back at the year , salomon korn , a member of the memorial 's board of trustees , admitted the memorial was not to everyone 's liking .
but , he said , the number of visitors attested to the monument 's power . the memorial , not far from the brandenburg gate , consists of an open space covered with 2,700 gray cement columns of different heights , and an underground information center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizer lea rosh with architect peter eisenman uwe neumärker , who heads up the foundation that created the memorial - officially the foundation for the memorial to the murdered jews - acknowledges that the 3.5 million visitor number is just an estimate .

" it is wonderful for us to see so many people going there , " she said .
and , she noted , visitors did not seem to have an attitude that the holocaust was something no longer important and best left in the past . little vandalism up to now , there have been five cases of swastikas being painted on the memorial 's pillars , and one star of david .
neumärker discounted the vandalism , calling it " basically , nothing . " during the creation of the monument , rosh set off an outcry when she said she planned to bury the tooth of a holocaust victim under one of the columns .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's foreign intelligence agency in the spotlight germany ’ s foreign intelligence agency turns 50 german politicians to face grilling as bnd inquiry begins europe -pipe- 09.05.2006 cia affair becoming a sharper thorn in transatlantic relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain , germany and others are investigating " extraordinary rendition " flights european investigations into secret cia flights and interrogation centers go on as mounting evidence showing they existed on european soil continues to be a diplomatic headache . in a statement that generated little public interest on thursday , the us announced that it would brief european officials about secret intelligence activities such as rendition flights allegedly carried out on european soil . but within diplomatic circles , the statement by us attorney general alberto gonzales pledging to brief a european parliament delegation to washington this week on clandestine intelligence activities caused a stir . " it signals that the us is feeling pressure over an issue they thought would die down and has n't , " said one german diplomat familiar with the issue . european officials pushing harder european leaders were initially slow to react to allegations of secret flights carrying suspected terrorists landing on their soil after reports of them first leaked in november .
experts say that is because european governments were more informed than they wanted to admit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giovanni claudio fava says the flights were not " tourist " flights but since eu commission officials first downplayed the issue late last year , the council of europe , a human rights watchdog , has continued to investigate .
at the same time , countries such as germany and italy are probing the issue - the bundestag will hold more hearings this week to find out what german officials knew .
most officials say it is unlikely that european governments were kept in the dark . meanwhile , an eu parliamentary committee issued a report last month saying that the cia carried out as many as 1,000 secret flights in the past five years , transporting suspected terrorists to third countries .
and parliamentarians took eu foreign policy chief javier solana to task for failing to probe the issue more aggressively during a parliamentary inquiry last week where he condemned such activities but said he did not have the jurisdiction to demand answers . " i have no information whatsoever that tells me with certainty that any of the accusations , allegations , rumors , etcetera that have taken place in the last year 's time are true , " he told parliamentarians . deputies shook their heads at such evasive responses . " i regret profoundly you say that you do n't intend to take any leadership role here , " one deputy responded .
" you are in a way washing your hands of responsibility . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german khalid al-masri told eu deputies of his alleged abduction by the cia the european parliament is an elected body and is considered more representative of european public opinion than other eu institutions .
and since the public has kept this issue in the forefront , officials such as italian eu parliament member giovanni claudio fava , a member of the special inquiry committee , said the eu parliament will continue to push hard for answers .
already , they have heard testimony from people such as kuwaiti-born german citizen khalid al-masri , who said he was detained by foreign agents in macedonia on dec .
31 , 2003 , while on holiday , flown to afghanistan and tortured . " our job is to find out the truth , and if the truth is that there have been illegal cia flights on our territory we ca n't remain silent , " he told reporters .
" these were not tourist flights . " no longer a wall of silence at first , us officials said little about the issue .
but experts in transatlantic relations say that increased european pressure and fears of weakened intelligence cooperation is changing that . last week , gonzales said that " rendition is an activity that is practiced by the united states and other countries . " and john bellinger , advisor to us secretary of state condoleezza rice , flew to brussels to meet with eu and nato officials last week and admitted that there had been secret intelligence flights even as he dismissed the number .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's foreign intelligence agency in the spotlight germany ’ s foreign intelligence agency turns 50 german politicians to face grilling as bnd inquiry begins europe -pipe- 09.05.2006 cia affair becoming a sharper thorn in transatlantic relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain , germany and others are investigating " extraordinary rendition " flights european investigations into secret cia flights and interrogation centers go on as mounting evidence showing they existed on european soil continues to be a diplomatic headache . in a statement that generated little public interest on thursday , the us announced that it would brief european officials about secret intelligence activities such as rendition flights allegedly carried out on european soil . but within diplomatic circles , the statement by us attorney general alberto gonzales pledging to brief a european parliament delegation to washington this week on clandestine intelligence activities caused a stir . " it signals that the us is feeling pressure over an issue they thought would die down and has n't , " said one german diplomat familiar with the issue . european officials pushing harder european leaders were initially slow to react to allegations of secret flights carrying suspected terrorists landing on their soil after reports of them first leaked in november .
experts say that is because european governments were more informed than they wanted to admit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giovanni claudio fava says the flights were not " tourist " flights but since eu commission officials first downplayed the issue late last year , the council of europe , a human rights watchdog , has continued to investigate .
at the same time , countries such as germany and italy are probing the issue - the bundestag will hold more hearings this week to find out what german officials knew .
most officials say it is unlikely that european governments were kept in the dark . meanwhile , an eu parliamentary committee issued a report last month saying that the cia carried out as many as 1,000 secret flights in the past five years , transporting suspected terrorists to third countries .
and parliamentarians took eu foreign policy chief javier solana to task for failing to probe the issue more aggressively during a parliamentary inquiry last week where he condemned such activities but said he did not have the jurisdiction to demand answers . " i have no information whatsoever that tells me with certainty that any of the accusations , allegations , rumors , etcetera that have taken place in the last year 's time are true , " he told parliamentarians . deputies shook their heads at such evasive responses . " i regret profoundly you say that you do n't intend to take any leadership role here , " one deputy responded .
" you are in a way washing your hands of responsibility . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german khalid al-masri told eu deputies of his alleged abduction by the cia the european parliament is an elected body and is considered more representative of european public opinion than other eu institutions .
and since the public has kept this issue in the forefront , officials such as italian eu parliament member giovanni claudio fava , a member of the special inquiry committee , said the eu parliament will continue to push hard for answers .
already , they have heard testimony from people such as kuwaiti-born german citizen khalid al-masri , who said he was detained by foreign agents in macedonia on dec .
31 , 2003 , while on holiday , flown to afghanistan and tortured . " our job is to find out the truth , and if the truth is that there have been illegal cia flights on our territory we ca n't remain silent , " he told reporters .
" these were not tourist flights . " no longer a wall of silence at first , us officials said little about the issue .
but experts in transatlantic relations say that increased european pressure and fears of weakened intelligence cooperation is changing that . last week , gonzales said that " rendition is an activity that is practiced by the united states and other countries . " and john bellinger , advisor to us secretary of state condoleezza rice , flew to brussels to meet with eu and nato officials last week and admitted that there had been secret intelligence flights even as he dismissed the number .

he 's right , says dw 's mirjam gehrke . part of frank-walter steinmeier 's journey involved preparations for the european union-latin america summit to take place in vienna in mid-may .
yet it was the foreign minister 's comment that germany and the european union should focus its gaze more on latin american countries that must have been music to the ears of his partners in dialogue . latin america has been feeling neglected by europe for nearly two decades .
just as the era of military dictatorships was coming to a close at the end of the 1980s and the countries in the region were slowly starting to pave the way to democracy , the wall came down in berlin .
with the cold war over , europe - and germany , in particular - began focusing on the east . latin america back on the map now , it is high time to put latin america back on the agenda again .
while the united states has been concentrating its entire political and military attention on afghanistan , iraq and iran , over the past years a shift to the left has been occurring south of the rio grande .
the changes in each country must be viewed in differentiated fashion .
however , they all have a common denominator : the countries ' inhabitants are disappointed and angry about the consequences of the neo-liberal economic order that has hardly helped to overcome poverty in latin america .
quite the contrary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin america has set its sights on europe the united states ' policy on latin america has failed .
the best proof of that are the plans for the free trade area of the americas - ftaa - which have been put on hold .
us president george w. bush 's administration would have liked to have seen the plans to unite the economies of the americas into a single free-trade area go into effect back in 2005 . european union has been a beacon for mercosur now , the european union is enjoying its hour of glory : european integration is viewed by argentina and brazil as a model for mercosur .
this economic association , to which uruguay and paraguay also belong and to which venezuela will become a full member at the end of 2006 , could offer exciting impulses for the creation of a single south american market .
the european union even beats the united states as mercosur 's most important trading partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivian president evo morales threatened to evict foreign companies unless they gave bolivia control of gas production however , it is not only the economic cooperation that can and must be expanded .
criticism of decisions such as that of bolivian president evo morales ' decision to dispatch soldiers to the country 's oil and gas posts is certainly appropriate in political dialogue . yet a more differentiated view is also required here : those who make blanket statements about leftist populism in light of the nationalization of the bolivian gas reserves - rather than entering into a constructive critical dialogue - are ignoring the democratically articulated will of an entire people .
and just as important as fighting poverty in latin america is overcoming the political-institutional crisis and reinforcing democracy . latin america needs more than lip service countries like peru , ecuador , but also venezuela , are far from achieving what chile , brazil and argentina have already accomplished .
if europe wants to expand its trade relations with latin america , then it can not avoid conducting a constructive political dialogue with countries like bolivia as well .
in fact , it must conduct a dialogue precisely with such countries . the eu-latin america summit in vienna this week will reveal whether or not steinmeier was merely paying lip service to latin america .
politicians , however , should not just leave that agenda up to the economy and the interests of multi-national corporations . mirjam gehrke -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier concerned about bolivian nationalization plans during a trip to latin america , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has voiced concerns over plans to nationalize bolivia 's oil and gas industry by the country 's new president , evo morales .

" we need to make sure we do n't start something we can not stop and which could get out of control afterwards , " steinmeier said on tuesday in an interview with german public television station zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says there are unanswered questions when it comes to iran he said " five or six questions are still open " before a draft resolution could be concluded calling for iran to halt its uranium enrichment . zdf said steinmeier had estimated it could take two weeks before they resolved their differences , but did n't provide any details from the german foreign minister supporting that timeframe .
russia and china have resisted the draft resolution . " important and difficult meeting " earlier britain 's new foreign secretary margaret beckett , making her debut on the international scene , called the session an " important and difficult meeting . " " everyone believed iran must give up its nuclear enrichment program , " beckett told reporters .
" it 's the way to achieve that we have to agree -lrb- on -rrb- . " participants said the ministers , who met for two hours on monday without aides before going into dinner , agreed on the need to keep iran from using its civilian nuclear program to develop atomic bombs . but a senior us official reported no progress in melting russian and chinese resistance to american calls for tough action under chapter seven of the un charter , which would authorize sanctions or the use of force . " there is not yet agreement on the tactics and what 's most pronounced is that there is no agreement yet that this should be a chapter seven resolution , " said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
" based on tonight 's meeting , i would not expect a resolution to be voted on and adopted this week . " further talks needed russian news agencies quoted moscow 's top envoy , sergei lavrov , as calling for further negotiations , including more direct talks between major powers and iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister lavrov , left with condoleezza rice " there was general agreement on the need to create conditions for resuming direct negotiations on iran 's nuclear program , " interfax news agency quoted lavrov as telling russian reporters in new york . france 's chief diplomat philippe douste-blazy said the ministers discussed " incentives and dissuasive measures according to the iranian response " in the confrontation . among the incentives raised by the french minister were cooperation in civilian nuclear energy , increased commercial and technological ties and security guarantees that the united states has refused to provide . us secretary of sate condoleezza rice had earlier monday billed the talks as " a time for the international community to come together and say with very great clarity it 's time for iran to accede to the demands of the international community . " us unimpressed by ahmadinejad 's letter the ministers also discussed the letter made public monday from iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad offering to seek ways to ease tensions with the united states . us officials said the 18-page rambling letter was more a philosophical treatise than a political overture and did not change washington 's position in the nuclear dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us says ahmadinejad 's letter contains nothing new " there is nothing in this letter that in any way addresses any of the issues really that are on the table in the international community , " rice told the editorial board of the associated press news agency monday . " it is most assuredly not a proposal , " she said , according to a state department transcript .
" there is nothing in here that would suggest that we 're on any different course than we were before we got the letter .

" we need to make sure we do n't start something we can not stop and which could get out of control afterwards , " steinmeier said on tuesday in an interview with german public television station zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says there are unanswered questions when it comes to iran he said " five or six questions are still open " before a draft resolution could be concluded calling for iran to halt its uranium enrichment . zdf said steinmeier had estimated it could take two weeks before they resolved their differences , but did n't provide any details from the german foreign minister supporting that timeframe .

" there is not yet agreement on the tactics and what 's most pronounced is that there is no agreement yet that this should be a chapter seven resolution , " said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
" based on tonight 's meeting , i would not expect a resolution to be voted on and adopted this week .

he 's right , says dw 's mirjam gehrke . part of frank-walter steinmeier 's journey involved preparations for the european union-latin america summit to take place in vienna in mid-may .
yet it was the foreign minister 's comment that germany and the european union should focus its gaze more on latin american countries that must have been music to the ears of his partners in dialogue . latin america has been feeling neglected by europe for nearly two decades .
just as the era of military dictatorships was coming to a close at the end of the 1980s and the countries in the region were slowly starting to pave the way to democracy , the wall came down in berlin .
with the cold war over , europe - and germany , in particular - began focusing on the east . latin america back on the map now , it is high time to put latin america back on the agenda again .
while the united states has been concentrating its entire political and military attention on afghanistan , iraq and iran , over the past years a shift to the left has been occurring south of the rio grande .
the changes in each country must be viewed in differentiated fashion .
however , they all have a common denominator : the countries ' inhabitants are disappointed and angry about the consequences of the neo-liberal economic order that has hardly helped to overcome poverty in latin america .
quite the contrary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin america has set its sights on europe the united states ' policy on latin america has failed .
the best proof of that are the plans for the free trade area of the americas - ftaa - which have been put on hold .
us president george w. bush 's administration would have liked to have seen the plans to unite the economies of the americas into a single free-trade area go into effect back in 2005 . european union has been a beacon for mercosur now , the european union is enjoying its hour of glory : european integration is viewed by argentina and brazil as a model for mercosur .
this economic association , to which uruguay and paraguay also belong and to which venezuela will become a full member at the end of 2006 , could offer exciting impulses for the creation of a single south american market .
the european union even beats the united states as mercosur 's most important trading partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivian president evo morales threatened to evict foreign companies unless they gave bolivia control of gas production however , it is not only the economic cooperation that can and must be expanded .
criticism of decisions such as that of bolivian president evo morales ' decision to dispatch soldiers to the country 's oil and gas posts is certainly appropriate in political dialogue . yet a more differentiated view is also required here : those who make blanket statements about leftist populism in light of the nationalization of the bolivian gas reserves - rather than entering into a constructive critical dialogue - are ignoring the democratically articulated will of an entire people .
and just as important as fighting poverty in latin america is overcoming the political-institutional crisis and reinforcing democracy . latin america needs more than lip service countries like peru , ecuador , but also venezuela , are far from achieving what chile , brazil and argentina have already accomplished .
if europe wants to expand its trade relations with latin america , then it can not avoid conducting a constructive political dialogue with countries like bolivia as well .
in fact , it must conduct a dialogue precisely with such countries . the eu-latin america summit in vienna this week will reveal whether or not steinmeier was merely paying lip service to latin america .
politicians , however , should not just leave that agenda up to the economy and the interests of multi-national corporations . mirjam gehrke -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier concerned about bolivian nationalization plans during a trip to latin america , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has voiced concerns over plans to nationalize bolivia 's oil and gas industry by the country 's new president , evo morales .

sales in the first quarter totaled 2.459 billion euros , an increase of 47 percent . " we are clearly market leaders in the biggest markets , therefore it 's quite logical that we are the number one , " said adidas chief executive herbert hainer during a conference call with journalists . however , figures from nike at the end of march showed the us group remains ahead on a financial basis with net profit of $ 325.8 million , -lrb- about 256 million euros -rrb- , and sales of $ 3.3 billion for the period of december to february . the claim from adidas is a sign of an intensifying battle between the companies ahead of the soccer world cup 2006 , which begins in germany next month and which is vital for both brands .
adidas is an official sponsor of the competition and is to provide the official match ball as well as kit sponsorship for six of the leading national teams in the competition . on the basis of a surge in demand for world cup merchandise , hainer announced that adidas expected to sell football equipment valued at 1.2 billion euros this year , rather than the previously expected 1.0 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both adidas-salomon and nike expect big profits from the world cup " demand for this -lrb- official -rrb- ball and other world cup products is very big , " said hainer " we 've scored on all product categories . "
adidas enthusiastic about reebock commenting on results for the first-quarter , hainer also pointed to the integration during the period of us brand reebok , which was acquired by adidas in january for more than 3.0 billion euros . " the adidas group has got off to a powerful start in the first quarter 2006 , " said company chief executive herbert hainer .

sales in the first quarter totaled 2.459 billion euros , an increase of 47 percent . " we are clearly market leaders in the biggest markets , therefore it 's quite logical that we are the number one , " said adidas chief executive herbert hainer during a conference call with journalists . however , figures from nike at the end of march showed the us group remains ahead on a financial basis with net profit of $ 325.8 million , -lrb- about 256 million euros -rrb- , and sales of $ 3.3 billion for the period of december to february . the claim from adidas is a sign of an intensifying battle between the companies ahead of the soccer world cup 2006 , which begins in germany next month and which is vital for both brands .
adidas is an official sponsor of the competition and is to provide the official match ball as well as kit sponsorship for six of the leading national teams in the competition . on the basis of a surge in demand for world cup merchandise , hainer announced that adidas expected to sell football equipment valued at 1.2 billion euros this year , rather than the previously expected 1.0 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both adidas-salomon and nike expect big profits from the world cup " demand for this -lrb- official -rrb- ball and other world cup products is very big , " said hainer " we 've scored on all product categories . "
adidas enthusiastic about reebock commenting on results for the first-quarter , hainer also pointed to the integration during the period of us brand reebok , which was acquired by adidas in january for more than 3.0 billion euros . " the adidas group has got off to a powerful start in the first quarter 2006 , " said company chief executive herbert hainer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.05.2006 opinion : german foreign minister rediscovers latin america großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier in chile : now is the time for the eu to focus on latin america german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has completed his first trip to south america and concluded that the continent deserves more attention from the eu .
he 's right , says dw 's mirjam gehrke . part of frank-walter steinmeier 's journey involved preparations for the european union-latin america summit to take place in vienna in mid-may .
yet it was the foreign minister 's comment that germany and the european union should focus its gaze more on latin american countries that must have been music to the ears of his partners in dialogue . latin america has been feeling neglected by europe for nearly two decades .
just as the era of military dictatorships was coming to a close at the end of the 1980s and the countries in the region were slowly starting to pave the way to democracy , the wall came down in berlin .
with the cold war over , europe - and germany , in particular - began focusing on the east . latin america back on the map now , it is high time to put latin america back on the agenda again .
while the united states has been concentrating its entire political and military attention on afghanistan , iraq and iran , over the past years a shift to the left has been occurring south of the rio grande .
the changes in each country must be viewed in differentiated fashion .
however , they all have a common denominator : the countries ' inhabitants are disappointed and angry about the consequences of the neo-liberal economic order that has hardly helped to overcome poverty in latin america .
quite the contrary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin america has set its sights on europe the united states ' policy on latin america has failed .
the best proof of that are the plans for the free trade area of the americas - ftaa - which have been put on hold .
us president george w. bush 's administration would have liked to have seen the plans to unite the economies of the americas into a single free-trade area go into effect back in 2005 . european union has been a beacon for mercosur now , the european union is enjoying its hour of glory : european integration is viewed by argentina and brazil as a model for mercosur .
this economic association , to which uruguay and paraguay also belong and to which venezuela will become a full member at the end of 2006 , could offer exciting impulses for the creation of a single south american market .
the european union even beats the united states as mercosur 's most important trading partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivian president evo morales threatened to evict foreign companies unless they gave bolivia control of gas production however , it is not only the economic cooperation that can and must be expanded .
criticism of decisions such as that of bolivian president evo morales ' decision to dispatch soldiers to the country 's oil and gas posts is certainly appropriate in political dialogue . yet a more differentiated view is also required here : those who make blanket statements about leftist populism in light of the nationalization of the bolivian gas reserves - rather than entering into a constructive critical dialogue - are ignoring the democratically articulated will of an entire people .
and just as important as fighting poverty in latin america is overcoming the political-institutional crisis and reinforcing democracy . latin america needs more than lip service countries like peru , ecuador , but also venezuela , are far from achieving what chile , brazil and argentina have already accomplished .
if europe wants to expand its trade relations with latin america , then it can not avoid conducting a constructive political dialogue with countries like bolivia as well .
in fact , it must conduct a dialogue precisely with such countries . the eu-latin america summit in vienna this week will reveal whether or not steinmeier was merely paying lip service to latin america .
politicians , however , should not just leave that agenda up to the economy and the interests of multi-national corporations . mirjam gehrke -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier concerned about bolivian nationalization plans during a trip to latin america , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has voiced concerns over plans to nationalize bolivia 's oil and gas industry by the country 's new president , evo morales .

divers pulled him from his water-filled sphere after he began struggling two minutes short of his nine-minute goal .
blaine spent seven days under water in new york receiving food and air through tubes .
crowds of spectators and millions of tv viewers saw him rescued .
appearing shaken and weak , he thanked his supporters and left for hospital .
" this was a very difficult week but you all made it fly by with your strong spirit , your energy .
thank you so much everybody , " blaine told a cheering crowd in lincoln square .
the current world record for holding breath under water stands at eight minutes and 58 seconds .
blaine spent seven minutes and eight seconds holding his breath before being rescued .
he appeared to have freed himself from chains attached to his hands but was struggling to free his feet when the divers entered the tank and pulled him out .
before the record attempt , blaine spent a week in the tank , receiving medical treatment over the weekend .
blaine 's spokesman pat smith said his peeling skin and overall condition were worrying doctors .
' considerable concern ' " they 're worried about loss of dexterity , " mr smith said .
" there is considerable concern about both his hands and his muscle tone . "
in order to receive medical attention , blaine stuck his hand out of a hole at the top of a tank , allowing doctors to remove specially created gloves , apply lotion and put on new gloves .
murat gunel , blaine 's doctor , had advised against performing the escape .
before embarking on the stunt , the 33-year-old us showman shed 50lbs -lrb- 23kg -rrb- in body weight to improve the efficiency of the way his body uses oxygen .
prolonged submersion in water poses a number of hazards , including nerve damage , blackouts , sleep deprivation and skin problems .
blaine had said his skin was causing him pain " like constant pins and needles " after five days in the acrylic sphere .
a lack of adequate oxygen , especially after seven days underwater , also carries a risk of irreversible brain injury , according to medical experts .

the console will come in two versions starting at $ 499 in the us and 499 euros -lrb- £ 341 -rrb- in europe .
sony announced the prices on the eve of the e3 games expo in los angeles .
the ps3 is the successor to the best-selling playstation 2 and will compete with microsoft 's xbox 360 and nintendo 's wii .
the machines make up the next wave of video gaming .
the xbox 360 is already available , while the wii is due out later this year .
the three console makers are competing for the hearts and minds of gamers in an industry worth more than $ 25bn -lrb- £ 13bn -rrb- annually .
november date sony currently dominates in the home , having sold more than 100 million playstation 2s , so it has much riding on the new console .
it had originally planned to launch the system in the spring , but was forced to delay due to issues with its new blu-ray dvd drive .
" we are not about cutting corners to rush a product to market , " said the head of sony game unit in the us , kaz hirai , at the company 's pre-e3 news conference .
" the next generation does n't start until we say it does .
today the playstation 3 is real . "
gamers have been eagerly waiting to hear more about the system and its price in order to decide whether to wait for the ps3 or shell out on an xbox 360 now .
the ps3 sports a new processor called cell which promises significant computing prowess , online connectivity and high definition graphics .
have your say " i am still enjoying my xbox and the very cheap games now to be had " mark , uk send us your comments future of games : your questions japanese gamers will be the first to get their hands on the ps3 on 11 november .
the console will arrive in the us and europe on 17 november .
sony also revealed the price of the console , which comes in two models .
the system with a 20gb hard drive will cost $ 499 in the us , while a model with a 60gb drive will cost $ 599 .
european pricing is 499 and 599 euros respectively .
final pricing in the uk has not been set , but the top model would probably retail at about £ 425 , said ray macguire , of sony uk .
" it depends on the exchange rate between ourselves and the yen , and the exchange rate between ourselves and the euro as well .
sometimes it will go up , sometimes it will go down , " he told the bbc .
" we 'll have a look closer to the day .
if i can make some savings , then of course i 'd be well versed to do that because obviously i 'd sell more of them . "
motion sensitive the two models have very different specs .
as well as different hard drives , the cheaper machine will not have in-built wireless or an hdmi -lrb- high-definition multimedia interface -rrb- connector necessary for hooking the machine up to a high definition tv or monitor .
however , both systems will come with a new controller .
sony has abandoned last year 's boomerang-shaped prototype and reverted to a design similar to the current model for the playstation 2 .
one key difference is the inclusion of a motion sensor in the wireless bluetooth controller .
in a demonstration , a virtual duck was made to jump out of the water by moving the controller upwards .
sony is following in the footsteps of nintendo , which has opted for a one-handed motion sensitive controller for its wii console .
in order to satisfy gamers wanting a ps3 for christmas , sony said it planned to have two million units available at launch worldwide , with a further two million by the end of the year .
when microsoft launched its xbox 360 last november , many gamers were left frustrated by supply shortages .
the software giant has since ramped up production and has sold more than three million units , giving it a valuable head start .
sony will also face competition from nintendo 's new machine , expected out later this year .
in the game the exact list of games available for the ps3 at launch is still unclear .
at its e3 news conference , sony showed off playable demos of a number of titles .
these included a ninja fighting title called heavenly sword , an intense first-person shooter called resistance : fall of man and an interactive monster card game called eye of judgement .
game enthusiasts will get a chance to try out the games on the show floor once e3 opens its doors on wednesday .
the expo is the annual showcase for the games industry , with more than 400 companies from 90 countries taking part .

they say pressure is greater than ever for housing and tourism developments .
gower became an aonb on 9 may 1956 in response to plans for a holiday camp .
there are now 40 in wales and england .
the gower society is a voluntary body with over 1,300 members from the uk and beyond .
one of its primary functions is to act as a watchdog on planning issues and spokesman randolph jenkins said the anniversary was a good time to assess the future .
" there 's a lot of pressure on the area from people who want to come and live here and pressure for commercial development because there are so many visitors who come here , " he said . "
i think we should be thinking of more of a statutory framework like we have in the national parks " randolph jenkins , gower society iconic views face up to challenge " i think we should be thinking of more of a statutory framework like we have in the national parks which control development far more closely .
" i do n't think it -lrb- aonb status -rrb- has kept up to date with the pressure since its inception 50 years ago . "
around 10 % of the land on the peninsula , including 26 miles of coastline , is owned by the national trust .
the trust 's director in wales , iwan hughes , had some sympathy with mr jenkins .
he said : " having aonb status means it 's on a par with national parks in a planning point of view but obviously not as well resourced as park authorities .
" there is an issue there that we depend upon the goodwill of the local authority .
" i do n't think the question of national park status is on the agenda but it deserves similar protection . "
' honed and refined ' swansea council is developing a new management plan for gower , and last year it faced calls from some farmers and tourism operators to have planning restrictions eased .
elfed roberts of the authority 's planning department said it had clear planning policies but these may be refined .
" the aonb was first established , i believe , as a response to pressure for a holiday camp , " he explained .
" they successfully got the gower designated as an aonb and the holiday camp never took place .
" since then there has been a realisation that all sorts of other types of developments could impact - new housing and tourist sites and so on .
" i think there has been a gradual process where by an interpretation of what is acceptable on the aonb has been honed and refined .
" a new management plan is forthcoming in the immediate future .
he said he hoped the swansea plan would reinforce policies about the aonb , including planning guidance on what good design on gower means .
