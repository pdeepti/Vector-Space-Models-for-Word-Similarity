in germany , schools often teach german at the cost of immigrants ' native languages .
politicians and linguists have differing views on the role native language instruction should play in education . it 's a given that immigrant children in germany who master the german language have a better chance to succeed in school and in the workplace . while everyone recognizes the importance of teaching immigrant students german , there is little agreement on what to do about their native languages .
there 's a lively ongoing debate in germany about how to best integrate non-native speakers . in some regions of the country , the emphasis on integration has meant cutting back on native-language instruction .
that 's a mistake , said ruprecht baur , a professor for german as a second language at the university of duisburg-essen . bilingualism is not the reason turkish or italian students fail in german schools , experts say .
in fact , speaking multiple languages remains the norm in most parts of the world , baur said . " we know from international research that the native language is not a disruptive factor , " baur said .

many well-educated women find it difficult in germany to balance work and family , and many are choosing to climb the career ladder instead of changing diapers . speaking to the dpa news agency , family affairs minister ursula von der leyen , said germany has one of the world 's longest and sharpest decline in the birth rate .
the fall in the number of children born could have serious consequences for the nation 's health and pension systems as well as its economy . analysts predict that germany 's current population of 82 million could drop to 50 million by 2050 . " i would be extremely pleased , if -lrb- the parental benefit -rrb- succeeded in stopping this dramatic decrease , " she said . the decrease has been apparent for several decades now , but was not seriously addressed by previous governments , in part because of the country 's nazi past .
hitler 's regime encouraged large families in order to propagate what it called the " master race . "
consequently , during much of the post-war era population studies were considered almost taboo in germany . how it works under the new child benefit plan which goes into effect on jan .
1 , parents - either the mother or father - would be entitled to 67 per cent of their previous income , up to a maximum of 1,800 euros a month -lrb- $ 2,363 -rrb- while staying at home for up to 14 months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family affairs minister ursula von der leyen von der leyen , who has seven children , said the new parental benefit represented the " first , but , key component " in helping germany to address the aging of its population . but she conceded that it will take some time " before people have the confidence to bring more children into the world again . " the plan has not been without controversy , mostly due to a provision that requires fathers take two months off work in order get the maximum period of benefits .
some conservative members , mostly men in van der leyen 's own party , the christian democratic union , said the government should not be telling parents how to raise their children . putting it off ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new plan asks dad to get more involved since the new benefits only apply to parents with babies born after dec .
31 , there have been concerns by members of the medical profession that women will try to wait until midnight on that day to give birth . " we warn against any intervention in the natural birth process , " said christian albring , the president of germany 's gynecologists ' federation . he said that medication which stops early contractions should only be given for sound medical reasons and not for financial gain . eu problem birth rates in many countries in the eu are low and the bloc has urged its member states to tackle the challenges of a shrinking workforce and an ageing population , especially by making it easier to meet the demands of both work and family . european governments must set up more flexible working patterns , said eu employment commissioner vladimir spidla earlier this year .
such programs should include cuts in working hours for young parents which would be made up for at a later stage in their lives and even compulsory paternity leave . the average number of children per woman across the eu is at 1.5 , but 2.1 are needed to replace a previous generation . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german population plunge expected germany 's population will drop by as much as 12 million by 2050 due to low birth rates , according to an official forecast released tuesday .

many well-educated women find it difficult in germany to balance work and family , and many are choosing to climb the career ladder instead of changing diapers . speaking to the dpa news agency , family affairs minister ursula von der leyen , said germany has one of the world 's longest and sharpest decline in the birth rate .
the fall in the number of children born could have serious consequences for the nation 's health and pension systems as well as its economy . analysts predict that germany 's current population of 82 million could drop to 50 million by 2050 . " i would be extremely pleased , if -lrb- the parental benefit -rrb- succeeded in stopping this dramatic decrease , " she said . the decrease has been apparent for several decades now , but was not seriously addressed by previous governments , in part because of the country 's nazi past .
hitler 's regime encouraged large families in order to propagate what it called the " master race . "
consequently , during much of the post-war era population studies were considered almost taboo in germany . how it works under the new child benefit plan which goes into effect on jan .
1 , parents - either the mother or father - would be entitled to 67 per cent of their previous income , up to a maximum of 1,800 euros a month -lrb- $ 2,363 -rrb- while staying at home for up to 14 months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family affairs minister ursula von der leyen von der leyen , who has seven children , said the new parental benefit represented the " first , but , key component " in helping germany to address the aging of its population . but she conceded that it will take some time " before people have the confidence to bring more children into the world again . " the plan has not been without controversy , mostly due to a provision that requires fathers take two months off work in order get the maximum period of benefits .
some conservative members , mostly men in van der leyen 's own party , the christian democratic union , said the government should not be telling parents how to raise their children . putting it off ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new plan asks dad to get more involved since the new benefits only apply to parents with babies born after dec .
31 , there have been concerns by members of the medical profession that women will try to wait until midnight on that day to give birth .

" our immediate response to the un security council is that , as of today , we will start the activities at the site of the 3,000 centrifuge machines in natanz and we will go ahead with full speed , " larijani said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani " we have said repeatedly that if the west wanted to exploit the un security council it will not only have no influence but make us more determined to pursue our nuclear goals even faster , " he told the hardline kayhan daily . president mahmoud ahmadinejad , in a speech in tehran , dismissed the un resolution as just a " scrap of paper " and said the west would have to learn to live with iran possessing nuclear technology . " whether the west likes it or not , iran is a nuclear country and it is in their interests to live alongside iran , " he said according to the semi-official fars agency . installing 3,000 centrifuges would mark an important step for iran towards an industrial scale enrichment of uranium , a process the west wants the islamic republic to suspend as it can be used to make both fuel and nuclear bombs . so far , iran has two cascades of 164 centrifuges at the plant in natanz in central iran which it has used to enrich uranium on a research scale to levels high enough to make nuclear fuel . iran has maintained that it wants to have the 3,000 new centrifuges installed by march and ahmadinejad has said the islamic republic will be able to celebrate its " nuclearization " around that time . " appropriate measures " after weeks of diplomatic wrangling , the un security council on saturday adopted a resolution which imposes restrictions on iran 's nuclear industry and ballistic missile program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad says iran can celebrate its " nuclearization " around march the united states accuses iran of seeking to develop a nuclear weapon , charges vehemently denied by the islamic republic which says it only wants to provide energy to a growing population . the resolution warned that if tehran refuses to comply with un demands to freeze enrichment , the council " shall adopt further appropriate measures under article 41 of chapter seven " of the un charter , a reference to non-military sanctions . russia 's un ambassador vitaly churkin , who worked hard in weeks of diplomatic horse-trading to soften the resolution , expressed hope that iran " will respond constructively . " us under secretary of state for political affairs nicholas burns however pledged to wrench up the pressure on iran beyond the resolution . " we do n't think this resolution is enough in itself .
we want the international community to take further action ...
we would like to see countries stop doing business as usual with iran , " the us diplomat said . france warns against isolation france on sunday warned iran it risked " total isolation " over its defiant decision to expand uranium enrichment in the wake of the imposition of un sanctions . " i ca n't think for an instant that all the iranian authorities have decided on total isolation of their country .
i think that , to the contrary , it would be in their interest to turn towards negotiation , " foreign minister philippe douste-blazy told france inter radio . he noted that the un security council had acted " in a united manner " to pass its resolution saturday . work with iaea to stop ? meanwhile , foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini warned that iran 's cooperation with the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog could be reduced after the resolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei at a ceremony in tehran on sunday " the resolution is contrary to legal principles .
therefore , it should not be expected that we will continue our work with the international atomic energy agency at the same level , " he said . " as the time passes will inform people about our decisions and it will be based on our national interest . " hosseini did not specify what cooperation could be cut , but some iranian lawmakers have already warned that tehran could limit un inspections of its nuclear sites after the resolution . the iranian parliament agreed to urgently vote on a bill that would oblige the government to " revise " its cooperation with the un nuclear watchdog . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un slaps nuclear-related sanctions on iran the security council on saturday slapped the first ever un sanctions on iran , targeting its nuclear and ballistic missile programs in response to its refusal to halt sensitive nuclear fuel work .

" the plan has not been without controversy , mostly due to a provision that requires fathers take two months off work in order get the maximum period of benefits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 24.12.2006 controversy persists over immigrant language instruction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should immigrant students be encouraged to study their native language ?
in germany , schools often teach german at the cost of immigrants ' native languages .
politicians and linguists have differing views on the role native language instruction should play in education . it 's a given that immigrant children in germany who master the german language have a better chance to succeed in school and in the workplace . while everyone recognizes the importance of teaching immigrant students german , there is little agreement on what to do about their native languages .
there 's a lively ongoing debate in germany about how to best integrate non-native speakers . in some regions of the country , the emphasis on integration has meant cutting back on native-language instruction .
that 's a mistake , said ruprecht baur , a professor for german as a second language at the university of duisburg-essen . bilingualism is not the reason turkish or italian students fail in german schools , experts say .
in fact , speaking multiple languages remains the norm in most parts of the world , baur said . " we know from international research that the native language is not a disruptive factor , " baur said .
" one can even say that the majority of the world 's population is multilingual .

many well-educated women find it difficult in germany to balance work and family , and many are choosing to climb the career ladder instead of changing diapers . speaking to the dpa news agency , family affairs minister ursula von der leyen , said germany has one of the world 's longest and sharpest decline in the birth rate .
the fall in the number of children born could have serious consequences for the nation 's health and pension systems as well as its economy . analysts predict that germany 's current population of 82 million could drop to 50 million by 2050 . " i would be extremely pleased , if -lrb- the parental benefit -rrb- succeeded in stopping this dramatic decrease , " she said . the decrease has been apparent for several decades now , but was not seriously addressed by previous governments , in part because of the country 's nazi past .
hitler 's regime encouraged large families in order to propagate what it called the " master race . "
consequently , during much of the post-war era population studies were considered almost taboo in germany . how it works under the new child benefit plan which goes into effect on jan .
1 , parents - either the mother or father - would be entitled to 67 per cent of their previous income , up to a maximum of 1,800 euros a month -lrb- $ 2,363 -rrb- while staying at home for up to 14 months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family affairs minister ursula von der leyen von der leyen , who has seven children , said the new parental benefit represented the " first , but , key component " in helping germany to address the aging of its population . but she conceded that it will take some time " before people have the confidence to bring more children into the world again . " the plan has not been without controversy , mostly due to a provision that requires fathers take two months off work in order get the maximum period of benefits .
some conservative members , mostly men in van der leyen 's own party , the christian democratic union , said the government should not be telling parents how to raise their children . putting it off ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new plan asks dad to get more involved since the new benefits only apply to parents with babies born after dec .
31 , there have been concerns by members of the medical profession that women will try to wait until midnight on that day to give birth . " we warn against any intervention in the natural birth process , " said christian albring , the president of germany 's gynecologists ' federation . he said that medication which stops early contractions should only be given for sound medical reasons and not for financial gain . eu problem birth rates in many countries in the eu are low and the bloc has urged its member states to tackle the challenges of a shrinking workforce and an ageing population , especially by making it easier to meet the demands of both work and family . european governments must set up more flexible working patterns , said eu employment commissioner vladimir spidla earlier this year .
such programs should include cuts in working hours for young parents which would be made up for at a later stage in their lives and even compulsory paternity leave . the average number of children per woman across the eu is at 1.5 , but 2.1 are needed to replace a previous generation . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german population plunge expected germany 's population will drop by as much as 12 million by 2050 due to low birth rates , according to an official forecast released tuesday .

in germany , schools often teach german at the cost of immigrants ' native languages .
politicians and linguists have differing views on the role native language instruction should play in education . it 's a given that immigrant children in germany who master the german language have a better chance to succeed in school and in the workplace . while everyone recognizes the importance of teaching immigrant students german , there is little agreement on what to do about their native languages .
there 's a lively ongoing debate in germany about how to best integrate non-native speakers . in some regions of the country , the emphasis on integration has meant cutting back on native-language instruction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 24.12.2006 controversy persists over immigrant language instruction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should immigrant students be encouraged to study their native language ?
in germany , schools often teach german at the cost of immigrants ' native languages .
politicians and linguists have differing views on the role native language instruction should play in education . it 's a given that immigrant children in germany who master the german language have a better chance to succeed in school and in the workplace . while everyone recognizes the importance of teaching immigrant students german , there is little agreement on what to do about their native languages .
there 's a lively ongoing debate in germany about how to best integrate non-native speakers . in some regions of the country , the emphasis on integration has meant cutting back on native-language instruction .
that 's a mistake , said ruprecht baur , a professor for german as a second language at the university of duisburg-essen . bilingualism is not the reason turkish or italian students fail in german schools , experts say .
in fact , speaking multiple languages remains the norm in most parts of the world , baur said . " we know from international research that the native language is not a disruptive factor , " baur said .
" one can even say that the majority of the world 's population is multilingual . " germany unsure about bilingualism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in many parts of the world , bilingualism is normal the european union has placed a high priority on promoting linguistic plurality . the eu guidelines require schools to provide immigrant children with instruction in their native languages . yet in germany in recent years , native language classes have been reduced or abolished in some regions .
vassilios fthenakis , a professor in developmental psychology and anthropology at the free university of bozen in italy criticizes the educational politics in germany . native language a treasure " this is a chronic problem for germany , that no one is seriously concerned with the meaning of the native language and the culture of the child , but instead in a policy of integration that does n't work , " fthenakis said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no agreement on how to best integrate foreign students a native greek speaker , fthenakis helped develop a draft educational plan for the german states of bavaria and hessen which views cultural and linguistic variety as an individual and collective treasure . the current german system disorients students .
it values english and french as foreign languages more highly than turkish or arabic , fthenakis said . unlike in sweden , england or france there 's no basis for a system which can keep immigrant students from becoming disoriented , fthenakis said . stamatis assimenios -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign students may find it harder to study in germany the german coalition government wants to tighten immigration laws with proponents saying tougher laws are necessary anti-terror measures , but others counter the new regulations could scare off qualified foreign students .
-lrb- 24.10.2006 -rrb- study reveals education gap in europe europe risks falling behind china and india because governments are doing " painfully little " to improve educational standards on which economic growth depends , said a new study released wednesday .

in germany , schools often teach german at the cost of immigrants ' native languages .
politicians and linguists have differing views on the role native language instruction should play in education . it 's a given that immigrant children in germany who master the german language have a better chance to succeed in school and in the workplace . while everyone recognizes the importance of teaching immigrant students german , there is little agreement on what to do about their native languages .
there 's a lively ongoing debate in germany about how to best integrate non-native speakers . in some regions of the country , the emphasis on integration has meant cutting back on native-language instruction .
that 's a mistake , said ruprecht baur , a professor for german as a second language at the university of duisburg-essen . bilingualism is not the reason turkish or italian students fail in german schools , experts say .
in fact , speaking multiple languages remains the norm in most parts of the world , baur said . " we know from international research that the native language is not a disruptive factor , " baur said .
" one can even say that the majority of the world 's population is multilingual . " germany unsure about bilingualism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in many parts of the world , bilingualism is normal the european union has placed a high priority on promoting linguistic plurality . the eu guidelines require schools to provide immigrant children with instruction in their native languages . yet in germany in recent years , native language classes have been reduced or abolished in some regions .
vassilios fthenakis , a professor in developmental psychology and anthropology at the free university of bozen in italy criticizes the educational politics in germany . native language a treasure " this is a chronic problem for germany , that no one is seriously concerned with the meaning of the native language and the culture of the child , but instead in a policy of integration that does n't work , " fthenakis said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no agreement on how to best integrate foreign students a native greek speaker , fthenakis helped develop a draft educational plan for the german states of bavaria and hessen which views cultural and linguistic variety as an individual and collective treasure . the current german system disorients students .
it values english and french as foreign languages more highly than turkish or arabic , fthenakis said . unlike in sweden , england or france there 's no basis for a system which can keep immigrant students from becoming disoriented , fthenakis said . stamatis assimenios -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign students may find it harder to study in germany the german coalition government wants to tighten immigration laws with proponents saying tougher laws are necessary anti-terror measures , but others counter the new regulations could scare off qualified foreign students .

" our immediate response to the un security council is that , as of today , we will start the activities at the site of the 3,000 centrifuge machines in natanz and we will go ahead with full speed , " larijani said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani " we have said repeatedly that if the west wanted to exploit the un security council it will not only have no influence but make us more determined to pursue our nuclear goals even faster , " he told the hardline kayhan daily . president mahmoud ahmadinejad , in a speech in tehran , dismissed the un resolution as just a " scrap of paper " and said the west would have to learn to live with iran possessing nuclear technology . " whether the west likes it or not , iran is a nuclear country and it is in their interests to live alongside iran , " he said according to the semi-official fars agency . installing 3,000 centrifuges would mark an important step for iran towards an industrial scale enrichment of uranium , a process the west wants the islamic republic to suspend as it can be used to make both fuel and nuclear bombs . so far , iran has two cascades of 164 centrifuges at the plant in natanz in central iran which it has used to enrich uranium on a research scale to levels high enough to make nuclear fuel . iran has maintained that it wants to have the 3,000 new centrifuges installed by march and ahmadinejad has said the islamic republic will be able to celebrate its " nuclearization " around that time . " appropriate measures " after weeks of diplomatic wrangling , the un security council on saturday adopted a resolution which imposes restrictions on iran 's nuclear industry and ballistic missile program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad says iran can celebrate its " nuclearization " around march the united states accuses iran of seeking to develop a nuclear weapon , charges vehemently denied by the islamic republic which says it only wants to provide energy to a growing population . the resolution warned that if tehran refuses to comply with un demands to freeze enrichment , the council " shall adopt further appropriate measures under article 41 of chapter seven " of the un charter , a reference to non-military sanctions . russia 's un ambassador vitaly churkin , who worked hard in weeks of diplomatic horse-trading to soften the resolution , expressed hope that iran " will respond constructively . " us under secretary of state for political affairs nicholas burns however pledged to wrench up the pressure on iran beyond the resolution . " we do n't think this resolution is enough in itself .
we want the international community to take further action ...
we would like to see countries stop doing business as usual with iran , " the us diplomat said . france warns against isolation france on sunday warned iran it risked " total isolation " over its defiant decision to expand uranium enrichment in the wake of the imposition of un sanctions . " i ca n't think for an instant that all the iranian authorities have decided on total isolation of their country .
i think that , to the contrary , it would be in their interest to turn towards negotiation , " foreign minister philippe douste-blazy told france inter radio . he noted that the un security council had acted " in a united manner " to pass its resolution saturday . work with iaea to stop ? meanwhile , foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini warned that iran 's cooperation with the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog could be reduced after the resolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei at a ceremony in tehran on sunday " the resolution is contrary to legal principles .
therefore , it should not be expected that we will continue our work with the international atomic energy agency at the same level , " he said . " as the time passes will inform people about our decisions and it will be based on our national interest . " hosseini did not specify what cooperation could be cut , but some iranian lawmakers have already warned that tehran could limit un inspections of its nuclear sites after the resolution . the iranian parliament agreed to urgently vote on a bill that would oblige the government to " revise " its cooperation with the un nuclear watchdog . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un slaps nuclear-related sanctions on iran the security council on saturday slapped the first ever un sanctions on iran , targeting its nuclear and ballistic missile programs in response to its refusal to halt sensitive nuclear fuel work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 24.12.2006 controversy persists over immigrant language instruction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should immigrant students be encouraged to study their native language ?
in germany , schools often teach german at the cost of immigrants ' native languages .
politicians and linguists have differing views on the role native language instruction should play in education . it 's a given that immigrant children in germany who master the german language have a better chance to succeed in school and in the workplace . while everyone recognizes the importance of teaching immigrant students german , there is little agreement on what to do about their native languages .
there 's a lively ongoing debate in germany about how to best integrate non-native speakers . in some regions of the country , the emphasis on integration has meant cutting back on native-language instruction .
that 's a mistake , said ruprecht baur , a professor for german as a second language at the university of duisburg-essen . bilingualism is not the reason turkish or italian students fail in german schools , experts say .
in fact , speaking multiple languages remains the norm in most parts of the world , baur said . " we know from international research that the native language is not a disruptive factor , " baur said .
" one can even say that the majority of the world 's population is multilingual . " germany unsure about bilingualism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in many parts of the world , bilingualism is normal the european union has placed a high priority on promoting linguistic plurality . the eu guidelines require schools to provide immigrant children with instruction in their native languages . yet in germany in recent years , native language classes have been reduced or abolished in some regions .
vassilios fthenakis , a professor in developmental psychology and anthropology at the free university of bozen in italy criticizes the educational politics in germany . native language a treasure " this is a chronic problem for germany , that no one is seriously concerned with the meaning of the native language and the culture of the child , but instead in a policy of integration that does n't work , " fthenakis said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no agreement on how to best integrate foreign students a native greek speaker , fthenakis helped develop a draft educational plan for the german states of bavaria and hessen which views cultural and linguistic variety as an individual and collective treasure . the current german system disorients students .
it values english and french as foreign languages more highly than turkish or arabic , fthenakis said . unlike in sweden , england or france there 's no basis for a system which can keep immigrant students from becoming disoriented , fthenakis said . stamatis assimenios -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign students may find it harder to study in germany the german coalition government wants to tighten immigration laws with proponents saying tougher laws are necessary anti-terror measures , but others counter the new regulations could scare off qualified foreign students .

many well-educated women find it difficult in germany to balance work and family , and many are choosing to climb the career ladder instead of changing diapers . speaking to the dpa news agency , family affairs minister ursula von der leyen , said germany has one of the world 's longest and sharpest decline in the birth rate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 24.12.2006 controversy persists over immigrant language instruction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should immigrant students be encouraged to study their native language ?
in germany , schools often teach german at the cost of immigrants ' native languages .

many well-educated women find it difficult in germany to balance work and family , and many are choosing to climb the career ladder instead of changing diapers . speaking to the dpa news agency , family affairs minister ursula von der leyen , said germany has one of the world 's longest and sharpest decline in the birth rate .
the fall in the number of children born could have serious consequences for the nation 's health and pension systems as well as its economy . analysts predict that germany 's current population of 82 million could drop to 50 million by 2050 . " i would be extremely pleased , if -lrb- the parental benefit -rrb- succeeded in stopping this dramatic decrease , " she said . the decrease has been apparent for several decades now , but was not seriously addressed by previous governments , in part because of the country 's nazi past .
hitler 's regime encouraged large families in order to propagate what it called the " master race . "
consequently , during much of the post-war era population studies were considered almost taboo in germany . how it works under the new child benefit plan which goes into effect on jan .
1 , parents - either the mother or father - would be entitled to 67 per cent of their previous income , up to a maximum of 1,800 euros a month -lrb- $ 2,363 -rrb- while staying at home for up to 14 months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family affairs minister ursula von der leyen von der leyen , who has seven children , said the new parental benefit represented the " first , but , key component " in helping germany to address the aging of its population . but she conceded that it will take some time " before people have the confidence to bring more children into the world again . " the plan has not been without controversy , mostly due to a provision that requires fathers take two months off work in order get the maximum period of benefits .
some conservative members , mostly men in van der leyen 's own party , the christian democratic union , said the government should not be telling parents how to raise their children . putting it off ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new plan asks dad to get more involved since the new benefits only apply to parents with babies born after dec .
31 , there have been concerns by members of the medical profession that women will try to wait until midnight on that day to give birth . " we warn against any intervention in the natural birth process , " said christian albring , the president of germany 's gynecologists ' federation . he said that medication which stops early contractions should only be given for sound medical reasons and not for financial gain . eu problem birth rates in many countries in the eu are low and the bloc has urged its member states to tackle the challenges of a shrinking workforce and an ageing population , especially by making it easier to meet the demands of both work and family . european governments must set up more flexible working patterns , said eu employment commissioner vladimir spidla earlier this year .
such programs should include cuts in working hours for young parents which would be made up for at a later stage in their lives and even compulsory paternity leave . the average number of children per woman across the eu is at 1.5 , but 2.1 are needed to replace a previous generation . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german population plunge expected germany 's population will drop by as much as 12 million by 2050 due to low birth rates , according to an official forecast released tuesday .

" our immediate response to the un security council is that , as of today , we will start the activities at the site of the 3,000 centrifuge machines in natanz and we will go ahead with full speed , " larijani said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani " we have said repeatedly that if the west wanted to exploit the un security council it will not only have no influence but make us more determined to pursue our nuclear goals even faster , " he told the hardline kayhan daily . president mahmoud ahmadinejad , in a speech in tehran , dismissed the un resolution as just a " scrap of paper " and said the west would have to learn to live with iran possessing nuclear technology . " whether the west likes it or not , iran is a nuclear country and it is in their interests to live alongside iran , " he said according to the semi-official fars agency . installing 3,000 centrifuges would mark an important step for iran towards an industrial scale enrichment of uranium , a process the west wants the islamic republic to suspend as it can be used to make both fuel and nuclear bombs . so far , iran has two cascades of 164 centrifuges at the plant in natanz in central iran which it has used to enrich uranium on a research scale to levels high enough to make nuclear fuel . iran has maintained that it wants to have the 3,000 new centrifuges installed by march and ahmadinejad has said the islamic republic will be able to celebrate its " nuclearization " around that time . " appropriate measures " after weeks of diplomatic wrangling , the un security council on saturday adopted a resolution which imposes restrictions on iran 's nuclear industry and ballistic missile program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad says iran can celebrate its " nuclearization " around march the united states accuses iran of seeking to develop a nuclear weapon , charges vehemently denied by the islamic republic which says it only wants to provide energy to a growing population . the resolution warned that if tehran refuses to comply with un demands to freeze enrichment , the council " shall adopt further appropriate measures under article 41 of chapter seven " of the un charter , a reference to non-military sanctions . russia 's un ambassador vitaly churkin , who worked hard in weeks of diplomatic horse-trading to soften the resolution , expressed hope that iran " will respond constructively . " us under secretary of state for political affairs nicholas burns however pledged to wrench up the pressure on iran beyond the resolution . " we do n't think this resolution is enough in itself .

" our immediate response to the un security council is that , as of today , we will start the activities at the site of the 3,000 centrifuge machines in natanz and we will go ahead with full speed , " larijani said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani " we have said repeatedly that if the west wanted to exploit the un security council it will not only have no influence but make us more determined to pursue our nuclear goals even faster , " he told the hardline kayhan daily . president mahmoud ahmadinejad , in a speech in tehran , dismissed the un resolution as just a " scrap of paper " and said the west would have to learn to live with iran possessing nuclear technology . " whether the west likes it or not , iran is a nuclear country and it is in their interests to live alongside iran , " he said according to the semi-official fars agency . installing 3,000 centrifuges would mark an important step for iran towards an industrial scale enrichment of uranium , a process the west wants the islamic republic to suspend as it can be used to make both fuel and nuclear bombs . so far , iran has two cascades of 164 centrifuges at the plant in natanz in central iran which it has used to enrich uranium on a research scale to levels high enough to make nuclear fuel . iran has maintained that it wants to have the 3,000 new centrifuges installed by march and ahmadinejad has said the islamic republic will be able to celebrate its " nuclearization " around that time . " appropriate measures " after weeks of diplomatic wrangling , the un security council on saturday adopted a resolution which imposes restrictions on iran 's nuclear industry and ballistic missile program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad says iran can celebrate its " nuclearization " around march the united states accuses iran of seeking to develop a nuclear weapon , charges vehemently denied by the islamic republic which says it only wants to provide energy to a growing population . the resolution warned that if tehran refuses to comply with un demands to freeze enrichment , the council " shall adopt further appropriate measures under article 41 of chapter seven " of the un charter , a reference to non-military sanctions . russia 's un ambassador vitaly churkin , who worked hard in weeks of diplomatic horse-trading to soften the resolution , expressed hope that iran " will respond constructively . " us under secretary of state for political affairs nicholas burns however pledged to wrench up the pressure on iran beyond the resolution . " we do n't think this resolution is enough in itself .
we want the international community to take further action ...
we would like to see countries stop doing business as usual with iran , " the us diplomat said . france warns against isolation france on sunday warned iran it risked " total isolation " over its defiant decision to expand uranium enrichment in the wake of the imposition of un sanctions . " i ca n't think for an instant that all the iranian authorities have decided on total isolation of their country .
i think that , to the contrary , it would be in their interest to turn towards negotiation , " foreign minister philippe douste-blazy told france inter radio . he noted that the un security council had acted " in a united manner " to pass its resolution saturday . work with iaea to stop ? meanwhile , foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini warned that iran 's cooperation with the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog could be reduced after the resolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei at a ceremony in tehran on sunday " the resolution is contrary to legal principles .
therefore , it should not be expected that we will continue our work with the international atomic energy agency at the same level , " he said . " as the time passes will inform people about our decisions and it will be based on our national interest . " hosseini did not specify what cooperation could be cut , but some iranian lawmakers have already warned that tehran could limit un inspections of its nuclear sites after the resolution . the iranian parliament agreed to urgently vote on a bill that would oblige the government to " revise " its cooperation with the un nuclear watchdog . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un slaps nuclear-related sanctions on iran the security council on saturday slapped the first ever un sanctions on iran , targeting its nuclear and ballistic missile programs in response to its refusal to halt sensitive nuclear fuel work .

many well-educated women find it difficult in germany to balance work and family , and many are choosing to climb the career ladder instead of changing diapers . speaking to the dpa news agency , family affairs minister ursula von der leyen , said germany has one of the world 's longest and sharpest decline in the birth rate .
the fall in the number of children born could have serious consequences for the nation 's health and pension systems as well as its economy . analysts predict that germany 's current population of 82 million could drop to 50 million by 2050 . " i would be extremely pleased , if -lrb- the parental benefit -rrb- succeeded in stopping this dramatic decrease , " she said . the decrease has been apparent for several decades now , but was not seriously addressed by previous governments , in part because of the country 's nazi past .
hitler 's regime encouraged large families in order to propagate what it called the " master race . "
consequently , during much of the post-war era population studies were considered almost taboo in germany . how it works under the new child benefit plan which goes into effect on jan .
1 , parents - either the mother or father - would be entitled to 67 per cent of their previous income , up to a maximum of 1,800 euros a month -lrb- $ 2,363 -rrb- while staying at home for up to 14 months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family affairs minister ursula von der leyen von der leyen , who has seven children , said the new parental benefit represented the " first , but , key component " in helping germany to address the aging of its population . but she conceded that it will take some time " before people have the confidence to bring more children into the world again . " the plan has not been without controversy , mostly due to a provision that requires fathers take two months off work in order get the maximum period of benefits .
some conservative members , mostly men in van der leyen 's own party , the christian democratic union , said the government should not be telling parents how to raise their children . putting it off ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new plan asks dad to get more involved since the new benefits only apply to parents with babies born after dec .
31 , there have been concerns by members of the medical profession that women will try to wait until midnight on that day to give birth . " we warn against any intervention in the natural birth process , " said christian albring , the president of germany 's gynecologists ' federation . he said that medication which stops early contractions should only be given for sound medical reasons and not for financial gain . eu problem birth rates in many countries in the eu are low and the bloc has urged its member states to tackle the challenges of a shrinking workforce and an ageing population , especially by making it easier to meet the demands of both work and family . european governments must set up more flexible working patterns , said eu employment commissioner vladimir spidla earlier this year .
such programs should include cuts in working hours for young parents which would be made up for at a later stage in their lives and even compulsory paternity leave . the average number of children per woman across the eu is at 1.5 , but 2.1 are needed to replace a previous generation . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : german population plunge expected germany 's population will drop by as much as 12 million by 2050 due to low birth rates , according to an official forecast released tuesday .

rainfall in many eastern and southern regions has been at near record lows .
on top of that , the weather has been exceptionally warm .
the parched conditions have sparked an emotional debate about global warming .
conservationists insist the " big dry " is almost certainly the result of climate change and warn that australia is on the brink of environmental disaster .
other experts believe such hysteria is wildly misplaced and that the country should n't panic .
' a war-like scenario ' the drought in australia has lasted for more than five years .
the worry for some is that this could be the start of a protracted period of low rainfall that could go on for decades .
" the really scary thing is last time we had a drought of this intensity that lasted about five years - it lasted for about 50 years , " cautioned professor andy pitman from macquarie university in sydney . "
i can imagine australia being a desert in a few decades ' time " cate faehrmann " the politicians truly believe this is a five-year or six-year drought that will break sometime in 2007 or 2008 .
but it might not break until 2050 and we are n't thinking in those terms at this stage , " professor pitman told the bbc .
global warming , the drought and the future of dwindling water supplies will undoubtedly dominate talk at barbeques and dinner parties this festive season in australia .
" we 're in a state of emergency , " said cate faehrmann from the nature conservation council of new south wales .
" we need to treat this as a war-like scenario .
the people are really worried that we are going to run out of water . "
she added : " i can imagine australia being a desert in a few decades ' time in some of these agricultural areas .
the soil is blowing away , the rivers are drying up .
" i think there will be plots of land abandoned and perhaps whole agricultural practices abandoned . "
massive losses the drought has affected farmers worse than anyone else .
jock lawrie , president of the new south wales farmers ' association , paints a dismal picture .
" there are people out in some parts of our state that have gone to work for four or five years and have n't even earned an income .
" with the winter crop failing to the extent it did , there have been some massive losses .
it is really hard on the emotions of people , there 's no doubt about that . "
australia has some of the world 's most erratic rainfall-patterns .
this vast continent has experienced very dry periods before : the " federation drought " of the late 1800s was a disaster for many communities .
however , some climate experts believe this drought will also pass and australians should n't be too alarmed .
veteran meteorologist bill kinimonth insists the gradual warming of the earth is part of a natural cycle : " the climate follows patterns which we can read back from our instrument records for about 150 years , and from a lot of the proxy records they go back thousands of years .
" the ice cores show the fluctuations of the climate over 100,000-year cycles . "
he told the bbc news website : " we 're presently in what we might call the optimum period , where the earth is warmer than it has been for the last 20,000 years , and i think we should be making the most of it .
" the alternative is not very good - a cold , dry australia . "
the australian prime minister john howard , who refused to sign the kyoto protocol insisting it would damage the economy , now believes , however , that serious environmental trouble is brewing .
professor andy pitman says the drought has forced politicians to look at the bigger picture .
" the australian government has absolutely jumped on greenhouse bandwagon in the last three or four months , " he said .
" although it wo n't sign kyoto , it 's now saying it wants to lead the drive for greenhouse gas emissions globally in a very aggressive leadership way .
" that 's largely due to the drought and the stern report . "

however , some climate experts believe this drought will also pass and australians should n't be too alarmed .
veteran meteorologist bill kinimonth insists the gradual warming of the earth is part of a natural cycle : " the climate follows patterns which we can read back from our instrument records for about 150 years , and from a lot of the proxy records they go back thousands of years .
" the ice cores show the fluctuations of the climate over 100,000-year cycles . "
he told the bbc news website : " we 're presently in what we might call the optimum period , where the earth is warmer than it has been for the last 20,000 years , and i think we should be making the most of it .
" the alternative is not very good - a cold , dry australia . "
the australian prime minister john howard , who refused to sign the kyoto protocol insisting it would damage the economy , now believes , however , that serious environmental trouble is brewing .
professor andy pitman says the drought has forced politicians to look at the bigger picture .
" the australian government has absolutely jumped on greenhouse bandwagon in the last three or four months , " he said .
" although it wo n't sign kyoto , it 's now saying it wants to lead the drive for greenhouse gas emissions globally in a very aggressive leadership way .
" that 's largely due to the drought and the stern report . "

managers at penrhos stanley hospitalin holyhead on anglesey said tvs on the ward were a trip hazard and noisy when some patients wanted to sleep .
but relatives claimed the move was badly timed and left vulnerable people unable to enjoy christmas programmes .
one woman , sally brown , said : " they could leave them there while they sort the problem out " .
north west wales nhs trust , which runs the hospital , said its staff had made the decision to remove the tvs based on purely clinical criteria .
a spokesman said the ward , which has up to 14 patients , had eight different televisions .
some of the elderly patients had hearing difficulties , he said , which had led to the televisions being on at different volumes .
" it obviously caused disruption to other patients who may want to rest , " the spokesman added .
' headphones ' " the cabinets on the bedside are not designed to take a television .
if we had an emergency , like a cardiac arrest , we would then struggle to get the team round the bed because of the trailing wires , which are a hazard .
" it 's unfortunate , but if you are making a clinical decision , you ca n't factor in christmas .
it 's a hazard at any time . "
he added that staff were willing to help patients to the communal television room .
but ms brown , 37 , of dinorwig , near llanberis , who has an elderly relative at the hospital , said : " hospitals are not quiet at the best of times .
the tellies have been there for 12 years , now all of a sudden it 's a problem .
" there are a lot of other things you could do rather than just take the tellies away .
they could put the tellies on the wall , they could have headphones attached .
" it just takes a bit of thought and consideration .
" part of the healing process is to stimulate people 's brains . "

laurie mansfield , his manager for 37 years , called him " the last of the great slapstick comedians " .
drake died in his sleep at a nursing home in twickenham , west london .
he leaves three sons .
he had been living at the entertainment artistes ' benevolent home at brinsworth house for two years .
' end of an era ' drake , who was born in 1925 in elephant and castle , south london , had carried on working into his 70s .
a stroke in the late 1990s forced him to stop , mr mansfield said .
in retirement : drake left showbiz after a stroke in the 1990s he continued : " it is the end of an era , of those comics and comedians that dominated our lives throughout the 1960s and 1970s .

' hallo , my darlings ' charlie drake had been a fixture of tv comedy since the 1950s " he was really on the way to making himself a name in america .
they would n't let him do the slapstick scene in the way he wanted to do it , " he recalled .
drake , whose real name was charles springall , made his first appearance on stage aged eight , and after leaving school toured working men 's clubs .
after serving in the raf during world war ii , drake turned professional and made his tv debut in the 1950s , becoming nationally-known for his " hallo , my darlings " catchphrase .

then , in 1975 , he was fined £ 750 by the actors ' union , equity , for employing a leeds housewife who was not in the union to appear in his pantomime .
he refused to pay the fine and was blacklisted for 18 months .
straight acting the 1980s saw charlie drake turn to straight acting , with some success .
he won an award for his part in pinter 's the caretaker in london and received critical acclaim for his touchstone in shakespeare 's as you like it .
his smallweed , in a bbc television adaptation of dickens ' bleak house , was also well-received .

he wrote many of his own scripts , and would rehearse again and again until he 'd got what he wanted .
and , on more than one occasion , he was injured during a slapstick routine .
when , in 1961 , when he was knocked unconscious during a television sketch , 2,000 people telephoned to see if he was all right .
