but the absence of any flag-waving at home suggests that the athletes ' impressive haul left germans cold .
has the country simply come to expect success ? germany has once again powered to the top of the winter olympics medals table , with a total of 29 medals in turin , 11 of which are gold .
having won 36 medals in salt lake city and 29 in nagano , the turin results are par for the course .
germans are not known for excessive displays of national pride .
but even while the german media praised the achievements of individual athletes such as michael greis who , with three gold medals was the most successful athlete at turin , there was still plenty of analysis about how it was really technological advances that helped german competitors , for example , or how the country was still weak in core sports such as alpine skiing , figure skating , and hockey . the süddeutsche zeitung attributed germany 's success in the medals table to " second-tier " sports , such as biathlon , luge and bobsleigh . " in the core winter olympic sport alpine skiing , germans were far behind the best , " the munich-based paper wrote .
" in figure skating , we fell further behind than expected .
the hockey team had nothing to offer .
germany has to be careful it does n't miss out on the new era . " germany 's winning athletes in turin might be forgiven for feeling somewhat slighted by such a " glass half empty " mindset . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katarina witt : we should be proud of ourselves speaking out on their behalf was german figure skating gold medal winner , katarina witt .
in the welt am sonntag , the former ice queen countered the fault-finding tendency of her fellow citizens , writing : " we should be proud of ourselves for being the best winter sports nation . " after all , in biathlete greis , germany had one of the stars of the turin games , with the 29-year-old becoming the first german to win three golds at the same olympics . greis had never picked up an olympic medal before but stole the show with gold in the 20km individual , 15km mass-start and 4x7.5km relay . old guard also on form he may have been the new star on the scene , but germany 's winter olympics old guard also delivered the goods in the twilight of their careers . biathlete sven fischer , 34 , won 10km individual gold to collect his seventh olympic medal in a career spanning 12 years .
fischer already had two golds to his name from the relay events at the 1994 and 1998 games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german speedskaters anni friesinger , claudia pechstein and daniela anschuetz thoms the 34-year-old claudia pechstein picked up silver in the 5,000m to make her the speedskater with the most medals in olympic history with five gold , two silver and two bronze . " i have nine medals to my name and am proud to be germany 's most successful winter olympian , " pechstein said , proving that she has no qualms about recognizing her achievements . the golden girl from 2002 , kati wilhelm , double olympic champion at biathlon , also won gold in the 10km pursuit and two silvers in the 12.5km mass-start and 4x6km relay . indeed biathlon , which combines rifle-shooting with cross-country skiing , provided germany with 11 out of its 29 medals . as well as biathlon , the luge and bobsleigh were other disciplines dominated by german athletes with sylke otto , silke kraushaar , and tatjana huefner ensuring a clean sweep in the women 's luge . in the bobsleigh , andre lange also won gold in the men 's two and four-man bobsleigh races . winning spirit other german team members like luge legend georg hackl , 39 , might have failed to win a medal , but still showed that the olympic spirit was alive and well .
hackl had hoped to add to his three career golds in turin , but " the speeding sausage " failed to sizzle , coming in seventh . " i did not win a medal but i have shown that i can still compete with these younger guys , " said hackl . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aliona savchenko and robin szolkowy went empty-handed figure-skating pair aliona savchenko and robin szolkowy also went home empty-handed as the controversy surrounding their coach ingo steuer took its toll . the german olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- had banned steuer from the games due to apparent ties with the stasi , the secret police in the former east germany , only to see a court overturn the decision and steuer board the plane for turin . there was also controversy surrounding cross-country ace evi sachenbacher , who was temporarily suspended for excessive haemoglobin levels , but germany shrugged off the problems to reach their goal . " we reached our goal to finish top of the medals table and can be very happy with the turin games , " concluded nok president klaus steinbach in the kind of matter-of-fact fashion that could only exist in a country which has come to expect this level of success . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's greis the golden boy of turin securing his place in olympics history , germany 's michael greis became the most successful athlete at the turin winter games on saturday when he won his third gold medal in the men 's 15-km biathlon .

like the head of dortmund 's racing association .
in a desperate bid to draw more mid-winter visitors to the track , he put his money on desert dromedaries . unlike horses , camels really do n't like to race .
they have to be coaxed , pushed , and motivated to run .
but hans hugo miebach , the president of the racing association in the western german city of dortmund , is hoping all that effort will pay off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could camel races be the next big craze to sweep germany ?
after watching a documentary about camel racing on public television , miebach decided that would be just the thing to pull dortmund 's racetrack out of the midwinter doldrums .
the exotic appeal of a camel race could easily draw double the amount of visitors on a cold , drizzly sunday than your standard horse race , he reasoned . that is , if he can actually get the diffident dromedaries in the competitive spirit .
at test races held on friday , the camels in question seemed much more interested in the lush green grass growing alongside the track , than crossing the finish line . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tired teddies take bavarian break everyone needs a vacation from time to time , so why should your loyal bedtime companion - teddy bear or otherwise - be any different ?

but the absence of any flag-waving at home suggests that the athletes ' impressive haul left germans cold .
has the country simply come to expect success ? germany has once again powered to the top of the winter olympics medals table , with a total of 29 medals in turin , 11 of which are gold .
having won 36 medals in salt lake city and 29 in nagano , the turin results are par for the course .
germans are not known for excessive displays of national pride .
but even while the german media praised the achievements of individual athletes such as michael greis who , with three gold medals was the most successful athlete at turin , there was still plenty of analysis about how it was really technological advances that helped german competitors , for example , or how the country was still weak in core sports such as alpine skiing , figure skating , and hockey . the süddeutsche zeitung attributed germany 's success in the medals table to " second-tier " sports , such as biathlon , luge and bobsleigh . " in the core winter olympic sport alpine skiing , germans were far behind the best , " the munich-based paper wrote .
" in figure skating , we fell further behind than expected .
the hockey team had nothing to offer .
germany has to be careful it does n't miss out on the new era . " germany 's winning athletes in turin might be forgiven for feeling somewhat slighted by such a " glass half empty " mindset . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katarina witt : we should be proud of ourselves speaking out on their behalf was german figure skating gold medal winner , katarina witt .
in the welt am sonntag , the former ice queen countered the fault-finding tendency of her fellow citizens , writing : " we should be proud of ourselves for being the best winter sports nation . " after all , in biathlete greis , germany had one of the stars of the turin games , with the 29-year-old becoming the first german to win three golds at the same olympics . greis had never picked up an olympic medal before but stole the show with gold in the 20km individual , 15km mass-start and 4x7.5km relay . old guard also on form he may have been the new star on the scene , but germany 's winter olympics old guard also delivered the goods in the twilight of their careers . biathlete sven fischer , 34 , won 10km individual gold to collect his seventh olympic medal in a career spanning 12 years .
fischer already had two golds to his name from the relay events at the 1994 and 1998 games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german speedskaters anni friesinger , claudia pechstein and daniela anschuetz thoms the 34-year-old claudia pechstein picked up silver in the 5,000m to make her the speedskater with the most medals in olympic history with five gold , two silver and two bronze . " i have nine medals to my name and am proud to be germany 's most successful winter olympian , " pechstein said , proving that she has no qualms about recognizing her achievements . the golden girl from 2002 , kati wilhelm , double olympic champion at biathlon , also won gold in the 10km pursuit and two silvers in the 12.5km mass-start and 4x6km relay . indeed biathlon , which combines rifle-shooting with cross-country skiing , provided germany with 11 out of its 29 medals . as well as biathlon , the luge and bobsleigh were other disciplines dominated by german athletes with sylke otto , silke kraushaar , and tatjana huefner ensuring a clean sweep in the women 's luge . in the bobsleigh , andre lange also won gold in the men 's two and four-man bobsleigh races . winning spirit other german team members like luge legend georg hackl , 39 , might have failed to win a medal , but still showed that the olympic spirit was alive and well .
hackl had hoped to add to his three career golds in turin , but " the speeding sausage " failed to sizzle , coming in seventh . " i did not win a medal but i have shown that i can still compete with these younger guys , " said hackl . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aliona savchenko and robin szolkowy went empty-handed figure-skating pair aliona savchenko and robin szolkowy also went home empty-handed as the controversy surrounding their coach ingo steuer took its toll . the german olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- had banned steuer from the games due to apparent ties with the stasi , the secret police in the former east germany , only to see a court overturn the decision and steuer board the plane for turin . there was also controversy surrounding cross-country ace evi sachenbacher , who was temporarily suspended for excessive haemoglobin levels , but germany shrugged off the problems to reach their goal . " we reached our goal to finish top of the medals table and can be very happy with the turin games , " concluded nok president klaus steinbach in the kind of matter-of-fact fashion that could only exist in a country which has come to expect this level of success . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's greis the golden boy of turin securing his place in olympics history , germany 's michael greis became the most successful athlete at the turin winter games on saturday when he won his third gold medal in the men 's 15-km biathlon .

the german counterparts to the likes of dr. dre and busta rhymes used to be middle-class white boys in baseball caps .
but not any more . in the 1980s , while hard-hitting line-ups like public enemy were giving mainstream america sleepless nights during the golden age of hip hop , german rap was a movement still very much in its infancy . even when it began catching up , it steered clear of in-your-face polemic .
chart-friendly bands like die fantastischen vier and fettes brot might have marked an escape from the grip neue deutsche welle held on the nation , but the last thing they were was confrontational .
and that made sense .
after all , rap had emerged from the margins of us society , giving a voice to its angry , frustrated - and primarily black - underclass .
germany , in contrast , was a wealthy , satisfied nation . socially aware bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hip hop culture grew out of the ghetto but gradually , political and social content did find its way into germany 's hip hop scene , in a development pioneered by the band advanced chemistry in the early 1990s .
as well as introducing a grittier dimension to german rap , it was also one of the first bands to write german lyrics . " rappers suddenly realized that people were far more likely to get into it when they actually understood the lyrics , " said writer and rapper murat göngör . german hip hoppers were finally getting the message .
the growing self-confidence of its immigrant population as well as an inexorable spiral into economic depression went hand-in-hand with a burgeoning subculture that finally identified with young , black america . rap gets down and dirty ten years later , the brand of quirky social criticism peddled by well-meaning white rappers with a penchant for a nice bassline has been replaced by an altogether edgier genre . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die söhne mannheims while germany is proud of politically-correct , multi-ethic groups such as die söhne mannheims , it 's also seen hip hop leave the affluent suburbs of stuttgart and heidelberg and head exactly where many believe it belongs : in berlin 's run-down high-rises , where it 's been reclaimed by kids who know at least as much about inner-city deprivation as snoop dog does . artists such as sido and bushido , who share the aggro berlin label , deal with sex , drugs and violence , and have even been censored by the bpjm , berlin 's department for media harmful to young persons .
that has n't stopped them amassing a vast and loyal following of fans - many of whom have far-right political sympathies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sido the racist content sets it apart from us rap , but in many other ways , performers such as bushido - who is half-tunisian - are unmistakably taking their cues state-side .
like 50 cent and the notorious b.i.g. , they have a penchant for gold chains and guns , baggy jeans and bandanas , and rap about drug habits , jail sentences and violent sex .
above all , they like to glamorize gang culture . a bad influence ? it 's authentic , but it 's considerably less palatable than the hip hop germany is used to . former member of hip hop combo anarchist academy and the author of several specialist books , hannes loh accuses this new generation of rappers of fuelling cultural stand-offs . " bushido styles himself as the typical aggressive arab , confirming precisely the stereotypes the majority of germans expect from arabs and turks , " he said .
" basically that all they do is deal drugs , take cocaine and beat their women . " loh thinks it 's right that much of this music has been censored , but says it 's symptomatic of deep-rooted social problems . " they 're victims themselves , " he said .
" they have no education and no jobs .
all they have is a big mouth . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de censoring german rap some german rappers have been making the headlines for their very politically incorrect lyrics .
the government 's media watchdog for youth has censored several cds , sparking a debate on just how far censorship should go .
-lrb- june 29 , 2005 -rrb- a german hip hopper 's hallelujah in israel a high-octane performance by messianic pop star xavier naidoo and his band die söhne mannheims in tel aviv served as a rousing testament to the rise of religion in german pop .
-lrb- june 10 , 2005 -rrb- hip-hop stars face off in leipzig leipzig has a strong musical tradition , though hip hop is n't the genre that first comes to mind .
but over the weekend , it was n't cellists and violinists at center stage , rather djs , breakdancers and beat boxers .

germany 's rhineland is on the cusp of its annual carnival climax , and it is not only the local jesters who are dancing a jig of joy .
carnival has , over the years , come to mean big business and big bucks for germany . one of the greatest money spinners at this time of year is fancy dress .
from funny costumes to crazy wigs - shops that stock it , flog it .
en masse .
spread out over 3000 square meters -lrb- 32,300 square feet -rrb- , germany 's biggest carnival store , " karnevalswierts " is like a scene from the post-christmas sales .
no sign of consumer apath here . frank schröder , who manages the store , said he ca n't complain . " maybe tough times make people all the more determined to celebrate , " he said .
" perhaps people work on the basis that even if they ca n't afford a holiday , they will aim to have a good time at carnival . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : probably one of the tamer soccer-themed carnival hats preparations for the rhineland 's festive season get underway before the official start on nov .
11 .
by the time christmas rolls around , the cologne carnival business is kitting out as many as 10,000 customers daily . soccer-themed costumes are a big seller this year as germany is hosting the world cup in the summer . " we have soccer overalls , scarves , caps and lots of other things , " schröder said , adding that he believes these kinds of outfits will remain popular way beyond ash wednesday , the official end of carnival . billio n -dollar i n dustry but costumes are only one part of the seasonal industry .
restaurants and bars also do good business , as do those who make the candy - tons of which is thrown through the air as part of the rose monday processions . tourism and taxi drivers equally experience a boom during carnival time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even crazy folks must eat " the annual revenue amounts to between 4 and 5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.7 billion to $ 5.9 billion -rrb- , " said volker wagner , the president of the german carnival association , adding that in cologne alone , carnival brings in revenues of 350 million euros . about 3,000 people in the city have also found work because of the " fifth " season .
wagner said that 30 companies in germany produce carnival medals year round . " gastronomy , cab companies and others - they may not live off carnival , but it certainly contributes to business as a lot of extra people are employed during that time , " wagner said . but not everyone stands to benefit from carnival : fewer and fewer people attend the big galas put on by carnival associations , opting to watch the festivities on television instead .
but wagner partly blamed gala organizers , who charge outrageous sums for drinks , such as 9.80 euros for a bottle of mineral water . " now that 's just crazy , " he said . dw staff -lrb- tkw / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carnival steers clear of religious topics carnival kicks off across germany this week .

germany 's rhineland is on the cusp of its annual carnival climax , and it is not only the local jesters who are dancing a jig of joy .
carnival has , over the years , come to mean big business and big bucks for germany . one of the greatest money spinners at this time of year is fancy dress .
from funny costumes to crazy wigs - shops that stock it , flog it .
en masse .
spread out over 3000 square meters -lrb- 32,300 square feet -rrb- , germany 's biggest carnival store , " karnevalswierts " is like a scene from the post-christmas sales .
no sign of consumer apath here . frank schröder , who manages the store , said he ca n't complain . " maybe tough times make people all the more determined to celebrate , " he said .
" perhaps people work on the basis that even if they ca n't afford a holiday , they will aim to have a good time at carnival . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : probably one of the tamer soccer-themed carnival hats preparations for the rhineland 's festive season get underway before the official start on nov .
11 .
by the time christmas rolls around , the cologne carnival business is kitting out as many as 10,000 customers daily . soccer-themed costumes are a big seller this year as germany is hosting the world cup in the summer . " we have soccer overalls , scarves , caps and lots of other things , " schröder said , adding that he believes these kinds of outfits will remain popular way beyond ash wednesday , the official end of carnival . billio n -dollar i n dustry but costumes are only one part of the seasonal industry .
restaurants and bars also do good business , as do those who make the candy - tons of which is thrown through the air as part of the rose monday processions . tourism and taxi drivers equally experience a boom during carnival time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even crazy folks must eat " the annual revenue amounts to between 4 and 5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.7 billion to $ 5.9 billion -rrb- , " said volker wagner , the president of the german carnival association , adding that in cologne alone , carnival brings in revenues of 350 million euros . about 3,000 people in the city have also found work because of the " fifth " season .
wagner said that 30 companies in germany produce carnival medals year round . " gastronomy , cab companies and others - they may not live off carnival , but it certainly contributes to business as a lot of extra people are employed during that time , " wagner said . but not everyone stands to benefit from carnival : fewer and fewer people attend the big galas put on by carnival associations , opting to watch the festivities on television instead .
but wagner partly blamed gala organizers , who charge outrageous sums for drinks , such as 9.80 euros for a bottle of mineral water . " now that 's just crazy , " he said . dw staff -lrb- tkw / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carnival steers clear of religious topics carnival kicks off across germany this week .

germany 's rhineland is on the cusp of its annual carnival climax , and it is not only the local jesters who are dancing a jig of joy .
carnival has , over the years , come to mean big business and big bucks for germany . one of the greatest money spinners at this time of year is fancy dress .
from funny costumes to crazy wigs - shops that stock it , flog it .
en masse .
spread out over 3000 square meters -lrb- 32,300 square feet -rrb- , germany 's biggest carnival store , " karnevalswierts " is like a scene from the post-christmas sales .
no sign of consumer apath here . frank schröder , who manages the store , said he ca n't complain . " maybe tough times make people all the more determined to celebrate , " he said .
" perhaps people work on the basis that even if they ca n't afford a holiday , they will aim to have a good time at carnival . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : probably one of the tamer soccer-themed carnival hats preparations for the rhineland 's festive season get underway before the official start on nov .
11 .
by the time christmas rolls around , the cologne carnival business is kitting out as many as 10,000 customers daily . soccer-themed costumes are a big seller this year as germany is hosting the world cup in the summer . " we have soccer overalls , scarves , caps and lots of other things , " schröder said , adding that he believes these kinds of outfits will remain popular way beyond ash wednesday , the official end of carnival . billio n -dollar i n dustry but costumes are only one part of the seasonal industry .
restaurants and bars also do good business , as do those who make the candy - tons of which is thrown through the air as part of the rose monday processions . tourism and taxi drivers equally experience a boom during carnival time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even crazy folks must eat " the annual revenue amounts to between 4 and 5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.7 billion to $ 5.9 billion -rrb- , " said volker wagner , the president of the german carnival association , adding that in cologne alone , carnival brings in revenues of 350 million euros . about 3,000 people in the city have also found work because of the " fifth " season .
wagner said that 30 companies in germany produce carnival medals year round . " gastronomy , cab companies and others - they may not live off carnival , but it certainly contributes to business as a lot of extra people are employed during that time , " wagner said . but not everyone stands to benefit from carnival : fewer and fewer people attend the big galas put on by carnival associations , opting to watch the festivities on television instead .
but wagner partly blamed gala organizers , who charge outrageous sums for drinks , such as 9.80 euros for a bottle of mineral water . " now that 's just crazy , " he said . dw staff -lrb- tkw / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carnival steers clear of religious topics carnival kicks off across germany this week .

like the head of dortmund 's racing association .
in a desperate bid to draw more mid-winter visitors to the track , he put his money on desert dromedaries . unlike horses , camels really do n't like to race .
they have to be coaxed , pushed , and motivated to run .
but hans hugo miebach , the president of the racing association in the western german city of dortmund , is hoping all that effort will pay off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could camel races be the next big craze to sweep germany ?
after watching a documentary about camel racing on public television , miebach decided that would be just the thing to pull dortmund 's racetrack out of the midwinter doldrums .
the exotic appeal of a camel race could easily draw double the amount of visitors on a cold , drizzly sunday than your standard horse race , he reasoned . that is , if he can actually get the diffident dromedaries in the competitive spirit .

germany , in contrast , was a wealthy , satisfied nation . socially aware bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hip hop culture grew out of the ghetto but gradually , political and social content did find its way into germany 's hip hop scene , in a development pioneered by the band advanced chemistry in the early 1990s .
as well as introducing a grittier dimension to german rap , it was also one of the first bands to write german lyrics . " rappers suddenly realized that people were far more likely to get into it when they actually understood the lyrics , " said writer and rapper murat göngör . german hip hoppers were finally getting the message .
the growing self-confidence of its immigrant population as well as an inexorable spiral into economic depression went hand-in-hand with a burgeoning subculture that finally identified with young , black america . rap gets down and dirty ten years later , the brand of quirky social criticism peddled by well-meaning white rappers with a penchant for a nice bassline has been replaced by an altogether edgier genre . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die söhne mannheims while germany is proud of politically-correct , multi-ethic groups such as die söhne mannheims , it 's also seen hip hop leave the affluent suburbs of stuttgart and heidelberg and head exactly where many believe it belongs : in berlin 's run-down high-rises , where it 's been reclaimed by kids who know at least as much about inner-city deprivation as snoop dog does . artists such as sido and bushido , who share the aggro berlin label , deal with sex , drugs and violence , and have even been censored by the bpjm , berlin 's department for media harmful to young persons .
that has n't stopped them amassing a vast and loyal following of fans - many of whom have far-right political sympathies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sido the racist content sets it apart from us rap , but in many other ways , performers such as bushido - who is half-tunisian - are unmistakably taking their cues state-side .
like 50 cent and the notorious b.i.g. , they have a penchant for gold chains and guns , baggy jeans and bandanas , and rap about drug habits , jail sentences and violent sex .
above all , they like to glamorize gang culture . a bad influence ? it 's authentic , but it 's considerably less palatable than the hip hop germany is used to . former member of hip hop combo anarchist academy and the author of several specialist books , hannes loh accuses this new generation of rappers of fuelling cultural stand-offs . " bushido styles himself as the typical aggressive arab , confirming precisely the stereotypes the majority of germans expect from arabs and turks , " he said .
" basically that all they do is deal drugs , take cocaine and beat their women . " loh thinks it 's right that much of this music has been censored , but says it 's symptomatic of deep-rooted social problems . " they 're victims themselves , " he said .
" they have no education and no jobs .
all they have is a big mouth . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de censoring german rap some german rappers have been making the headlines for their very politically incorrect lyrics .
the government 's media watchdog for youth has censored several cds , sparking a debate on just how far censorship should go .
-lrb- june 29 , 2005 -rrb- a german hip hopper 's hallelujah in israel a high-octane performance by messianic pop star xavier naidoo and his band die söhne mannheims in tel aviv served as a rousing testament to the rise of religion in german pop .
-lrb- june 10 , 2005 -rrb- hip-hop stars face off in leipzig leipzig has a strong musical tradition , though hip hop is n't the genre that first comes to mind .
but over the weekend , it was n't cellists and violinists at center stage , rather djs , breakdancers and beat boxers .

no sign of consumer apath here . frank schröder , who manages the store , said he ca n't complain . " maybe tough times make people all the more determined to celebrate , " he said .
" perhaps people work on the basis that even if they ca n't afford a holiday , they will aim to have a good time at carnival .

wagner said that 30 companies in germany produce carnival medals year round . " gastronomy , cab companies and others - they may not live off carnival , but it certainly contributes to business as a lot of extra people are employed during that time , " wagner said . but not everyone stands to benefit from carnival : fewer and fewer people attend the big galas put on by carnival associations , opting to watch the festivities on television instead .
but wagner partly blamed gala organizers , who charge outrageous sums for drinks , such as 9.80 euros for a bottle of mineral water .

no sign of consumer apath here . frank schröder , who manages the store , said he ca n't complain . " maybe tough times make people all the more determined to celebrate , " he said .
" perhaps people work on the basis that even if they ca n't afford a holiday , they will aim to have a good time at carnival .

by the time christmas rolls around , the cologne carnival business is kitting out as many as 10,000 customers daily . soccer-themed costumes are a big seller this year as germany is hosting the world cup in the summer . " we have soccer overalls , scarves , caps and lots of other things , " schröder said , adding that he believes these kinds of outfits will remain popular way beyond ash wednesday , the official end of carnival . billio n -dollar i n dustry but costumes are only one part of the seasonal industry .
restaurants and bars also do good business , as do those who make the candy - tons of which is thrown through the air as part of the rose monday processions . tourism and taxi drivers equally experience a boom during carnival time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even crazy folks must eat " the annual revenue amounts to between 4 and 5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.7 billion to $ 5.9 billion -rrb- , " said volker wagner , the president of the german carnival association , adding that in cologne alone , carnival brings in revenues of 350 million euros . about 3,000 people in the city have also found work because of the " fifth " season .
wagner said that 30 companies in germany produce carnival medals year round . " gastronomy , cab companies and others - they may not live off carnival , but it certainly contributes to business as a lot of extra people are employed during that time , " wagner said . but not everyone stands to benefit from carnival : fewer and fewer people attend the big galas put on by carnival associations , opting to watch the festivities on television instead .
but wagner partly blamed gala organizers , who charge outrageous sums for drinks , such as 9.80 euros for a bottle of mineral water .

the german counterparts to the likes of dr. dre and busta rhymes used to be middle-class white boys in baseball caps .
but not any more . in the 1980s , while hard-hitting line-ups like public enemy were giving mainstream america sleepless nights during the golden age of hip hop , german rap was a movement still very much in its infancy . even when it began catching up , it steered clear of in-your-face polemic .
chart-friendly bands like die fantastischen vier and fettes brot might have marked an escape from the grip neue deutsche welle held on the nation , but the last thing they were was confrontational .
and that made sense .
after all , rap had emerged from the margins of us society , giving a voice to its angry , frustrated - and primarily black - underclass .
germany , in contrast , was a wealthy , satisfied nation . socially aware bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hip hop culture grew out of the ghetto but gradually , political and social content did find its way into germany 's hip hop scene , in a development pioneered by the band advanced chemistry in the early 1990s .
as well as introducing a grittier dimension to german rap , it was also one of the first bands to write german lyrics . " rappers suddenly realized that people were far more likely to get into it when they actually understood the lyrics , " said writer and rapper murat göngör . german hip hoppers were finally getting the message .
the growing self-confidence of its immigrant population as well as an inexorable spiral into economic depression went hand-in-hand with a burgeoning subculture that finally identified with young , black america . rap gets down and dirty ten years later , the brand of quirky social criticism peddled by well-meaning white rappers with a penchant for a nice bassline has been replaced by an altogether edgier genre . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die söhne mannheims while germany is proud of politically-correct , multi-ethic groups such as die söhne mannheims , it 's also seen hip hop leave the affluent suburbs of stuttgart and heidelberg and head exactly where many believe it belongs : in berlin 's run-down high-rises , where it 's been reclaimed by kids who know at least as much about inner-city deprivation as snoop dog does . artists such as sido and bushido , who share the aggro berlin label , deal with sex , drugs and violence , and have even been censored by the bpjm , berlin 's department for media harmful to young persons .
that has n't stopped them amassing a vast and loyal following of fans - many of whom have far-right political sympathies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sido the racist content sets it apart from us rap , but in many other ways , performers such as bushido - who is half-tunisian - are unmistakably taking their cues state-side .
like 50 cent and the notorious b.i.g. , they have a penchant for gold chains and guns , baggy jeans and bandanas , and rap about drug habits , jail sentences and violent sex .
above all , they like to glamorize gang culture . a bad influence ? it 's authentic , but it 's considerably less palatable than the hip hop germany is used to . former member of hip hop combo anarchist academy and the author of several specialist books , hannes loh accuses this new generation of rappers of fuelling cultural stand-offs . " bushido styles himself as the typical aggressive arab , confirming precisely the stereotypes the majority of germans expect from arabs and turks , " he said .
" basically that all they do is deal drugs , take cocaine and beat their women . " loh thinks it 's right that much of this music has been censored , but says it 's symptomatic of deep-rooted social problems . " they 're victims themselves , " he said .
" they have no education and no jobs .
all they have is a big mouth . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de censoring german rap some german rappers have been making the headlines for their very politically incorrect lyrics .

but not any more . in the 1980s , while hard-hitting line-ups like public enemy were giving mainstream america sleepless nights during the golden age of hip hop , german rap was a movement still very much in its infancy . even when it began catching up , it steered clear of in-your-face polemic .
chart-friendly bands like die fantastischen vier and fettes brot might have marked an escape from the grip neue deutsche welle held on the nation , but the last thing they were was confrontational .
and that made sense .

but the absence of any flag-waving at home suggests that the athletes ' impressive haul left germans cold .
has the country simply come to expect success ? germany has once again powered to the top of the winter olympics medals table , with a total of 29 medals in turin , 11 of which are gold .
having won 36 medals in salt lake city and 29 in nagano , the turin results are par for the course .
germans are not known for excessive displays of national pride .
but even while the german media praised the achievements of individual athletes such as michael greis who , with three gold medals was the most successful athlete at turin , there was still plenty of analysis about how it was really technological advances that helped german competitors , for example , or how the country was still weak in core sports such as alpine skiing , figure skating , and hockey . the süddeutsche zeitung attributed germany 's success in the medals table to " second-tier " sports , such as biathlon , luge and bobsleigh . " in the core winter olympic sport alpine skiing , germans were far behind the best , " the munich-based paper wrote .
" in figure skating , we fell further behind than expected .
the hockey team had nothing to offer .
germany has to be careful it does n't miss out on the new era . " germany 's winning athletes in turin might be forgiven for feeling somewhat slighted by such a " glass half empty " mindset . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katarina witt : we should be proud of ourselves speaking out on their behalf was german figure skating gold medal winner , katarina witt .
in the welt am sonntag , the former ice queen countered the fault-finding tendency of her fellow citizens , writing : " we should be proud of ourselves for being the best winter sports nation . " after all , in biathlete greis , germany had one of the stars of the turin games , with the 29-year-old becoming the first german to win three golds at the same olympics . greis had never picked up an olympic medal before but stole the show with gold in the 20km individual , 15km mass-start and 4x7.5km relay . old guard also on form he may have been the new star on the scene , but germany 's winter olympics old guard also delivered the goods in the twilight of their careers . biathlete sven fischer , 34 , won 10km individual gold to collect his seventh olympic medal in a career spanning 12 years .
fischer already had two golds to his name from the relay events at the 1994 and 1998 games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german speedskaters anni friesinger , claudia pechstein and daniela anschuetz thoms the 34-year-old claudia pechstein picked up silver in the 5,000m to make her the speedskater with the most medals in olympic history with five gold , two silver and two bronze . " i have nine medals to my name and am proud to be germany 's most successful winter olympian , " pechstein said , proving that she has no qualms about recognizing her achievements . the golden girl from 2002 , kati wilhelm , double olympic champion at biathlon , also won gold in the 10km pursuit and two silvers in the 12.5km mass-start and 4x6km relay . indeed biathlon , which combines rifle-shooting with cross-country skiing , provided germany with 11 out of its 29 medals . as well as biathlon , the luge and bobsleigh were other disciplines dominated by german athletes with sylke otto , silke kraushaar , and tatjana huefner ensuring a clean sweep in the women 's luge . in the bobsleigh , andre lange also won gold in the men 's two and four-man bobsleigh races . winning spirit other german team members like luge legend georg hackl , 39 , might have failed to win a medal , but still showed that the olympic spirit was alive and well .
hackl had hoped to add to his three career golds in turin , but " the speeding sausage " failed to sizzle , coming in seventh . " i did not win a medal but i have shown that i can still compete with these younger guys , " said hackl . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aliona savchenko and robin szolkowy went empty-handed figure-skating pair aliona savchenko and robin szolkowy also went home empty-handed as the controversy surrounding their coach ingo steuer took its toll . the german olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- had banned steuer from the games due to apparent ties with the stasi , the secret police in the former east germany , only to see a court overturn the decision and steuer board the plane for turin . there was also controversy surrounding cross-country ace evi sachenbacher , who was temporarily suspended for excessive haemoglobin levels , but germany shrugged off the problems to reach their goal .

but the absence of any flag-waving at home suggests that the athletes ' impressive haul left germans cold .
has the country simply come to expect success ? germany has once again powered to the top of the winter olympics medals table , with a total of 29 medals in turin , 11 of which are gold .
having won 36 medals in salt lake city and 29 in nagano , the turin results are par for the course .
germans are not known for excessive displays of national pride .
but even while the german media praised the achievements of individual athletes such as michael greis who , with three gold medals was the most successful athlete at turin , there was still plenty of analysis about how it was really technological advances that helped german competitors , for example , or how the country was still weak in core sports such as alpine skiing , figure skating , and hockey . the süddeutsche zeitung attributed germany 's success in the medals table to " second-tier " sports , such as biathlon , luge and bobsleigh . " in the core winter olympic sport alpine skiing , germans were far behind the best , " the munich-based paper wrote .
" in figure skating , we fell further behind than expected .
the hockey team had nothing to offer .
germany has to be careful it does n't miss out on the new era . " germany 's winning athletes in turin might be forgiven for feeling somewhat slighted by such a " glass half empty " mindset . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katarina witt : we should be proud of ourselves speaking out on their behalf was german figure skating gold medal winner , katarina witt .
in the welt am sonntag , the former ice queen countered the fault-finding tendency of her fellow citizens , writing : " we should be proud of ourselves for being the best winter sports nation . " after all , in biathlete greis , germany had one of the stars of the turin games , with the 29-year-old becoming the first german to win three golds at the same olympics . greis had never picked up an olympic medal before but stole the show with gold in the 20km individual , 15km mass-start and 4x7.5km relay . old guard also on form he may have been the new star on the scene , but germany 's winter olympics old guard also delivered the goods in the twilight of their careers . biathlete sven fischer , 34 , won 10km individual gold to collect his seventh olympic medal in a career spanning 12 years .
fischer already had two golds to his name from the relay events at the 1994 and 1998 games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german speedskaters anni friesinger , claudia pechstein and daniela anschuetz thoms the 34-year-old claudia pechstein picked up silver in the 5,000m to make her the speedskater with the most medals in olympic history with five gold , two silver and two bronze . " i have nine medals to my name and am proud to be germany 's most successful winter olympian , " pechstein said , proving that she has no qualms about recognizing her achievements . the golden girl from 2002 , kati wilhelm , double olympic champion at biathlon , also won gold in the 10km pursuit and two silvers in the 12.5km mass-start and 4x6km relay . indeed biathlon , which combines rifle-shooting with cross-country skiing , provided germany with 11 out of its 29 medals . as well as biathlon , the luge and bobsleigh were other disciplines dominated by german athletes with sylke otto , silke kraushaar , and tatjana huefner ensuring a clean sweep in the women 's luge . in the bobsleigh , andre lange also won gold in the men 's two and four-man bobsleigh races . winning spirit other german team members like luge legend georg hackl , 39 , might have failed to win a medal , but still showed that the olympic spirit was alive and well .
hackl had hoped to add to his three career golds in turin , but " the speeding sausage " failed to sizzle , coming in seventh . " i did not win a medal but i have shown that i can still compete with these younger guys , " said hackl . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aliona savchenko and robin szolkowy went empty-handed figure-skating pair aliona savchenko and robin szolkowy also went home empty-handed as the controversy surrounding their coach ingo steuer took its toll . the german olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- had banned steuer from the games due to apparent ties with the stasi , the secret police in the former east germany , only to see a court overturn the decision and steuer board the plane for turin . there was also controversy surrounding cross-country ace evi sachenbacher , who was temporarily suspended for excessive haemoglobin levels , but germany shrugged off the problems to reach their goal . " we reached our goal to finish top of the medals table and can be very happy with the turin games , " concluded nok president klaus steinbach in the kind of matter-of-fact fashion that could only exist in a country which has come to expect this level of success . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's greis the golden boy of turin securing his place in olympics history , germany 's michael greis became the most successful athlete at the turin winter games on saturday when he won his third gold medal in the men 's 15-km biathlon .

but the absence of any flag-waving at home suggests that the athletes ' impressive haul left germans cold .
has the country simply come to expect success ? germany has once again powered to the top of the winter olympics medals table , with a total of 29 medals in turin , 11 of which are gold .
having won 36 medals in salt lake city and 29 in nagano , the turin results are par for the course .
germans are not known for excessive displays of national pride .
but even while the german media praised the achievements of individual athletes such as michael greis who , with three gold medals was the most successful athlete at turin , there was still plenty of analysis about how it was really technological advances that helped german competitors , for example , or how the country was still weak in core sports such as alpine skiing , figure skating , and hockey . the süddeutsche zeitung attributed germany 's success in the medals table to " second-tier " sports , such as biathlon , luge and bobsleigh . " in the core winter olympic sport alpine skiing , germans were far behind the best , " the munich-based paper wrote .
" in figure skating , we fell further behind than expected .
the hockey team had nothing to offer .
germany has to be careful it does n't miss out on the new era . " germany 's winning athletes in turin might be forgiven for feeling somewhat slighted by such a " glass half empty " mindset . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katarina witt : we should be proud of ourselves speaking out on their behalf was german figure skating gold medal winner , katarina witt .
in the welt am sonntag , the former ice queen countered the fault-finding tendency of her fellow citizens , writing : " we should be proud of ourselves for being the best winter sports nation . " after all , in biathlete greis , germany had one of the stars of the turin games , with the 29-year-old becoming the first german to win three golds at the same olympics . greis had never picked up an olympic medal before but stole the show with gold in the 20km individual , 15km mass-start and 4x7.5km relay . old guard also on form he may have been the new star on the scene , but germany 's winter olympics old guard also delivered the goods in the twilight of their careers . biathlete sven fischer , 34 , won 10km individual gold to collect his seventh olympic medal in a career spanning 12 years .
fischer already had two golds to his name from the relay events at the 1994 and 1998 games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german speedskaters anni friesinger , claudia pechstein and daniela anschuetz thoms the 34-year-old claudia pechstein picked up silver in the 5,000m to make her the speedskater with the most medals in olympic history with five gold , two silver and two bronze . " i have nine medals to my name and am proud to be germany 's most successful winter olympian , " pechstein said , proving that she has no qualms about recognizing her achievements . the golden girl from 2002 , kati wilhelm , double olympic champion at biathlon , also won gold in the 10km pursuit and two silvers in the 12.5km mass-start and 4x6km relay . indeed biathlon , which combines rifle-shooting with cross-country skiing , provided germany with 11 out of its 29 medals . as well as biathlon , the luge and bobsleigh were other disciplines dominated by german athletes with sylke otto , silke kraushaar , and tatjana huefner ensuring a clean sweep in the women 's luge . in the bobsleigh , andre lange also won gold in the men 's two and four-man bobsleigh races . winning spirit other german team members like luge legend georg hackl , 39 , might have failed to win a medal , but still showed that the olympic spirit was alive and well .
hackl had hoped to add to his three career golds in turin , but " the speeding sausage " failed to sizzle , coming in seventh . " i did not win a medal but i have shown that i can still compete with these younger guys , " said hackl . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aliona savchenko and robin szolkowy went empty-handed figure-skating pair aliona savchenko and robin szolkowy also went home empty-handed as the controversy surrounding their coach ingo steuer took its toll . the german olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- had banned steuer from the games due to apparent ties with the stasi , the secret police in the former east germany , only to see a court overturn the decision and steuer board the plane for turin . there was also controversy surrounding cross-country ace evi sachenbacher , who was temporarily suspended for excessive haemoglobin levels , but germany shrugged off the problems to reach their goal . " we reached our goal to finish top of the medals table and can be very happy with the turin games , " concluded nok president klaus steinbach in the kind of matter-of-fact fashion that could only exist in a country which has come to expect this level of success . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's greis the golden boy of turin securing his place in olympics history , germany 's michael greis became the most successful athlete at the turin winter games on saturday when he won his third gold medal in the men 's 15-km biathlon .

no sign of consumer apath here . frank schröder , who manages the store , said he ca n't complain . " maybe tough times make people all the more determined to celebrate , " he said .
" perhaps people work on the basis that even if they ca n't afford a holiday , they will aim to have a good time at carnival .

by the time christmas rolls around , the cologne carnival business is kitting out as many as 10,000 customers daily . soccer-themed costumes are a big seller this year as germany is hosting the world cup in the summer .

restaurants and bars also do good business , as do those who make the candy - tons of which is thrown through the air as part of the rose monday processions . tourism and taxi drivers equally experience a boom during carnival time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even crazy folks must eat " the annual revenue amounts to between 4 and 5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.7 billion to $ 5.9 billion -rrb- , " said volker wagner , the president of the german carnival association , adding that in cologne alone , carnival brings in revenues of 350 million euros . about 3,000 people in the city have also found work because of the " fifth " season .
wagner said that 30 companies in germany produce carnival medals year round . " gastronomy , cab companies and others - they may not live off carnival , but it certainly contributes to business as a lot of extra people are employed during that time , " wagner said . but not everyone stands to benefit from carnival : fewer and fewer people attend the big galas put on by carnival associations , opting to watch the festivities on television instead .
but wagner partly blamed gala organizers , who charge outrageous sums for drinks , such as 9.80 euros for a bottle of mineral water .

but the magistrates ' body says this is " too low " a start point for sentencing .

abh cases can be heard in magistrates ' court or crown court .

in magistrates ' court the offence carries a maximum six months in prison , and at crown court a maximum of five years .

the department store chain revealed on friday it had received a tentative bid approach from an unnamed party .
the company , which operates about 60 department stores in the uk and ireland , said it was not certain a formal bid offer would be made .
several uk newspapers are reporting that apax partners was weighing up a possible bid .
shares boost apax is reportedly pondering an offer of more than £ 300m in the next few days while stressing that negotiations were at a very early phase .
house of fraser was the subject of takeover interest in 2003 when retail entrepreneur tom hunter considered making a bid at 85 pence per share but ultimately backed off .
news of the latest approach pushed the retailer 's shares 4.2 % higher to 118p on friday , giving the business a stock market value of £ 279m .
like many other high street firms , house of fraser has found trading difficult amid tough competition and a slowdown in consumer spending .
the firm made a £ 3m loss in the first six months of the current financial year , but experienced an improvement in sales in the run-up to christmas .
house of fraser has boosted its store portfolio in the past year buying the beatties chain as well as landmark edinburgh store jenners .
it has also closed a number of stores including dickins & jones on london 's regent street .
