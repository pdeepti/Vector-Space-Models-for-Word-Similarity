in this year 's survey of 17,000 people in 15 countries , the organization concluded that " america 's global image has again slipped and support for the war on terrorism has declined , even among close us allies like japan .

" but the world has long become multi-polar ; america is not able to dictate its conditions everywhere .

it 's pretty much like ground zero .

she was driving to an appointment in bonn , singing along to " beautiful day " by her favorite band u2 on the radio .
it really was a beautiful day - the golden september sun slanting through the window , warming her cheeks . her cell phone jolted her out of the musical daydream . " a friend called to tell me that a plane had just crashed into the world trade center , and then another one , " said kelly , a new york state native . she pulled over as she was just too shaken to drive .

" they told us right away to not go anywhere as a group since the terrorists may be targeting americans abroad , " ' brunowsky said . to this day , the federation of american women 's clubs overseas does not publish online where their meetings are held . even though here was not home , many americans were touched by germans ' sympathy at the time .

the foreign policy course the united states chose to take in response to the sept .
11 attacks - the invasion into afghanistan , the war in iraq , allowing torture at abu ghraib and the manner of prisoner detention at guantanamo bay - destroyed the rallying behind her homeland , she believes . a study by the pew research center , in its " global attitudes project , " confirmed this .
in this year 's survey of 17,000 people in 15 countries , the organization concluded that " america 's global image has again slipped and support for the war on terrorism has declined , even among close us allies like japan .
favorable opinions of the united states have fallen in most of the countries surveyed , " the report said . the study continued : " the war in iraq is a continuing drag on opinions of the united states , not only in predominantly muslim countries , but in europe and asia as well . " a n ti-america n ism cycles heike bungert , a north american history professor at the university of bremen , said anti-americanism comes in waves .
right now , she said , the " wave " is higher due to us foreign policy .
she sees it among her students . " the suspicion lurks that the us wants to intervene everywhere , " she said . the then german government 's opposition to the war in iraq in 2003 may have helped anchor that attitude .

american academic francis fukuyama , once close to the neo-conservative movement , distanced himself from the group just before the war . " iraq has become a breeding ground for terror , " he told der spiegel newsmagazine this spring .
" it has stimulated a lot of people to join the resistance and commit themselves to jihad . " others point out that us power and privilege feed anti-americanism .
us undersecretary of state karen hughes 's job is to improve america 's image abroad . " we are a superpower and with that comes some resentment , " she said in a february interview . philosopher andré glucksmann , a frenchman of german-jewish descent , pointed out that " people use the myth of the superpower america to pin the blame onto the country for everything , " he told der spiegel last fall .
" but the world has long become multi-polar ; america is not able to dictate its conditions everywhere . " in fact , bungert , fukayama and glucksmann all believe that it is modernism that has helped fuel frustration , resentment and , ultimately , terrorism .

" a n ti-america n ism cycles heike bungert , a north american history professor at the university of bremen , said anti-americanism comes in waves .
right now , she said , the " wave " is higher due to us foreign policy .
she sees it among her students . " the suspicion lurks that the us wants to intervene everywhere , " she said . the then german government 's opposition to the war in iraq in 2003 may have helped anchor that attitude . " there 's a sense here in germany - and that is a result of our history of world wars - that global problems can and should be worked out through negotiations rather than militarily , " said herbert of the amerika haus , himself a german . the good , the bad a n d the ugly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyday life in iraq : suicide bombers and roadside attacks many leading american analysts believe that the war in iraq has done more harm than good .
american academic francis fukuyama , once close to the neo-conservative movement , distanced himself from the group just before the war . " iraq has become a breeding ground for terror , " he told der spiegel newsmagazine this spring .
" it has stimulated a lot of people to join the resistance and commit themselves to jihad . " others point out that us power and privilege feed anti-americanism .
us undersecretary of state karen hughes 's job is to improve america 's image abroad . " we are a superpower and with that comes some resentment , " she said in a february interview . philosopher andré glucksmann , a frenchman of german-jewish descent , pointed out that " people use the myth of the superpower america to pin the blame onto the country for everything , " he told der spiegel last fall .
" but the world has long become multi-polar ; america is not able to dictate its conditions everywhere . " in fact , bungert , fukayama and glucksmann all believe that it is modernism that has helped fuel frustration , resentment and , ultimately , terrorism . " modernization , or more precisely , the - brutal - westernization of the planet , has sent three-fourths of the world 's population spinning , " glucksmann said . guilt by associatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-iraq war : parisian girl at the us embassy in 2002 germany may have had its wake-up call about its currents of anti-americanism at the start of this year when revelations surfaced that german spies in baghdad had supplied the us military with information during the iraq war . some germans realized that they could no longer be pointing the finger at the us for an erroneous invasion in iraq , when germany itself had dirtied its hands . still , the urge to reproach dies hard .
american carmen pang , a cologne resident , was recently strolling through the city with her husband .
heeding the festive soccer world cup mood , her husband donned his cowboy hat .
as the couple passed by an outdoor café , someone called out " fuck bush . " though carmen had to swallow hard over that one , she said most germans can distinguish between american policy and the country 's people , and that they welcome her here . one might think that americans abroad have a distant stance toward their native country .
au co n traire , some ex-pats say - many feel themselves to be unofficial ambassadors to their country of origin . " it 's so easy to america-bash overseas and distance oneself from it all , " my-linh said .
" but actually , while i do n't defend us foreign politics right now , i find that when i 'm abroad , i 'm quite patriotic and proud to be an american .
i just shut out the america-bashing . " but mary said it is sometimes hard to turn a deaf ear .

last year , ates was named germany 's woman of the year for her unstinting battle for the rights of mainly muslim women . given her reputation for toughness and bravery , ates ' recent announcement that she was closing her practice because she felt threatened has sent shockwaves through the german capital . livi n g with threats , i n timidatio n berlin daily der tagesspiegel reported that ates , who has been insulted and threatened by the husbands and relatives of many turkish women she has represented over the years , decided to wind up her work after another similar incident last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ates has riled up the turkish community with her outspoken criticism the muslim husband of one of her clients , whom ates was representing in divorce proceedings , assaulted his wife and tried to attack ates opposite the courtroom where the case was being heard , the paper wrote . " i 'm withdrawing from professional life as a lawyer , my client is living in a women 's shelter , but the assailant is running around scot-free , " ates told the paper , adding that " my life and that of my young daughter have priority . " a statement on ates ' web site said : " it 's once again clear to me how dangerous my work as a lawyer was and how little i was and still am protected as an individual . " " a lot has to cha n ge " ates has also criticized both politicians and police in failing to provide her support and protection . der tagesspiegel reported that ates had applied for police protection last march after turkish daily hürriyet attacked her in a series of articles for her critical statements about the treatment of women in many turkish families .
but the police refused protection , saying there was no indication of a concrete threat , ates said .
the police however have rejected the allegations . " a lot has to change there , " ates told der tagesspiegel .
" the victim protection law has to be urgently expanded . " the german-turkish lawyer , a member of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- since 2004 , has said that the spd too has n't paid any heed to her concerns . " the spd is still dominated by an immigration policy that plays things down , " ates told the paper , saying that politicians always urged citizens to show more courage .
" that is right , but then you also have to protect people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder of hatun sürücü , a turkish woman , by her brother made headlines last year ates ' outspoken criticism of the treatment of women in turkish families in germany has earned her the ire of both turks as well as many left-wingers in favor of multicultural policies .
ates has consistently slammed politicians for turning a blind eye to problems within immigrant communities under the guise of tolerance and fostering diversity . ates however has said that she will continue giving lectures and interviews to highlight the plight of women in turkish and kurdish communities in germany . a n " alarmi n g sig n " ates ' announcement has sparked outrage among politicians , with many calling for expanding victim protection laws to include women who feel threatened . berlin 's interior minister , erhard körting called it an " alarming sign " and said he had " high respect for ates ' work . " others have called for a signature campaign for ates .
ulrich schellenberg , the chairman of the berlin lawyers ' association , called ates ' resignation " dramatic " and said lawyers " must demonstrate solidarity .

the trend has surprised the author of a study tracking car buying and gas price trends since 2000 . " we really did not expect this high increase in horsepower despite high fuel prices , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer of b & d forecast . some 17 percent of german auto buyers were interested in cars with less than 70 horsepower six years ago .

" they are helping get around the conflicting objectives of more performance without more consumption . " car buyers are turning to diesel engines because they can get similar performance with less fuel .
the market share of diesel engines has climbed to nearly 45 percent since 2000 in germany , according to dudenhöffer 's report . more cars staying in the garage in addition to switching to diesel , germans are also extending the time between fill-ups by driving less , a separate study showed .

" we really did not expect this high increase in horsepower despite high fuel prices , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer of b & d forecast . some 17 percent of german auto buyers were interested in cars with less than 70 horsepower six years ago .
but in 2006 , only 9 percent want the smaller engines .
over the same period of time , sales of cars with between 136 and 190 horsepower doubled to 27 percent , dudenhöffer said . cars are emotional products bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars usually receive excellent care in germany " the automobile is still a very emotional product , and this emotion is expressed in sportiness , " he said , adding that that leads people to make decisions in the car showroom they might not make if they were deciding while standing at a gas pump . the emotional attachment that makes a fast car more than just a way to get from point a to point b can also be seen by the growing percentage of people buying cars with up to 350 horsepower .
though still less than one percent of car buyers , it has doubled over the last six years , even as fuel prices have increased by 33 percent , dudenhöffer said . " automobiles are very valuable to germans , they have a feeling of freedom in the car , " he said . "
a person 's esteem is very closely connected to what they drive . " fuel price still plays a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas prices have made some consider other means of transportation still , germans are not willing to ignore the price of fuel completely and are often turning to diesel instead of gasoline , dudenhöffer added . " by emphasizing diesels over the last few years , manufactures have done a lot to help consumers , " he said .
" they are helping get around the conflicting objectives of more performance without more consumption . " car buyers are turning to diesel engines because they can get similar performance with less fuel .
the market share of diesel engines has climbed to nearly 45 percent since 2000 in germany , according to dudenhöffer 's report . more cars staying in the garage in addition to switching to diesel , germans are also extending the time between fill-ups by driving less , a separate study showed . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of german car makes have plans to introduce new suvs the decreases , however , may not hold , as a spate of compact sport utility vehicles from volkswagen , opel , audi and mercedes hit the german market over the next year , the trend toward more powerful engines is likely to continue for the short-term , dudenhöffer said . but when planning their long-term strategies , german carmakers may not want to overstress the importance of horsepower as changes occur in other markets , dudenhöffer said .

last year , ates was named germany 's woman of the year for her unstinting battle for the rights of mainly muslim women . given her reputation for toughness and bravery , ates ' recent announcement that she was closing her practice because she felt threatened has sent shockwaves through the german capital . livi n g with threats , i n timidatio n berlin daily der tagesspiegel reported that ates , who has been insulted and threatened by the husbands and relatives of many turkish women she has represented over the years , decided to wind up her work after another similar incident last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ates has riled up the turkish community with her outspoken criticism the muslim husband of one of her clients , whom ates was representing in divorce proceedings , assaulted his wife and tried to attack ates opposite the courtroom where the case was being heard , the paper wrote . " i 'm withdrawing from professional life as a lawyer , my client is living in a women 's shelter , but the assailant is running around scot-free , " ates told the paper , adding that " my life and that of my young daughter have priority . " a statement on ates ' web site said : " it 's once again clear to me how dangerous my work as a lawyer was and how little i was and still am protected as an individual . " " a lot has to cha n ge " ates has also criticized both politicians and police in failing to provide her support and protection . der tagesspiegel reported that ates had applied for police protection last march after turkish daily hürriyet attacked her in a series of articles for her critical statements about the treatment of women in many turkish families .
but the police refused protection , saying there was no indication of a concrete threat , ates said .

" it really is something new for me , " ballack said in an interview with welt am so n n tag . " as a family it changed the day we left germany and i am still living in a hotel .
it is not that easy to find something in london .
i know that london is expensive but i am a well paid footballer so i am lucky . " ballack , who led germany to third place at the world cup , was accused of joining chelsea , bankrolled by russian billionaire roman abramovich , for the money but said that was not the major factor . " the main reason to come to england and chelsea was to play with a great team , " ballack said .
" money and the chance to live in a city like london are additional factors .

" i already speak english but really need to improve .
a few players speak with an accent and need to speak more slowly with me .
i can understand the foreigners better as they speak more slowly . " ballack also revealed that his chelsea team-mates heard him sing a german song on his arrival at stamford bridge . " it was recommended that i sing in german as no-one understands it , " he said .
" i did not think it was that bad . " ballack injured his hip on his debut for chelsea in the 2-1 community shield defeat to liverpool but has since recovered and has his eye on trophies .

others say that jail time and heavy fines are the appropriate punishment .
what most agree on is that stronger measures need to be taken against such perpetrators . " a fine that currently runs up to 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 25,600 -rrb- is too low , " gert sonnleitner , president of the german association of farmers , told german tabloid bild .
" the punishment must be drastically increased in order to protect consumers . " sonnleitner wants offenders ' names published and a ban on such firms from doing business again instituted .
green party parliamentary leader bärbel höhn , meanwhile , told bild that she wants the toughest punishment of all - jail time .

they also found up to 40 tons of suspicious duck meat at another bavarian business . some of the meat was more than four years past its due date . authorities were also concerned because one of the companies storing the moldy meat has customers across europe .
authorities said monday that at least 26 companies were supplied with meat recently from the company - in five cases so far , the meat was questionable . meanwhile no charges have yet been filed as authorities continue to test meat at restaurants , stores and food stalls . jail as deterrent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the meat found was four years past its expiration date in the aftermath , there have been calls for stronger laws to ensure that such incidents do n't occur in the future . the only way to do that , according to bavarian consumer protection minister werner schnappauf , is to set an example . " it is impossible to inspect each and every steak or schnitzel , " he told german broadcaster ard .
" so we must then ensure that whoever plays fast and loose with the health of citizens in this way must serve jail time .

i can understand the foreigners better as they speak more slowly . " ballack also revealed that his chelsea team-mates heard him sing a german song on his arrival at stamford bridge . " it was recommended that i sing in german as no-one understands it , " he said .
" i did not think it was that bad . " ballack injured his hip on his debut for chelsea in the 2-1 community shield defeat to liverpool but has since recovered and has his eye on trophies .

that 's no easier to answer than the question of how this politically important region will develop in the future . " it can not be denied that new , radical currents and previously unknown terror groups have surfaced since the horrible events on sept .

it 's often unclear who is actually supporting the terror groups , " said sagie qurqmas , a well-known writer and historian from syria . " since sept .
11 , the west , especially the us , has continued to accuse the arabs of being the source of radicalism and terrorism , " he said . " even if this is true of some arabs , the majority can not be characterized by this minority .

the west 's blanket accusations have only deepened the fissure with the arab world , he said . he named the occupation of iraq , the failure of the palestinian-israeli peace process , and the israeli-lebanese war - " not to mention the west 's ambivalent treatment of fundamental issues like democracy and human rights " - as contributors to the widening rift . until the events on sept .
11 , western democracies had served as role models of secular powers for the arab world , which was seeking to replace the repressive , totalitarian regimes in the region with democratic societies . however , human rights violations in guantanamo bay and abu ghraib , the cia affair in europe and the united states ' unconditional support of israel in its war against the palestinians and lebanese have considerably detracted from the credibility of the us and its european allies in the arab world . doubting democracy " no one here wants to hear anything from the west , " wrote journalist abdel-karim shaheen .

tightened domestic security measures and new anti-terror laws are results of the threat , which has already become apparent in egypt , tunisia , morocco , saudi arabia , jordan , syria and elsewhere . new laws , however , have restricted individual rights even further and hindered democratic reforms .
author and columnist jameel abu hassan said citizens are more than willing to make the compromise . " the people prefer living in a police state than in a country where chaos reigns and blood is spilled , which is the case in iraq under american-british occupation , " said hassan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear the national borders in the middle east will be redrawn by western powers five years after sept .

11 and aftermath sent earthquake through arab world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 rattled not just new york city and the western world , but the middle east as well the terror , war and chaos that have occurred since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks have led to destabilization in the arab world and an ever-widening rift with the west . how has the arab world changed since sept .
11 , 2001 ?
that 's no easier to answer than the question of how this politically important region will develop in the future . " it can not be denied that new , radical currents and previously unknown terror groups have surfaced since the horrible events on sept .
11 .
it 's often unclear who is actually supporting the terror groups , " said sagie qurqmas , a well-known writer and historian from syria . " since sept .
11 , the west , especially the us , has continued to accuse the arabs of being the source of radicalism and terrorism , " he said . " even if this is true of some arabs , the majority can not be characterized by this minority .
radicalism is present in all societies , regardless of religion or nationality . " a deepening divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us tactics have driven moderates into terrorist groups , said qurqmas qurqmas says that the united states ' " failed policy of violence and occupation " has driven many more moderate arabs into the radical camp .
the west 's blanket accusations have only deepened the fissure with the arab world , he said . he named the occupation of iraq , the failure of the palestinian-israeli peace process , and the israeli-lebanese war - " not to mention the west 's ambivalent treatment of fundamental issues like democracy and human rights " - as contributors to the widening rift . until the events on sept .
11 , western democracies had served as role models of secular powers for the arab world , which was seeking to replace the repressive , totalitarian regimes in the region with democratic societies . however , human rights violations in guantanamo bay and abu ghraib , the cia affair in europe and the united states ' unconditional support of israel in its war against the palestinians and lebanese have considerably detracted from the credibility of the us and its european allies in the arab world . doubting democracy " no one here wants to hear anything from the west , " wrote journalist abdel-karim shaheen .
" the leading opinion today is that sermons about western democracy have lost their significance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us presence in iraq has deepend the divide between the west and the middle east what kind of democracy sends in tanks , bombs and fighter jets , asked shaheen , and is worth tens of thousands of lives and the destruction of essential infrastructure ?
the journalist believes that the west is not really interested in democratization , rather in securing oil and other economic markets . a domestic threat on the other hand , the strengthening of radical islamic groups represents a threat to the arab world itself , said both iranian journalist and lawyer najh al-obaidi and syrian journalist atef afif .
tightened domestic security measures and new anti-terror laws are results of the threat , which has already become apparent in egypt , tunisia , morocco , saudi arabia , jordan , syria and elsewhere . new laws , however , have restricted individual rights even further and hindered democratic reforms .
author and columnist jameel abu hassan said citizens are more than willing to make the compromise . " the people prefer living in a police state than in a country where chaos reigns and blood is spilled , which is the case in iraq under american-british occupation , " said hassan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear the national borders in the middle east will be redrawn by western powers five years after sept .
11 , 2001 , the future of the arab world is alarming .
the peace process in palestine has come to a dead end , iraq is on the brink of a civil war , and the perspectives in lebanon after the recent war are across the board . fear of new borders the people in the region fear that the us may redraw the national borders in the arab world , which us foreign minister condoleezza rice proposed during the war in lebanon , and try to impose the new divisions with military force together with its allies , said both atef afif and lebanese journalist ghassn abu hamad . the fear is that the territories would be distributed according to religious groups , which would then fight against each other ad infinitum , said the two journalists . nevertheless , despite crisis and irritation , " the arab world and the western world are dependent on each other , " said hamad .

others in the country welcomed the german head of state 's remarks . poland 's conservative premier , jaroslaw kaczynski , criticized köhler 's appearance at the annual remembrance day for the 12 million germans who fled or were expelled from eastern europe after world war ii . he called köhler 's speech " one of these unsettling events that have taken place recently in germany . " speaking to some 2,000 guests of the league of german expellees , köhler made an appeal for increased dialogue within a greater european context .
he recognized the concerns that have sprung up in poland , particularly following the opening of a controversial exhibit on german and other expellees in berlin in early august . " we should n't ignore these concerns , " he said .
" we should take them seriously , even if we consider them unfounded .
there is no doubt what the cause of escape and expulsion was : the unjust national-socialist regime and world war ii , which germany started .

the event recalls the fate of germans who fled from the soviet army when world war ii ended , or were expelled from former german territories when europe 's borders were redrawn following the war . kaczynski was referring to the league when he said , " there is a large government-supported group in germany that constantly brings up the polish territories that used to belong to germany . " if there were a similar organization in poland that demanded the return of parts of the ukraine , belarus or lithuania , warsaw would face serious political consequences , added kaczynski . " we just want the principle of symmetry to be applied here so that everyone is treated the same , " he said . köhler said that germany 's former territories to the east were part of his country 's cultural heritage , even if irrevocably no longer part of germany and that the culture and history of the expellees was part of german identity . kaczy n ski 's opi n io n n ot the o n ly o n e i n pola n d according to a monday article in the warsaw daily gazeta wyborcza , kaczynski 's statements may not be representative of the polish media or his country 's population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach has advocated for a permanent expellee center in berlin köhler 's words " were positive , from the polish perspective , " wrote the paper , because " he began with sept .

others in the country welcomed the german head of state 's remarks . poland 's conservative premier , jaroslaw kaczynski , criticized köhler 's appearance at the annual remembrance day for the 12 million germans who fled or were expelled from eastern europe after world war ii . he called köhler 's speech " one of these unsettling events that have taken place recently in germany . " speaking to some 2,000 guests of the league of german expellees , köhler made an appeal for increased dialogue within a greater european context .
he recognized the concerns that have sprung up in poland , particularly following the opening of a controversial exhibit on german and other expellees in berlin in early august . " we should n't ignore these concerns , " he said .
" we should take them seriously , even if we consider them unfounded .
there is no doubt what the cause of escape and expulsion was : the unjust national-socialist regime and world war ii , which germany started .

the event recalls the fate of germans who fled from the soviet army when world war ii ended , or were expelled from former german territories when europe 's borders were redrawn following the war . kaczynski was referring to the league when he said , " there is a large government-supported group in germany that constantly brings up the polish territories that used to belong to germany . " if there were a similar organization in poland that demanded the return of parts of the ukraine , belarus or lithuania , warsaw would face serious political consequences , added kaczynski . " we just want the principle of symmetry to be applied here so that everyone is treated the same , " he said . köhler said that germany 's former territories to the east were part of his country 's cultural heritage , even if irrevocably no longer part of germany and that the culture and history of the expellees was part of german identity . kaczy n ski 's opi n io n n ot the o n ly o n e i n pola n d according to a monday article in the warsaw daily gazeta wyborcza , kaczynski 's statements may not be representative of the polish media or his country 's population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach has advocated for a permanent expellee center in berlin köhler 's words " were positive , from the polish perspective , " wrote the paper , because " he began with sept .

last year , ates was named germany 's woman of the year for her unstinting battle for the rights of mainly muslim women . given her reputation for toughness and bravery , ates ' recent announcement that she was closing her practice because she felt threatened has sent shockwaves through the german capital . livi n g with threats , i n timidatio n berlin daily der tagesspiegel reported that ates , who has been insulted and threatened by the husbands and relatives of many turkish women she has represented over the years , decided to wind up her work after another similar incident last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ates has riled up the turkish community with her outspoken criticism the muslim husband of one of her clients , whom ates was representing in divorce proceedings , assaulted his wife and tried to attack ates opposite the courtroom where the case was being heard , the paper wrote . " i 'm withdrawing from professional life as a lawyer , my client is living in a women 's shelter , but the assailant is running around scot-free , " ates told the paper , adding that " my life and that of my young daughter have priority . " a statement on ates ' web site said : " it 's once again clear to me how dangerous my work as a lawyer was and how little i was and still am protected as an individual . " " a lot has to cha n ge " ates has also criticized both politicians and police in failing to provide her support and protection . der tagesspiegel reported that ates had applied for police protection last march after turkish daily hürriyet attacked her in a series of articles for her critical statements about the treatment of women in many turkish families .
but the police refused protection , saying there was no indication of a concrete threat , ates said .
the police however have rejected the allegations . " a lot has to change there , " ates told der tagesspiegel .
" the victim protection law has to be urgently expanded . " the german-turkish lawyer , a member of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- since 2004 , has said that the spd too has n't paid any heed to her concerns . " the spd is still dominated by an immigration policy that plays things down , " ates told the paper , saying that politicians always urged citizens to show more courage .
" that is right , but then you also have to protect people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder of hatun sürücü , a turkish woman , by her brother made headlines last year ates ' outspoken criticism of the treatment of women in turkish families in germany has earned her the ire of both turks as well as many left-wingers in favor of multicultural policies .
ates has consistently slammed politicians for turning a blind eye to problems within immigrant communities under the guise of tolerance and fostering diversity . ates however has said that she will continue giving lectures and interviews to highlight the plight of women in turkish and kurdish communities in germany . a n " alarmi n g sig n " ates ' announcement has sparked outrage among politicians , with many calling for expanding victim protection laws to include women who feel threatened . berlin 's interior minister , erhard körting called it an " alarming sign " and said he had " high respect for ates ' work . " others have called for a signature campaign for ates .
ulrich schellenberg , the chairman of the berlin lawyers ' association , called ates ' resignation " dramatic " and said lawyers " must demonstrate solidarity .

last year , ates was named germany 's woman of the year for her unstinting battle for the rights of mainly muslim women . given her reputation for toughness and bravery , ates ' recent announcement that she was closing her practice because she felt threatened has sent shockwaves through the german capital . livi n g with threats , i n timidatio n berlin daily der tagesspiegel reported that ates , who has been insulted and threatened by the husbands and relatives of many turkish women she has represented over the years , decided to wind up her work after another similar incident last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ates has riled up the turkish community with her outspoken criticism the muslim husband of one of her clients , whom ates was representing in divorce proceedings , assaulted his wife and tried to attack ates opposite the courtroom where the case was being heard , the paper wrote .

" " a lot has to cha n ge " ates has also criticized both politicians and police in failing to provide her support and protection . der tagesspiegel reported that ates had applied for police protection last march after turkish daily hürriyet attacked her in a series of articles for her critical statements about the treatment of women in many turkish families .
but the police refused protection , saying there was no indication of a concrete threat , ates said .
the police however have rejected the allegations . " a lot has to change there , " ates told der tagesspiegel .

" that is right , but then you also have to protect people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder of hatun sürücü , a turkish woman , by her brother made headlines last year ates ' outspoken criticism of the treatment of women in turkish families in germany has earned her the ire of both turks as well as many left-wingers in favor of multicultural policies .

" the ant-terror database will be a central component in effectively fighting terrorism , " police union head konrad freiberg said on monday . deep reservatio n s about database though the current grand coalition made up of social democrats and the conservatives agreed on setting up a central anti-terrorism database last year , the two parties have differed on its exact shape and reach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a proliferation of security agencies on account of its federal structure the idea is that all police and intelligence agencies , both at the federal and national level , would gather information about terror suspects and terrorist organizations in a central database that would be accessible to all crime-fighting agencies .
at present , germany 's 37 agencies do that separately .
the central anti-terrorism database would also contain information about banking , telecommunication and internet information regarding the suspects . in addition to problems stemming from germany 's federal structure , critics had feared the database would create more bureacracy as well as erode people 's privacy . germany 's social democrats and the opposition greens and the left party also expressed concerns that easily accessible information on terrorism suspects could be misused as well as create legal problems given the differing information-gathering methods of the police and intelligence agencies . " a complete central anti-terrorism database would mean that we 'd get a gigantic flood of data that you 'd no longer be able to get a grip on , " said claudia roth , green party chairwoman .
" besides , we 'd have the problem that intelligence information would no longer be protected . " should religio n be i n cluded ? monday 's compromise foresees a two-part database .
one will contain the identity of the terror suspect while the other will hold details about his religion , travel abroad , possession of weapons etc . sharp differences earlier also centered on whether a suspect 's religion should be included in the database . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- pleaded in favor of the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are split on including the religion of terror suspects in the database " naturally we should only collect and network data that is really relevant to fighting danger and is really necessary , " schäuble told the magazine super illu .
" and i believe that religion and profession do belong there . " however , politicians from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party were against the measure , arguing that it would violate the constitution . experts war n of hysteria politicians have also warned that the threat of terrorism in germany would increase through a possible deployment of the german army to southern lebanon . " the german army might be controlling weapons smuggling to hezbollah by sea , " said bavarian interior minister günther beckstein .
" the terror threat in germany will rise due to that . " on the eve of the conference , german chancellor angela merkel stressed that the state had to play a more active role in beefing up germany 's defenses . " we need more security , we need more state , " merkel said a party conference , adding it was apparent that video surveillance needed to be expanded in germany after the failed bomb attacks on passenger trains in dortmund and koblenz in july . however , germany 's federal data protection commissioner peter schaar has warned of security paranoia and hysteria , saying he is concerned that germany was " increasingly developing into a surveillance-obsessed society . " i consider the aimless gathering and processing of data not only inefficient , but also a legally , highly problematic path , " schaar said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts say germany needs better tools to fight terror the foiling of potentially devastating bomb attacks in britain has germany reviewing its own fight against terror .

others say that jail time and heavy fines are the appropriate punishment .
what most agree on is that stronger measures need to be taken against such perpetrators . " a fine that currently runs up to 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 25,600 -rrb- is too low , " gert sonnleitner , president of the german association of farmers , told german tabloid bild .
" the punishment must be drastically increased in order to protect consumers . " sonnleitner wants offenders ' names published and a ban on such firms from doing business again instituted .
green party parliamentary leader bärbel höhn , meanwhile , told bild that she wants the toughest punishment of all - jail time . " the black sheep of the meat industry belong in prison , " she said . years out of date bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are still investigating a number of bavarian meat dealers german authorities last week confiscated 10 tons of rotten meat from an unnamed munich company 's meat locker .
they also found up to 40 tons of suspicious duck meat at another bavarian business . some of the meat was more than four years past its due date . authorities were also concerned because one of the companies storing the moldy meat has customers across europe .
authorities said monday that at least 26 companies were supplied with meat recently from the company - in five cases so far , the meat was questionable . meanwhile no charges have yet been filed as authorities continue to test meat at restaurants , stores and food stalls . jail as deterrent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the meat found was four years past its expiration date in the aftermath , there have been calls for stronger laws to ensure that such incidents do n't occur in the future . the only way to do that , according to bavarian consumer protection minister werner schnappauf , is to set an example . " it is impossible to inspect each and every steak or schnitzel , " he told german broadcaster ard .
" so we must then ensure that whoever plays fast and loose with the health of citizens in this way must serve jail time .

11 terrorist attacks have led to destabilization in the arab world and an ever-widening rift with the west . how has the arab world changed since sept .
11 , 2001 ?
that 's no easier to answer than the question of how this politically important region will develop in the future . " it can not be denied that new , radical currents and previously unknown terror groups have surfaced since the horrible events on sept .
11 .
it 's often unclear who is actually supporting the terror groups , " said sagie qurqmas , a well-known writer and historian from syria . " since sept .
11 , the west , especially the us , has continued to accuse the arabs of being the source of radicalism and terrorism , " he said . " even if this is true of some arabs , the majority can not be characterized by this minority .

" a deepening divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us tactics have driven moderates into terrorist groups , said qurqmas qurqmas says that the united states ' " failed policy of violence and occupation " has driven many more moderate arabs into the radical camp .
the west 's blanket accusations have only deepened the fissure with the arab world , he said . he named the occupation of iraq , the failure of the palestinian-israeli peace process , and the israeli-lebanese war - " not to mention the west 's ambivalent treatment of fundamental issues like democracy and human rights " - as contributors to the widening rift . until the events on sept .
11 , western democracies had served as role models of secular powers for the arab world , which was seeking to replace the repressive , totalitarian regimes in the region with democratic societies . however , human rights violations in guantanamo bay and abu ghraib , the cia affair in europe and the united states ' unconditional support of israel in its war against the palestinians and lebanese have considerably detracted from the credibility of the us and its european allies in the arab world . doubting democracy " no one here wants to hear anything from the west , " wrote journalist abdel-karim shaheen .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us presence in iraq has deepend the divide between the west and the middle east what kind of democracy sends in tanks , bombs and fighter jets , asked shaheen , and is worth tens of thousands of lives and the destruction of essential infrastructure ?
the journalist believes that the west is not really interested in democratization , rather in securing oil and other economic markets . a domestic threat on the other hand , the strengthening of radical islamic groups represents a threat to the arab world itself , said both iranian journalist and lawyer najh al-obaidi and syrian journalist atef afif .
tightened domestic security measures and new anti-terror laws are results of the threat , which has already become apparent in egypt , tunisia , morocco , saudi arabia , jordan , syria and elsewhere . new laws , however , have restricted individual rights even further and hindered democratic reforms .
author and columnist jameel abu hassan said citizens are more than willing to make the compromise . " the people prefer living in a police state than in a country where chaos reigns and blood is spilled , which is the case in iraq under american-british occupation , " said hassan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear the national borders in the middle east will be redrawn by western powers five years after sept .

others say that jail time and heavy fines are the appropriate punishment .
what most agree on is that stronger measures need to be taken against such perpetrators . " a fine that currently runs up to 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 25,600 -rrb- is too low , " gert sonnleitner , president of the german association of farmers , told german tabloid bild .
" the punishment must be drastically increased in order to protect consumers . " sonnleitner wants offenders ' names published and a ban on such firms from doing business again instituted .
green party parliamentary leader bärbel höhn , meanwhile , told bild that she wants the toughest punishment of all - jail time . " the black sheep of the meat industry belong in prison , " she said . years out of date bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are still investigating a number of bavarian meat dealers german authorities last week confiscated 10 tons of rotten meat from an unnamed munich company 's meat locker .
they also found up to 40 tons of suspicious duck meat at another bavarian business . some of the meat was more than four years past its due date . authorities were also concerned because one of the companies storing the moldy meat has customers across europe .
authorities said monday that at least 26 companies were supplied with meat recently from the company - in five cases so far , the meat was questionable . meanwhile no charges have yet been filed as authorities continue to test meat at restaurants , stores and food stalls . jail as deterrent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the meat found was four years past its expiration date in the aftermath , there have been calls for stronger laws to ensure that such incidents do n't occur in the future . the only way to do that , according to bavarian consumer protection minister werner schnappauf , is to set an example . " it is impossible to inspect each and every steak or schnitzel , " he told german broadcaster ard .
" so we must then ensure that whoever plays fast and loose with the health of citizens in this way must serve jail time .

tightened domestic security measures and new anti-terror laws are results of the threat , which has already become apparent in egypt , tunisia , morocco , saudi arabia , jordan , syria and elsewhere . new laws , however , have restricted individual rights even further and hindered democratic reforms .
author and columnist jameel abu hassan said citizens are more than willing to make the compromise . " the people prefer living in a police state than in a country where chaos reigns and blood is spilled , which is the case in iraq under american-british occupation , " said hassan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear the national borders in the middle east will be redrawn by western powers five years after sept .

" ' ' the world cup is awarded to a country six years in advance , so there is a bidding momentum and an awareness that is generated , " radnedge said . bildunterschrift : the allianz arena in munich was built specifically for soccer events to cater to the world cup crowds , germany had to provide the facilities to cope with such a large-scale sporting event .

' ' if germany has the capacity to hold such a big event , then they will obviously have the capacity to do the same for more large events .

' ' in the past , the largest hockey event in germany sold 28,000 tickets and we have sold nearly three times that amount for this event , " he said .
' ' we have had many international and domestic visitors and enormous media coverage . " abel observed that germany has attracted a larger than usual number of visiting foreign reporters , spectators and sporting representatives because ' ' the -lrb- soccer -rrb- world cup is just as important as the olympics . " more international events for germany in the future ? newcombe expects there will be more sporting events , although he does not expect they will just come ' ' flooding in . " ' ' it 's no surprise that if you put on these big events then more will be happening in the future and i think germany has set itself up well , " newcombe said . radnedge thinks it is a confidence-building exercise for german domestic sports , who have become more willing to ' ' put themselves out into the international community " following events such as the world cup . rachel ryan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup scores goal for german economy since the world cup ended , host nation germany has been counting the immediate economic benefits for businesses during the month-long event .

but they 're not upset enough to stop buying cars with bigger motors and more horsepower . maybe it 's a desire to take full advantage of those freeways with no speed limits ; maybe it 's a kind of compensation for other perceived shortcomings or mid-life crises - either way germans are flocking towards new cars with more muscular , and thirstier , engines .
the trend has surprised the author of a study tracking car buying and gas price trends since 2000 . " we really did not expect this high increase in horsepower despite high fuel prices , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer of b & d forecast . some 17 percent of german auto buyers were interested in cars with less than 70 horsepower six years ago .
but in 2006 , only 9 percent want the smaller engines .
over the same period of time , sales of cars with between 136 and 190 horsepower doubled to 27 percent , dudenhöffer said . cars are emotional products bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars usually receive excellent care in germany " the automobile is still a very emotional product , and this emotion is expressed in sportiness , " he said , adding that that leads people to make decisions in the car showroom they might not make if they were deciding while standing at a gas pump . the emotional attachment that makes a fast car more than just a way to get from point a to point b can also be seen by the growing percentage of people buying cars with up to 350 horsepower .
though still less than one percent of car buyers , it has doubled over the last six years , even as fuel prices have increased by 33 percent , dudenhöffer said . " automobiles are very valuable to germans , they have a feeling of freedom in the car , " he said . "
a person 's esteem is very closely connected to what they drive . " fuel price still plays a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas prices have made some consider other means of transportation still , germans are not willing to ignore the price of fuel completely and are often turning to diesel instead of gasoline , dudenhöffer added . " by emphasizing diesels over the last few years , manufactures have done a lot to help consumers , " he said .
" they are helping get around the conflicting objectives of more performance without more consumption . " car buyers are turning to diesel engines because they can get similar performance with less fuel .
the market share of diesel engines has climbed to nearly 45 percent since 2000 in germany , according to dudenhöffer 's report . more cars staying in the garage in addition to switching to diesel , germans are also extending the time between fill-ups by driving less , a separate study showed . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of german car makes have plans to introduce new suvs the decreases , however , may not hold , as a spate of compact sport utility vehicles from volkswagen , opel , audi and mercedes hit the german market over the next year , the trend toward more powerful engines is likely to continue for the short-term , dudenhöffer said . but when planning their long-term strategies , german carmakers may not want to overstress the importance of horsepower as changes occur in other markets , dudenhöffer said . " in the usa we are seeing that all the big suvs are turning into the americans ' slow sellers , " he said .

he recognized the concerns that have sprung up in poland , particularly following the opening of a controversial exhibit on german and other expellees in berlin in early august . " we should n't ignore these concerns , " he said .

others in the country welcomed the german head of state 's remarks . poland 's conservative premier , jaroslaw kaczynski , criticized köhler 's appearance at the annual remembrance day for the 12 million germans who fled or were expelled from eastern europe after world war ii . he called köhler 's speech " one of these unsettling events that have taken place recently in germany . " speaking to some 2,000 guests of the league of german expellees , köhler made an appeal for increased dialogue within a greater european context .
he recognized the concerns that have sprung up in poland , particularly following the opening of a controversial exhibit on german and other expellees in berlin in early august . " we should n't ignore these concerns , " he said .
" we should take them seriously , even if we consider them unfounded .
there is no doubt what the cause of escape and expulsion was : the unjust national-socialist regime and world war ii , which germany started . " expellees " part of germa n ide n tity " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski , right , was appointed pm by his twin brother , president lech kaczynski the league of german expellees , chaired by erika steinbach from the conservative party cdu , has celebrated " home day " since 1950 .
the event recalls the fate of germans who fled from the soviet army when world war ii ended , or were expelled from former german territories when europe 's borders were redrawn following the war . kaczynski was referring to the league when he said , " there is a large government-supported group in germany that constantly brings up the polish territories that used to belong to germany . " if there were a similar organization in poland that demanded the return of parts of the ukraine , belarus or lithuania , warsaw would face serious political consequences , added kaczynski . " we just want the principle of symmetry to be applied here so that everyone is treated the same , " he said . köhler said that germany 's former territories to the east were part of his country 's cultural heritage , even if irrevocably no longer part of germany and that the culture and history of the expellees was part of german identity . kaczy n ski 's opi n io n n ot the o n ly o n e i n pola n d according to a monday article in the warsaw daily gazeta wyborcza , kaczynski 's statements may not be representative of the polish media or his country 's population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach has advocated for a permanent expellee center in berlin köhler 's words " were positive , from the polish perspective , " wrote the paper , because " he began with sept .
1 , 1939 as the beginning of the expulsions .
secondly , he emphasized the integration of the expellees and not remembrance of german suffering . " hitler 's army invaded poland on sept .
1 , 1939 , starting world war ii . köhler also mentioned the danzig declaration , signed in october 2003 by his predecessor johannes rau and poland 's former president aleksander kwasniewski .
the document represents a formal withdrawal of compensation claims and mutual accusations of guilt between the neighboring countries . a summer of te n sio n communication between polish and german government leaders has been taut this summer and emotions have run high after a series of toe-stepping events . the string of offending incidents include a satire in a german newspaper that called polish president lech kaczynski " a potato , " the berlin exhibition on expulsion , and günter grass ' public confession of membership in the feared nazi waffen ss . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin exhibition on postwar expulsions opens amid protests a controversial exhibition which opened in berlin thursday on the expulsions of germans and other europeans after 1945 has been strongly condemned by polish leaders .

" germany wants a letter that should be sent to the unifil and this is something that is in the process , we really have to do it , " siniora told reporters .

" in this case , it is better to do things properly than to proceed in a hurry , " she said .

germany needed a request to the un from lebanon , a " robust mandate " from the world body and the approval of the lower house of parliament for the mission , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told reporters on sunday .
no ground troops so far , berlin has ruled out sending ground troops to lebanon , but germany is expected to assume the naval command of the bolstered un force that must police a fragile ceasefire between israel and hezbollah in southern lebanon and stop the flow of arms to the radical shiite organization .
the country is expected to contribute up to 3,000 sea and air troops .
putting an international force in place on lebanon 's coast is important for lebanese businesses as an israeli sea blockade has stopped goods from arriving in lebanese ports since july , lebanese business representatives told afp .
despite calls from the european union and united nations , israel said it would not lift the blockade until an international force is put in place to stop weapons smuggling to hezbollah fighters .

they will be joined by a 15,000-strong lebanese army force to prevent hezbollah attacks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.09.2006 small cars take a back seat for german car buyers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even on the autobahn , a bigger engine does n't guarantee a quick arrival even after gas prices hit a six-month low in august , germans are still unhappy when it comes time to fill up .
but they 're not upset enough to stop buying cars with bigger motors and more horsepower . maybe it 's a desire to take full advantage of those freeways with no speed limits ; maybe it 's a kind of compensation for other perceived shortcomings or mid-life crises - either way germans are flocking towards new cars with more muscular , and thirstier , engines .
the trend has surprised the author of a study tracking car buying and gas price trends since 2000 . " we really did not expect this high increase in horsepower despite high fuel prices , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer of b & d forecast . some 17 percent of german auto buyers were interested in cars with less than 70 horsepower six years ago .
but in 2006 , only 9 percent want the smaller engines .
over the same period of time , sales of cars with between 136 and 190 horsepower doubled to 27 percent , dudenhöffer said . cars are emotional products bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars usually receive excellent care in germany " the automobile is still a very emotional product , and this emotion is expressed in sportiness , " he said , adding that that leads people to make decisions in the car showroom they might not make if they were deciding while standing at a gas pump . the emotional attachment that makes a fast car more than just a way to get from point a to point b can also be seen by the growing percentage of people buying cars with up to 350 horsepower .
though still less than one percent of car buyers , it has doubled over the last six years , even as fuel prices have increased by 33 percent , dudenhöffer said . " automobiles are very valuable to germans , they have a feeling of freedom in the car , " he said . "
a person 's esteem is very closely connected to what they drive . " fuel price still plays a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas prices have made some consider other means of transportation still , germans are not willing to ignore the price of fuel completely and are often turning to diesel instead of gasoline , dudenhöffer added . " by emphasizing diesels over the last few years , manufactures have done a lot to help consumers , " he said .
" they are helping get around the conflicting objectives of more performance without more consumption . " car buyers are turning to diesel engines because they can get similar performance with less fuel .
the market share of diesel engines has climbed to nearly 45 percent since 2000 in germany , according to dudenhöffer 's report . more cars staying in the garage in addition to switching to diesel , germans are also extending the time between fill-ups by driving less , a separate study showed . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of german car makes have plans to introduce new suvs the decreases , however , may not hold , as a spate of compact sport utility vehicles from volkswagen , opel , audi and mercedes hit the german market over the next year , the trend toward more powerful engines is likely to continue for the short-term , dudenhöffer said . but when planning their long-term strategies , german carmakers may not want to overstress the importance of horsepower as changes occur in other markets , dudenhöffer said . " in the usa we are seeing that all the big suvs are turning into the americans ' slow sellers , " he said .

but they 're not upset enough to stop buying cars with bigger motors and more horsepower . maybe it 's a desire to take full advantage of those freeways with no speed limits ; maybe it 's a kind of compensation for other perceived shortcomings or mid-life crises - either way germans are flocking towards new cars with more muscular , and thirstier , engines .
the trend has surprised the author of a study tracking car buying and gas price trends since 2000 . " we really did not expect this high increase in horsepower despite high fuel prices , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer of b & d forecast . some 17 percent of german auto buyers were interested in cars with less than 70 horsepower six years ago .
but in 2006 , only 9 percent want the smaller engines .
over the same period of time , sales of cars with between 136 and 190 horsepower doubled to 27 percent , dudenhöffer said . cars are emotional products bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars usually receive excellent care in germany " the automobile is still a very emotional product , and this emotion is expressed in sportiness , " he said , adding that that leads people to make decisions in the car showroom they might not make if they were deciding while standing at a gas pump . the emotional attachment that makes a fast car more than just a way to get from point a to point b can also be seen by the growing percentage of people buying cars with up to 350 horsepower .
though still less than one percent of car buyers , it has doubled over the last six years , even as fuel prices have increased by 33 percent , dudenhöffer said . " automobiles are very valuable to germans , they have a feeling of freedom in the car , " he said . "
a person 's esteem is very closely connected to what they drive . " fuel price still plays a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas prices have made some consider other means of transportation still , germans are not willing to ignore the price of fuel completely and are often turning to diesel instead of gasoline , dudenhöffer added . " by emphasizing diesels over the last few years , manufactures have done a lot to help consumers , " he said .
" they are helping get around the conflicting objectives of more performance without more consumption . " car buyers are turning to diesel engines because they can get similar performance with less fuel .
the market share of diesel engines has climbed to nearly 45 percent since 2000 in germany , according to dudenhöffer 's report . more cars staying in the garage in addition to switching to diesel , germans are also extending the time between fill-ups by driving less , a separate study showed . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of german car makes have plans to introduce new suvs the decreases , however , may not hold , as a spate of compact sport utility vehicles from volkswagen , opel , audi and mercedes hit the german market over the next year , the trend toward more powerful engines is likely to continue for the short-term , dudenhöffer said . but when planning their long-term strategies , german carmakers may not want to overstress the importance of horsepower as changes occur in other markets , dudenhöffer said .

" germany wants a letter that should be sent to the unifil and this is something that is in the process , we really have to do it , " siniora told reporters .
doing things properly german chancellor angela merkel on sunday said berlin 's offer of sending its navy to help patrol the lebanese coast still stood but that the country wanted to follow the proper procedures for the sake of its soldiers .
" in this case , it is better to do things properly than to proceed in a hurry , " she said .
" no german government will take a risk that it not justified . "
berlin had been scheduled to receive an official request on sunday and to announce the number of troops it plans to send to lebanon later that day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is much to repair in bombed out beirut a special cabinet sitting to finalize other details of the mission was scheduled for monday , but has also been postponed .
germany needed a request to the un from lebanon , a " robust mandate " from the world body and the approval of the lower house of parliament for the mission , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told reporters on sunday .
no ground troops so far , berlin has ruled out sending ground troops to lebanon , but germany is expected to assume the naval command of the bolstered un force that must police a fragile ceasefire between israel and hezbollah in southern lebanon and stop the flow of arms to the radical shiite organization .
the country is expected to contribute up to 3,000 sea and air troops .

others say that jail time and heavy fines are the appropriate punishment .
what most agree on is that stronger measures need to be taken against such perpetrators . " a fine that currently runs up to 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 25,600 -rrb- is too low , " gert sonnleitner , president of the german association of farmers , told german tabloid bild .
" the punishment must be drastically increased in order to protect consumers . " sonnleitner wants offenders ' names published and a ban on such firms from doing business again instituted .
green party parliamentary leader bärbel höhn , meanwhile , told bild that she wants the toughest punishment of all - jail time . " the black sheep of the meat industry belong in prison , " she said . years out of date bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are still investigating a number of bavarian meat dealers german authorities last week confiscated 10 tons of rotten meat from an unnamed munich company 's meat locker .
they also found up to 40 tons of suspicious duck meat at another bavarian business . some of the meat was more than four years past its due date . authorities were also concerned because one of the companies storing the moldy meat has customers across europe .
authorities said monday that at least 26 companies were supplied with meat recently from the company - in five cases so far , the meat was questionable . meanwhile no charges have yet been filed as authorities continue to test meat at restaurants , stores and food stalls . jail as deterrent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the meat found was four years past its expiration date in the aftermath , there have been calls for stronger laws to ensure that such incidents do n't occur in the future . the only way to do that , according to bavarian consumer protection minister werner schnappauf , is to set an example . " it is impossible to inspect each and every steak or schnitzel , " he told german broadcaster ard .
" so we must then ensure that whoever plays fast and loose with the health of citizens in this way must serve jail time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.09.2006 small cars take a back seat for german car buyers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even on the autobahn , a bigger engine does n't guarantee a quick arrival even after gas prices hit a six-month low in august , germans are still unhappy when it comes time to fill up .
but they 're not upset enough to stop buying cars with bigger motors and more horsepower . maybe it 's a desire to take full advantage of those freeways with no speed limits ; maybe it 's a kind of compensation for other perceived shortcomings or mid-life crises - either way germans are flocking towards new cars with more muscular , and thirstier , engines .
the trend has surprised the author of a study tracking car buying and gas price trends since 2000 . " we really did not expect this high increase in horsepower despite high fuel prices , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer of b & d forecast . some 17 percent of german auto buyers were interested in cars with less than 70 horsepower six years ago .
but in 2006 , only 9 percent want the smaller engines .
over the same period of time , sales of cars with between 136 and 190 horsepower doubled to 27 percent , dudenhöffer said . cars are emotional products bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars usually receive excellent care in germany " the automobile is still a very emotional product , and this emotion is expressed in sportiness , " he said , adding that that leads people to make decisions in the car showroom they might not make if they were deciding while standing at a gas pump . the emotional attachment that makes a fast car more than just a way to get from point a to point b can also be seen by the growing percentage of people buying cars with up to 350 horsepower .
though still less than one percent of car buyers , it has doubled over the last six years , even as fuel prices have increased by 33 percent , dudenhöffer said . " automobiles are very valuable to germans , they have a feeling of freedom in the car , " he said . "
a person 's esteem is very closely connected to what they drive . " fuel price still plays a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas prices have made some consider other means of transportation still , germans are not willing to ignore the price of fuel completely and are often turning to diesel instead of gasoline , dudenhöffer added . " by emphasizing diesels over the last few years , manufactures have done a lot to help consumers , " he said .
" they are helping get around the conflicting objectives of more performance without more consumption . " car buyers are turning to diesel engines because they can get similar performance with less fuel .
the market share of diesel engines has climbed to nearly 45 percent since 2000 in germany , according to dudenhöffer 's report . more cars staying in the garage in addition to switching to diesel , germans are also extending the time between fill-ups by driving less , a separate study showed . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of german car makes have plans to introduce new suvs the decreases , however , may not hold , as a spate of compact sport utility vehicles from volkswagen , opel , audi and mercedes hit the german market over the next year , the trend toward more powerful engines is likely to continue for the short-term , dudenhöffer said . but when planning their long-term strategies , german carmakers may not want to overstress the importance of horsepower as changes occur in other markets , dudenhöffer said . " in the usa we are seeing that all the big suvs are turning into the americans ' slow sellers , " he said .
" this is a very high economic burden for general motors , ford and chrysler .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.09.2006 small cars take a back seat for german car buyers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even on the autobahn , a bigger engine does n't guarantee a quick arrival even after gas prices hit a six-month low in august , germans are still unhappy when it comes time to fill up .
but they 're not upset enough to stop buying cars with bigger motors and more horsepower . maybe it 's a desire to take full advantage of those freeways with no speed limits ; maybe it 's a kind of compensation for other perceived shortcomings or mid-life crises - either way germans are flocking towards new cars with more muscular , and thirstier , engines .
the trend has surprised the author of a study tracking car buying and gas price trends since 2000 . " we really did not expect this high increase in horsepower despite high fuel prices , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer of b & d forecast . some 17 percent of german auto buyers were interested in cars with less than 70 horsepower six years ago .
but in 2006 , only 9 percent want the smaller engines .
over the same period of time , sales of cars with between 136 and 190 horsepower doubled to 27 percent , dudenhöffer said . cars are emotional products bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars usually receive excellent care in germany " the automobile is still a very emotional product , and this emotion is expressed in sportiness , " he said , adding that that leads people to make decisions in the car showroom they might not make if they were deciding while standing at a gas pump . the emotional attachment that makes a fast car more than just a way to get from point a to point b can also be seen by the growing percentage of people buying cars with up to 350 horsepower .
though still less than one percent of car buyers , it has doubled over the last six years , even as fuel prices have increased by 33 percent , dudenhöffer said . " automobiles are very valuable to germans , they have a feeling of freedom in the car , " he said . "
a person 's esteem is very closely connected to what they drive . " fuel price still plays a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas prices have made some consider other means of transportation still , germans are not willing to ignore the price of fuel completely and are often turning to diesel instead of gasoline , dudenhöffer added . " by emphasizing diesels over the last few years , manufactures have done a lot to help consumers , " he said .
" they are helping get around the conflicting objectives of more performance without more consumption . " car buyers are turning to diesel engines because they can get similar performance with less fuel .
the market share of diesel engines has climbed to nearly 45 percent since 2000 in germany , according to dudenhöffer 's report . more cars staying in the garage in addition to switching to diesel , germans are also extending the time between fill-ups by driving less , a separate study showed . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of german car makes have plans to introduce new suvs the decreases , however , may not hold , as a spate of compact sport utility vehicles from volkswagen , opel , audi and mercedes hit the german market over the next year , the trend toward more powerful engines is likely to continue for the short-term , dudenhöffer said . but when planning their long-term strategies , german carmakers may not want to overstress the importance of horsepower as changes occur in other markets , dudenhöffer said . " in the usa we are seeing that all the big suvs are turning into the americans ' slow sellers , " he said .
" this is a very high economic burden for general motors , ford and chrysler .

11 changed the world more than images : sept .
11 as a key event for online media daily life has n't changed for americans since sept .
11 germany 's solidarity with us waning after sept .
11 " on that day , i just ran " germany -pipe- 04.09.2006 " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the terrorist attacks , many americans abroad wanted to be " back home " sept .
11 shook americans inside and outside the us .
for those abroad , " home " had suddenly become unsafe .
five years on , ex-pats in germany and other european countries still feel uneasy - because of anti-americanism . " when i look back at sept .
11 , 2001 , it always makes me gasp , " said kelly , an american who has resided in germany for 17 years .
it 's pretty much like ground zero .
it 's still like a big hole in my stomach . " her memories of that day are vivid .
she was driving to an appointment in bonn , singing along to " beautiful day " by her favorite band u2 on the radio .
it really was a beautiful day - the golden september sun slanting through the window , warming her cheeks . her cell phone jolted her out of the musical daydream . " a friend called to tell me that a plane had just crashed into the world trade center , and then another one , " said kelly , a new york state native . she pulled over as she was just too shaken to drive . " i knew with the second plane that it could n't be a coincidence , " she said . utterly alo n e bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it still feels like ground zero in my stomach " washington , d.c. native my-linh kunst was living in brussels at the time , but was in frankfurt on sept .
11 . " my husband was working at a trade fair , and i was in the hotel translating , " my-lihn said .
" i took a late lunch break and tuned in to cnn . when the second one hit , the reporter said it was clearly a terrorist attack . " my-linh - like millions around the world - was glued to her tv for days .
for many " expatriates , " television was the only source of information - and solace . " i tried to call my family in washington , but could n't get through , " she said .
" i was completely alone . " shell-shocked fiona newman was heading an american business team in london .
when the news broke , most headed from the office over to the pub where there was a television . " everyone in the pub was crying , " fiona said .
" there was sheer disbelief that such a thing could happen to anybody , much less to america .
people had felt so safe and secure there .
the americans were shell-shocked . " home away from home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans gathered at the us consulate in hamburg to pay their respects many sought comfort in other americans , but it was n't easy .
mary brunowsky , the president of the american women 's club in cologne , called cologne 's amerika haus that day . as part of the düsseldorf-based american consulate general , the task of the amerika haus in cologne is to explain us society and policies to german audiences . " they told us right away to not go anywhere as a group since the terrorists may be targeting americans abroad , " ' brunowsky said . to this day , the federation of american women 's clubs overseas does not publish online where their meetings are held . even though here was not home , many americans were touched by germans ' sympathy at the time .
the solidarity eased the sorrow . " for days and weeks after sept .
11 , there were candles and flowers everywhere outside of the amerika haus , " said bernd herbert , the organization 's cultural affairs officer . divided respo n ses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german sympathy in cologne but the sympathy was n't meant to last . " and then america blew it , " kelly said .
the foreign policy course the united states chose to take in response to the sept .
11 attacks - the invasion into afghanistan , the war in iraq , allowing torture at abu ghraib and the manner of prisoner detention at guantanamo bay - destroyed the rallying behind her homeland , she believes . a study by the pew research center , in its " global attitudes project , " confirmed this .
in this year 's survey of 17,000 people in 15 countries , the organization concluded that " america 's global image has again slipped and support for the war on terrorism has declined , even among close us allies like japan .
favorable opinions of the united states have fallen in most of the countries surveyed , " the report said . the study continued : " the war in iraq is a continuing drag on opinions of the united states , not only in predominantly muslim countries , but in europe and asia as well . " a n ti-america n ism cycles heike bungert , a north american history professor at the university of bremen , said anti-americanism comes in waves .
right now , she said , the " wave " is higher due to us foreign policy .
she sees it among her students . " the suspicion lurks that the us wants to intervene everywhere , " she said . the then german government 's opposition to the war in iraq in 2003 may have helped anchor that attitude . " there 's a sense here in germany - and that is a result of our history of world wars - that global problems can and should be worked out through negotiations rather than militarily , " said herbert of the amerika haus , himself a german . the good , the bad a n d the ugly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyday life in iraq : suicide bombers and roadside attacks many leading american analysts believe that the war in iraq has done more harm than good .
american academic francis fukuyama , once close to the neo-conservative movement , distanced himself from the group just before the war . " iraq has become a breeding ground for terror , " he told der spiegel newsmagazine this spring .
" it has stimulated a lot of people to join the resistance and commit themselves to jihad . " others point out that us power and privilege feed anti-americanism .
us undersecretary of state karen hughes 's job is to improve america 's image abroad . " we are a superpower and with that comes some resentment , " she said in a february interview . philosopher andré glucksmann , a frenchman of german-jewish descent , pointed out that " people use the myth of the superpower america to pin the blame onto the country for everything , " he told der spiegel last fall .
" but the world has long become multi-polar ; america is not able to dictate its conditions everywhere . " in fact , bungert , fukayama and glucksmann all believe that it is modernism that has helped fuel frustration , resentment and , ultimately , terrorism . " modernization , or more precisely , the - brutal - westernization of the planet , has sent three-fourths of the world 's population spinning , " glucksmann said . guilt by associatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-iraq war : parisian girl at the us embassy in 2002 germany may have had its wake-up call about its currents of anti-americanism at the start of this year when revelations surfaced that german spies in baghdad had supplied the us military with information during the iraq war . some germans realized that they could no longer be pointing the finger at the us for an erroneous invasion in iraq , when germany itself had dirtied its hands . still , the urge to reproach dies hard .
american carmen pang , a cologne resident , was recently strolling through the city with her husband .
heeding the festive soccer world cup mood , her husband donned his cowboy hat .
as the couple passed by an outdoor café , someone called out " fuck bush . " though carmen had to swallow hard over that one , she said most germans can distinguish between american policy and the country 's people , and that they welcome her here . one might think that americans abroad have a distant stance toward their native country .
au co n traire , some ex-pats say - many feel themselves to be unofficial ambassadors to their country of origin . " it 's so easy to america-bash overseas and distance oneself from it all , " my-linh said .
" but actually , while i do n't defend us foreign politics right now , i find that when i 'm abroad , i 'm quite patriotic and proud to be an american .
i just shut out the america-bashing . " but mary said it is sometimes hard to turn a deaf ear . " we as ex-pats - whether we believe in american politics or not - we as americans feel uncomfortable now abroad , " she said . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strange bedfellows : radical leftists for bush among the german far-left , one subgroup called the anti-germans holds some contradictory views .

that 's no easier to answer than the question of how this politically important region will develop in the future . " it can not be denied that new , radical currents and previously unknown terror groups have surfaced since the horrible events on sept .

it 's often unclear who is actually supporting the terror groups , " said sagie qurqmas , a well-known writer and historian from syria . " since sept .

tightened domestic security measures and new anti-terror laws are results of the threat , which has already become apparent in egypt , tunisia , morocco , saudi arabia , jordan , syria and elsewhere . new laws , however , have restricted individual rights even further and hindered democratic reforms .
author and columnist jameel abu hassan said citizens are more than willing to make the compromise .

that 's no easier to answer than the question of how this politically important region will develop in the future . " it can not be denied that new , radical currents and previously unknown terror groups have surfaced since the horrible events on sept .

11 , the west , especially the us , has continued to accuse the arabs of being the source of radicalism and terrorism , " he said . " even if this is true of some arabs , the majority can not be characterized by this minority .

" a deepening divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us tactics have driven moderates into terrorist groups , said qurqmas qurqmas says that the united states ' " failed policy of violence and occupation " has driven many more moderate arabs into the radical camp .
the west 's blanket accusations have only deepened the fissure with the arab world , he said . he named the occupation of iraq , the failure of the palestinian-israeli peace process , and the israeli-lebanese war - " not to mention the west 's ambivalent treatment of fundamental issues like democracy and human rights " - as contributors to the widening rift . until the events on sept .
11 , western democracies had served as role models of secular powers for the arab world , which was seeking to replace the repressive , totalitarian regimes in the region with democratic societies . however , human rights violations in guantanamo bay and abu ghraib , the cia affair in europe and the united states ' unconditional support of israel in its war against the palestinians and lebanese have considerably detracted from the credibility of the us and its european allies in the arab world . doubting democracy " no one here wants to hear anything from the west , " wrote journalist abdel-karim shaheen .

the journalist believes that the west is not really interested in democratization , rather in securing oil and other economic markets . a domestic threat on the other hand , the strengthening of radical islamic groups represents a threat to the arab world itself , said both iranian journalist and lawyer najh al-obaidi and syrian journalist atef afif .
tightened domestic security measures and new anti-terror laws are results of the threat , which has already become apparent in egypt , tunisia , morocco , saudi arabia , jordan , syria and elsewhere . new laws , however , have restricted individual rights even further and hindered democratic reforms .

11 " on that day , i just ran " germany -pipe- 04.09.2006 " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the terrorist attacks , many americans abroad wanted to be " back home " sept .
11 shook americans inside and outside the us .
for those abroad , " home " had suddenly become unsafe .
five years on , ex-pats in germany and other european countries still feel uneasy - because of anti-americanism . " when i look back at sept .
11 , 2001 , it always makes me gasp , " said kelly , an american who has resided in germany for 17 years .
it 's pretty much like ground zero .
it 's still like a big hole in my stomach . " her memories of that day are vivid .
she was driving to an appointment in bonn , singing along to " beautiful day " by her favorite band u2 on the radio .
it really was a beautiful day - the golden september sun slanting through the window , warming her cheeks . her cell phone jolted her out of the musical daydream . " a friend called to tell me that a plane had just crashed into the world trade center , and then another one , " said kelly , a new york state native . she pulled over as she was just too shaken to drive . " i knew with the second plane that it could n't be a coincidence , " she said . utterly alo n e bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it still feels like ground zero in my stomach " washington , d.c. native my-linh kunst was living in brussels at the time , but was in frankfurt on sept .
11 . " my husband was working at a trade fair , and i was in the hotel translating , " my-lihn said .
" i took a late lunch break and tuned in to cnn . when the second one hit , the reporter said it was clearly a terrorist attack . " my-linh - like millions around the world - was glued to her tv for days .
for many " expatriates , " television was the only source of information - and solace . " i tried to call my family in washington , but could n't get through , " she said .
" i was completely alone . " shell-shocked fiona newman was heading an american business team in london .
when the news broke , most headed from the office over to the pub where there was a television . " everyone in the pub was crying , " fiona said .
" there was sheer disbelief that such a thing could happen to anybody , much less to america .
people had felt so safe and secure there .
the americans were shell-shocked . " home away from home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans gathered at the us consulate in hamburg to pay their respects many sought comfort in other americans , but it was n't easy .
mary brunowsky , the president of the american women 's club in cologne , called cologne 's amerika haus that day . as part of the düsseldorf-based american consulate general , the task of the amerika haus in cologne is to explain us society and policies to german audiences . " they told us right away to not go anywhere as a group since the terrorists may be targeting americans abroad , " ' brunowsky said . to this day , the federation of american women 's clubs overseas does not publish online where their meetings are held . even though here was not home , many americans were touched by germans ' sympathy at the time .
the solidarity eased the sorrow . " for days and weeks after sept .
11 , there were candles and flowers everywhere outside of the amerika haus , " said bernd herbert , the organization 's cultural affairs officer . divided respo n ses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german sympathy in cologne but the sympathy was n't meant to last . " and then america blew it , " kelly said .
the foreign policy course the united states chose to take in response to the sept .
11 attacks - the invasion into afghanistan , the war in iraq , allowing torture at abu ghraib and the manner of prisoner detention at guantanamo bay - destroyed the rallying behind her homeland , she believes . a study by the pew research center , in its " global attitudes project , " confirmed this .
in this year 's survey of 17,000 people in 15 countries , the organization concluded that " america 's global image has again slipped and support for the war on terrorism has declined , even among close us allies like japan .
favorable opinions of the united states have fallen in most of the countries surveyed , " the report said . the study continued : " the war in iraq is a continuing drag on opinions of the united states , not only in predominantly muslim countries , but in europe and asia as well . " a n ti-america n ism cycles heike bungert , a north american history professor at the university of bremen , said anti-americanism comes in waves .
right now , she said , the " wave " is higher due to us foreign policy .
she sees it among her students . " the suspicion lurks that the us wants to intervene everywhere , " she said . the then german government 's opposition to the war in iraq in 2003 may have helped anchor that attitude . " there 's a sense here in germany - and that is a result of our history of world wars - that global problems can and should be worked out through negotiations rather than militarily , " said herbert of the amerika haus , himself a german . the good , the bad a n d the ugly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyday life in iraq : suicide bombers and roadside attacks many leading american analysts believe that the war in iraq has done more harm than good .
american academic francis fukuyama , once close to the neo-conservative movement , distanced himself from the group just before the war . " iraq has become a breeding ground for terror , " he told der spiegel newsmagazine this spring .
" it has stimulated a lot of people to join the resistance and commit themselves to jihad . " others point out that us power and privilege feed anti-americanism .
us undersecretary of state karen hughes 's job is to improve america 's image abroad . " we are a superpower and with that comes some resentment , " she said in a february interview . philosopher andré glucksmann , a frenchman of german-jewish descent , pointed out that " people use the myth of the superpower america to pin the blame onto the country for everything , " he told der spiegel last fall .
" but the world has long become multi-polar ; america is not able to dictate its conditions everywhere . " in fact , bungert , fukayama and glucksmann all believe that it is modernism that has helped fuel frustration , resentment and , ultimately , terrorism . " modernization , or more precisely , the - brutal - westernization of the planet , has sent three-fourths of the world 's population spinning , " glucksmann said . guilt by associatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-iraq war : parisian girl at the us embassy in 2002 germany may have had its wake-up call about its currents of anti-americanism at the start of this year when revelations surfaced that german spies in baghdad had supplied the us military with information during the iraq war . some germans realized that they could no longer be pointing the finger at the us for an erroneous invasion in iraq , when germany itself had dirtied its hands . still , the urge to reproach dies hard .
american carmen pang , a cologne resident , was recently strolling through the city with her husband .
heeding the festive soccer world cup mood , her husband donned his cowboy hat .
as the couple passed by an outdoor café , someone called out " fuck bush . " though carmen had to swallow hard over that one , she said most germans can distinguish between american policy and the country 's people , and that they welcome her here . one might think that americans abroad have a distant stance toward their native country .
au co n traire , some ex-pats say - many feel themselves to be unofficial ambassadors to their country of origin . " it 's so easy to america-bash overseas and distance oneself from it all , " my-linh said .
" but actually , while i do n't defend us foreign politics right now , i find that when i 'm abroad , i 'm quite patriotic and proud to be an american .
i just shut out the america-bashing . " but mary said it is sometimes hard to turn a deaf ear .

11 changed the world more than images : sept .
11 as a key event for online media daily life has n't changed for americans since sept .
11 germany 's solidarity with us waning after sept .
11 " on that day , i just ran " germany -pipe- 04.09.2006 " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the terrorist attacks , many americans abroad wanted to be " back home " sept .
11 shook americans inside and outside the us .
for those abroad , " home " had suddenly become unsafe .
five years on , ex-pats in germany and other european countries still feel uneasy - because of anti-americanism . " when i look back at sept .
11 , 2001 , it always makes me gasp , " said kelly , an american who has resided in germany for 17 years .
it 's pretty much like ground zero .
it 's still like a big hole in my stomach . " her memories of that day are vivid .
she was driving to an appointment in bonn , singing along to " beautiful day " by her favorite band u2 on the radio .
it really was a beautiful day - the golden september sun slanting through the window , warming her cheeks . her cell phone jolted her out of the musical daydream . " a friend called to tell me that a plane had just crashed into the world trade center , and then another one , " said kelly , a new york state native . she pulled over as she was just too shaken to drive . " i knew with the second plane that it could n't be a coincidence , " she said . utterly alo n e bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it still feels like ground zero in my stomach " washington , d.c. native my-linh kunst was living in brussels at the time , but was in frankfurt on sept .
11 . " my husband was working at a trade fair , and i was in the hotel translating , " my-lihn said .
" i took a late lunch break and tuned in to cnn . when the second one hit , the reporter said it was clearly a terrorist attack . " my-linh - like millions around the world - was glued to her tv for days .
for many " expatriates , " television was the only source of information - and solace . " i tried to call my family in washington , but could n't get through , " she said .
" i was completely alone . " shell-shocked fiona newman was heading an american business team in london .
when the news broke , most headed from the office over to the pub where there was a television . " everyone in the pub was crying , " fiona said .
" there was sheer disbelief that such a thing could happen to anybody , much less to america .
people had felt so safe and secure there .
the americans were shell-shocked . " home away from home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans gathered at the us consulate in hamburg to pay their respects many sought comfort in other americans , but it was n't easy .
mary brunowsky , the president of the american women 's club in cologne , called cologne 's amerika haus that day . as part of the düsseldorf-based american consulate general , the task of the amerika haus in cologne is to explain us society and policies to german audiences . " they told us right away to not go anywhere as a group since the terrorists may be targeting americans abroad , " ' brunowsky said . to this day , the federation of american women 's clubs overseas does not publish online where their meetings are held . even though here was not home , many americans were touched by germans ' sympathy at the time .
the solidarity eased the sorrow . " for days and weeks after sept .
11 , there were candles and flowers everywhere outside of the amerika haus , " said bernd herbert , the organization 's cultural affairs officer . divided respo n ses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german sympathy in cologne but the sympathy was n't meant to last . " and then america blew it , " kelly said .
the foreign policy course the united states chose to take in response to the sept .
11 attacks - the invasion into afghanistan , the war in iraq , allowing torture at abu ghraib and the manner of prisoner detention at guantanamo bay - destroyed the rallying behind her homeland , she believes . a study by the pew research center , in its " global attitudes project , " confirmed this .
in this year 's survey of 17,000 people in 15 countries , the organization concluded that " america 's global image has again slipped and support for the war on terrorism has declined , even among close us allies like japan .
favorable opinions of the united states have fallen in most of the countries surveyed , " the report said . the study continued : " the war in iraq is a continuing drag on opinions of the united states , not only in predominantly muslim countries , but in europe and asia as well . " a n ti-america n ism cycles heike bungert , a north american history professor at the university of bremen , said anti-americanism comes in waves .
right now , she said , the " wave " is higher due to us foreign policy .
she sees it among her students . " the suspicion lurks that the us wants to intervene everywhere , " she said . the then german government 's opposition to the war in iraq in 2003 may have helped anchor that attitude . " there 's a sense here in germany - and that is a result of our history of world wars - that global problems can and should be worked out through negotiations rather than militarily , " said herbert of the amerika haus , himself a german . the good , the bad a n d the ugly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyday life in iraq : suicide bombers and roadside attacks many leading american analysts believe that the war in iraq has done more harm than good .
american academic francis fukuyama , once close to the neo-conservative movement , distanced himself from the group just before the war . " iraq has become a breeding ground for terror , " he told der spiegel newsmagazine this spring .
" it has stimulated a lot of people to join the resistance and commit themselves to jihad . " others point out that us power and privilege feed anti-americanism .
us undersecretary of state karen hughes 's job is to improve america 's image abroad . " we are a superpower and with that comes some resentment , " she said in a february interview . philosopher andré glucksmann , a frenchman of german-jewish descent , pointed out that " people use the myth of the superpower america to pin the blame onto the country for everything , " he told der spiegel last fall .
" but the world has long become multi-polar ; america is not able to dictate its conditions everywhere . " in fact , bungert , fukayama and glucksmann all believe that it is modernism that has helped fuel frustration , resentment and , ultimately , terrorism . " modernization , or more precisely , the - brutal - westernization of the planet , has sent three-fourths of the world 's population spinning , " glucksmann said . guilt by associatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-iraq war : parisian girl at the us embassy in 2002 germany may have had its wake-up call about its currents of anti-americanism at the start of this year when revelations surfaced that german spies in baghdad had supplied the us military with information during the iraq war . some germans realized that they could no longer be pointing the finger at the us for an erroneous invasion in iraq , when germany itself had dirtied its hands . still , the urge to reproach dies hard .
american carmen pang , a cologne resident , was recently strolling through the city with her husband .
heeding the festive soccer world cup mood , her husband donned his cowboy hat .

last year , ates was named germany 's woman of the year for her unstinting battle for the rights of mainly muslim women . given her reputation for toughness and bravery , ates ' recent announcement that she was closing her practice because she felt threatened has sent shockwaves through the german capital . livi n g with threats , i n timidatio n berlin daily der tagesspiegel reported that ates , who has been insulted and threatened by the husbands and relatives of many turkish women she has represented over the years , decided to wind up her work after another similar incident last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ates has riled up the turkish community with her outspoken criticism the muslim husband of one of her clients , whom ates was representing in divorce proceedings , assaulted his wife and tried to attack ates opposite the courtroom where the case was being heard , the paper wrote .

" " a lot has to cha n ge " ates has also criticized both politicians and police in failing to provide her support and protection . der tagesspiegel reported that ates had applied for police protection last march after turkish daily hürriyet attacked her in a series of articles for her critical statements about the treatment of women in many turkish families .
but the police refused protection , saying there was no indication of a concrete threat , ates said .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder of hatun sürücü , a turkish woman , by her brother made headlines last year ates ' outspoken criticism of the treatment of women in turkish families in germany has earned her the ire of both turks as well as many left-wingers in favor of multicultural policies .

" the ant-terror database will be a central component in effectively fighting terrorism , " police union head konrad freiberg said on monday . deep reservatio n s about database though the current grand coalition made up of social democrats and the conservatives agreed on setting up a central anti-terrorism database last year , the two parties have differed on its exact shape and reach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a proliferation of security agencies on account of its federal structure the idea is that all police and intelligence agencies , both at the federal and national level , would gather information about terror suspects and terrorist organizations in a central database that would be accessible to all crime-fighting agencies .

" the ant-terror database will be a central component in effectively fighting terrorism , " police union head konrad freiberg said on monday . deep reservatio n s about database though the current grand coalition made up of social democrats and the conservatives agreed on setting up a central anti-terrorism database last year , the two parties have differed on its exact shape and reach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a proliferation of security agencies on account of its federal structure the idea is that all police and intelligence agencies , both at the federal and national level , would gather information about terror suspects and terrorist organizations in a central database that would be accessible to all crime-fighting agencies .

last year , ates was named germany 's woman of the year for her unstinting battle for the rights of mainly muslim women . given her reputation for toughness and bravery , ates ' recent announcement that she was closing her practice because she felt threatened has sent shockwaves through the german capital . livi n g with threats , i n timidatio n berlin daily der tagesspiegel reported that ates , who has been insulted and threatened by the husbands and relatives of many turkish women she has represented over the years , decided to wind up her work after another similar incident last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ates has riled up the turkish community with her outspoken criticism the muslim husband of one of her clients , whom ates was representing in divorce proceedings , assaulted his wife and tried to attack ates opposite the courtroom where the case was being heard , the paper wrote . " i 'm withdrawing from professional life as a lawyer , my client is living in a women 's shelter , but the assailant is running around scot-free , " ates told the paper , adding that " my life and that of my young daughter have priority . " a statement on ates ' web site said : " it 's once again clear to me how dangerous my work as a lawyer was and how little i was and still am protected as an individual . " " a lot has to cha n ge " ates has also criticized both politicians and police in failing to provide her support and protection . der tagesspiegel reported that ates had applied for police protection last march after turkish daily hürriyet attacked her in a series of articles for her critical statements about the treatment of women in many turkish families .
but the police refused protection , saying there was no indication of a concrete threat , ates said .
the police however have rejected the allegations . " a lot has to change there , " ates told der tagesspiegel .
" the victim protection law has to be urgently expanded . " the german-turkish lawyer , a member of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- since 2004 , has said that the spd too has n't paid any heed to her concerns . " the spd is still dominated by an immigration policy that plays things down , " ates told the paper , saying that politicians always urged citizens to show more courage .
" that is right , but then you also have to protect people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder of hatun sürücü , a turkish woman , by her brother made headlines last year ates ' outspoken criticism of the treatment of women in turkish families in germany has earned her the ire of both turks as well as many left-wingers in favor of multicultural policies .
ates has consistently slammed politicians for turning a blind eye to problems within immigrant communities under the guise of tolerance and fostering diversity . ates however has said that she will continue giving lectures and interviews to highlight the plight of women in turkish and kurdish communities in germany . a n " alarmi n g sig n " ates ' announcement has sparked outrage among politicians , with many calling for expanding victim protection laws to include women who feel threatened . berlin 's interior minister , erhard körting called it an " alarming sign " and said he had " high respect for ates ' work . " others have called for a signature campaign for ates .

they also found up to 40 tons of suspicious duck meat at another bavarian business . some of the meat was more than four years past its due date . authorities were also concerned because one of the companies storing the moldy meat has customers across europe .
authorities said monday that at least 26 companies were supplied with meat recently from the company - in five cases so far , the meat was questionable . meanwhile no charges have yet been filed as authorities continue to test meat at restaurants , stores and food stalls . jail as deterrent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the meat found was four years past its expiration date in the aftermath , there have been calls for stronger laws to ensure that such incidents do n't occur in the future . the only way to do that , according to bavarian consumer protection minister werner schnappauf , is to set an example .

others in the country welcomed the german head of state 's remarks . poland 's conservative premier , jaroslaw kaczynski , criticized köhler 's appearance at the annual remembrance day for the 12 million germans who fled or were expelled from eastern europe after world war ii . he called köhler 's speech " one of these unsettling events that have taken place recently in germany . " speaking to some 2,000 guests of the league of german expellees , köhler made an appeal for increased dialogue within a greater european context .
he recognized the concerns that have sprung up in poland , particularly following the opening of a controversial exhibit on german and other expellees in berlin in early august . " we should n't ignore these concerns , " he said .

" we just want the principle of symmetry to be applied here so that everyone is treated the same , " he said . köhler said that germany 's former territories to the east were part of his country 's cultural heritage , even if irrevocably no longer part of germany and that the culture and history of the expellees was part of german identity . kaczy n ski 's opi n io n n ot the o n ly o n e i n pola n d according to a monday article in the warsaw daily gazeta wyborcza , kaczynski 's statements may not be representative of the polish media or his country 's population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach has advocated for a permanent expellee center in berlin köhler 's words " were positive , from the polish perspective , " wrote the paper , because " he began with sept .

others in the country welcomed the german head of state 's remarks . poland 's conservative premier , jaroslaw kaczynski , criticized köhler 's appearance at the annual remembrance day for the 12 million germans who fled or were expelled from eastern europe after world war ii . he called köhler 's speech " one of these unsettling events that have taken place recently in germany . " speaking to some 2,000 guests of the league of german expellees , köhler made an appeal for increased dialogue within a greater european context .
he recognized the concerns that have sprung up in poland , particularly following the opening of a controversial exhibit on german and other expellees in berlin in early august . " we should n't ignore these concerns , " he said .
" we should take them seriously , even if we consider them unfounded .
there is no doubt what the cause of escape and expulsion was : the unjust national-socialist regime and world war ii , which germany started . " expellees " part of germa n ide n tity " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski , right , was appointed pm by his twin brother , president lech kaczynski the league of german expellees , chaired by erika steinbach from the conservative party cdu , has celebrated " home day " since 1950 .
the event recalls the fate of germans who fled from the soviet army when world war ii ended , or were expelled from former german territories when europe 's borders were redrawn following the war . kaczynski was referring to the league when he said , " there is a large government-supported group in germany that constantly brings up the polish territories that used to belong to germany . " if there were a similar organization in poland that demanded the return of parts of the ukraine , belarus or lithuania , warsaw would face serious political consequences , added kaczynski . " we just want the principle of symmetry to be applied here so that everyone is treated the same , " he said . köhler said that germany 's former territories to the east were part of his country 's cultural heritage , even if irrevocably no longer part of germany and that the culture and history of the expellees was part of german identity . kaczy n ski 's opi n io n n ot the o n ly o n e i n pola n d according to a monday article in the warsaw daily gazeta wyborcza , kaczynski 's statements may not be representative of the polish media or his country 's population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach has advocated for a permanent expellee center in berlin köhler 's words " were positive , from the polish perspective , " wrote the paper , because " he began with sept .
1 , 1939 as the beginning of the expulsions .
secondly , he emphasized the integration of the expellees and not remembrance of german suffering . " hitler 's army invaded poland on sept .
1 , 1939 , starting world war ii . köhler also mentioned the danzig declaration , signed in october 2003 by his predecessor johannes rau and poland 's former president aleksander kwasniewski .
the document represents a formal withdrawal of compensation claims and mutual accusations of guilt between the neighboring countries . a summer of te n sio n communication between polish and german government leaders has been taut this summer and emotions have run high after a series of toe-stepping events . the string of offending incidents include a satire in a german newspaper that called polish president lech kaczynski " a potato , " the berlin exhibition on expulsion , and günter grass ' public confession of membership in the feared nazi waffen ss . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin exhibition on postwar expulsions opens amid protests a controversial exhibition which opened in berlin thursday on the expulsions of germans and other europeans after 1945 has been strongly condemned by polish leaders .

" in this case , it is better to do things properly than to proceed in a hurry , " she said .

they will be joined by a 15,000-strong lebanese army force to prevent hezbollah attacks .

but they 're not upset enough to stop buying cars with bigger motors and more horsepower . maybe it 's a desire to take full advantage of those freeways with no speed limits ; maybe it 's a kind of compensation for other perceived shortcomings or mid-life crises - either way germans are flocking towards new cars with more muscular , and thirstier , engines .
the trend has surprised the author of a study tracking car buying and gas price trends since 2000 . " we really did not expect this high increase in horsepower despite high fuel prices , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer of b & d forecast . some 17 percent of german auto buyers were interested in cars with less than 70 horsepower six years ago .
but in 2006 , only 9 percent want the smaller engines .
over the same period of time , sales of cars with between 136 and 190 horsepower doubled to 27 percent , dudenhöffer said . cars are emotional products bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars usually receive excellent care in germany " the automobile is still a very emotional product , and this emotion is expressed in sportiness , " he said , adding that that leads people to make decisions in the car showroom they might not make if they were deciding while standing at a gas pump . the emotional attachment that makes a fast car more than just a way to get from point a to point b can also be seen by the growing percentage of people buying cars with up to 350 horsepower .
though still less than one percent of car buyers , it has doubled over the last six years , even as fuel prices have increased by 33 percent , dudenhöffer said . " automobiles are very valuable to germans , they have a feeling of freedom in the car , " he said . "
a person 's esteem is very closely connected to what they drive . " fuel price still plays a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas prices have made some consider other means of transportation still , germans are not willing to ignore the price of fuel completely and are often turning to diesel instead of gasoline , dudenhöffer added . " by emphasizing diesels over the last few years , manufactures have done a lot to help consumers , " he said .
" they are helping get around the conflicting objectives of more performance without more consumption . " car buyers are turning to diesel engines because they can get similar performance with less fuel .
the market share of diesel engines has climbed to nearly 45 percent since 2000 in germany , according to dudenhöffer 's report . more cars staying in the garage in addition to switching to diesel , germans are also extending the time between fill-ups by driving less , a separate study showed . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of german car makes have plans to introduce new suvs the decreases , however , may not hold , as a spate of compact sport utility vehicles from volkswagen , opel , audi and mercedes hit the german market over the next year , the trend toward more powerful engines is likely to continue for the short-term , dudenhöffer said . but when planning their long-term strategies , german carmakers may not want to overstress the importance of horsepower as changes occur in other markets , dudenhöffer said .

11 changed the world more than images : sept .
11 as a key event for online media daily life has n't changed for americans since sept .
11 germany 's solidarity with us waning after sept .
11 " on that day , i just ran " germany -pipe- 04.09.2006 " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the terrorist attacks , many americans abroad wanted to be " back home " sept .
11 shook americans inside and outside the us .
for those abroad , " home " had suddenly become unsafe .
five years on , ex-pats in germany and other european countries still feel uneasy - because of anti-americanism . " when i look back at sept .
11 , 2001 , it always makes me gasp , " said kelly , an american who has resided in germany for 17 years .
it 's pretty much like ground zero .
it 's still like a big hole in my stomach . " her memories of that day are vivid .
she was driving to an appointment in bonn , singing along to " beautiful day " by her favorite band u2 on the radio .
it really was a beautiful day - the golden september sun slanting through the window , warming her cheeks . her cell phone jolted her out of the musical daydream . " a friend called to tell me that a plane had just crashed into the world trade center , and then another one , " said kelly , a new york state native . she pulled over as she was just too shaken to drive . " i knew with the second plane that it could n't be a coincidence , " she said . utterly alo n e bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it still feels like ground zero in my stomach " washington , d.c. native my-linh kunst was living in brussels at the time , but was in frankfurt on sept .
11 . " my husband was working at a trade fair , and i was in the hotel translating , " my-lihn said .
" i took a late lunch break and tuned in to cnn . when the second one hit , the reporter said it was clearly a terrorist attack . " my-linh - like millions around the world - was glued to her tv for days .
for many " expatriates , " television was the only source of information - and solace . " i tried to call my family in washington , but could n't get through , " she said .
" i was completely alone . " shell-shocked fiona newman was heading an american business team in london .
when the news broke , most headed from the office over to the pub where there was a television . " everyone in the pub was crying , " fiona said .
" there was sheer disbelief that such a thing could happen to anybody , much less to america .
people had felt so safe and secure there .
the americans were shell-shocked . " home away from home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans gathered at the us consulate in hamburg to pay their respects many sought comfort in other americans , but it was n't easy .
mary brunowsky , the president of the american women 's club in cologne , called cologne 's amerika haus that day . as part of the düsseldorf-based american consulate general , the task of the amerika haus in cologne is to explain us society and policies to german audiences . " they told us right away to not go anywhere as a group since the terrorists may be targeting americans abroad , " ' brunowsky said . to this day , the federation of american women 's clubs overseas does not publish online where their meetings are held . even though here was not home , many americans were touched by germans ' sympathy at the time .
the solidarity eased the sorrow . " for days and weeks after sept .
11 , there were candles and flowers everywhere outside of the amerika haus , " said bernd herbert , the organization 's cultural affairs officer . divided respo n ses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german sympathy in cologne but the sympathy was n't meant to last . " and then america blew it , " kelly said .
the foreign policy course the united states chose to take in response to the sept .
11 attacks - the invasion into afghanistan , the war in iraq , allowing torture at abu ghraib and the manner of prisoner detention at guantanamo bay - destroyed the rallying behind her homeland , she believes . a study by the pew research center , in its " global attitudes project , " confirmed this .
in this year 's survey of 17,000 people in 15 countries , the organization concluded that " america 's global image has again slipped and support for the war on terrorism has declined , even among close us allies like japan .
favorable opinions of the united states have fallen in most of the countries surveyed , " the report said . the study continued : " the war in iraq is a continuing drag on opinions of the united states , not only in predominantly muslim countries , but in europe and asia as well . " a n ti-america n ism cycles heike bungert , a north american history professor at the university of bremen , said anti-americanism comes in waves .
right now , she said , the " wave " is higher due to us foreign policy .

" i think that the talks that will take place in lebanon have to be conducted to make a request possible , " merkel said monday .
" then we will do things quickly , but not rush if the conditions are not right . " germany needed a request to the un , a " robust mandate " from the world body and the approval of the lower house of parliament for the mission , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told reporters on sunday . un grou n d troops accepted by beirut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian soldiers moved into southern lebanon " without such a request from lebanon to the united nations , the bundeswehr can not participate , " he said .
" we can only send troops if the rules of engagement are clear and there is a stated willingness on the part of lebanon , communicated to the united nations . " italy has already received its marching orders from the un , and some 890 of its soldiers arrived in lebanon to strengthen the un force already in place there .
additional french ground troops are also expected in the region by the end of the week . the lebanese government , including the two hezbollah ministers , has not opposed a united nations force marching into a buffer zone between lebanon and israel , but called protecting its marine borders a task for the national military . allowing a foreign country to stop ships on its coast , which germany requests as part of its mandate , is a major intrusion into national sovereignty , which requires approval from the cabinet , lebanese foreign minister fawzi salloukh told german public broadcaster ard on sunday . " we may discuss it -lrb- monday -rrb- and reach a decision , " he added . germa n oppositio n calls for troops to stay home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle said german troops should not deploy to the middle east the murky situation on the ground in lebanon is reason enough for " germany not to send any armed troops to the middle east , " according to the german opposition free market , liberal free democratic party leader guido westerwelle . but german deputy foreign minister gernot erler told deutschlandfunk radio on monday that he did not see the political discussions in lebanon as endangering a un mission to the middle east . " there is no reason to call the entire mission into question , " he said , adding that the west needed to understand the need for discussion inside the lebanese government . israel wa n ts forces i n place before e n di n g sea blockade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could lead a number of european nations offering naval forces berlin has ruled out sending ground troops to lebanon , but germany is widely expected to assume the naval command of the bolstered un force that must police a fragile ceasefire between israel and hezbollah in southern lebanon . putting an international force in place on lebanon 's coast is important for lebanese businesses as an israeli sea blockade has stopped goods from arriving in lebanese ports since july , lebanese business representatives told afp . despite calls from the european union and united nations , israel said it would not lift the blockade until an international force is put in place to stop weapons smuggling to hezbollah fighters . government spokesman wilhelm said the other nations which are likely to help protect lebanon 's coast - denmark , the netherlands , norway and sweden - were also waiting for the green light from beirut before sending naval forces to the region . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ready for troop deployment on lebanon 's request the mandate of the enlarged un interim force in lebanon is " solid and reasonable " , german chancellor angela merkel said ahead of an expected request from lebanon for troops to be sent to the region .

but they 're not upset enough to stop buying cars with bigger motors and more horsepower . maybe it 's a desire to take full advantage of those freeways with no speed limits ; maybe it 's a kind of compensation for other perceived shortcomings or mid-life crises - either way germans are flocking towards new cars with more muscular , and thirstier , engines .
the trend has surprised the author of a study tracking car buying and gas price trends since 2000 . " we really did not expect this high increase in horsepower despite high fuel prices , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer of b & d forecast . some 17 percent of german auto buyers were interested in cars with less than 70 horsepower six years ago .

though still less than one percent of car buyers , it has doubled over the last six years , even as fuel prices have increased by 33 percent , dudenhöffer said . " automobiles are very valuable to germans , they have a feeling of freedom in the car , " he said . "
a person 's esteem is very closely connected to what they drive . " fuel price still plays a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas prices have made some consider other means of transportation still , germans are not willing to ignore the price of fuel completely and are often turning to diesel instead of gasoline , dudenhöffer added . " by emphasizing diesels over the last few years , manufactures have done a lot to help consumers , " he said .
" they are helping get around the conflicting objectives of more performance without more consumption . " car buyers are turning to diesel engines because they can get similar performance with less fuel .
the market share of diesel engines has climbed to nearly 45 percent since 2000 in germany , according to dudenhöffer 's report . more cars staying in the garage in addition to switching to diesel , germans are also extending the time between fill-ups by driving less , a separate study showed . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of german car makes have plans to introduce new suvs the decreases , however , may not hold , as a spate of compact sport utility vehicles from volkswagen , opel , audi and mercedes hit the german market over the next year , the trend toward more powerful engines is likely to continue for the short-term , dudenhöffer said . but when planning their long-term strategies , german carmakers may not want to overstress the importance of horsepower as changes occur in other markets , dudenhöffer said .

but they 're not upset enough to stop buying cars with bigger motors and more horsepower . maybe it 's a desire to take full advantage of those freeways with no speed limits ; maybe it 's a kind of compensation for other perceived shortcomings or mid-life crises - either way germans are flocking towards new cars with more muscular , and thirstier , engines .
the trend has surprised the author of a study tracking car buying and gas price trends since 2000 . " we really did not expect this high increase in horsepower despite high fuel prices , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer of b & d forecast . some 17 percent of german auto buyers were interested in cars with less than 70 horsepower six years ago .
but in 2006 , only 9 percent want the smaller engines .
over the same period of time , sales of cars with between 136 and 190 horsepower doubled to 27 percent , dudenhöffer said . cars are emotional products bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars usually receive excellent care in germany " the automobile is still a very emotional product , and this emotion is expressed in sportiness , " he said , adding that that leads people to make decisions in the car showroom they might not make if they were deciding while standing at a gas pump . the emotional attachment that makes a fast car more than just a way to get from point a to point b can also be seen by the growing percentage of people buying cars with up to 350 horsepower .
though still less than one percent of car buyers , it has doubled over the last six years , even as fuel prices have increased by 33 percent , dudenhöffer said . " automobiles are very valuable to germans , they have a feeling of freedom in the car , " he said . "
a person 's esteem is very closely connected to what they drive . " fuel price still plays a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas prices have made some consider other means of transportation still , germans are not willing to ignore the price of fuel completely and are often turning to diesel instead of gasoline , dudenhöffer added . " by emphasizing diesels over the last few years , manufactures have done a lot to help consumers , " he said .
" they are helping get around the conflicting objectives of more performance without more consumption . " car buyers are turning to diesel engines because they can get similar performance with less fuel .
the market share of diesel engines has climbed to nearly 45 percent since 2000 in germany , according to dudenhöffer 's report . more cars staying in the garage in addition to switching to diesel , germans are also extending the time between fill-ups by driving less , a separate study showed . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of german car makes have plans to introduce new suvs the decreases , however , may not hold , as a spate of compact sport utility vehicles from volkswagen , opel , audi and mercedes hit the german market over the next year , the trend toward more powerful engines is likely to continue for the short-term , dudenhöffer said . but when planning their long-term strategies , german carmakers may not want to overstress the importance of horsepower as changes occur in other markets , dudenhöffer said .

others in the country welcomed the german head of state 's remarks . poland 's conservative premier , jaroslaw kaczynski , criticized köhler 's appearance at the annual remembrance day for the 12 million germans who fled or were expelled from eastern europe after world war ii . he called köhler 's speech " one of these unsettling events that have taken place recently in germany . " speaking to some 2,000 guests of the league of german expellees , köhler made an appeal for increased dialogue within a greater european context .
he recognized the concerns that have sprung up in poland , particularly following the opening of a controversial exhibit on german and other expellees in berlin in early august . " we should n't ignore these concerns , " he said .
" we should take them seriously , even if we consider them unfounded .
there is no doubt what the cause of escape and expulsion was : the unjust national-socialist regime and world war ii , which germany started . " expellees " part of germa n ide n tity " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski , right , was appointed pm by his twin brother , president lech kaczynski the league of german expellees , chaired by erika steinbach from the conservative party cdu , has celebrated " home day " since 1950 .
the event recalls the fate of germans who fled from the soviet army when world war ii ended , or were expelled from former german territories when europe 's borders were redrawn following the war . kaczynski was referring to the league when he said , " there is a large government-supported group in germany that constantly brings up the polish territories that used to belong to germany . " if there were a similar organization in poland that demanded the return of parts of the ukraine , belarus or lithuania , warsaw would face serious political consequences , added kaczynski .

last year , ates was named germany 's woman of the year for her unstinting battle for the rights of mainly muslim women . given her reputation for toughness and bravery , ates ' recent announcement that she was closing her practice because she felt threatened has sent shockwaves through the german capital . livi n g with threats , i n timidatio n berlin daily der tagesspiegel reported that ates , who has been insulted and threatened by the husbands and relatives of many turkish women she has represented over the years , decided to wind up her work after another similar incident last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ates has riled up the turkish community with her outspoken criticism the muslim husband of one of her clients , whom ates was representing in divorce proceedings , assaulted his wife and tried to attack ates opposite the courtroom where the case was being heard , the paper wrote . " i 'm withdrawing from professional life as a lawyer , my client is living in a women 's shelter , but the assailant is running around scot-free , " ates told the paper , adding that " my life and that of my young daughter have priority . " a statement on ates ' web site said : " it 's once again clear to me how dangerous my work as a lawyer was and how little i was and still am protected as an individual . " " a lot has to cha n ge " ates has also criticized both politicians and police in failing to provide her support and protection . der tagesspiegel reported that ates had applied for police protection last march after turkish daily hürriyet attacked her in a series of articles for her critical statements about the treatment of women in many turkish families .
but the police refused protection , saying there was no indication of a concrete threat , ates said .
the police however have rejected the allegations . " a lot has to change there , " ates told der tagesspiegel .
" the victim protection law has to be urgently expanded . " the german-turkish lawyer , a member of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- since 2004 , has said that the spd too has n't paid any heed to her concerns . " the spd is still dominated by an immigration policy that plays things down , " ates told the paper , saying that politicians always urged citizens to show more courage .
" that is right , but then you also have to protect people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder of hatun sürücü , a turkish woman , by her brother made headlines last year ates ' outspoken criticism of the treatment of women in turkish families in germany has earned her the ire of both turks as well as many left-wingers in favor of multicultural policies .
ates has consistently slammed politicians for turning a blind eye to problems within immigrant communities under the guise of tolerance and fostering diversity . ates however has said that she will continue giving lectures and interviews to highlight the plight of women in turkish and kurdish communities in germany . a n " alarmi n g sig n " ates ' announcement has sparked outrage among politicians , with many calling for expanding victim protection laws to include women who feel threatened . berlin 's interior minister , erhard körting called it an " alarming sign " and said he had " high respect for ates ' work . " others have called for a signature campaign for ates .
ulrich schellenberg , the chairman of the berlin lawyers ' association , called ates ' resignation " dramatic " and said lawyers " must demonstrate solidarity .

" germany wants a letter that should be sent to the unifil and this is something that is in the process , we really have to do it , " siniora told reporters .
doing things properly german chancellor angela merkel on sunday said berlin 's offer of sending its navy to help patrol the lebanese coast still stood but that the country wanted to follow the proper procedures for the sake of its soldiers .
" in this case , it is better to do things properly than to proceed in a hurry , " she said .
" no german government will take a risk that it not justified . "
berlin had been scheduled to receive an official request on sunday and to announce the number of troops it plans to send to lebanon later that day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is much to repair in bombed out beirut a special cabinet sitting to finalize other details of the mission was scheduled for monday , but has also been postponed .
germany needed a request to the un from lebanon , a " robust mandate " from the world body and the approval of the lower house of parliament for the mission , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told reporters on sunday .
no ground troops so far , berlin has ruled out sending ground troops to lebanon , but germany is expected to assume the naval command of the bolstered un force that must police a fragile ceasefire between israel and hezbollah in southern lebanon and stop the flow of arms to the radical shiite organization .
the country is expected to contribute up to 3,000 sea and air troops .
putting an international force in place on lebanon 's coast is important for lebanese businesses as an israeli sea blockade has stopped goods from arriving in lebanese ports since july , lebanese business representatives told afp .
despite calls from the european union and united nations , israel said it would not lift the blockade until an international force is put in place to stop weapons smuggling to hezbollah fighters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants a clear un mandate before sending troops government spokesman wilhelm said the other nations which are likely to help protect lebanon 's coast - denmark , the netherlands , norway and sweden - were also waiting for the green light from beirut before sending naval forces to the region .
the un-brokered truce in lebanon calls for the unifil force in lebanon to expand to up to 15,000 soldiers with a stronger mandate .
they will be joined by a 15,000-strong lebanese army force to prevent hezbollah attacks .
italy has already received its marching orders from the un , and some 890 of its soldiers arrived in lebanon to strengthen the un force already in place there .
additional french ground troops are also expected in the region by the end of the week . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german navy waits for middle east sailing orders political wrangling in lebanon convinced the german government to postpone a cabinet meeting monday to finalize plans for a bundeswehr deployment to patrol lebanon 's mediterranean coast .

last year , ates was named germany 's woman of the year for her unstinting battle for the rights of mainly muslim women . given her reputation for toughness and bravery , ates ' recent announcement that she was closing her practice because she felt threatened has sent shockwaves through the german capital . livi n g with threats , i n timidatio n berlin daily der tagesspiegel reported that ates , who has been insulted and threatened by the husbands and relatives of many turkish women she has represented over the years , decided to wind up her work after another similar incident last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ates has riled up the turkish community with her outspoken criticism the muslim husband of one of her clients , whom ates was representing in divorce proceedings , assaulted his wife and tried to attack ates opposite the courtroom where the case was being heard , the paper wrote . " i 'm withdrawing from professional life as a lawyer , my client is living in a women 's shelter , but the assailant is running around scot-free , " ates told the paper , adding that " my life and that of my young daughter have priority . " a statement on ates ' web site said : " it 's once again clear to me how dangerous my work as a lawyer was and how little i was and still am protected as an individual . " " a lot has to cha n ge " ates has also criticized both politicians and police in failing to provide her support and protection . der tagesspiegel reported that ates had applied for police protection last march after turkish daily hürriyet attacked her in a series of articles for her critical statements about the treatment of women in many turkish families .
but the police refused protection , saying there was no indication of a concrete threat , ates said .
the police however have rejected the allegations . " a lot has to change there , " ates told der tagesspiegel .
" the victim protection law has to be urgently expanded . " the german-turkish lawyer , a member of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- since 2004 , has said that the spd too has n't paid any heed to her concerns . " the spd is still dominated by an immigration policy that plays things down , " ates told the paper , saying that politicians always urged citizens to show more courage .
" that is right , but then you also have to protect people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder of hatun sürücü , a turkish woman , by her brother made headlines last year ates ' outspoken criticism of the treatment of women in turkish families in germany has earned her the ire of both turks as well as many left-wingers in favor of multicultural policies .
ates has consistently slammed politicians for turning a blind eye to problems within immigrant communities under the guise of tolerance and fostering diversity . ates however has said that she will continue giving lectures and interviews to highlight the plight of women in turkish and kurdish communities in germany . a n " alarmi n g sig n " ates ' announcement has sparked outrage among politicians , with many calling for expanding victim protection laws to include women who feel threatened . berlin 's interior minister , erhard körting called it an " alarming sign " and said he had " high respect for ates ' work . " others have called for a signature campaign for ates .
ulrich schellenberg , the chairman of the berlin lawyers ' association , called ates ' resignation " dramatic " and said lawyers " must demonstrate solidarity .

" it really is something new for me , " ballack said in an interview with welt am so n n tag . " as a family it changed the day we left germany and i am still living in a hotel .
it is not that easy to find something in london .

" the main reason to come to england and chelsea was to play with a great team , " ballack said .

a few players speak with an accent and need to speak more slowly with me .
i can understand the foreigners better as they speak more slowly . " ballack also revealed that his chelsea team-mates heard him sing a german song on his arrival at stamford bridge . " it was recommended that i sing in german as no-one understands it , " he said .
" i did not think it was that bad . " ballack injured his hip on his debut for chelsea in the 2-1 community shield defeat to liverpool but has since recovered and has his eye on trophies .

i can understand the foreigners better as they speak more slowly . " ballack also revealed that his chelsea team-mates heard him sing a german song on his arrival at stamford bridge . " it was recommended that i sing in german as no-one understands it , " he said .

others say that jail time and heavy fines are the appropriate punishment .
what most agree on is that stronger measures need to be taken against such perpetrators . " a fine that currently runs up to 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 25,600 -rrb- is too low , " gert sonnleitner , president of the german association of farmers , told german tabloid bild .
" the punishment must be drastically increased in order to protect consumers . " sonnleitner wants offenders ' names published and a ban on such firms from doing business again instituted .
green party parliamentary leader bärbel höhn , meanwhile , told bild that she wants the toughest punishment of all - jail time . " the black sheep of the meat industry belong in prison , " she said . years out of date bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are still investigating a number of bavarian meat dealers german authorities last week confiscated 10 tons of rotten meat from an unnamed munich company 's meat locker .
they also found up to 40 tons of suspicious duck meat at another bavarian business . some of the meat was more than four years past its due date . authorities were also concerned because one of the companies storing the moldy meat has customers across europe .
authorities said monday that at least 26 companies were supplied with meat recently from the company - in five cases so far , the meat was questionable . meanwhile no charges have yet been filed as authorities continue to test meat at restaurants , stores and food stalls . jail as deterrent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the meat found was four years past its expiration date in the aftermath , there have been calls for stronger laws to ensure that such incidents do n't occur in the future . the only way to do that , according to bavarian consumer protection minister werner schnappauf , is to set an example . " it is impossible to inspect each and every steak or schnitzel , " he told german broadcaster ard .
" so we must then ensure that whoever plays fast and loose with the health of citizens in this way must serve jail time .

" the punishment must be drastically increased in order to protect consumers . " sonnleitner wants offenders ' names published and a ban on such firms from doing business again instituted .

" it is impossible to inspect each and every steak or schnitzel , " he told german broadcaster ard .

" i think that the talks that will take place in lebanon have to be conducted to make a request possible , " merkel said monday .
" then we will do things quickly , but not rush if the conditions are not right . " germany needed a request to the un , a " robust mandate " from the world body and the approval of the lower house of parliament for the mission , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told reporters on sunday . un grou n d troops accepted by beirut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian soldiers moved into southern lebanon " without such a request from lebanon to the united nations , the bundeswehr can not participate , " he said .
" we can only send troops if the rules of engagement are clear and there is a stated willingness on the part of lebanon , communicated to the united nations . " italy has already received its marching orders from the un , and some 890 of its soldiers arrived in lebanon to strengthen the un force already in place there .
additional french ground troops are also expected in the region by the end of the week . the lebanese government , including the two hezbollah ministers , has not opposed a united nations force marching into a buffer zone between lebanon and israel , but called protecting its marine borders a task for the national military . allowing a foreign country to stop ships on its coast , which germany requests as part of its mandate , is a major intrusion into national sovereignty , which requires approval from the cabinet , lebanese foreign minister fawzi salloukh told german public broadcaster ard on sunday .

" there is no reason to call the entire mission into question , " he said , adding that the west needed to understand the need for discussion inside the lebanese government . israel wa n ts forces i n place before e n di n g sea blockade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could lead a number of european nations offering naval forces berlin has ruled out sending ground troops to lebanon , but germany is widely expected to assume the naval command of the bolstered un force that must police a fragile ceasefire between israel and hezbollah in southern lebanon . putting an international force in place on lebanon 's coast is important for lebanese businesses as an israeli sea blockade has stopped goods from arriving in lebanese ports since july , lebanese business representatives told afp . despite calls from the european union and united nations , israel said it would not lift the blockade until an international force is put in place to stop weapons smuggling to hezbollah fighters . government spokesman wilhelm said the other nations which are likely to help protect lebanon 's coast - denmark , the netherlands , norway and sweden - were also waiting for the green light from beirut before sending naval forces to the region . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ready for troop deployment on lebanon 's request the mandate of the enlarged un interim force in lebanon is " solid and reasonable " , german chancellor angela merkel said ahead of an expected request from lebanon for troops to be sent to the region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.09.2006 germany reaches agreement on anti-terrorism measure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is on heightened alert following recent bomb scares germany 's federal interior ministers have reached a compromise on a long-planned anti-terrorism database as security concerns take on added urgency in the wake of failed bomb attacks on german trains . amid a heightened sense of vulnerability after the discovery of failed bomb attacks on german trains , interior ministers from germany 's 16 federal states meeting in berlin on monday agreed on a central anti-terrorism database , primarily meant to simplify cooperation and improve networking between germany 's myriad security agencies and thus help investigators hunt terror suspects . the measure - long a sticking-point between germany 's main ruling parties - foresees a two-part database that brings together information collected by germany 's police and intelligence agencies , separated since the end of world war ii because of nazi-era security abuses . " the ant-terror database will be a central component in effectively fighting terrorism , " police union head konrad freiberg said on monday . deep reservatio n s about database though the current grand coalition made up of social democrats and the conservatives agreed on setting up a central anti-terrorism database last year , the two parties have differed on its exact shape and reach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a proliferation of security agencies on account of its federal structure the idea is that all police and intelligence agencies , both at the federal and national level , would gather information about terror suspects and terrorist organizations in a central database that would be accessible to all crime-fighting agencies .
at present , germany 's 37 agencies do that separately .
the central anti-terrorism database would also contain information about banking , telecommunication and internet information regarding the suspects . in addition to problems stemming from germany 's federal structure , critics had feared the database would create more bureacracy as well as erode people 's privacy . germany 's social democrats and the opposition greens and the left party also expressed concerns that easily accessible information on terrorism suspects could be misused as well as create legal problems given the differing information-gathering methods of the police and intelligence agencies . " a complete central anti-terrorism database would mean that we 'd get a gigantic flood of data that you 'd no longer be able to get a grip on , " said claudia roth , green party chairwoman .
" besides , we 'd have the problem that intelligence information would no longer be protected . " should religio n be i n cluded ? monday 's compromise foresees a two-part database .
one will contain the identity of the terror suspect while the other will hold details about his religion , travel abroad , possession of weapons etc . sharp differences earlier also centered on whether a suspect 's religion should be included in the database . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- pleaded in favor of the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are split on including the religion of terror suspects in the database " naturally we should only collect and network data that is really relevant to fighting danger and is really necessary , " schäuble told the magazine super illu .
" and i believe that religion and profession do belong there . " however , politicians from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party were against the measure , arguing that it would violate the constitution . experts war n of hysteria politicians have also warned that the threat of terrorism in germany would increase through a possible deployment of the german army to southern lebanon . " the german army might be controlling weapons smuggling to hezbollah by sea , " said bavarian interior minister günther beckstein .
" the terror threat in germany will rise due to that . " on the eve of the conference , german chancellor angela merkel stressed that the state had to play a more active role in beefing up germany 's defenses . " we need more security , we need more state , " merkel said a party conference , adding it was apparent that video surveillance needed to be expanded in germany after the failed bomb attacks on passenger trains in dortmund and koblenz in july . however , germany 's federal data protection commissioner peter schaar has warned of security paranoia and hysteria , saying he is concerned that germany was " increasingly developing into a surveillance-obsessed society . " i consider the aimless gathering and processing of data not only inefficient , but also a legally , highly problematic path , " schaar said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts say germany needs better tools to fight terror the foiling of potentially devastating bomb attacks in britain has germany reviewing its own fight against terror .

" the ant-terror database will be a central component in effectively fighting terrorism , " police union head konrad freiberg said on monday . deep reservatio n s about database though the current grand coalition made up of social democrats and the conservatives agreed on setting up a central anti-terrorism database last year , the two parties have differed on its exact shape and reach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a proliferation of security agencies on account of its federal structure the idea is that all police and intelligence agencies , both at the federal and national level , would gather information about terror suspects and terrorist organizations in a central database that would be accessible to all crime-fighting agencies .
at present , germany 's 37 agencies do that separately .
the central anti-terrorism database would also contain information about banking , telecommunication and internet information regarding the suspects . in addition to problems stemming from germany 's federal structure , critics had feared the database would create more bureacracy as well as erode people 's privacy . germany 's social democrats and the opposition greens and the left party also expressed concerns that easily accessible information on terrorism suspects could be misused as well as create legal problems given the differing information-gathering methods of the police and intelligence agencies . " a complete central anti-terrorism database would mean that we 'd get a gigantic flood of data that you 'd no longer be able to get a grip on , " said claudia roth , green party chairwoman .
" besides , we 'd have the problem that intelligence information would no longer be protected . " should religio n be i n cluded ? monday 's compromise foresees a two-part database .
one will contain the identity of the terror suspect while the other will hold details about his religion , travel abroad , possession of weapons etc . sharp differences earlier also centered on whether a suspect 's religion should be included in the database . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- pleaded in favor of the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are split on including the religion of terror suspects in the database " naturally we should only collect and network data that is really relevant to fighting danger and is really necessary , " schäuble told the magazine super illu .
" and i believe that religion and profession do belong there . " however , politicians from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party were against the measure , arguing that it would violate the constitution . experts war n of hysteria politicians have also warned that the threat of terrorism in germany would increase through a possible deployment of the german army to southern lebanon . " the german army might be controlling weapons smuggling to hezbollah by sea , " said bavarian interior minister günther beckstein .
" the terror threat in germany will rise due to that . " on the eve of the conference , german chancellor angela merkel stressed that the state had to play a more active role in beefing up germany 's defenses . " we need more security , we need more state , " merkel said a party conference , adding it was apparent that video surveillance needed to be expanded in germany after the failed bomb attacks on passenger trains in dortmund and koblenz in july . however , germany 's federal data protection commissioner peter schaar has warned of security paranoia and hysteria , saying he is concerned that germany was " increasingly developing into a surveillance-obsessed society . " i consider the aimless gathering and processing of data not only inefficient , but also a legally , highly problematic path , " schaar said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts say germany needs better tools to fight terror the foiling of potentially devastating bomb attacks in britain has germany reviewing its own fight against terror .

others in the country welcomed the german head of state 's remarks . poland 's conservative premier , jaroslaw kaczynski , criticized köhler 's appearance at the annual remembrance day for the 12 million germans who fled or were expelled from eastern europe after world war ii . he called köhler 's speech " one of these unsettling events that have taken place recently in germany . " speaking to some 2,000 guests of the league of german expellees , köhler made an appeal for increased dialogue within a greater european context .
he recognized the concerns that have sprung up in poland , particularly following the opening of a controversial exhibit on german and other expellees in berlin in early august . " we should n't ignore these concerns , " he said .
" we should take them seriously , even if we consider them unfounded .
there is no doubt what the cause of escape and expulsion was : the unjust national-socialist regime and world war ii , which germany started . " expellees " part of germa n ide n tity " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski , right , was appointed pm by his twin brother , president lech kaczynski the league of german expellees , chaired by erika steinbach from the conservative party cdu , has celebrated " home day " since 1950 .
the event recalls the fate of germans who fled from the soviet army when world war ii ended , or were expelled from former german territories when europe 's borders were redrawn following the war . kaczynski was referring to the league when he said , " there is a large government-supported group in germany that constantly brings up the polish territories that used to belong to germany . " if there were a similar organization in poland that demanded the return of parts of the ukraine , belarus or lithuania , warsaw would face serious political consequences , added kaczynski . " we just want the principle of symmetry to be applied here so that everyone is treated the same , " he said . köhler said that germany 's former territories to the east were part of his country 's cultural heritage , even if irrevocably no longer part of germany and that the culture and history of the expellees was part of german identity . kaczy n ski 's opi n io n n ot the o n ly o n e i n pola n d according to a monday article in the warsaw daily gazeta wyborcza , kaczynski 's statements may not be representative of the polish media or his country 's population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach has advocated for a permanent expellee center in berlin köhler 's words " were positive , from the polish perspective , " wrote the paper , because " he began with sept .
1 , 1939 as the beginning of the expulsions .

11 rattled not just new york city and the western world , but the middle east as well the terror , war and chaos that have occurred since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks have led to destabilization in the arab world and an ever-widening rift with the west . how has the arab world changed since sept .
11 , 2001 ?
that 's no easier to answer than the question of how this politically important region will develop in the future . " it can not be denied that new , radical currents and previously unknown terror groups have surfaced since the horrible events on sept .
11 .
it 's often unclear who is actually supporting the terror groups , " said sagie qurqmas , a well-known writer and historian from syria . " since sept .
11 , the west , especially the us , has continued to accuse the arabs of being the source of radicalism and terrorism , " he said . " even if this is true of some arabs , the majority can not be characterized by this minority .
radicalism is present in all societies , regardless of religion or nationality . " a deepening divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us tactics have driven moderates into terrorist groups , said qurqmas qurqmas says that the united states ' " failed policy of violence and occupation " has driven many more moderate arabs into the radical camp .
the west 's blanket accusations have only deepened the fissure with the arab world , he said . he named the occupation of iraq , the failure of the palestinian-israeli peace process , and the israeli-lebanese war - " not to mention the west 's ambivalent treatment of fundamental issues like democracy and human rights " - as contributors to the widening rift . until the events on sept .
11 , western democracies had served as role models of secular powers for the arab world , which was seeking to replace the repressive , totalitarian regimes in the region with democratic societies . however , human rights violations in guantanamo bay and abu ghraib , the cia affair in europe and the united states ' unconditional support of israel in its war against the palestinians and lebanese have considerably detracted from the credibility of the us and its european allies in the arab world . doubting democracy " no one here wants to hear anything from the west , " wrote journalist abdel-karim shaheen .
" the leading opinion today is that sermons about western democracy have lost their significance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us presence in iraq has deepend the divide between the west and the middle east what kind of democracy sends in tanks , bombs and fighter jets , asked shaheen , and is worth tens of thousands of lives and the destruction of essential infrastructure ?
the journalist believes that the west is not really interested in democratization , rather in securing oil and other economic markets . a domestic threat on the other hand , the strengthening of radical islamic groups represents a threat to the arab world itself , said both iranian journalist and lawyer najh al-obaidi and syrian journalist atef afif .
tightened domestic security measures and new anti-terror laws are results of the threat , which has already become apparent in egypt , tunisia , morocco , saudi arabia , jordan , syria and elsewhere . new laws , however , have restricted individual rights even further and hindered democratic reforms .
author and columnist jameel abu hassan said citizens are more than willing to make the compromise . " the people prefer living in a police state than in a country where chaos reigns and blood is spilled , which is the case in iraq under american-british occupation , " said hassan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear the national borders in the middle east will be redrawn by western powers five years after sept .
11 , 2001 , the future of the arab world is alarming .
the peace process in palestine has come to a dead end , iraq is on the brink of a civil war , and the perspectives in lebanon after the recent war are across the board . fear of new borders the people in the region fear that the us may redraw the national borders in the arab world , which us foreign minister condoleezza rice proposed during the war in lebanon , and try to impose the new divisions with military force together with its allies , said both atef afif and lebanese journalist ghassn abu hamad . the fear is that the territories would be distributed according to religious groups , which would then fight against each other ad infinitum , said the two journalists . nevertheless , despite crisis and irritation , " the arab world and the western world are dependent on each other , " said hamad .

" i think that the talks that will take place in lebanon have to be conducted to make a request possible , " merkel said monday .
" then we will do things quickly , but not rush if the conditions are not right . " germany needed a request to the un , a " robust mandate " from the world body and the approval of the lower house of parliament for the mission , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told reporters on sunday . un grou n d troops accepted by beirut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian soldiers moved into southern lebanon " without such a request from lebanon to the united nations , the bundeswehr can not participate , " he said .
" we can only send troops if the rules of engagement are clear and there is a stated willingness on the part of lebanon , communicated to the united nations . " italy has already received its marching orders from the un , and some 890 of its soldiers arrived in lebanon to strengthen the un force already in place there .
additional french ground troops are also expected in the region by the end of the week . the lebanese government , including the two hezbollah ministers , has not opposed a united nations force marching into a buffer zone between lebanon and israel , but called protecting its marine borders a task for the national military . allowing a foreign country to stop ships on its coast , which germany requests as part of its mandate , is a major intrusion into national sovereignty , which requires approval from the cabinet , lebanese foreign minister fawzi salloukh told german public broadcaster ard on sunday . " we may discuss it -lrb- monday -rrb- and reach a decision , " he added . germa n oppositio n calls for troops to stay home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle said german troops should not deploy to the middle east the murky situation on the ground in lebanon is reason enough for " germany not to send any armed troops to the middle east , " according to the german opposition free market , liberal free democratic party leader guido westerwelle . but german deputy foreign minister gernot erler told deutschlandfunk radio on monday that he did not see the political discussions in lebanon as endangering a un mission to the middle east . " there is no reason to call the entire mission into question , " he said , adding that the west needed to understand the need for discussion inside the lebanese government . israel wa n ts forces i n place before e n di n g sea blockade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could lead a number of european nations offering naval forces berlin has ruled out sending ground troops to lebanon , but germany is widely expected to assume the naval command of the bolstered un force that must police a fragile ceasefire between israel and hezbollah in southern lebanon . putting an international force in place on lebanon 's coast is important for lebanese businesses as an israeli sea blockade has stopped goods from arriving in lebanese ports since july , lebanese business representatives told afp . despite calls from the european union and united nations , israel said it would not lift the blockade until an international force is put in place to stop weapons smuggling to hezbollah fighters . government spokesman wilhelm said the other nations which are likely to help protect lebanon 's coast - denmark , the netherlands , norway and sweden - were also waiting for the green light from beirut before sending naval forces to the region . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ready for troop deployment on lebanon 's request the mandate of the enlarged un interim force in lebanon is " solid and reasonable " , german chancellor angela merkel said ahead of an expected request from lebanon for troops to be sent to the region .

" the ant-terror database will be a central component in effectively fighting terrorism , " police union head konrad freiberg said on monday . deep reservatio n s about database though the current grand coalition made up of social democrats and the conservatives agreed on setting up a central anti-terrorism database last year , the two parties have differed on its exact shape and reach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a proliferation of security agencies on account of its federal structure the idea is that all police and intelligence agencies , both at the federal and national level , would gather information about terror suspects and terrorist organizations in a central database that would be accessible to all crime-fighting agencies .
at present , germany 's 37 agencies do that separately .
the central anti-terrorism database would also contain information about banking , telecommunication and internet information regarding the suspects . in addition to problems stemming from germany 's federal structure , critics had feared the database would create more bureacracy as well as erode people 's privacy . germany 's social democrats and the opposition greens and the left party also expressed concerns that easily accessible information on terrorism suspects could be misused as well as create legal problems given the differing information-gathering methods of the police and intelligence agencies . " a complete central anti-terrorism database would mean that we 'd get a gigantic flood of data that you 'd no longer be able to get a grip on , " said claudia roth , green party chairwoman .
" besides , we 'd have the problem that intelligence information would no longer be protected . " should religio n be i n cluded ? monday 's compromise foresees a two-part database .
one will contain the identity of the terror suspect while the other will hold details about his religion , travel abroad , possession of weapons etc . sharp differences earlier also centered on whether a suspect 's religion should be included in the database . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- pleaded in favor of the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are split on including the religion of terror suspects in the database " naturally we should only collect and network data that is really relevant to fighting danger and is really necessary , " schäuble told the magazine super illu .
" and i believe that religion and profession do belong there . " however , politicians from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party were against the measure , arguing that it would violate the constitution . experts war n of hysteria politicians have also warned that the threat of terrorism in germany would increase through a possible deployment of the german army to southern lebanon . " the german army might be controlling weapons smuggling to hezbollah by sea , " said bavarian interior minister günther beckstein .
" the terror threat in germany will rise due to that . " on the eve of the conference , german chancellor angela merkel stressed that the state had to play a more active role in beefing up germany 's defenses . " we need more security , we need more state , " merkel said a party conference , adding it was apparent that video surveillance needed to be expanded in germany after the failed bomb attacks on passenger trains in dortmund and koblenz in july . however , germany 's federal data protection commissioner peter schaar has warned of security paranoia and hysteria , saying he is concerned that germany was " increasingly developing into a surveillance-obsessed society . " i consider the aimless gathering and processing of data not only inefficient , but also a legally , highly problematic path , " schaar said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts say germany needs better tools to fight terror the foiling of potentially devastating bomb attacks in britain has germany reviewing its own fight against terror .

last year , ates was named germany 's woman of the year for her unstinting battle for the rights of mainly muslim women . given her reputation for toughness and bravery , ates ' recent announcement that she was closing her practice because she felt threatened has sent shockwaves through the german capital . livi n g with threats , i n timidatio n berlin daily der tagesspiegel reported that ates , who has been insulted and threatened by the husbands and relatives of many turkish women she has represented over the years , decided to wind up her work after another similar incident last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ates has riled up the turkish community with her outspoken criticism the muslim husband of one of her clients , whom ates was representing in divorce proceedings , assaulted his wife and tried to attack ates opposite the courtroom where the case was being heard , the paper wrote .

" a statement on ates ' web site said : " it 's once again clear to me how dangerous my work as a lawyer was and how little i was and still am protected as an individual . " " a lot has to cha n ge " ates has also criticized both politicians and police in failing to provide her support and protection . der tagesspiegel reported that ates had applied for police protection last march after turkish daily hürriyet attacked her in a series of articles for her critical statements about the treatment of women in many turkish families .

" the spd is still dominated by an immigration policy that plays things down , " ates told the paper , saying that politicians always urged citizens to show more courage .
" that is right , but then you also have to protect people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder of hatun sürücü , a turkish woman , by her brother made headlines last year ates ' outspoken criticism of the treatment of women in turkish families in germany has earned her the ire of both turks as well as many left-wingers in favor of multicultural policies .
ates has consistently slammed politicians for turning a blind eye to problems within immigrant communities under the guise of tolerance and fostering diversity . ates however has said that she will continue giving lectures and interviews to highlight the plight of women in turkish and kurdish communities in germany . a n " alarmi n g sig n " ates ' announcement has sparked outrage among politicians , with many calling for expanding victim protection laws to include women who feel threatened . berlin 's interior minister , erhard körting called it an " alarming sign " and said he had " high respect for ates ' work .

last year , ates was named germany 's woman of the year for her unstinting battle for the rights of mainly muslim women . given her reputation for toughness and bravery , ates ' recent announcement that she was closing her practice because she felt threatened has sent shockwaves through the german capital . livi n g with threats , i n timidatio n berlin daily der tagesspiegel reported that ates , who has been insulted and threatened by the husbands and relatives of many turkish women she has represented over the years , decided to wind up her work after another similar incident last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ates has riled up the turkish community with her outspoken criticism the muslim husband of one of her clients , whom ates was representing in divorce proceedings , assaulted his wife and tried to attack ates opposite the courtroom where the case was being heard , the paper wrote . " i 'm withdrawing from professional life as a lawyer , my client is living in a women 's shelter , but the assailant is running around scot-free , " ates told the paper , adding that " my life and that of my young daughter have priority . " a statement on ates ' web site said : " it 's once again clear to me how dangerous my work as a lawyer was and how little i was and still am protected as an individual . " " a lot has to cha n ge " ates has also criticized both politicians and police in failing to provide her support and protection . der tagesspiegel reported that ates had applied for police protection last march after turkish daily hürriyet attacked her in a series of articles for her critical statements about the treatment of women in many turkish families .
but the police refused protection , saying there was no indication of a concrete threat , ates said .
the police however have rejected the allegations . " a lot has to change there , " ates told der tagesspiegel .
" the victim protection law has to be urgently expanded . " the german-turkish lawyer , a member of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- since 2004 , has said that the spd too has n't paid any heed to her concerns . " the spd is still dominated by an immigration policy that plays things down , " ates told the paper , saying that politicians always urged citizens to show more courage .
" that is right , but then you also have to protect people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder of hatun sürücü , a turkish woman , by her brother made headlines last year ates ' outspoken criticism of the treatment of women in turkish families in germany has earned her the ire of both turks as well as many left-wingers in favor of multicultural policies .
ates has consistently slammed politicians for turning a blind eye to problems within immigrant communities under the guise of tolerance and fostering diversity . ates however has said that she will continue giving lectures and interviews to highlight the plight of women in turkish and kurdish communities in germany . a n " alarmi n g sig n " ates ' announcement has sparked outrage among politicians , with many calling for expanding victim protection laws to include women who feel threatened . berlin 's interior minister , erhard körting called it an " alarming sign " and said he had " high respect for ates ' work . " others have called for a signature campaign for ates .
ulrich schellenberg , the chairman of the berlin lawyers ' association , called ates ' resignation " dramatic " and said lawyers " must demonstrate solidarity .

tightened domestic security measures and new anti-terror laws are results of the threat , which has already become apparent in egypt , tunisia , morocco , saudi arabia , jordan , syria and elsewhere . new laws , however , have restricted individual rights even further and hindered democratic reforms .

others say that jail time and heavy fines are the appropriate punishment .
what most agree on is that stronger measures need to be taken against such perpetrators . " a fine that currently runs up to 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 25,600 -rrb- is too low , " gert sonnleitner , president of the german association of farmers , told german tabloid bild .
" the punishment must be drastically increased in order to protect consumers . " sonnleitner wants offenders ' names published and a ban on such firms from doing business again instituted .
green party parliamentary leader bärbel höhn , meanwhile , told bild that she wants the toughest punishment of all - jail time . " the black sheep of the meat industry belong in prison , " she said . years out of date bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are still investigating a number of bavarian meat dealers german authorities last week confiscated 10 tons of rotten meat from an unnamed munich company 's meat locker .
they also found up to 40 tons of suspicious duck meat at another bavarian business . some of the meat was more than four years past its due date . authorities were also concerned because one of the companies storing the moldy meat has customers across europe .
authorities said monday that at least 26 companies were supplied with meat recently from the company - in five cases so far , the meat was questionable . meanwhile no charges have yet been filed as authorities continue to test meat at restaurants , stores and food stalls . jail as deterrent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the meat found was four years past its expiration date in the aftermath , there have been calls for stronger laws to ensure that such incidents do n't occur in the future . the only way to do that , according to bavarian consumer protection minister werner schnappauf , is to set an example . " it is impossible to inspect each and every steak or schnitzel , " he told german broadcaster ard .
" so we must then ensure that whoever plays fast and loose with the health of citizens in this way must serve jail time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.09.2006 small cars take a back seat for german car buyers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even on the autobahn , a bigger engine does n't guarantee a quick arrival even after gas prices hit a six-month low in august , germans are still unhappy when it comes time to fill up .
but they 're not upset enough to stop buying cars with bigger motors and more horsepower . maybe it 's a desire to take full advantage of those freeways with no speed limits ; maybe it 's a kind of compensation for other perceived shortcomings or mid-life crises - either way germans are flocking towards new cars with more muscular , and thirstier , engines .
the trend has surprised the author of a study tracking car buying and gas price trends since 2000 . " we really did not expect this high increase in horsepower despite high fuel prices , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer of b & d forecast . some 17 percent of german auto buyers were interested in cars with less than 70 horsepower six years ago .
but in 2006 , only 9 percent want the smaller engines .
over the same period of time , sales of cars with between 136 and 190 horsepower doubled to 27 percent , dudenhöffer said . cars are emotional products bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars usually receive excellent care in germany " the automobile is still a very emotional product , and this emotion is expressed in sportiness , " he said , adding that that leads people to make decisions in the car showroom they might not make if they were deciding while standing at a gas pump . the emotional attachment that makes a fast car more than just a way to get from point a to point b can also be seen by the growing percentage of people buying cars with up to 350 horsepower .
though still less than one percent of car buyers , it has doubled over the last six years , even as fuel prices have increased by 33 percent , dudenhöffer said . " automobiles are very valuable to germans , they have a feeling of freedom in the car , " he said . "
a person 's esteem is very closely connected to what they drive . " fuel price still plays a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas prices have made some consider other means of transportation still , germans are not willing to ignore the price of fuel completely and are often turning to diesel instead of gasoline , dudenhöffer added . " by emphasizing diesels over the last few years , manufactures have done a lot to help consumers , " he said .
" they are helping get around the conflicting objectives of more performance without more consumption . " car buyers are turning to diesel engines because they can get similar performance with less fuel .
the market share of diesel engines has climbed to nearly 45 percent since 2000 in germany , according to dudenhöffer 's report . more cars staying in the garage in addition to switching to diesel , germans are also extending the time between fill-ups by driving less , a separate study showed . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of german car makes have plans to introduce new suvs the decreases , however , may not hold , as a spate of compact sport utility vehicles from volkswagen , opel , audi and mercedes hit the german market over the next year , the trend toward more powerful engines is likely to continue for the short-term , dudenhöffer said . but when planning their long-term strategies , german carmakers may not want to overstress the importance of horsepower as changes occur in other markets , dudenhöffer said . " in the usa we are seeing that all the big suvs are turning into the americans ' slow sellers , " he said .
" this is a very high economic burden for general motors , ford and chrysler .

but they 're not upset enough to stop buying cars with bigger motors and more horsepower . maybe it 's a desire to take full advantage of those freeways with no speed limits ; maybe it 's a kind of compensation for other perceived shortcomings or mid-life crises - either way germans are flocking towards new cars with more muscular , and thirstier , engines .
the trend has surprised the author of a study tracking car buying and gas price trends since 2000 . " we really did not expect this high increase in horsepower despite high fuel prices , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer of b & d forecast . some 17 percent of german auto buyers were interested in cars with less than 70 horsepower six years ago .

though still less than one percent of car buyers , it has doubled over the last six years , even as fuel prices have increased by 33 percent , dudenhöffer said . " automobiles are very valuable to germans , they have a feeling of freedom in the car , " he said . "
a person 's esteem is very closely connected to what they drive . " fuel price still plays a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas prices have made some consider other means of transportation still , germans are not willing to ignore the price of fuel completely and are often turning to diesel instead of gasoline , dudenhöffer added . " by emphasizing diesels over the last few years , manufactures have done a lot to help consumers , " he said .
" they are helping get around the conflicting objectives of more performance without more consumption . " car buyers are turning to diesel engines because they can get similar performance with less fuel .
the market share of diesel engines has climbed to nearly 45 percent since 2000 in germany , according to dudenhöffer 's report . more cars staying in the garage in addition to switching to diesel , germans are also extending the time between fill-ups by driving less , a separate study showed . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of german car makes have plans to introduce new suvs the decreases , however , may not hold , as a spate of compact sport utility vehicles from volkswagen , opel , audi and mercedes hit the german market over the next year , the trend toward more powerful engines is likely to continue for the short-term , dudenhöffer said . but when planning their long-term strategies , german carmakers may not want to overstress the importance of horsepower as changes occur in other markets , dudenhöffer said .

" germany wants a letter that should be sent to the unifil and this is something that is in the process , we really have to do it , " siniora told reporters .
doing things properly german chancellor angela merkel on sunday said berlin 's offer of sending its navy to help patrol the lebanese coast still stood but that the country wanted to follow the proper procedures for the sake of its soldiers .
" in this case , it is better to do things properly than to proceed in a hurry , " she said .
" no german government will take a risk that it not justified . "

germany needed a request to the un from lebanon , a " robust mandate " from the world body and the approval of the lower house of parliament for the mission , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told reporters on sunday .
no ground troops so far , berlin has ruled out sending ground troops to lebanon , but germany is expected to assume the naval command of the bolstered un force that must police a fragile ceasefire between israel and hezbollah in southern lebanon and stop the flow of arms to the radical shiite organization .

the un-brokered truce in lebanon calls for the unifil force in lebanon to expand to up to 15,000 soldiers with a stronger mandate .
they will be joined by a 15,000-strong lebanese army force to prevent hezbollah attacks .

" i think that the talks that will take place in lebanon have to be conducted to make a request possible , " merkel said monday .
" then we will do things quickly , but not rush if the conditions are not right . " germany needed a request to the un , a " robust mandate " from the world body and the approval of the lower house of parliament for the mission , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told reporters on sunday . un grou n d troops accepted by beirut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian soldiers moved into southern lebanon " without such a request from lebanon to the united nations , the bundeswehr can not participate , " he said .
" we can only send troops if the rules of engagement are clear and there is a stated willingness on the part of lebanon , communicated to the united nations . " italy has already received its marching orders from the un , and some 890 of its soldiers arrived in lebanon to strengthen the un force already in place there .
additional french ground troops are also expected in the region by the end of the week . the lebanese government , including the two hezbollah ministers , has not opposed a united nations force marching into a buffer zone between lebanon and israel , but called protecting its marine borders a task for the national military . allowing a foreign country to stop ships on its coast , which germany requests as part of its mandate , is a major intrusion into national sovereignty , which requires approval from the cabinet , lebanese foreign minister fawzi salloukh told german public broadcaster ard on sunday . " we may discuss it -lrb- monday -rrb- and reach a decision , " he added . germa n oppositio n calls for troops to stay home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle said german troops should not deploy to the middle east the murky situation on the ground in lebanon is reason enough for " germany not to send any armed troops to the middle east , " according to the german opposition free market , liberal free democratic party leader guido westerwelle . but german deputy foreign minister gernot erler told deutschlandfunk radio on monday that he did not see the political discussions in lebanon as endangering a un mission to the middle east . " there is no reason to call the entire mission into question , " he said , adding that the west needed to understand the need for discussion inside the lebanese government . israel wa n ts forces i n place before e n di n g sea blockade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could lead a number of european nations offering naval forces berlin has ruled out sending ground troops to lebanon , but germany is widely expected to assume the naval command of the bolstered un force that must police a fragile ceasefire between israel and hezbollah in southern lebanon . putting an international force in place on lebanon 's coast is important for lebanese businesses as an israeli sea blockade has stopped goods from arriving in lebanese ports since july , lebanese business representatives told afp . despite calls from the european union and united nations , israel said it would not lift the blockade until an international force is put in place to stop weapons smuggling to hezbollah fighters . government spokesman wilhelm said the other nations which are likely to help protect lebanon 's coast - denmark , the netherlands , norway and sweden - were also waiting for the green light from beirut before sending naval forces to the region . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ready for troop deployment on lebanon 's request the mandate of the enlarged un interim force in lebanon is " solid and reasonable " , german chancellor angela merkel said ahead of an expected request from lebanon for troops to be sent to the region .

" the ant-terror database will be a central component in effectively fighting terrorism , " police union head konrad freiberg said on monday . deep reservatio n s about database though the current grand coalition made up of social democrats and the conservatives agreed on setting up a central anti-terrorism database last year , the two parties have differed on its exact shape and reach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a proliferation of security agencies on account of its federal structure the idea is that all police and intelligence agencies , both at the federal and national level , would gather information about terror suspects and terrorist organizations in a central database that would be accessible to all crime-fighting agencies .
at present , germany 's 37 agencies do that separately .
the central anti-terrorism database would also contain information about banking , telecommunication and internet information regarding the suspects . in addition to problems stemming from germany 's federal structure , critics had feared the database would create more bureacracy as well as erode people 's privacy . germany 's social democrats and the opposition greens and the left party also expressed concerns that easily accessible information on terrorism suspects could be misused as well as create legal problems given the differing information-gathering methods of the police and intelligence agencies . " a complete central anti-terrorism database would mean that we 'd get a gigantic flood of data that you 'd no longer be able to get a grip on , " said claudia roth , green party chairwoman .
" besides , we 'd have the problem that intelligence information would no longer be protected . " should religio n be i n cluded ? monday 's compromise foresees a two-part database .
one will contain the identity of the terror suspect while the other will hold details about his religion , travel abroad , possession of weapons etc . sharp differences earlier also centered on whether a suspect 's religion should be included in the database . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- pleaded in favor of the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are split on including the religion of terror suspects in the database " naturally we should only collect and network data that is really relevant to fighting danger and is really necessary , " schäuble told the magazine super illu .

" the german army might be controlling weapons smuggling to hezbollah by sea , " said bavarian interior minister günther beckstein .
" the terror threat in germany will rise due to that . " on the eve of the conference , german chancellor angela merkel stressed that the state had to play a more active role in beefing up germany 's defenses . " we need more security , we need more state , " merkel said a party conference , adding it was apparent that video surveillance needed to be expanded in germany after the failed bomb attacks on passenger trains in dortmund and koblenz in july . however , germany 's federal data protection commissioner peter schaar has warned of security paranoia and hysteria , saying he is concerned that germany was " increasingly developing into a surveillance-obsessed society .

" the ant-terror database will be a central component in effectively fighting terrorism , " police union head konrad freiberg said on monday . deep reservatio n s about database though the current grand coalition made up of social democrats and the conservatives agreed on setting up a central anti-terrorism database last year , the two parties have differed on its exact shape and reach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a proliferation of security agencies on account of its federal structure the idea is that all police and intelligence agencies , both at the federal and national level , would gather information about terror suspects and terrorist organizations in a central database that would be accessible to all crime-fighting agencies .
at present , germany 's 37 agencies do that separately .
the central anti-terrorism database would also contain information about banking , telecommunication and internet information regarding the suspects . in addition to problems stemming from germany 's federal structure , critics had feared the database would create more bureacracy as well as erode people 's privacy . germany 's social democrats and the opposition greens and the left party also expressed concerns that easily accessible information on terrorism suspects could be misused as well as create legal problems given the differing information-gathering methods of the police and intelligence agencies . " a complete central anti-terrorism database would mean that we 'd get a gigantic flood of data that you 'd no longer be able to get a grip on , " said claudia roth , green party chairwoman .
" besides , we 'd have the problem that intelligence information would no longer be protected . " should religio n be i n cluded ? monday 's compromise foresees a two-part database .
one will contain the identity of the terror suspect while the other will hold details about his religion , travel abroad , possession of weapons etc . sharp differences earlier also centered on whether a suspect 's religion should be included in the database . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- pleaded in favor of the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are split on including the religion of terror suspects in the database " naturally we should only collect and network data that is really relevant to fighting danger and is really necessary , " schäuble told the magazine super illu .
" and i believe that religion and profession do belong there . " however , politicians from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party were against the measure , arguing that it would violate the constitution . experts war n of hysteria politicians have also warned that the threat of terrorism in germany would increase through a possible deployment of the german army to southern lebanon . " the german army might be controlling weapons smuggling to hezbollah by sea , " said bavarian interior minister günther beckstein .
" the terror threat in germany will rise due to that . " on the eve of the conference , german chancellor angela merkel stressed that the state had to play a more active role in beefing up germany 's defenses . " we need more security , we need more state , " merkel said a party conference , adding it was apparent that video surveillance needed to be expanded in germany after the failed bomb attacks on passenger trains in dortmund and koblenz in july . however , germany 's federal data protection commissioner peter schaar has warned of security paranoia and hysteria , saying he is concerned that germany was " increasingly developing into a surveillance-obsessed society . " i consider the aimless gathering and processing of data not only inefficient , but also a legally , highly problematic path , " schaar said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts say germany needs better tools to fight terror the foiling of potentially devastating bomb attacks in britain has germany reviewing its own fight against terror .

jugs , plates , remnants of a public bath and a paved street reveal a surprisingly modern people . the mass of dirt directly across from the plenary hall in bonn 's former government quarter looks like the surface of the moon .
deep pockets have been dug out in several spots and three excavators are boring their way deeper into the ground . nora andrikopoulou-strack is standing on one of the other-worldly dirt mounds , with clay-smeared boots on her feet and a broad smile on her face . she is responsible for turning this construction site into an archeological dig . " this dig site is , technically speaking , the greatest coherent window into the history of a roman vicus that we 've ever had in germany , " she said . converted un construction site bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it came to floor heating systems , the romans were well ahead of their time construction workers were in the middle of building a new un convention center when they quite literally ran into the vicus , that is , a roman village .
the building project has now been put on hold while archeologists uncover the plates , pots , bones and other historical treasures that lie three meters -lrb- 10 feet -rrb- underground . excavators and shovels are used for the rough work before rakes are brought in for the parts of the process that require a finer , more detailed touch . " actually it 's a garden tool , " said an assistant in the dirt-coated overalls , referring to the rake .
" we can use it to clean off parallel surfaces . " everything that the 50-person team has uncovered in the past several weeks - cups , jugs , pottery shards , hair pins and bones - has been cleaned up , numbered and carefully stored .
some 300 boxes have already been filled with artifacts discovered in the ancient apartments , hidden for so many years underground . thermal baths and paved roads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2,000 people probably lived in the roman village " this plate is a particular highlight .
it really looks as if it just came from the potter 's workshop .
after more than 2,000 years the quality is still excellent , " said head archeologist peter hendrick , holding up a piece of porcelain . in addition to claudius secundus , whose name is on one of the plates , around 2,000 people must have lived in the village .
they made their homes in stable houses with shops at the front and gardens out back . the village boasted a paved street , a temple and a brick oven , and apparently also had a public bath with floor heating . civilizations shared the same space the artifacts hendrick and his team have found are not limited to roman times , however .
more recent items , from the 19th and 20th centuries , have also been discovered . the numerous bottles and caps that have surfaced offer insight into the history of bonn 's breweries , for example .
a rusted american helmet from world war ii - with a bullet hole - was also among the finds . marcus boesch -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de traveling into the past at germany 's open-air museums people curious about life in earlier times in germany can visit the numerous outdoor museums the country has to offer .

11 changed the world more than images : sept .
11 as a key event for online media daily life has n't changed for americans since sept .
11 germany 's solidarity with us waning after sept .
11 " on that day , i just ran " germany -pipe- 04.09.2006 " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the terrorist attacks , many americans abroad wanted to be " back home " sept .
11 shook americans inside and outside the us .
for those abroad , " home " had suddenly become unsafe .
five years on , ex-pats in germany and other european countries still feel uneasy - because of anti-americanism . " when i look back at sept .
11 , 2001 , it always makes me gasp , " said kelly , an american who has resided in germany for 17 years .
it 's pretty much like ground zero .
it 's still like a big hole in my stomach . " her memories of that day are vivid .
she was driving to an appointment in bonn , singing along to " beautiful day " by her favorite band u2 on the radio .
it really was a beautiful day - the golden september sun slanting through the window , warming her cheeks . her cell phone jolted her out of the musical daydream . " a friend called to tell me that a plane had just crashed into the world trade center , and then another one , " said kelly , a new york state native . she pulled over as she was just too shaken to drive . " i knew with the second plane that it could n't be a coincidence , " she said . utterly alo n e bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it still feels like ground zero in my stomach " washington , d.c. native my-linh kunst was living in brussels at the time , but was in frankfurt on sept .
11 . " my husband was working at a trade fair , and i was in the hotel translating , " my-lihn said .
" i took a late lunch break and tuned in to cnn . when the second one hit , the reporter said it was clearly a terrorist attack . " my-linh - like millions around the world - was glued to her tv for days .
for many " expatriates , " television was the only source of information - and solace . " i tried to call my family in washington , but could n't get through , " she said .
" i was completely alone . " shell-shocked fiona newman was heading an american business team in london .
when the news broke , most headed from the office over to the pub where there was a television . " everyone in the pub was crying , " fiona said .
" there was sheer disbelief that such a thing could happen to anybody , much less to america .
people had felt so safe and secure there .
the americans were shell-shocked . " home away from home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans gathered at the us consulate in hamburg to pay their respects many sought comfort in other americans , but it was n't easy .
mary brunowsky , the president of the american women 's club in cologne , called cologne 's amerika haus that day . as part of the düsseldorf-based american consulate general , the task of the amerika haus in cologne is to explain us society and policies to german audiences . " they told us right away to not go anywhere as a group since the terrorists may be targeting americans abroad , " ' brunowsky said . to this day , the federation of american women 's clubs overseas does not publish online where their meetings are held . even though here was not home , many americans were touched by germans ' sympathy at the time .
the solidarity eased the sorrow . " for days and weeks after sept .
11 , there were candles and flowers everywhere outside of the amerika haus , " said bernd herbert , the organization 's cultural affairs officer . divided respo n ses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german sympathy in cologne but the sympathy was n't meant to last . " and then america blew it , " kelly said .
the foreign policy course the united states chose to take in response to the sept .
11 attacks - the invasion into afghanistan , the war in iraq , allowing torture at abu ghraib and the manner of prisoner detention at guantanamo bay - destroyed the rallying behind her homeland , she believes . a study by the pew research center , in its " global attitudes project , " confirmed this .
in this year 's survey of 17,000 people in 15 countries , the organization concluded that " america 's global image has again slipped and support for the war on terrorism has declined , even among close us allies like japan .
favorable opinions of the united states have fallen in most of the countries surveyed , " the report said . the study continued : " the war in iraq is a continuing drag on opinions of the united states , not only in predominantly muslim countries , but in europe and asia as well . " a n ti-america n ism cycles heike bungert , a north american history professor at the university of bremen , said anti-americanism comes in waves .
right now , she said , the " wave " is higher due to us foreign policy .
she sees it among her students . " the suspicion lurks that the us wants to intervene everywhere , " she said . the then german government 's opposition to the war in iraq in 2003 may have helped anchor that attitude . " there 's a sense here in germany - and that is a result of our history of world wars - that global problems can and should be worked out through negotiations rather than militarily , " said herbert of the amerika haus , himself a german . the good , the bad a n d the ugly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyday life in iraq : suicide bombers and roadside attacks many leading american analysts believe that the war in iraq has done more harm than good .
american academic francis fukuyama , once close to the neo-conservative movement , distanced himself from the group just before the war . " iraq has become a breeding ground for terror , " he told der spiegel newsmagazine this spring .
" it has stimulated a lot of people to join the resistance and commit themselves to jihad . " others point out that us power and privilege feed anti-americanism .
us undersecretary of state karen hughes 's job is to improve america 's image abroad . " we are a superpower and with that comes some resentment , " she said in a february interview . philosopher andré glucksmann , a frenchman of german-jewish descent , pointed out that " people use the myth of the superpower america to pin the blame onto the country for everything , " he told der spiegel last fall .
" but the world has long become multi-polar ; america is not able to dictate its conditions everywhere . " in fact , bungert , fukayama and glucksmann all believe that it is modernism that has helped fuel frustration , resentment and , ultimately , terrorism . " modernization , or more precisely , the - brutal - westernization of the planet , has sent three-fourths of the world 's population spinning , " glucksmann said . guilt by associatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-iraq war : parisian girl at the us embassy in 2002 germany may have had its wake-up call about its currents of anti-americanism at the start of this year when revelations surfaced that german spies in baghdad had supplied the us military with information during the iraq war . some germans realized that they could no longer be pointing the finger at the us for an erroneous invasion in iraq , when germany itself had dirtied its hands . still , the urge to reproach dies hard .
american carmen pang , a cologne resident , was recently strolling through the city with her husband .
heeding the festive soccer world cup mood , her husband donned his cowboy hat .
as the couple passed by an outdoor café , someone called out " fuck bush . " though carmen had to swallow hard over that one , she said most germans can distinguish between american policy and the country 's people , and that they welcome her here . one might think that americans abroad have a distant stance toward their native country .
au co n traire , some ex-pats say - many feel themselves to be unofficial ambassadors to their country of origin . " it 's so easy to america-bash overseas and distance oneself from it all , " my-linh said .
" but actually , while i do n't defend us foreign politics right now , i find that when i 'm abroad , i 'm quite patriotic and proud to be an american .
i just shut out the america-bashing . " but mary said it is sometimes hard to turn a deaf ear .

' ' if germany has the capacity to hold such a big event , then they will obviously have the capacity to do the same for more large events .

' ' in the past , the largest hockey event in germany sold 28,000 tickets and we have sold nearly three times that amount for this event , " he said .
' ' we have had many international and domestic visitors and enormous media coverage . " abel observed that germany has attracted a larger than usual number of visiting foreign reporters , spectators and sporting representatives because ' ' the -lrb- soccer -rrb- world cup is just as important as the olympics . " more international events for germany in the future ? newcombe expects there will be more sporting events , although he does not expect they will just come ' ' flooding in . " ' ' it 's no surprise that if you put on these big events then more will be happening in the future and i think germany has set itself up well , " newcombe said . radnedge thinks it is a confidence-building exercise for german domestic sports , who have become more willing to ' ' put themselves out into the international community " following events such as the world cup . rachel ryan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup scores goal for german economy since the world cup ended , host nation germany has been counting the immediate economic benefits for businesses during the month-long event .

" ' ' the world cup is awarded to a country six years in advance , so there is a bidding momentum and an awareness that is generated , " radnedge said . bildunterschrift : the allianz arena in munich was built specifically for soccer events to cater to the world cup crowds , germany had to provide the facilities to cope with such a large-scale sporting event . ' ' the world cup effects the infrastructure of the country in a big way and the international sports administrators are becoming more attuned to this , " radnedge said .

but they 're not upset enough to stop buying cars with bigger motors and more horsepower . maybe it 's a desire to take full advantage of those freeways with no speed limits ; maybe it 's a kind of compensation for other perceived shortcomings or mid-life crises - either way germans are flocking towards new cars with more muscular , and thirstier , engines .
the trend has surprised the author of a study tracking car buying and gas price trends since 2000 . " we really did not expect this high increase in horsepower despite high fuel prices , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer of b & d forecast . some 17 percent of german auto buyers were interested in cars with less than 70 horsepower six years ago .
but in 2006 , only 9 percent want the smaller engines .
over the same period of time , sales of cars with between 136 and 190 horsepower doubled to 27 percent , dudenhöffer said . cars are emotional products bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars usually receive excellent care in germany " the automobile is still a very emotional product , and this emotion is expressed in sportiness , " he said , adding that that leads people to make decisions in the car showroom they might not make if they were deciding while standing at a gas pump . the emotional attachment that makes a fast car more than just a way to get from point a to point b can also be seen by the growing percentage of people buying cars with up to 350 horsepower .
though still less than one percent of car buyers , it has doubled over the last six years , even as fuel prices have increased by 33 percent , dudenhöffer said . " automobiles are very valuable to germans , they have a feeling of freedom in the car , " he said . "
a person 's esteem is very closely connected to what they drive . " fuel price still plays a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas prices have made some consider other means of transportation still , germans are not willing to ignore the price of fuel completely and are often turning to diesel instead of gasoline , dudenhöffer added . " by emphasizing diesels over the last few years , manufactures have done a lot to help consumers , " he said .
" they are helping get around the conflicting objectives of more performance without more consumption . " car buyers are turning to diesel engines because they can get similar performance with less fuel .
the market share of diesel engines has climbed to nearly 45 percent since 2000 in germany , according to dudenhöffer 's report . more cars staying in the garage in addition to switching to diesel , germans are also extending the time between fill-ups by driving less , a separate study showed . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of german car makes have plans to introduce new suvs the decreases , however , may not hold , as a spate of compact sport utility vehicles from volkswagen , opel , audi and mercedes hit the german market over the next year , the trend toward more powerful engines is likely to continue for the short-term , dudenhöffer said . but when planning their long-term strategies , german carmakers may not want to overstress the importance of horsepower as changes occur in other markets , dudenhöffer said . " in the usa we are seeing that all the big suvs are turning into the americans ' slow sellers , " he said .

others in the country welcomed the german head of state 's remarks . poland 's conservative premier , jaroslaw kaczynski , criticized köhler 's appearance at the annual remembrance day for the 12 million germans who fled or were expelled from eastern europe after world war ii . he called köhler 's speech " one of these unsettling events that have taken place recently in germany . " speaking to some 2,000 guests of the league of german expellees , köhler made an appeal for increased dialogue within a greater european context .
he recognized the concerns that have sprung up in poland , particularly following the opening of a controversial exhibit on german and other expellees in berlin in early august . " we should n't ignore these concerns , " he said .
" we should take them seriously , even if we consider them unfounded .
there is no doubt what the cause of escape and expulsion was : the unjust national-socialist regime and world war ii , which germany started . " expellees " part of germa n ide n tity " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski , right , was appointed pm by his twin brother , president lech kaczynski the league of german expellees , chaired by erika steinbach from the conservative party cdu , has celebrated " home day " since 1950 .
the event recalls the fate of germans who fled from the soviet army when world war ii ended , or were expelled from former german territories when europe 's borders were redrawn following the war . kaczynski was referring to the league when he said , " there is a large government-supported group in germany that constantly brings up the polish territories that used to belong to germany . " if there were a similar organization in poland that demanded the return of parts of the ukraine , belarus or lithuania , warsaw would face serious political consequences , added kaczynski . " we just want the principle of symmetry to be applied here so that everyone is treated the same , " he said . köhler said that germany 's former territories to the east were part of his country 's cultural heritage , even if irrevocably no longer part of germany and that the culture and history of the expellees was part of german identity . kaczy n ski 's opi n io n n ot the o n ly o n e i n pola n d according to a monday article in the warsaw daily gazeta wyborcza , kaczynski 's statements may not be representative of the polish media or his country 's population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach has advocated for a permanent expellee center in berlin köhler 's words " were positive , from the polish perspective , " wrote the paper , because " he began with sept .
1 , 1939 as the beginning of the expulsions .
secondly , he emphasized the integration of the expellees and not remembrance of german suffering . " hitler 's army invaded poland on sept .
1 , 1939 , starting world war ii . köhler also mentioned the danzig declaration , signed in october 2003 by his predecessor johannes rau and poland 's former president aleksander kwasniewski .
the document represents a formal withdrawal of compensation claims and mutual accusations of guilt between the neighboring countries . a summer of te n sio n communication between polish and german government leaders has been taut this summer and emotions have run high after a series of toe-stepping events . the string of offending incidents include a satire in a german newspaper that called polish president lech kaczynski " a potato , " the berlin exhibition on expulsion , and günter grass ' public confession of membership in the feared nazi waffen ss . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin exhibition on postwar expulsions opens amid protests a controversial exhibition which opened in berlin thursday on the expulsions of germans and other europeans after 1945 has been strongly condemned by polish leaders .

others in the country welcomed the german head of state 's remarks . poland 's conservative premier , jaroslaw kaczynski , criticized köhler 's appearance at the annual remembrance day for the 12 million germans who fled or were expelled from eastern europe after world war ii . he called köhler 's speech " one of these unsettling events that have taken place recently in germany . " speaking to some 2,000 guests of the league of german expellees , köhler made an appeal for increased dialogue within a greater european context .
he recognized the concerns that have sprung up in poland , particularly following the opening of a controversial exhibit on german and other expellees in berlin in early august . " we should n't ignore these concerns , " he said .
" we should take them seriously , even if we consider them unfounded .
there is no doubt what the cause of escape and expulsion was : the unjust national-socialist regime and world war ii , which germany started .

the event recalls the fate of germans who fled from the soviet army when world war ii ended , or were expelled from former german territories when europe 's borders were redrawn following the war . kaczynski was referring to the league when he said , " there is a large government-supported group in germany that constantly brings up the polish territories that used to belong to germany . " if there were a similar organization in poland that demanded the return of parts of the ukraine , belarus or lithuania , warsaw would face serious political consequences , added kaczynski . " we just want the principle of symmetry to be applied here so that everyone is treated the same , " he said . köhler said that germany 's former territories to the east were part of his country 's cultural heritage , even if irrevocably no longer part of germany and that the culture and history of the expellees was part of german identity . kaczy n ski 's opi n io n n ot the o n ly o n e i n pola n d according to a monday article in the warsaw daily gazeta wyborcza , kaczynski 's statements may not be representative of the polish media or his country 's population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach has advocated for a permanent expellee center in berlin köhler 's words " were positive , from the polish perspective , " wrote the paper , because " he began with sept .

others say that jail time and heavy fines are the appropriate punishment .
what most agree on is that stronger measures need to be taken against such perpetrators . " a fine that currently runs up to 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 25,600 -rrb- is too low , " gert sonnleitner , president of the german association of farmers , told german tabloid bild .
" the punishment must be drastically increased in order to protect consumers . " sonnleitner wants offenders ' names published and a ban on such firms from doing business again instituted .
green party parliamentary leader bärbel höhn , meanwhile , told bild that she wants the toughest punishment of all - jail time .

they also found up to 40 tons of suspicious duck meat at another bavarian business . some of the meat was more than four years past its due date . authorities were also concerned because one of the companies storing the moldy meat has customers across europe .
authorities said monday that at least 26 companies were supplied with meat recently from the company - in five cases so far , the meat was questionable . meanwhile no charges have yet been filed as authorities continue to test meat at restaurants , stores and food stalls . jail as deterrent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the meat found was four years past its expiration date in the aftermath , there have been calls for stronger laws to ensure that such incidents do n't occur in the future . the only way to do that , according to bavarian consumer protection minister werner schnappauf , is to set an example . " it is impossible to inspect each and every steak or schnitzel , " he told german broadcaster ard .

last year , ates was named germany 's woman of the year for her unstinting battle for the rights of mainly muslim women . given her reputation for toughness and bravery , ates ' recent announcement that she was closing her practice because she felt threatened has sent shockwaves through the german capital . livi n g with threats , i n timidatio n berlin daily der tagesspiegel reported that ates , who has been insulted and threatened by the husbands and relatives of many turkish women she has represented over the years , decided to wind up her work after another similar incident last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ates has riled up the turkish community with her outspoken criticism the muslim husband of one of her clients , whom ates was representing in divorce proceedings , assaulted his wife and tried to attack ates opposite the courtroom where the case was being heard , the paper wrote . " i 'm withdrawing from professional life as a lawyer , my client is living in a women 's shelter , but the assailant is running around scot-free , " ates told the paper , adding that " my life and that of my young daughter have priority . " a statement on ates ' web site said : " it 's once again clear to me how dangerous my work as a lawyer was and how little i was and still am protected as an individual . " " a lot has to cha n ge " ates has also criticized both politicians and police in failing to provide her support and protection . der tagesspiegel reported that ates had applied for police protection last march after turkish daily hürriyet attacked her in a series of articles for her critical statements about the treatment of women in many turkish families .
but the police refused protection , saying there was no indication of a concrete threat , ates said .
the police however have rejected the allegations . " a lot has to change there , " ates told der tagesspiegel .
" the victim protection law has to be urgently expanded . " the german-turkish lawyer , a member of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- since 2004 , has said that the spd too has n't paid any heed to her concerns . " the spd is still dominated by an immigration policy that plays things down , " ates told the paper , saying that politicians always urged citizens to show more courage .
" that is right , but then you also have to protect people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder of hatun sürücü , a turkish woman , by her brother made headlines last year ates ' outspoken criticism of the treatment of women in turkish families in germany has earned her the ire of both turks as well as many left-wingers in favor of multicultural policies .
ates has consistently slammed politicians for turning a blind eye to problems within immigrant communities under the guise of tolerance and fostering diversity . ates however has said that she will continue giving lectures and interviews to highlight the plight of women in turkish and kurdish communities in germany . a n " alarmi n g sig n " ates ' announcement has sparked outrage among politicians , with many calling for expanding victim protection laws to include women who feel threatened . berlin 's interior minister , erhard körting called it an " alarming sign " and said he had " high respect for ates ' work . " others have called for a signature campaign for ates .

" i think that the talks that will take place in lebanon have to be conducted to make a request possible , " merkel said monday .
" then we will do things quickly , but not rush if the conditions are not right .

others say that jail time and heavy fines are the appropriate punishment .
what most agree on is that stronger measures need to be taken against such perpetrators . " a fine that currently runs up to 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 25,600 -rrb- is too low , " gert sonnleitner , president of the german association of farmers , told german tabloid bild .
" the punishment must be drastically increased in order to protect consumers . " sonnleitner wants offenders ' names published and a ban on such firms from doing business again instituted .
green party parliamentary leader bärbel höhn , meanwhile , told bild that she wants the toughest punishment of all - jail time . " the black sheep of the meat industry belong in prison , " she said . years out of date bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are still investigating a number of bavarian meat dealers german authorities last week confiscated 10 tons of rotten meat from an unnamed munich company 's meat locker .
they also found up to 40 tons of suspicious duck meat at another bavarian business . some of the meat was more than four years past its due date . authorities were also concerned because one of the companies storing the moldy meat has customers across europe .
authorities said monday that at least 26 companies were supplied with meat recently from the company - in five cases so far , the meat was questionable . meanwhile no charges have yet been filed as authorities continue to test meat at restaurants , stores and food stalls . jail as deterrent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the meat found was four years past its expiration date in the aftermath , there have been calls for stronger laws to ensure that such incidents do n't occur in the future . the only way to do that , according to bavarian consumer protection minister werner schnappauf , is to set an example . " it is impossible to inspect each and every steak or schnitzel , " he told german broadcaster ard .
" so we must then ensure that whoever plays fast and loose with the health of citizens in this way must serve jail time .

11 current affairs -pipe- 04.09.2006 sept .
11 and aftermath sent earthquake through arab world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 rattled not just new york city and the western world , but the middle east as well the terror , war and chaos that have occurred since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks have led to destabilization in the arab world and an ever-widening rift with the west . how has the arab world changed since sept .
11 , 2001 ?
that 's no easier to answer than the question of how this politically important region will develop in the future . " it can not be denied that new , radical currents and previously unknown terror groups have surfaced since the horrible events on sept .
11 .
it 's often unclear who is actually supporting the terror groups , " said sagie qurqmas , a well-known writer and historian from syria . " since sept .
11 , the west , especially the us , has continued to accuse the arabs of being the source of radicalism and terrorism , " he said . " even if this is true of some arabs , the majority can not be characterized by this minority .
radicalism is present in all societies , regardless of religion or nationality . " a deepening divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us tactics have driven moderates into terrorist groups , said qurqmas qurqmas says that the united states ' " failed policy of violence and occupation " has driven many more moderate arabs into the radical camp .
the west 's blanket accusations have only deepened the fissure with the arab world , he said . he named the occupation of iraq , the failure of the palestinian-israeli peace process , and the israeli-lebanese war - " not to mention the west 's ambivalent treatment of fundamental issues like democracy and human rights " - as contributors to the widening rift . until the events on sept .
11 , western democracies had served as role models of secular powers for the arab world , which was seeking to replace the repressive , totalitarian regimes in the region with democratic societies . however , human rights violations in guantanamo bay and abu ghraib , the cia affair in europe and the united states ' unconditional support of israel in its war against the palestinians and lebanese have considerably detracted from the credibility of the us and its european allies in the arab world . doubting democracy " no one here wants to hear anything from the west , " wrote journalist abdel-karim shaheen .
" the leading opinion today is that sermons about western democracy have lost their significance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us presence in iraq has deepend the divide between the west and the middle east what kind of democracy sends in tanks , bombs and fighter jets , asked shaheen , and is worth tens of thousands of lives and the destruction of essential infrastructure ?
the journalist believes that the west is not really interested in democratization , rather in securing oil and other economic markets . a domestic threat on the other hand , the strengthening of radical islamic groups represents a threat to the arab world itself , said both iranian journalist and lawyer najh al-obaidi and syrian journalist atef afif .
tightened domestic security measures and new anti-terror laws are results of the threat , which has already become apparent in egypt , tunisia , morocco , saudi arabia , jordan , syria and elsewhere . new laws , however , have restricted individual rights even further and hindered democratic reforms .
author and columnist jameel abu hassan said citizens are more than willing to make the compromise . " the people prefer living in a police state than in a country where chaos reigns and blood is spilled , which is the case in iraq under american-british occupation , " said hassan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear the national borders in the middle east will be redrawn by western powers five years after sept .
11 , 2001 , the future of the arab world is alarming .
the peace process in palestine has come to a dead end , iraq is on the brink of a civil war , and the perspectives in lebanon after the recent war are across the board . fear of new borders the people in the region fear that the us may redraw the national borders in the arab world , which us foreign minister condoleezza rice proposed during the war in lebanon , and try to impose the new divisions with military force together with its allies , said both atef afif and lebanese journalist ghassn abu hamad . the fear is that the territories would be distributed according to religious groups , which would then fight against each other ad infinitum , said the two journalists . nevertheless , despite crisis and irritation , " the arab world and the western world are dependent on each other , " said hamad .

others say that jail time and heavy fines are the appropriate punishment .
what most agree on is that stronger measures need to be taken against such perpetrators . " a fine that currently runs up to 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 25,600 -rrb- is too low , " gert sonnleitner , president of the german association of farmers , told german tabloid bild .
" the punishment must be drastically increased in order to protect consumers . " sonnleitner wants offenders ' names published and a ban on such firms from doing business again instituted .
green party parliamentary leader bärbel höhn , meanwhile , told bild that she wants the toughest punishment of all - jail time . " the black sheep of the meat industry belong in prison , " she said . years out of date bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are still investigating a number of bavarian meat dealers german authorities last week confiscated 10 tons of rotten meat from an unnamed munich company 's meat locker .
they also found up to 40 tons of suspicious duck meat at another bavarian business . some of the meat was more than four years past its due date . authorities were also concerned because one of the companies storing the moldy meat has customers across europe .
authorities said monday that at least 26 companies were supplied with meat recently from the company - in five cases so far , the meat was questionable . meanwhile no charges have yet been filed as authorities continue to test meat at restaurants , stores and food stalls . jail as deterrent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the meat found was four years past its expiration date in the aftermath , there have been calls for stronger laws to ensure that such incidents do n't occur in the future . the only way to do that , according to bavarian consumer protection minister werner schnappauf , is to set an example . " it is impossible to inspect each and every steak or schnitzel , " he told german broadcaster ard .
" so we must then ensure that whoever plays fast and loose with the health of citizens in this way must serve jail time .

others in the country welcomed the german head of state 's remarks . poland 's conservative premier , jaroslaw kaczynski , criticized köhler 's appearance at the annual remembrance day for the 12 million germans who fled or were expelled from eastern europe after world war ii . he called köhler 's speech " one of these unsettling events that have taken place recently in germany . " speaking to some 2,000 guests of the league of german expellees , köhler made an appeal for increased dialogue within a greater european context .
he recognized the concerns that have sprung up in poland , particularly following the opening of a controversial exhibit on german and other expellees in berlin in early august . " we should n't ignore these concerns , " he said .
" we should take them seriously , even if we consider them unfounded .
there is no doubt what the cause of escape and expulsion was : the unjust national-socialist regime and world war ii , which germany started . " expellees " part of germa n ide n tity " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski , right , was appointed pm by his twin brother , president lech kaczynski the league of german expellees , chaired by erika steinbach from the conservative party cdu , has celebrated " home day " since 1950 .
the event recalls the fate of germans who fled from the soviet army when world war ii ended , or were expelled from former german territories when europe 's borders were redrawn following the war . kaczynski was referring to the league when he said , " there is a large government-supported group in germany that constantly brings up the polish territories that used to belong to germany . " if there were a similar organization in poland that demanded the return of parts of the ukraine , belarus or lithuania , warsaw would face serious political consequences , added kaczynski . " we just want the principle of symmetry to be applied here so that everyone is treated the same , " he said . köhler said that germany 's former territories to the east were part of his country 's cultural heritage , even if irrevocably no longer part of germany and that the culture and history of the expellees was part of german identity . kaczy n ski 's opi n io n n ot the o n ly o n e i n pola n d according to a monday article in the warsaw daily gazeta wyborcza , kaczynski 's statements may not be representative of the polish media or his country 's population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach has advocated for a permanent expellee center in berlin köhler 's words " were positive , from the polish perspective , " wrote the paper , because " he began with sept .
1 , 1939 as the beginning of the expulsions .
secondly , he emphasized the integration of the expellees and not remembrance of german suffering . " hitler 's army invaded poland on sept .
1 , 1939 , starting world war ii . köhler also mentioned the danzig declaration , signed in october 2003 by his predecessor johannes rau and poland 's former president aleksander kwasniewski .
the document represents a formal withdrawal of compensation claims and mutual accusations of guilt between the neighboring countries . a summer of te n sio n communication between polish and german government leaders has been taut this summer and emotions have run high after a series of toe-stepping events . the string of offending incidents include a satire in a german newspaper that called polish president lech kaczynski " a potato , " the berlin exhibition on expulsion , and günter grass ' public confession of membership in the feared nazi waffen ss . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin exhibition on postwar expulsions opens amid protests a controversial exhibition which opened in berlin thursday on the expulsions of germans and other europeans after 1945 has been strongly condemned by polish leaders .

last year , ates was named germany 's woman of the year for her unstinting battle for the rights of mainly muslim women . given her reputation for toughness and bravery , ates ' recent announcement that she was closing her practice because she felt threatened has sent shockwaves through the german capital . livi n g with threats , i n timidatio n berlin daily der tagesspiegel reported that ates , who has been insulted and threatened by the husbands and relatives of many turkish women she has represented over the years , decided to wind up her work after another similar incident last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ates has riled up the turkish community with her outspoken criticism the muslim husband of one of her clients , whom ates was representing in divorce proceedings , assaulted his wife and tried to attack ates opposite the courtroom where the case was being heard , the paper wrote . " i 'm withdrawing from professional life as a lawyer , my client is living in a women 's shelter , but the assailant is running around scot-free , " ates told the paper , adding that " my life and that of my young daughter have priority . " a statement on ates ' web site said : " it 's once again clear to me how dangerous my work as a lawyer was and how little i was and still am protected as an individual . " " a lot has to cha n ge " ates has also criticized both politicians and police in failing to provide her support and protection . der tagesspiegel reported that ates had applied for police protection last march after turkish daily hürriyet attacked her in a series of articles for her critical statements about the treatment of women in many turkish families .
but the police refused protection , saying there was no indication of a concrete threat , ates said .
the police however have rejected the allegations . " a lot has to change there , " ates told der tagesspiegel .
" the victim protection law has to be urgently expanded . " the german-turkish lawyer , a member of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- since 2004 , has said that the spd too has n't paid any heed to her concerns . " the spd is still dominated by an immigration policy that plays things down , " ates told the paper , saying that politicians always urged citizens to show more courage .
" that is right , but then you also have to protect people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder of hatun sürücü , a turkish woman , by her brother made headlines last year ates ' outspoken criticism of the treatment of women in turkish families in germany has earned her the ire of both turks as well as many left-wingers in favor of multicultural policies .
ates has consistently slammed politicians for turning a blind eye to problems within immigrant communities under the guise of tolerance and fostering diversity . ates however has said that she will continue giving lectures and interviews to highlight the plight of women in turkish and kurdish communities in germany . a n " alarmi n g sig n " ates ' announcement has sparked outrage among politicians , with many calling for expanding victim protection laws to include women who feel threatened . berlin 's interior minister , erhard körting called it an " alarming sign " and said he had " high respect for ates ' work . " others have called for a signature campaign for ates .

11 and aftermath sent earthquake through arab world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 rattled not just new york city and the western world , but the middle east as well the terror , war and chaos that have occurred since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks have led to destabilization in the arab world and an ever-widening rift with the west . how has the arab world changed since sept .
11 , 2001 ?
that 's no easier to answer than the question of how this politically important region will develop in the future . " it can not be denied that new , radical currents and previously unknown terror groups have surfaced since the horrible events on sept .
11 .
it 's often unclear who is actually supporting the terror groups , " said sagie qurqmas , a well-known writer and historian from syria . " since sept .
11 , the west , especially the us , has continued to accuse the arabs of being the source of radicalism and terrorism , " he said . " even if this is true of some arabs , the majority can not be characterized by this minority .
radicalism is present in all societies , regardless of religion or nationality . " a deepening divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us tactics have driven moderates into terrorist groups , said qurqmas qurqmas says that the united states ' " failed policy of violence and occupation " has driven many more moderate arabs into the radical camp .
the west 's blanket accusations have only deepened the fissure with the arab world , he said . he named the occupation of iraq , the failure of the palestinian-israeli peace process , and the israeli-lebanese war - " not to mention the west 's ambivalent treatment of fundamental issues like democracy and human rights " - as contributors to the widening rift . until the events on sept .
11 , western democracies had served as role models of secular powers for the arab world , which was seeking to replace the repressive , totalitarian regimes in the region with democratic societies . however , human rights violations in guantanamo bay and abu ghraib , the cia affair in europe and the united states ' unconditional support of israel in its war against the palestinians and lebanese have considerably detracted from the credibility of the us and its european allies in the arab world . doubting democracy " no one here wants to hear anything from the west , " wrote journalist abdel-karim shaheen .
" the leading opinion today is that sermons about western democracy have lost their significance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us presence in iraq has deepend the divide between the west and the middle east what kind of democracy sends in tanks , bombs and fighter jets , asked shaheen , and is worth tens of thousands of lives and the destruction of essential infrastructure ?
the journalist believes that the west is not really interested in democratization , rather in securing oil and other economic markets . a domestic threat on the other hand , the strengthening of radical islamic groups represents a threat to the arab world itself , said both iranian journalist and lawyer najh al-obaidi and syrian journalist atef afif .
tightened domestic security measures and new anti-terror laws are results of the threat , which has already become apparent in egypt , tunisia , morocco , saudi arabia , jordan , syria and elsewhere . new laws , however , have restricted individual rights even further and hindered democratic reforms .
author and columnist jameel abu hassan said citizens are more than willing to make the compromise . " the people prefer living in a police state than in a country where chaos reigns and blood is spilled , which is the case in iraq under american-british occupation , " said hassan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear the national borders in the middle east will be redrawn by western powers five years after sept .

last year , ates was named germany 's woman of the year for her unstinting battle for the rights of mainly muslim women . given her reputation for toughness and bravery , ates ' recent announcement that she was closing her practice because she felt threatened has sent shockwaves through the german capital . livi n g with threats , i n timidatio n berlin daily der tagesspiegel reported that ates , who has been insulted and threatened by the husbands and relatives of many turkish women she has represented over the years , decided to wind up her work after another similar incident last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ates has riled up the turkish community with her outspoken criticism the muslim husband of one of her clients , whom ates was representing in divorce proceedings , assaulted his wife and tried to attack ates opposite the courtroom where the case was being heard , the paper wrote . " i 'm withdrawing from professional life as a lawyer , my client is living in a women 's shelter , but the assailant is running around scot-free , " ates told the paper , adding that " my life and that of my young daughter have priority . " a statement on ates ' web site said : " it 's once again clear to me how dangerous my work as a lawyer was and how little i was and still am protected as an individual . " " a lot has to cha n ge " ates has also criticized both politicians and police in failing to provide her support and protection . der tagesspiegel reported that ates had applied for police protection last march after turkish daily hürriyet attacked her in a series of articles for her critical statements about the treatment of women in many turkish families .
but the police refused protection , saying there was no indication of a concrete threat , ates said .
the police however have rejected the allegations . " a lot has to change there , " ates told der tagesspiegel .
" the victim protection law has to be urgently expanded . " the german-turkish lawyer , a member of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- since 2004 , has said that the spd too has n't paid any heed to her concerns . " the spd is still dominated by an immigration policy that plays things down , " ates told the paper , saying that politicians always urged citizens to show more courage .
" that is right , but then you also have to protect people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder of hatun sürücü , a turkish woman , by her brother made headlines last year ates ' outspoken criticism of the treatment of women in turkish families in germany has earned her the ire of both turks as well as many left-wingers in favor of multicultural policies .
ates has consistently slammed politicians for turning a blind eye to problems within immigrant communities under the guise of tolerance and fostering diversity . ates however has said that she will continue giving lectures and interviews to highlight the plight of women in turkish and kurdish communities in germany . a n " alarmi n g sig n " ates ' announcement has sparked outrage among politicians , with many calling for expanding victim protection laws to include women who feel threatened . berlin 's interior minister , erhard körting called it an " alarming sign " and said he had " high respect for ates ' work . " others have called for a signature campaign for ates .
ulrich schellenberg , the chairman of the berlin lawyers ' association , called ates ' resignation " dramatic " and said lawyers " must demonstrate solidarity .

11 current affairs -pipe- 04.09.2006 sept .
11 and aftermath sent earthquake through arab world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 rattled not just new york city and the western world , but the middle east as well the terror , war and chaos that have occurred since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks have led to destabilization in the arab world and an ever-widening rift with the west . how has the arab world changed since sept .
11 , 2001 ?
that 's no easier to answer than the question of how this politically important region will develop in the future . " it can not be denied that new , radical currents and previously unknown terror groups have surfaced since the horrible events on sept .
11 .
it 's often unclear who is actually supporting the terror groups , " said sagie qurqmas , a well-known writer and historian from syria . " since sept .
11 , the west , especially the us , has continued to accuse the arabs of being the source of radicalism and terrorism , " he said . " even if this is true of some arabs , the majority can not be characterized by this minority .
radicalism is present in all societies , regardless of religion or nationality . " a deepening divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us tactics have driven moderates into terrorist groups , said qurqmas qurqmas says that the united states ' " failed policy of violence and occupation " has driven many more moderate arabs into the radical camp .
the west 's blanket accusations have only deepened the fissure with the arab world , he said . he named the occupation of iraq , the failure of the palestinian-israeli peace process , and the israeli-lebanese war - " not to mention the west 's ambivalent treatment of fundamental issues like democracy and human rights " - as contributors to the widening rift . until the events on sept .
11 , western democracies had served as role models of secular powers for the arab world , which was seeking to replace the repressive , totalitarian regimes in the region with democratic societies . however , human rights violations in guantanamo bay and abu ghraib , the cia affair in europe and the united states ' unconditional support of israel in its war against the palestinians and lebanese have considerably detracted from the credibility of the us and its european allies in the arab world . doubting democracy " no one here wants to hear anything from the west , " wrote journalist abdel-karim shaheen .
" the leading opinion today is that sermons about western democracy have lost their significance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us presence in iraq has deepend the divide between the west and the middle east what kind of democracy sends in tanks , bombs and fighter jets , asked shaheen , and is worth tens of thousands of lives and the destruction of essential infrastructure ?
the journalist believes that the west is not really interested in democratization , rather in securing oil and other economic markets . a domestic threat on the other hand , the strengthening of radical islamic groups represents a threat to the arab world itself , said both iranian journalist and lawyer najh al-obaidi and syrian journalist atef afif .
tightened domestic security measures and new anti-terror laws are results of the threat , which has already become apparent in egypt , tunisia , morocco , saudi arabia , jordan , syria and elsewhere . new laws , however , have restricted individual rights even further and hindered democratic reforms .
author and columnist jameel abu hassan said citizens are more than willing to make the compromise .

others in the country welcomed the german head of state 's remarks . poland 's conservative premier , jaroslaw kaczynski , criticized köhler 's appearance at the annual remembrance day for the 12 million germans who fled or were expelled from eastern europe after world war ii . he called köhler 's speech " one of these unsettling events that have taken place recently in germany . " speaking to some 2,000 guests of the league of german expellees , köhler made an appeal for increased dialogue within a greater european context .
he recognized the concerns that have sprung up in poland , particularly following the opening of a controversial exhibit on german and other expellees in berlin in early august . " we should n't ignore these concerns , " he said .
" we should take them seriously , even if we consider them unfounded .
there is no doubt what the cause of escape and expulsion was : the unjust national-socialist regime and world war ii , which germany started . " expellees " part of germa n ide n tity " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski , right , was appointed pm by his twin brother , president lech kaczynski the league of german expellees , chaired by erika steinbach from the conservative party cdu , has celebrated " home day " since 1950 .
the event recalls the fate of germans who fled from the soviet army when world war ii ended , or were expelled from former german territories when europe 's borders were redrawn following the war . kaczynski was referring to the league when he said , " there is a large government-supported group in germany that constantly brings up the polish territories that used to belong to germany . " if there were a similar organization in poland that demanded the return of parts of the ukraine , belarus or lithuania , warsaw would face serious political consequences , added kaczynski . " we just want the principle of symmetry to be applied here so that everyone is treated the same , " he said . köhler said that germany 's former territories to the east were part of his country 's cultural heritage , even if irrevocably no longer part of germany and that the culture and history of the expellees was part of german identity . kaczy n ski 's opi n io n n ot the o n ly o n e i n pola n d according to a monday article in the warsaw daily gazeta wyborcza , kaczynski 's statements may not be representative of the polish media or his country 's population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach has advocated for a permanent expellee center in berlin köhler 's words " were positive , from the polish perspective , " wrote the paper , because " he began with sept .
1 , 1939 as the beginning of the expulsions .
secondly , he emphasized the integration of the expellees and not remembrance of german suffering . " hitler 's army invaded poland on sept .
1 , 1939 , starting world war ii . köhler also mentioned the danzig declaration , signed in october 2003 by his predecessor johannes rau and poland 's former president aleksander kwasniewski .
the document represents a formal withdrawal of compensation claims and mutual accusations of guilt between the neighboring countries . a summer of te n sio n communication between polish and german government leaders has been taut this summer and emotions have run high after a series of toe-stepping events . the string of offending incidents include a satire in a german newspaper that called polish president lech kaczynski " a potato , " the berlin exhibition on expulsion , and günter grass ' public confession of membership in the feared nazi waffen ss . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin exhibition on postwar expulsions opens amid protests a controversial exhibition which opened in berlin thursday on the expulsions of germans and other europeans after 1945 has been strongly condemned by polish leaders .

" i think that the talks that will take place in lebanon have to be conducted to make a request possible , " merkel said monday .
" then we will do things quickly , but not rush if the conditions are not right .

additional french ground troops are also expected in the region by the end of the week . the lebanese government , including the two hezbollah ministers , has not opposed a united nations force marching into a buffer zone between lebanon and israel , but called protecting its marine borders a task for the national military . allowing a foreign country to stop ships on its coast , which germany requests as part of its mandate , is a major intrusion into national sovereignty , which requires approval from the cabinet , lebanese foreign minister fawzi salloukh told german public broadcaster ard on sunday .

" speaking to some 2,000 guests of the league of german expellees , köhler made an appeal for increased dialogue within a greater european context .
he recognized the concerns that have sprung up in poland , particularly following the opening of a controversial exhibit on german and other expellees in berlin in early august . " we should n't ignore these concerns , " he said .
" we should take them seriously , even if we consider them unfounded .
there is no doubt what the cause of escape and expulsion was : the unjust national-socialist regime and world war ii , which germany started . " expellees " part of germa n ide n tity " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski , right , was appointed pm by his twin brother , president lech kaczynski the league of german expellees , chaired by erika steinbach from the conservative party cdu , has celebrated " home day " since 1950 .
the event recalls the fate of germans who fled from the soviet army when world war ii ended , or were expelled from former german territories when europe 's borders were redrawn following the war . kaczynski was referring to the league when he said , " there is a large government-supported group in germany that constantly brings up the polish territories that used to belong to germany . " if there were a similar organization in poland that demanded the return of parts of the ukraine , belarus or lithuania , warsaw would face serious political consequences , added kaczynski . " we just want the principle of symmetry to be applied here so that everyone is treated the same , " he said . köhler said that germany 's former territories to the east were part of his country 's cultural heritage , even if irrevocably no longer part of germany and that the culture and history of the expellees was part of german identity . kaczy n ski 's opi n io n n ot the o n ly o n e i n pola n d according to a monday article in the warsaw daily gazeta wyborcza , kaczynski 's statements may not be representative of the polish media or his country 's population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach has advocated for a permanent expellee center in berlin köhler 's words " were positive , from the polish perspective , " wrote the paper , because " he began with sept .
1 , 1939 as the beginning of the expulsions .
secondly , he emphasized the integration of the expellees and not remembrance of german suffering . " hitler 's army invaded poland on sept .
1 , 1939 , starting world war ii . köhler also mentioned the danzig declaration , signed in october 2003 by his predecessor johannes rau and poland 's former president aleksander kwasniewski .
the document represents a formal withdrawal of compensation claims and mutual accusations of guilt between the neighboring countries . a summer of te n sio n communication between polish and german government leaders has been taut this summer and emotions have run high after a series of toe-stepping events . the string of offending incidents include a satire in a german newspaper that called polish president lech kaczynski " a potato , " the berlin exhibition on expulsion , and günter grass ' public confession of membership in the feared nazi waffen ss . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin exhibition on postwar expulsions opens amid protests a controversial exhibition which opened in berlin thursday on the expulsions of germans and other europeans after 1945 has been strongly condemned by polish leaders .

but they 're not upset enough to stop buying cars with bigger motors and more horsepower . maybe it 's a desire to take full advantage of those freeways with no speed limits ; maybe it 's a kind of compensation for other perceived shortcomings or mid-life crises - either way germans are flocking towards new cars with more muscular , and thirstier , engines .
the trend has surprised the author of a study tracking car buying and gas price trends since 2000 . " we really did not expect this high increase in horsepower despite high fuel prices , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer of b & d forecast . some 17 percent of german auto buyers were interested in cars with less than 70 horsepower six years ago .
but in 2006 , only 9 percent want the smaller engines .
over the same period of time , sales of cars with between 136 and 190 horsepower doubled to 27 percent , dudenhöffer said . cars are emotional products bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars usually receive excellent care in germany " the automobile is still a very emotional product , and this emotion is expressed in sportiness , " he said , adding that that leads people to make decisions in the car showroom they might not make if they were deciding while standing at a gas pump . the emotional attachment that makes a fast car more than just a way to get from point a to point b can also be seen by the growing percentage of people buying cars with up to 350 horsepower .
though still less than one percent of car buyers , it has doubled over the last six years , even as fuel prices have increased by 33 percent , dudenhöffer said . " automobiles are very valuable to germans , they have a feeling of freedom in the car , " he said . "
a person 's esteem is very closely connected to what they drive . " fuel price still plays a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas prices have made some consider other means of transportation still , germans are not willing to ignore the price of fuel completely and are often turning to diesel instead of gasoline , dudenhöffer added . " by emphasizing diesels over the last few years , manufactures have done a lot to help consumers , " he said .
" they are helping get around the conflicting objectives of more performance without more consumption . " car buyers are turning to diesel engines because they can get similar performance with less fuel .
the market share of diesel engines has climbed to nearly 45 percent since 2000 in germany , according to dudenhöffer 's report . more cars staying in the garage in addition to switching to diesel , germans are also extending the time between fill-ups by driving less , a separate study showed . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of german car makes have plans to introduce new suvs the decreases , however , may not hold , as a spate of compact sport utility vehicles from volkswagen , opel , audi and mercedes hit the german market over the next year , the trend toward more powerful engines is likely to continue for the short-term , dudenhöffer said . but when planning their long-term strategies , german carmakers may not want to overstress the importance of horsepower as changes occur in other markets , dudenhöffer said . " in the usa we are seeing that all the big suvs are turning into the americans ' slow sellers , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.09.2006 germany reaches agreement on anti-terrorism measure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is on heightened alert following recent bomb scares germany 's federal interior ministers have reached a compromise on a long-planned anti-terrorism database as security concerns take on added urgency in the wake of failed bomb attacks on german trains . amid a heightened sense of vulnerability after the discovery of failed bomb attacks on german trains , interior ministers from germany 's 16 federal states meeting in berlin on monday agreed on a central anti-terrorism database , primarily meant to simplify cooperation and improve networking between germany 's myriad security agencies and thus help investigators hunt terror suspects . the measure - long a sticking-point between germany 's main ruling parties - foresees a two-part database that brings together information collected by germany 's police and intelligence agencies , separated since the end of world war ii because of nazi-era security abuses . " the ant-terror database will be a central component in effectively fighting terrorism , " police union head konrad freiberg said on monday . deep reservatio n s about database though the current grand coalition made up of social democrats and the conservatives agreed on setting up a central anti-terrorism database last year , the two parties have differed on its exact shape and reach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a proliferation of security agencies on account of its federal structure the idea is that all police and intelligence agencies , both at the federal and national level , would gather information about terror suspects and terrorist organizations in a central database that would be accessible to all crime-fighting agencies .
at present , germany 's 37 agencies do that separately .
the central anti-terrorism database would also contain information about banking , telecommunication and internet information regarding the suspects . in addition to problems stemming from germany 's federal structure , critics had feared the database would create more bureacracy as well as erode people 's privacy . germany 's social democrats and the opposition greens and the left party also expressed concerns that easily accessible information on terrorism suspects could be misused as well as create legal problems given the differing information-gathering methods of the police and intelligence agencies . " a complete central anti-terrorism database would mean that we 'd get a gigantic flood of data that you 'd no longer be able to get a grip on , " said claudia roth , green party chairwoman .
" besides , we 'd have the problem that intelligence information would no longer be protected . " should religio n be i n cluded ? monday 's compromise foresees a two-part database .
one will contain the identity of the terror suspect while the other will hold details about his religion , travel abroad , possession of weapons etc . sharp differences earlier also centered on whether a suspect 's religion should be included in the database . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- pleaded in favor of the move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians are split on including the religion of terror suspects in the database " naturally we should only collect and network data that is really relevant to fighting danger and is really necessary , " schäuble told the magazine super illu .
" and i believe that religion and profession do belong there . " however , politicians from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party were against the measure , arguing that it would violate the constitution . experts war n of hysteria politicians have also warned that the threat of terrorism in germany would increase through a possible deployment of the german army to southern lebanon . " the german army might be controlling weapons smuggling to hezbollah by sea , " said bavarian interior minister günther beckstein .
" the terror threat in germany will rise due to that . " on the eve of the conference , german chancellor angela merkel stressed that the state had to play a more active role in beefing up germany 's defenses . " we need more security , we need more state , " merkel said a party conference , adding it was apparent that video surveillance needed to be expanded in germany after the failed bomb attacks on passenger trains in dortmund and koblenz in july . however , germany 's federal data protection commissioner peter schaar has warned of security paranoia and hysteria , saying he is concerned that germany was " increasingly developing into a surveillance-obsessed society .

but in 2006 , only 9 percent want the smaller engines .
over the same period of time , sales of cars with between 136 and 190 horsepower doubled to 27 percent , dudenhöffer said . cars are emotional products bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars usually receive excellent care in germany " the automobile is still a very emotional product , and this emotion is expressed in sportiness , " he said , adding that that leads people to make decisions in the car showroom they might not make if they were deciding while standing at a gas pump . the emotional attachment that makes a fast car more than just a way to get from point a to point b can also be seen by the growing percentage of people buying cars with up to 350 horsepower .
though still less than one percent of car buyers , it has doubled over the last six years , even as fuel prices have increased by 33 percent , dudenhöffer said . " automobiles are very valuable to germans , they have a feeling of freedom in the car , " he said . "
a person 's esteem is very closely connected to what they drive . " fuel price still plays a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas prices have made some consider other means of transportation still , germans are not willing to ignore the price of fuel completely and are often turning to diesel instead of gasoline , dudenhöffer added . " by emphasizing diesels over the last few years , manufactures have done a lot to help consumers , " he said .
" they are helping get around the conflicting objectives of more performance without more consumption . " car buyers are turning to diesel engines because they can get similar performance with less fuel .
the market share of diesel engines has climbed to nearly 45 percent since 2000 in germany , according to dudenhöffer 's report . more cars staying in the garage in addition to switching to diesel , germans are also extending the time between fill-ups by driving less , a separate study showed . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of german car makes have plans to introduce new suvs the decreases , however , may not hold , as a spate of compact sport utility vehicles from volkswagen , opel , audi and mercedes hit the german market over the next year , the trend toward more powerful engines is likely to continue for the short-term , dudenhöffer said . but when planning their long-term strategies , german carmakers may not want to overstress the importance of horsepower as changes occur in other markets , dudenhöffer said . " in the usa we are seeing that all the big suvs are turning into the americans ' slow sellers , " he said .

" germany wants a letter that should be sent to the unifil and this is something that is in the process , we really have to do it , " siniora told reporters .
doing things properly german chancellor angela merkel on sunday said berlin 's offer of sending its navy to help patrol the lebanese coast still stood but that the country wanted to follow the proper procedures for the sake of its soldiers .
" in this case , it is better to do things properly than to proceed in a hurry , " she said .
" no german government will take a risk that it not justified . "
berlin had been scheduled to receive an official request on sunday and to announce the number of troops it plans to send to lebanon later that day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is much to repair in bombed out beirut a special cabinet sitting to finalize other details of the mission was scheduled for monday , but has also been postponed .
germany needed a request to the un from lebanon , a " robust mandate " from the world body and the approval of the lower house of parliament for the mission , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told reporters on sunday .
no ground troops so far , berlin has ruled out sending ground troops to lebanon , but germany is expected to assume the naval command of the bolstered un force that must police a fragile ceasefire between israel and hezbollah in southern lebanon and stop the flow of arms to the radical shiite organization .
the country is expected to contribute up to 3,000 sea and air troops .
putting an international force in place on lebanon 's coast is important for lebanese businesses as an israeli sea blockade has stopped goods from arriving in lebanese ports since july , lebanese business representatives told afp .
despite calls from the european union and united nations , israel said it would not lift the blockade until an international force is put in place to stop weapons smuggling to hezbollah fighters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants a clear un mandate before sending troops government spokesman wilhelm said the other nations which are likely to help protect lebanon 's coast - denmark , the netherlands , norway and sweden - were also waiting for the green light from beirut before sending naval forces to the region .
the un-brokered truce in lebanon calls for the unifil force in lebanon to expand to up to 15,000 soldiers with a stronger mandate .
they will be joined by a 15,000-strong lebanese army force to prevent hezbollah attacks .
italy has already received its marching orders from the un , and some 890 of its soldiers arrived in lebanon to strengthen the un force already in place there .
additional french ground troops are also expected in the region by the end of the week . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german navy waits for middle east sailing orders political wrangling in lebanon convinced the german government to postpone a cabinet meeting monday to finalize plans for a bundeswehr deployment to patrol lebanon 's mediterranean coast .

but they 're not upset enough to stop buying cars with bigger motors and more horsepower . maybe it 's a desire to take full advantage of those freeways with no speed limits ; maybe it 's a kind of compensation for other perceived shortcomings or mid-life crises - either way germans are flocking towards new cars with more muscular , and thirstier , engines .
the trend has surprised the author of a study tracking car buying and gas price trends since 2000 . " we really did not expect this high increase in horsepower despite high fuel prices , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer of b & d forecast . some 17 percent of german auto buyers were interested in cars with less than 70 horsepower six years ago .
but in 2006 , only 9 percent want the smaller engines .
over the same period of time , sales of cars with between 136 and 190 horsepower doubled to 27 percent , dudenhöffer said . cars are emotional products bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars usually receive excellent care in germany " the automobile is still a very emotional product , and this emotion is expressed in sportiness , " he said , adding that that leads people to make decisions in the car showroom they might not make if they were deciding while standing at a gas pump . the emotional attachment that makes a fast car more than just a way to get from point a to point b can also be seen by the growing percentage of people buying cars with up to 350 horsepower .
though still less than one percent of car buyers , it has doubled over the last six years , even as fuel prices have increased by 33 percent , dudenhöffer said . " automobiles are very valuable to germans , they have a feeling of freedom in the car , " he said . "
a person 's esteem is very closely connected to what they drive . " fuel price still plays a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas prices have made some consider other means of transportation still , germans are not willing to ignore the price of fuel completely and are often turning to diesel instead of gasoline , dudenhöffer added . " by emphasizing diesels over the last few years , manufactures have done a lot to help consumers , " he said .
" they are helping get around the conflicting objectives of more performance without more consumption . " car buyers are turning to diesel engines because they can get similar performance with less fuel .
the market share of diesel engines has climbed to nearly 45 percent since 2000 in germany , according to dudenhöffer 's report . more cars staying in the garage in addition to switching to diesel , germans are also extending the time between fill-ups by driving less , a separate study showed . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of german car makes have plans to introduce new suvs the decreases , however , may not hold , as a spate of compact sport utility vehicles from volkswagen , opel , audi and mercedes hit the german market over the next year , the trend toward more powerful engines is likely to continue for the short-term , dudenhöffer said . but when planning their long-term strategies , german carmakers may not want to overstress the importance of horsepower as changes occur in other markets , dudenhöffer said . " in the usa we are seeing that all the big suvs are turning into the americans ' slow sellers , " he said .
" this is a very high economic burden for general motors , ford and chrysler .

" they told us right away to not go anywhere as a group since the terrorists may be targeting americans abroad , " ' brunowsky said . to this day , the federation of american women 's clubs overseas does not publish online where their meetings are held . even though here was not home , many americans were touched by germans ' sympathy at the time .

the foreign policy course the united states chose to take in response to the sept .
11 attacks - the invasion into afghanistan , the war in iraq , allowing torture at abu ghraib and the manner of prisoner detention at guantanamo bay - destroyed the rallying behind her homeland , she believes . a study by the pew research center , in its " global attitudes project , " confirmed this .
in this year 's survey of 17,000 people in 15 countries , the organization concluded that " america 's global image has again slipped and support for the war on terrorism has declined , even among close us allies like japan .
favorable opinions of the united states have fallen in most of the countries surveyed , " the report said . the study continued : " the war in iraq is a continuing drag on opinions of the united states , not only in predominantly muslim countries , but in europe and asia as well . " a n ti-america n ism cycles heike bungert , a north american history professor at the university of bremen , said anti-americanism comes in waves .
right now , she said , the " wave " is higher due to us foreign policy .
she sees it among her students . " the suspicion lurks that the us wants to intervene everywhere , " she said . the then german government 's opposition to the war in iraq in 2003 may have helped anchor that attitude .

" but the world has long become multi-polar ; america is not able to dictate its conditions everywhere . " in fact , bungert , fukayama and glucksmann all believe that it is modernism that has helped fuel frustration , resentment and , ultimately , terrorism .

11 changed the world more than images : sept .
11 as a key event for online media daily life has n't changed for americans since sept .
11 germany 's solidarity with us waning after sept .
11 " on that day , i just ran " germany -pipe- 04.09.2006 " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the terrorist attacks , many americans abroad wanted to be " back home " sept .
11 shook americans inside and outside the us .
for those abroad , " home " had suddenly become unsafe .
five years on , ex-pats in germany and other european countries still feel uneasy - because of anti-americanism . " when i look back at sept .
11 , 2001 , it always makes me gasp , " said kelly , an american who has resided in germany for 17 years .
it 's pretty much like ground zero .
it 's still like a big hole in my stomach . " her memories of that day are vivid .
she was driving to an appointment in bonn , singing along to " beautiful day " by her favorite band u2 on the radio .
it really was a beautiful day - the golden september sun slanting through the window , warming her cheeks . her cell phone jolted her out of the musical daydream . " a friend called to tell me that a plane had just crashed into the world trade center , and then another one , " said kelly , a new york state native . she pulled over as she was just too shaken to drive . " i knew with the second plane that it could n't be a coincidence , " she said . utterly alo n e bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it still feels like ground zero in my stomach " washington , d.c. native my-linh kunst was living in brussels at the time , but was in frankfurt on sept .
11 . " my husband was working at a trade fair , and i was in the hotel translating , " my-lihn said .
" i took a late lunch break and tuned in to cnn . when the second one hit , the reporter said it was clearly a terrorist attack . " my-linh - like millions around the world - was glued to her tv for days .
for many " expatriates , " television was the only source of information - and solace . " i tried to call my family in washington , but could n't get through , " she said .
" i was completely alone . " shell-shocked fiona newman was heading an american business team in london .
when the news broke , most headed from the office over to the pub where there was a television . " everyone in the pub was crying , " fiona said .
" there was sheer disbelief that such a thing could happen to anybody , much less to america .
people had felt so safe and secure there .
the americans were shell-shocked . " home away from home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans gathered at the us consulate in hamburg to pay their respects many sought comfort in other americans , but it was n't easy .
mary brunowsky , the president of the american women 's club in cologne , called cologne 's amerika haus that day . as part of the düsseldorf-based american consulate general , the task of the amerika haus in cologne is to explain us society and policies to german audiences . " they told us right away to not go anywhere as a group since the terrorists may be targeting americans abroad , " ' brunowsky said . to this day , the federation of american women 's clubs overseas does not publish online where their meetings are held . even though here was not home , many americans were touched by germans ' sympathy at the time .
the solidarity eased the sorrow . " for days and weeks after sept .
11 , there were candles and flowers everywhere outside of the amerika haus , " said bernd herbert , the organization 's cultural affairs officer . divided respo n ses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german sympathy in cologne but the sympathy was n't meant to last . " and then america blew it , " kelly said .
the foreign policy course the united states chose to take in response to the sept .
11 attacks - the invasion into afghanistan , the war in iraq , allowing torture at abu ghraib and the manner of prisoner detention at guantanamo bay - destroyed the rallying behind her homeland , she believes . a study by the pew research center , in its " global attitudes project , " confirmed this .
in this year 's survey of 17,000 people in 15 countries , the organization concluded that " america 's global image has again slipped and support for the war on terrorism has declined , even among close us allies like japan .
favorable opinions of the united states have fallen in most of the countries surveyed , " the report said . the study continued : " the war in iraq is a continuing drag on opinions of the united states , not only in predominantly muslim countries , but in europe and asia as well . " a n ti-america n ism cycles heike bungert , a north american history professor at the university of bremen , said anti-americanism comes in waves .
right now , she said , the " wave " is higher due to us foreign policy .
she sees it among her students . " the suspicion lurks that the us wants to intervene everywhere , " she said . the then german government 's opposition to the war in iraq in 2003 may have helped anchor that attitude . " there 's a sense here in germany - and that is a result of our history of world wars - that global problems can and should be worked out through negotiations rather than militarily , " said herbert of the amerika haus , himself a german . the good , the bad a n d the ugly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyday life in iraq : suicide bombers and roadside attacks many leading american analysts believe that the war in iraq has done more harm than good .
american academic francis fukuyama , once close to the neo-conservative movement , distanced himself from the group just before the war . " iraq has become a breeding ground for terror , " he told der spiegel newsmagazine this spring .
" it has stimulated a lot of people to join the resistance and commit themselves to jihad . " others point out that us power and privilege feed anti-americanism .
us undersecretary of state karen hughes 's job is to improve america 's image abroad . " we are a superpower and with that comes some resentment , " she said in a february interview . philosopher andré glucksmann , a frenchman of german-jewish descent , pointed out that " people use the myth of the superpower america to pin the blame onto the country for everything , " he told der spiegel last fall .
" but the world has long become multi-polar ; america is not able to dictate its conditions everywhere . " in fact , bungert , fukayama and glucksmann all believe that it is modernism that has helped fuel frustration , resentment and , ultimately , terrorism . " modernization , or more precisely , the - brutal - westernization of the planet , has sent three-fourths of the world 's population spinning , " glucksmann said . guilt by associatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-iraq war : parisian girl at the us embassy in 2002 germany may have had its wake-up call about its currents of anti-americanism at the start of this year when revelations surfaced that german spies in baghdad had supplied the us military with information during the iraq war . some germans realized that they could no longer be pointing the finger at the us for an erroneous invasion in iraq , when germany itself had dirtied its hands . still , the urge to reproach dies hard .
american carmen pang , a cologne resident , was recently strolling through the city with her husband .
heeding the festive soccer world cup mood , her husband donned his cowboy hat .
as the couple passed by an outdoor café , someone called out " fuck bush . " though carmen had to swallow hard over that one , she said most germans can distinguish between american policy and the country 's people , and that they welcome her here . one might think that americans abroad have a distant stance toward their native country .
au co n traire , some ex-pats say - many feel themselves to be unofficial ambassadors to their country of origin . " it 's so easy to america-bash overseas and distance oneself from it all , " my-linh said .
" but actually , while i do n't defend us foreign politics right now , i find that when i 'm abroad , i 'm quite patriotic and proud to be an american .
i just shut out the america-bashing . " but mary said it is sometimes hard to turn a deaf ear . " we as ex-pats - whether we believe in american politics or not - we as americans feel uncomfortable now abroad , " she said . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strange bedfellows : radical leftists for bush among the german far-left , one subgroup called the anti-germans holds some contradictory views .

11 shook americans inside and outside the us .
for those abroad , " home " had suddenly become unsafe .
five years on , ex-pats in germany and other european countries still feel uneasy - because of anti-americanism . " when i look back at sept .
11 , 2001 , it always makes me gasp , " said kelly , an american who has resided in germany for 17 years .
it 's pretty much like ground zero .
it 's still like a big hole in my stomach . " her memories of that day are vivid .
she was driving to an appointment in bonn , singing along to " beautiful day " by her favorite band u2 on the radio .
it really was a beautiful day - the golden september sun slanting through the window , warming her cheeks . her cell phone jolted her out of the musical daydream . " a friend called to tell me that a plane had just crashed into the world trade center , and then another one , " said kelly , a new york state native . she pulled over as she was just too shaken to drive . " i knew with the second plane that it could n't be a coincidence , " she said . utterly alo n e bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it still feels like ground zero in my stomach " washington , d.c. native my-linh kunst was living in brussels at the time , but was in frankfurt on sept .

" i took a late lunch break and tuned in to cnn . when the second one hit , the reporter said it was clearly a terrorist attack . " my-linh - like millions around the world - was glued to her tv for days .
for many " expatriates , " television was the only source of information - and solace . " i tried to call my family in washington , but could n't get through , " she said .
" i was completely alone . " shell-shocked fiona newman was heading an american business team in london .
when the news broke , most headed from the office over to the pub where there was a television . " everyone in the pub was crying , " fiona said .

jugs , plates , remnants of a public bath and a paved street reveal a surprisingly modern people . the mass of dirt directly across from the plenary hall in bonn 's former government quarter looks like the surface of the moon .
deep pockets have been dug out in several spots and three excavators are boring their way deeper into the ground . nora andrikopoulou-strack is standing on one of the other-worldly dirt mounds , with clay-smeared boots on her feet and a broad smile on her face . she is responsible for turning this construction site into an archeological dig . " this dig site is , technically speaking , the greatest coherent window into the history of a roman vicus that we 've ever had in germany , " she said . converted un construction site bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it came to floor heating systems , the romans were well ahead of their time construction workers were in the middle of building a new un convention center when they quite literally ran into the vicus , that is , a roman village .
the building project has now been put on hold while archeologists uncover the plates , pots , bones and other historical treasures that lie three meters -lrb- 10 feet -rrb- underground . excavators and shovels are used for the rough work before rakes are brought in for the parts of the process that require a finer , more detailed touch . " actually it 's a garden tool , " said an assistant in the dirt-coated overalls , referring to the rake .
" we can use it to clean off parallel surfaces . " everything that the 50-person team has uncovered in the past several weeks - cups , jugs , pottery shards , hair pins and bones - has been cleaned up , numbered and carefully stored .
some 300 boxes have already been filled with artifacts discovered in the ancient apartments , hidden for so many years underground . thermal baths and paved roads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2,000 people probably lived in the roman village " this plate is a particular highlight .
it really looks as if it just came from the potter 's workshop .
after more than 2,000 years the quality is still excellent , " said head archeologist peter hendrick , holding up a piece of porcelain . in addition to claudius secundus , whose name is on one of the plates , around 2,000 people must have lived in the village .
they made their homes in stable houses with shops at the front and gardens out back . the village boasted a paved street , a temple and a brick oven , and apparently also had a public bath with floor heating . civilizations shared the same space the artifacts hendrick and his team have found are not limited to roman times , however .
more recent items , from the 19th and 20th centuries , have also been discovered . the numerous bottles and caps that have surfaced offer insight into the history of bonn 's breweries , for example .
a rusted american helmet from world war ii - with a bullet hole - was also among the finds . marcus boesch -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de traveling into the past at germany 's open-air museums people curious about life in earlier times in germany can visit the numerous outdoor museums the country has to offer .

jugs , plates , remnants of a public bath and a paved street reveal a surprisingly modern people . the mass of dirt directly across from the plenary hall in bonn 's former government quarter looks like the surface of the moon .
deep pockets have been dug out in several spots and three excavators are boring their way deeper into the ground . nora andrikopoulou-strack is standing on one of the other-worldly dirt mounds , with clay-smeared boots on her feet and a broad smile on her face . she is responsible for turning this construction site into an archeological dig .

the building project has now been put on hold while archeologists uncover the plates , pots , bones and other historical treasures that lie three meters -lrb- 10 feet -rrb- underground . excavators and shovels are used for the rough work before rakes are brought in for the parts of the process that require a finer , more detailed touch .

" we can use it to clean off parallel surfaces . " everything that the 50-person team has uncovered in the past several weeks - cups , jugs , pottery shards , hair pins and bones - has been cleaned up , numbered and carefully stored .

more recent items , from the 19th and 20th centuries , have also been discovered . the numerous bottles and caps that have surfaced offer insight into the history of bonn 's breweries , for example .

jugs , plates , remnants of a public bath and a paved street reveal a surprisingly modern people . the mass of dirt directly across from the plenary hall in bonn 's former government quarter looks like the surface of the moon .
deep pockets have been dug out in several spots and three excavators are boring their way deeper into the ground . nora andrikopoulou-strack is standing on one of the other-worldly dirt mounds , with clay-smeared boots on her feet and a broad smile on her face . she is responsible for turning this construction site into an archeological dig . " this dig site is , technically speaking , the greatest coherent window into the history of a roman vicus that we 've ever had in germany , " she said . converted un construction site bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it came to floor heating systems , the romans were well ahead of their time construction workers were in the middle of building a new un convention center when they quite literally ran into the vicus , that is , a roman village .
the building project has now been put on hold while archeologists uncover the plates , pots , bones and other historical treasures that lie three meters -lrb- 10 feet -rrb- underground . excavators and shovels are used for the rough work before rakes are brought in for the parts of the process that require a finer , more detailed touch . " actually it 's a garden tool , " said an assistant in the dirt-coated overalls , referring to the rake .
" we can use it to clean off parallel surfaces . " everything that the 50-person team has uncovered in the past several weeks - cups , jugs , pottery shards , hair pins and bones - has been cleaned up , numbered and carefully stored .

the healthcare commission aims to deal with 85 % of complaints within six months .
but 55 % of the current cases have been with its staff for longer than that .
the commission says it has received far more complaints than it expected , but lawyers and patients ' charities say the delays are unacceptable . "
i just ca n't move on until i get these answers " complainant val johns val johns is sitting in the conservatory of her home in kent , and leafing through a thick pile of correspondence .
her husband robert , who she still describes as her best friend , died from lung cancer four years ago .
she was unhappy with the medical care he received and after feeling she could not get the answers she needed from local nhs bosses in kent , mrs johns took her complaint to the healthcare commission .
that was two years ago - she is still waiting to get their report .
" i just ca n't move on until i get these answers , " said mrs johns .
" you keep hoping every day you 're going to get an answer and it just never comes .
" the first letter i ever had from the healthcare commission was mid-july 2004 - and to today 's date , it 's still going on . "
' timescale was unachievable ' matters do seem to be moving since the bbc began looking at her case - mrs johns has now been told to expect a draft report in a few weeks ' time .
but she is upset she has had to wait and the healthcare commission has admitted her case is an " extreme " example of a wider problem .
when the commission took on a new role of reviewing nhs complaints that could not be resolved locally two years ago , it was hailed as adding a new element of independence to the system .
the commission set a target to complete all cases within six months , but it soon became clear that timescale was unachievable .
in april , the body revised its targets .
now it aims to clear 85 % of cases in six months , and 95 % within a year .
but figures obtained by the bbc under the freedom of information act show that 2,875 of the current workload - that is 55 % - have been with the healthcare commission for more than six months .
and of those , nearly 900 complaints have spent more than a year at this second stage of review . "
we 've had to scale up our operation - we 've brought in more people and refined our processes so we can spend time on the more complicated cases " the healthcare commission " clearly it 's unacceptable for it to take up to and over a year to reach conclusion of request for an independent review of a complaint , " said peter walsh , who runs action against medical accidents , a charity which promotes patient safety .
" the healthcare commission reports are robust and independent - but patients need an assurance that these matters will be dealt with in a timely and appropriate manner . "
the commission had initially expected to get 5,000 complaints a year - but the figure has turned out to be much higher at 8,000 .
staff feel that more should be done by the nhs at a local level to solve these problems before they get to the stage of needing independent scrutiny .
in the meantime , the commission is trying to tackle the delays .
" it was a surprise that the cases have been arriving in such high numbers , " said marcia fry , head of operational development at the commission .
" we 're sending back nearly a third of them , where we feel not enough investigation has been done at a local level .
" we 've had to scale up our operation - we 've brought in more people and refined our processes so we can spend time on the more complicated cases .
" we certainly admit it 's not ideal - and we 're sorry for people who are caught in the system .
" but we 're getting better - more cases are now being resolved than are coming in each month , so we 're making progress . "
however liberal democrat health spokesman steve webb said : " people who make a complaint to the healthcare commission have the right to expect a prompt resolution .
" this is a government-created body that is supposed to deal with difficult complaints from worried members of the public , it needs to be properly resourced so that it has the tools to do the job . "

the healthcare commission aims to deal with 85 % of complaints within six months .
but 55 % of the current cases have been with its staff for longer than that .
the commission says it has received far more complaints than it expected , but lawyers and patients ' charities say the delays are unacceptable .
one woman 's wait for her complaint to be resolved i just ca n't move on until i get these answers complainant val johns val johns is sitting in the conservatory of her home in kent , and leafing through a thick pile of correspondence .
her husband robert , who she still describes as her best friend , died from lung cancer four years ago .
she was unhappy with the medical care he received and after feeling she could not get the answers she needed from local nhs bosses in kent , mrs johns took her complaint to the healthcare commission .
that was two years ago - she is still waiting to get their report .
" i just ca n't move on until i get these answers , " said mrs johns .
" you keep hoping every day you 're going to get an answer and it just never comes .
" the first letter i ever had from the healthcare commission was mid-july 2004 - and to today 's date , it 's still going on . "
' timescale was unachievable ' matters do seem to be moving since the bbc began looking at her case - mrs johns has now been told to expect a draft report in a few weeks ' time .
but she is upset she has had to wait and the healthcare commission has admitted her case is an " extreme " example of a wider problem .
when the commission took on a new role of reviewing nhs complaints that could not be resolved locally two years ago , it was hailed as adding a new element of independence to the system .
the commission set a target to complete all cases within six months , but it soon became clear that timescale was unachievable .
in april , the body revised its targets .
now it aims to clear 85 % of cases in six months , and 95 % within a year .
but figures obtained by the bbc under the freedom of information act show that 2,875 of the current workload - that is 55 % - have been with the healthcare commission for more than six months .
and of those , nearly 900 complaints have spent more than a year at this second stage of review .
we 've had to scale up our operation - we 've brought in more people and refined our processes so we can spend time on the more complicated cases the healthcare commission " clearly it 's unacceptable for it to take up to and over a year to reach conclusion of request for an independent review of a complaint , " said peter walsh , who runs action against medical accidents , a charity which promotes patient safety .
" the healthcare commission reports are robust and independent - but patients need an assurance that these matters will be dealt with in a timely and appropriate manner . "
the commission had initially expected to get 5,000 complaints a year - but the figure has turned out to be much higher at 8,000 .
staff feel that more should be done by the nhs at a local level to solve these problems before they get to the stage of needing independent scrutiny .
in the meantime , the commission is trying to tackle the delays .
" it was a surprise that the cases have been arriving in such high numbers , " said marcia fry , head of operational development at the commission .
" we 're sending back nearly a third of them , where we feel not enough investigation has been done at a local level .
" we 've had to scale up our operation - we 've brought in more people and refined our processes so we can spend time on the more complicated cases .
" we certainly admit it 's not ideal - and we 're sorry for people who are caught in the system .
" but we 're getting better - more cases are now being resolved than are coming in each month , so we 're making progress . "
however liberal democrat health spokesman steve webb said : " people who make a complaint to the healthcare commission have the right to expect a prompt resolution .

new guidelines mean all primary , secondary and special needs schools must now provide a minimum of two portions of fruit and vegetables with every meal .
many old favourites are now off the menu - crisps , chocolate and sugary drinks .
this morning on breakfast sarah campbell visited a school in leicester to find out what the new menus look like .
we also spoke to the education minister alan johnson and chef antony worrall thompson .
mr johnson said healthier food was more popular with youngsters .
menu changes had been introduced in hull three to four years ago .
what you told breakfast " the efforts to introduce healthy foods in schools is only half of the solution .
many schools only have two hours worth of physical education . "
stephen henry read more viewers ' comments on our your say page initially there had been a decline in children taking school meals .
but now there was an 8 % increase in primary schools and 15 % in secondary schools .
he told breakfast : " it is not an answer to the problem of obesity , but it has to be part of the solution . "
antony worrall thompson told us more needed to be done to encourage healthy eating and ensure people knew how to cook .
he said : " the government needs to look at the impact that diet is having on society .
" they need to look at the fact that within five or six years , obesity is going to cost the country - the nhs - five times as much as smoking .
" the government is only scratchng the surface . "
michael nelson from the school food trust said the quality of food in schools was improving .
he said : " lots of schools have made progress and the school food trust is there to support all the change that 's needed .
" i think that cooks want to get back to cooking and they are really keen . "
as part of the school meals shake-up , the governement also plans to provide cookery lessons for all pupils who want them .
food experts are delighted with the new nutritional guidelines .

the original series the voyage home deep space nine enterprise the wrath of khan the next generation voyager star trek : the original series -lrb- 1966-1969 -rrb- " narrative shortcomings and political correctness are unable to rob the background and setting of their revolutionary edge . "
david mana , torino , italy star trek was created by policeman-turned-scriptwriter gene roddenberry , and followed the adventures of the crew of the starship enterprise .
according to the opening voice-over , they were on a five-year mission " to explore strange new worlds " and " to boldly go where no man has gone before " .
it gave the series some of its best-remembered characters , from captain james t kirk to the half-vulcan mr spock and chief engineer scotty .

mckenzie , greenock , uk the second star trek film was made 13 years after the original tv series ended .
it featured the villainous khan , who was seeking revenge over captain kirk - now an admiral - after being banished to the edge of the universe in a tv episode called space seed .
at the film 's climax , spock sacrifices his life to help his colleagues escape a deadly missile .

so the enterprise crew travel back to 1986 to find some whales which they plan to send into the future .
during their trip , kirk gets lost on a bus , spock performs a vulcan pinch on a punk , and chekov is arrested by the fbi .

the spock role is taken by brent spiner 's character data - an android who continually attempts to be more human .
comedienne whoopi goldberg had one of the recurring roles in the series .

the captain in this series is benjamin sisko , played by avery brooks , while the supporting cast included science officer jadzia dax and bartender quark .

analysis by steve schifferes economics reporter , bbc news website the us economy has been generating strong economic growth over the past few years as it has come out of recession .
after growing at more than 3 % a year in 2004 and 2005 , the pace picked up to a blistering 5.6 % annual rate in the first quarter of this year - although the pace has since then slipped back to 2.9 % .
so far , though , little of that growth has translated into the hands of the average worker , according to new research from the economic policy institute -lrb- epi -rrb- .
click here for a graph of wages vs. productivity for real household incomes , the median point - the level at which half of households earn more and half less - has actually fallen over the past five years . "
the unprecedented split between growth and living standards is the defining economic agenda " jared bernstein , economic policy institute that marks a notable contrast with the 1990s , when the economic boom boosted both jobs and incomes .
the puzzle of economic expansion without significant job or wage growth has been troubling us economists and commentators of all political persuasions .
slowing wages " the unprecedented split between growth and living standards is the defining economic agenda of the day , " says the epi 's senior economist , jared bernstein .
during the five years from 2000 to 2005 , the us economy grew in size from $ 9.8 trillion to $ 11.2 trillion , an increase in real terms of 14 % .
productivity - the measure of the output of the economy per worker employed - grew even more strongly , by 16.6 % .
but over the same period , the median family 's income slid by 2.9 % , in contrast to the 11.3 % gain registered in the second half of the 1990s .
the wages of households of african or hispanic origin fell even faster .
and new entrants to the labour market fared particularly badly .
average hourly real wages for both college and high school graduates actually fell between 2000 and 2005 , and fewer of the jobs they found carried benefits such as health care or company pensions .
the poor performance of the us economy in delivering fuller wage packets may be one reason why the public gives the bush administration 's such a low rating on economic policy .
according to the latest gallup poll , only 37 % approve of mr bush 's handling of the economy , and 70 % think economic conditions are getting worse , substantially worse figures than in 2004 .
with mid-term elections to the house of representatives and senate - both , currently , held by mr bush 's republicans - due in november , the contrasts are concentrating minds in both main parties .
where has the increase gone ?
one way to comprehend what is happening is to look at the split between how much of the economy is won by profits and how much by wages .
the share allotted to corporate profits increased sharply , from 17.7 % in 2000 to 20.9 % in 2005 , while the share going to wages has reached a record low .
meanwhile , a large section of the workforce - the unemployed or those not seeking work - have not benefited from economic growth .
unemployment has remained stubbornly high despite the economic recovery , with the latest figure at 4.7 % compared to 4 % at the end of 2000 .
overall job growth in the first half of the current decade has been just 1.3 % .
in the 1990s , job growth of some 12 % goes some way towards explaining why prosperity in that earlier period spread down the income scale .
rising inequality even for those with jobs , the fruits of economic growth have been more unequally distributed within the labour market .
the incomes of the top 20 % have grown much faster than earnings of those at the middle or bottom of the income distribution .
the income of the top 1 % and top 0.1 % have grown particularly rapidly .
from 1992 to 2005 , the pay of chief executive officers of major companies rose by 186 % .
the equivalent figure for median hourly wages was 7.2 % , leaving the ratio of ceos ' pay to that of the average worker at 262 .
in the 1960s , the comparable figure was 24 .
there has been much debate about the extent to which the tax policies of the bush administration , which lowered many taxes on capital , have contributed to this trend .
the administration argues that the tax cuts have been vital to the economic recovery , and that more jobs and higher wages will eventually follow gdp growth .
it also says that the encouragement to invest delivered by lower taxes has made the us more productive , and therefore more competitive in the global economy .
explanations the authors of the epi report argue that low minimum wages , weakened union power , and the loss of both blue and white-collar jobs to off shoring do much to explain the jobs picture .
admittedly the federal minimum wage has been static for a decade , but the downward pressure on wages is probably coming from other sources .
one is immigration , which may have a greater effect on the wages of low-skilled workers .
another is the " china effect , " , the idea that low prices of imported manufactured goods are pushing us industry to cut its workforce in order to increase productivity .
the head of the us central bank , ben bernanke , recently admitted that globalisation was producing losers as well as winners .
" the changes in the pattern of production are likely to threaten the livelihoods of some workers and the profits of some firms , even when these changes lead to greater productivity , " he said .
so for politicians of all parties , trying to understand how the average family can gain a greater share in future prosperity may prove one of the biggest electoral challenges of the year. return to top e-mail this to a friend related internet links us labor department economic policy institute us federal reserve the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites search bbc news : news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- business contents : your money -pipe- economy companies newswatch -pipe- notes -pipe- contact us -pipe- about bbc news -pipe- profiles -pipe- history ^ back to top -pipe- bbc sport home -pipe- bbc homepage -pipe- contact us -pipe- help -pipe- ©

meanwhile , a large section of the workforce - the unemployed or those not seeking work - have not benefited from economic growth .
unemployment has remained stubbornly high despite the economic recovery , with the latest figure at 4.7 % compared to 4 % at the end of 2000 .
overall job growth in the first half of the current decade has been just 1.3 % .
in the 1990s , job growth of some 12 % goes some way towards explaining why prosperity in that earlier period spread down the income scale .
rising inequality even for those with jobs , the fruits of economic growth have been more unequally distributed within the labour market .
the incomes of the top 20 % have grown much faster than earnings of those at the middle or bottom of the income distribution .
the income of the top 1 % and top 0.1 % have grown particularly rapidly .
from 1992 to 2005 , the pay of chief executive officers of major companies rose by 186 % .
the equivalent figure for median hourly wages was 7.2 % , leaving the ratio of ceos ' pay to that of the average worker at 262 .
in the 1960s , the comparable figure was 24 .
there has been much debate about the extent to which the tax policies of the bush administration , which lowered many taxes on capital , have contributed to this trend .
the administration argues that the tax cuts have been vital to the economic recovery , and that more jobs and higher wages will eventually follow gdp growth .
it also says that the encouragement to invest delivered by lower taxes has made the us more productive , and therefore more competitive in the global economy .
explanations the authors of the epi report argue that low minimum wages , weakened union power , and the loss of both blue and white-collar jobs to off shoring do much to explain the jobs picture .
admittedly the federal minimum wage has been static for a decade , but the downward pressure on wages is probably coming from other sources .
one is immigration , which may have a greater effect on the wages of low-skilled workers .
another is the " china effect , " , the idea that low prices of imported manufactured goods are pushing us industry to cut its workforce in order to increase productivity .
the head of the us central bank , ben bernanke , recently admitted that globalisation was producing losers as well as winners .

analysis by steve schifferes economics reporter , bbc news website wage growth for average workers has been stagnant the us economy has been generating strong economic growth over the past few years as it has come out of recession .
after growing at more than 3 % a year in 2004 and 2005 , the pace picked up to a blistering 5.6 % annual rate in the first quarter of this year - although the pace has since then slipped back to 2.9 % .
so far , though , little of that growth has translated into the hands of the average worker , according to new research from the economic policy institute -lrb- epi -rrb- .
click here for a graph of wages vs. productivity for real household incomes , the median point - the level at which half of households earn more and half less - has actually fallen over the past five years .
the unprecedented split between growth and living standards is the defining economic agenda jared bernstein , economic policy institute that marks a notable contrast with the 1990s , when the economic boom boosted both jobs and incomes .
the puzzle of economic expansion without significant job or wage growth has been troubling us economists and commentators of all political persuasions .
slowing wages " the unprecedented split between growth and living standards is the defining economic agenda of the day , " says the epi 's senior economist , jared bernstein .
during the five years from 2000 to 2005 , the us economy grew in size from $ 9.8 trillion to $ 11.2 trillion , an increase in real terms of 14 % .
productivity - the measure of the output of the economy per worker employed - grew even more strongly , by 16.6 % .
but over the same period , the median family 's income slid by 2.9 % , in contrast to the 11.3 % gain registered in the second half of the 1990s .
the wages of households of african or hispanic origin fell even faster .
and new entrants to the labour market fared particularly badly .
average hourly real wages for both college and high school graduates actually fell between 2000 and 2005 , and fewer of the jobs they found carried benefits such as health care or company pensions .
the poor performance of the us economy in delivering fuller wage packets may be one reason why the public gives the bush administration 's such a low rating on economic policy .
according to the latest gallup poll , only 37 % approve of mr bush 's handling of the economy , and 70 % think economic conditions are getting worse , substantially worse figures than in 2004 .
with mid-term elections to the house of representatives and senate - both , currently , held by mr bush 's republicans - due in november , the contrasts are concentrating minds in both main parties .

and new entrants to the labour market fared particularly badly .
average hourly real wages for both college and high school graduates actually fell between 2000 and 2005 , and fewer of the jobs they found carried benefits such as health care or company pensions .
the poor performance of the us economy in delivering fuller wage packets may be one reason why the public gives the bush administration 's such a low rating on economic policy .
according to the latest gallup poll , only 37 % approve of mr bush 's handling of the economy , and 70 % think economic conditions are getting worse , substantially worse figures than in 2004 .
with mid-term elections to the house of representatives and senate - both , currently , held by mr bush 's republicans - due in november , the contrasts are concentrating minds in both main parties .
where has the increase gone ?
one way to comprehend what is happening is to look at the split between how much of the economy is won by profits and how much by wages .
the share allotted to corporate profits increased sharply , from 17.7 % in 2000 to 20.9 % in 2005 , while the share going to wages has reached a record low .
meanwhile , a large section of the workforce - the unemployed or those not seeking work - have not benefited from economic growth .
unemployment has remained stubbornly high despite the economic recovery , with the latest figure at 4.7 % compared to 4 % at the end of 2000 .
overall job growth in the first half of the current decade has been just 1.3 % .
in the 1990s , job growth of some 12 % goes some way towards explaining why prosperity in that earlier period spread down the income scale .
rising inequality even for those with jobs , the fruits of economic growth have been more unequally distributed within the labour market .
the incomes of the top 20 % have grown much faster than earnings of those at the middle or bottom of the income distribution .
the income of the top 1 % and top 0.1 % have grown particularly rapidly .
from 1992 to 2005 , the pay of chief executive officers of major companies rose by 186 % .
the equivalent figure for median hourly wages was 7.2 % , leaving the ratio of ceos ' pay to that of the average worker at 262 .
in the 1960s , the comparable figure was 24 .
there has been much debate about the extent to which the tax policies of the bush administration , which lowered many taxes on capital , have contributed to this trend .
the administration argues that the tax cuts have been vital to the economic recovery , and that more jobs and higher wages will eventually follow gdp growth .
it also says that the encouragement to invest delivered by lower taxes has made the us more productive , and therefore more competitive in the global economy .
explanations the authors of the epi report argue that low minimum wages , weakened union power , and the loss of both blue and white-collar jobs to off shoring do much to explain the jobs picture .
admittedly the federal minimum wage has been static for a decade , but the downward pressure on wages is probably coming from other sources .
one is immigration , which may have a greater effect on the wages of low-skilled workers .
another is the " china effect , " , the idea that low prices of imported manufactured goods are pushing us industry to cut its workforce in order to increase productivity .
the head of the us central bank , ben bernanke , recently admitted that globalisation was producing losers as well as winners .
" the changes in the pattern of production are likely to threaten the livelihoods of some workers and the profits of some firms , even when these changes lead to greater productivity , " he said .
so for politicians of all parties , trying to understand how the average family can gain a greater share in future prosperity may prove one of the biggest electoral challenges of the year. return to top e-mail this to a friend printable version bookmark with : delicious digg reddit facebook stumbleupon what are these ?

the puzzle of economic expansion without significant job or wage growth has been troubling us economists and commentators of all political persuasions .
slowing wages " the unprecedented split between growth and living standards is the defining economic agenda of the day , " says the epi 's senior economist , jared bernstein .
during the five years from 2000 to 2005 , the us economy grew in size from $ 9.8 trillion to $ 11.2 trillion , an increase in real terms of 14 % .
