the body called for new laws to control spies . in a report examining the possible role of european countries in the alleged illegal cia transfer of terrorist suspects and secret detentions , the council of europe criticized its member states for a lack of legislative control of foreign secret services operating on their territory . " it would appear that most of europe is a happy hunting ground for foreign security services , " secretary general terry davis told a news conference after the report 's release at the body 's headquarters in the french city of strasbourg .
" hardly any country has any legal provisions to ensure an effective oversight over the activities of foreign security services on their territory . " the report did not produce evidence that the us had run secret jails in europe .
however , it called for better oversight and regulation by national parliaments and judicial bodies when human rights abuses were suspected and better controls of foreign intelligence services .

this decrease was less than the fall of 20,000 expected by economists , however . on the plus side , business confidence in germany is at a 14-year high point and consumers are feeling increasingly optimistic as the recovery in the eurozone 's biggest economy gathers pace . still , experts are wary of being overly optimistic , cautioning that the current " feel-good " sentiment had yet to be reflected in real economic data . slow progress ? many observers have voiced fears that the forced political alliance between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will result in stagnation on pressing economic issues . " when it comes to economics , i 'm not disappointed , because i did n't expect too much to begin with , " said paul clemens friedhoff , economics expert for the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" the two partners in this coalition are far from singing the same song . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer spending is going up now , but experts say that will change with the planned vat hike the cdu and spd have managed to agree on a 25-billion euro -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- investment program to jump-start the economy , but critics say the program will be ineffectual come next year when consumer spending is expected to dip due to the cdu 's three-percent increase in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- . no shortage of issues merkel 's coalition will also have to make up its mind on how to regulate the low-wage sector .
a debate about the introduction of a minimum wage for all sectors is in full swing now , but a decision is not expected before the second half of this year . among other economic issues demanding the government 's attention is a corporate tax reform - on the back burner for the moment because the coalition partners can ’ t agree on a sustainable model . there 's also the issue of fresh borrowing .
in 2006 , over 38 billion euros will be added to germany 's pile of debt , with a turnaround on this front only expected in 2007 . a more immediate concern is the current atmosphere of discontent , with tens of thousands of public-sector employees , including garbage collectors , hospital staff and child-care workers on strike all around the country in protest against longer working hours and cuts in bonuses . " if we are seeing a recovery in germany it is not a very strong one , " said adam posen , an economist at the institute for international economics in washington .
" merkel will ultimately be judged on whether she can push through reforms and deliver on the economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.03.2006 " the account of the german role was explicit " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did german intelligence help the us topple saddam hussein ?
the new york times web site reported this week that german agents provided us intelligence with an iraqi defense plan shortly before the us-led invasion .
dw-radio spoke to michael r. gordon , who broke the scoop . michael r. gordon : i did n't produce the american military report .
i faithfully quoted and presented the quotes in the report .
they 're in my book , " cobra ii : the inside story of the invasion and occupation of iraq , " and they 're on the website of the new york times , presented exactly as they are in that report . what strikes me is that the account of the german role is so specific and the description of the institutional arrangements they describe of the german intelligence liaison officer in qatar .
they describe him handing off a document to a defense intelligence agency official .
they say that there were two german agents in baghdad .
there are so many details here that , while i ca n't personally say with 100 percent confidence that they 're right or wrong , i do think that the report on its face appears to be highly credible and warrants more scrutiny and investigation than i think has been carried out so far . dw-radio : how did you end up with this report ? i certainly did n't set out to report on germany .
i have been working on a book on iraq for the last two years .
in the process of working on this book , i was very interested in the research that the american military had done on their iraqi counterparts .
after every war , militaries study the foe and try to figure out what the other guy was doing while they were fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militaries regularly review past actions to learn from them as i accessed a report on this , i saw that there was a very detailed discussion of saddam 's plans to defend baghdad and the pros and cons of saddam 's plan .
and in this section of the report , there was a bit of an aside which explained how this scheme for the defense of baghdad came to the attention of the united states central command , which was general tommy franks ' command .
and in no uncertain terms , this report said that the sketch of the defense arrangements for the defense of baghdad was supplied by a german liaison officer in qatar , and that he gave it to a member of the united states defense intelligence agency who worked in general franks ' headquarters . that caught my attention .
i was really struck by how explicit the account was of the german role and how detailed it was . you 've heard no doubt that a lot of people in germany are saying this was a so-called targeted leak designed to punish the previous german administration for opposing the iraq war .
what is your response ? that was certainly not my intention , nor the intention of anybody who provided access to this .
again , this is a study that i accessed not to learn about germany but to learn about what the iraqis were up to , and which i accessed some months ago .
the german portion of this report is rather small . the reason that this is coming out now is my book is coming out in march .
since completing my book leave i 've returned to the new york times , and i 've begun to harvest the material in the book and make it available to the times ' readers .
if i 'd finished my book a little earlier , it would have come out a few months ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us agents could have been inserted into the embassies of allies ' in baghdad , gordon said this type of cooperation - passing information back and forth - is this at all unusual among intelligence services ? i think it 's entirely understandable and not surprising .
intelligence agencies have relationships which continue despite political problems between capitals , and that 's because the services need to work together even after their regimes change .
in the case of iraq , the united states really did n't have very good intelligence - this i think ought to be clear , i mean , there was no wmd , the us was wrong on that .
and it 's a matter of public record that the united states did n't have a single spy in iraq with direct access to iraq 's wmd programs .

the new york times web site reported this week that german agents provided us intelligence with an iraqi defense plan shortly before the us-led invasion .
dw-radio spoke to michael r. gordon , who broke the scoop . michael r. gordon : i did n't produce the american military report .
i faithfully quoted and presented the quotes in the report .
they 're in my book , " cobra ii : the inside story of the invasion and occupation of iraq , " and they 're on the website of the new york times , presented exactly as they are in that report . what strikes me is that the account of the german role is so specific and the description of the institutional arrangements they describe of the german intelligence liaison officer in qatar .
they describe him handing off a document to a defense intelligence agency official .
they say that there were two german agents in baghdad .
there are so many details here that , while i ca n't personally say with 100 percent confidence that they 're right or wrong , i do think that the report on its face appears to be highly credible and warrants more scrutiny and investigation than i think has been carried out so far . dw-radio : how did you end up with this report ? i certainly did n't set out to report on germany .
i have been working on a book on iraq for the last two years .
in the process of working on this book , i was very interested in the research that the american military had done on their iraqi counterparts .
after every war , militaries study the foe and try to figure out what the other guy was doing while they were fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militaries regularly review past actions to learn from them as i accessed a report on this , i saw that there was a very detailed discussion of saddam 's plans to defend baghdad and the pros and cons of saddam 's plan .
and in this section of the report , there was a bit of an aside which explained how this scheme for the defense of baghdad came to the attention of the united states central command , which was general tommy franks ' command .
and in no uncertain terms , this report said that the sketch of the defense arrangements for the defense of baghdad was supplied by a german liaison officer in qatar , and that he gave it to a member of the united states defense intelligence agency who worked in general franks ' headquarters . that caught my attention .
i was really struck by how explicit the account was of the german role and how detailed it was . you 've heard no doubt that a lot of people in germany are saying this was a so-called targeted leak designed to punish the previous german administration for opposing the iraq war .
what is your response ? that was certainly not my intention , nor the intention of anybody who provided access to this .
again , this is a study that i accessed not to learn about germany but to learn about what the iraqis were up to , and which i accessed some months ago .
the german portion of this report is rather small . the reason that this is coming out now is my book is coming out in march .
since completing my book leave i 've returned to the new york times , and i 've begun to harvest the material in the book and make it available to the times ' readers .
if i 'd finished my book a little earlier , it would have come out a few months ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us agents could have been inserted into the embassies of allies ' in baghdad , gordon said this type of cooperation - passing information back and forth - is this at all unusual among intelligence services ? i think it 's entirely understandable and not surprising .
intelligence agencies have relationships which continue despite political problems between capitals , and that 's because the services need to work together even after their regimes change .
in the case of iraq , the united states really did n't have very good intelligence - this i think ought to be clear , i mean , there was no wmd , the us was wrong on that .
and it 's a matter of public record that the united states did n't have a single spy in iraq with direct access to iraq 's wmd programs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.03.2006 " the account of the german role was explicit " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did german intelligence help the us topple saddam hussein ?
the new york times web site reported this week that german agents provided us intelligence with an iraqi defense plan shortly before the us-led invasion .
dw-radio spoke to michael r. gordon , who broke the scoop . michael r. gordon : i did n't produce the american military report .
i faithfully quoted and presented the quotes in the report .
they 're in my book , " cobra ii : the inside story of the invasion and occupation of iraq , " and they 're on the website of the new york times , presented exactly as they are in that report . what strikes me is that the account of the german role is so specific and the description of the institutional arrangements they describe of the german intelligence liaison officer in qatar .
they describe him handing off a document to a defense intelligence agency official .
they say that there were two german agents in baghdad .
there are so many details here that , while i ca n't personally say with 100 percent confidence that they 're right or wrong , i do think that the report on its face appears to be highly credible and warrants more scrutiny and investigation than i think has been carried out so far . dw-radio : how did you end up with this report ? i certainly did n't set out to report on germany .
i have been working on a book on iraq for the last two years .
in the process of working on this book , i was very interested in the research that the american military had done on their iraqi counterparts .
after every war , militaries study the foe and try to figure out what the other guy was doing while they were fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militaries regularly review past actions to learn from them as i accessed a report on this , i saw that there was a very detailed discussion of saddam 's plans to defend baghdad and the pros and cons of saddam 's plan .
and in this section of the report , there was a bit of an aside which explained how this scheme for the defense of baghdad came to the attention of the united states central command , which was general tommy franks ' command .
and in no uncertain terms , this report said that the sketch of the defense arrangements for the defense of baghdad was supplied by a german liaison officer in qatar , and that he gave it to a member of the united states defense intelligence agency who worked in general franks ' headquarters . that caught my attention .
i was really struck by how explicit the account was of the german role and how detailed it was . you 've heard no doubt that a lot of people in germany are saying this was a so-called targeted leak designed to punish the previous german administration for opposing the iraq war .
what is your response ? that was certainly not my intention , nor the intention of anybody who provided access to this .
again , this is a study that i accessed not to learn about germany but to learn about what the iraqis were up to , and which i accessed some months ago .
the german portion of this report is rather small . the reason that this is coming out now is my book is coming out in march .
since completing my book leave i 've returned to the new york times , and i 've begun to harvest the material in the book and make it available to the times ' readers .
if i 'd finished my book a little earlier , it would have come out a few months ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us agents could have been inserted into the embassies of allies ' in baghdad , gordon said this type of cooperation - passing information back and forth - is this at all unusual among intelligence services ? i think it 's entirely understandable and not surprising .

" from warsaw to london and davos , in jerusalem and ramallah , merkel succeeded in combining the diplomatic inheritance of her mentor , helmut kohl , with that of her predecessor , gerhard schröder - the european and atlantic tradition of the one , and the defense of national interests of the other , " the paper commented .
a question of gender ? britain 's financial times decided to speculate on whether the initial successes of merkel 's chancellorship could be put down to a certain " female touch " she brings to foreign policy .
well aware that such a hypothesis could be thrown out by some as " thinly veiled discrimination , " the paper nonetheless made a case for its assumption , arguing : " after all , she visited president george w. bush in washington to relaunch a productive german-american relationship but uttered clear words on the need to close down the guantanamo prison .
she decided not to embrace -lrb- nor kiss à la gerhard schröder -rrb- vladimir putin , russia 's president , and sent strong signals to hamas .
from these initial - and very successful - moves we may draw two rules that seem to apply to ms. merkel 's ' female ' foreign policy : firm but sober on principles , tough but patient on implementation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a less-than-flattering view of merkel 's relationship with the us administration the swiss paper der bund took a closer look at what 's behind the praise being heaped on the merkel administration , and found that the positive reviews are deceptive .
it commented that " the team around the cdu leader profited to a large extent from the implosion of the red-green coalition in 2005 , and the paralysis that set in after the indecisive election .
compared to that uncertainty , the unspectacular but solidly working government is a boon , no matter whether or not you agree with what it 's doing . "
but the paper feared that this would not be enough in the long run , and predicted that merkel - who it described as more of a social democrat in some points than the social democrats themselves - risks frustrating her grand coalition partners . the paris-based paper libération also foresaw difficulties for merkel in the future , mainly because , as it commented , " she has not even had to get to grips with the bigger stones lying in her path . "
everyone 's waiting for merkel to tackle issues such as unemployment and the financing of health care - issues where the cdu and the spd do not at all see eye to eye , the paper wrote . unemployment the true test britain 's the times , however , said that merkel 's aura has already begun to fade , and predicted that the issue of unemployment will be her undoing .
" dozens of bouquets have been prepared to mark her 100th day as chancellor , but the only number that seemed to count was the 5,048,000 on the dole , " the paper wrote .
on the domestic front , merkel has changed the law to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 and increase vat by three points , but according to the times , " neither initiative addresses the dilemma of how to translate higher growth - now predicted to be 1.5 percent this year - into jobs .

on the contrary , harmony is the watchword so far .
political scientist klaus detterbeck looks back and ahead . dw-world : the grand coalition 's grace period - its first hundred days - is now over .
one gets the impression that the government has made a better impression than was once expected . klaus detterbeck : i think so too .
surveys regarding angela merkel and the christian democrats are good right now .
there are two reasons for this relatively good start for the grand coalition .
first , there have been successes , like chancellor merkel 's trip to the us , to russia and at the eu summit , as well as some overall positive economic developments .
secondly , the populace has given the chancellor something of an advance when it comes to trust .
people are willing to give this coalition some time to find its footing .
a majority of people have the feeling that a solid , capable team is at the helm , as opposed to that of the last schröder government . so are the individuals in the government less important than the " team " as a whole ? yes , you could say that .
that has to do with chancellor merkel 's role as a director .
she is not a big personality out front , who calls all the shots .
rather she 's the person who steers the entire team .
that makes her different than schröder , who was something of a showman who pranced on the political stage . despite the laurels , has the country really progressed toward finding solutions to some of its problems ? it 's true that there have been no big decisions made as yet .
there is this positive impression , a positive undertone , but the real foundation for new policies has n't yet been laid .
negotiations still have to take place about federalism reform , and other big reform projects have yet to be tackled . angela merkel enjoys a good deal of sympathy from journalists of all stripes .
she is also respected by foreign leaders .
what is different about her ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular with journalists these days she leaves the impression of being someone who does solid work and does n't push her way to the front .
instead , she tries to enact good policies for the good of the country .
in the grand coalition , she is engaging in the politics of inclusion .
that 's to her great credit . will she be successful if she continues to follow this strategy ?
what about when she has to get down to the nitty-gritty ? one of her strengths is her ability to hold the two camps together .
but in fact , this advantage could turn into a disadvantage if it comes time to make difficult decisions and she finds it hard to assert her authority , depending on a consensus for decisions . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have lost popularity among voters .
does the party have the wrong party chairman or is its strategy faulty ? the spd has two problems .
for one , they have the rather " unpleasant " ministries : -lrb- franz -rrb- müntefering at labor and -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrück at finance .
on the other hand , people still are n't sure what this party actually stands for .
is it a reform party , which is how it 's been seen over the past few years under schröder ?
or is it headed back in a more traditional , union-oriented direction ?
-lrb- matthias -rrb- platzeck is still not in the position to explain where the party should go from here and it 's hurting because of that . let 's look at the opposition .
does one actually still exist and if so , is it able to attract any attention to itself ? it 's true that the opposition parties have problems finding an audience .
the left party is mostly concerned with itself these days ; the greens have n't found their direction yet ; and the free democrats are having a hard time making their mark .
these are tough times for the smaller parties .
we 'll have to see how they do at the end of march , when there are elections in rheinland-palatinate , saxony-anhalt and baden-württemberg . political scientist klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . steffen leidel spoke with klaus detterbeck send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges recovery and resolve in first speech angela merkel gave her first speech to parliament as german chancellor wednesday and spoke of a strong germany full of opportunities and a country that would stand firm on the issues of justice and equal rights .

that makes her different than schröder , who was something of a showman who pranced on the political stage . despite the laurels , has the country really progressed toward finding solutions to some of its problems ? it 's true that there have been no big decisions made as yet .
there is this positive impression , a positive undertone , but the real foundation for new policies has n't yet been laid .
negotiations still have to take place about federalism reform , and other big reform projects have yet to be tackled . angela merkel enjoys a good deal of sympathy from journalists of all stripes .
she is also respected by foreign leaders .
what is different about her ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular with journalists these days she leaves the impression of being someone who does solid work and does n't push her way to the front .
instead , she tries to enact good policies for the good of the country .
in the grand coalition , she is engaging in the politics of inclusion .
that 's to her great credit . will she be successful if she continues to follow this strategy ?
what about when she has to get down to the nitty-gritty ? one of her strengths is her ability to hold the two camps together .
but in fact , this advantage could turn into a disadvantage if it comes time to make difficult decisions and she finds it hard to assert her authority , depending on a consensus for decisions . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have lost popularity among voters .
does the party have the wrong party chairman or is its strategy faulty ? the spd has two problems .
for one , they have the rather " unpleasant " ministries : -lrb- franz -rrb- müntefering at labor and -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrück at finance .
on the other hand , people still are n't sure what this party actually stands for .
is it a reform party , which is how it 's been seen over the past few years under schröder ?
or is it headed back in a more traditional , union-oriented direction ?
-lrb- matthias -rrb- platzeck is still not in the position to explain where the party should go from here and it 's hurting because of that . let 's look at the opposition .
does one actually still exist and if so , is it able to attract any attention to itself ? it 's true that the opposition parties have problems finding an audience .
the left party is mostly concerned with itself these days ; the greens have n't found their direction yet ; and the free democrats are having a hard time making their mark .
these are tough times for the smaller parties .
we 'll have to see how they do at the end of march , when there are elections in rheinland-palatinate , saxony-anhalt and baden-württemberg . political scientist klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . steffen leidel spoke with klaus detterbeck send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges recovery and resolve in first speech angela merkel gave her first speech to parliament as german chancellor wednesday and spoke of a strong germany full of opportunities and a country that would stand firm on the issues of justice and equal rights .

becoming germany 's first female leader was not easy , but angela merkel has already carved her name high up in the popularity stakes . the grand coalition has been in office for a full 100 days , which means the period of grace traditionally granted a new government , is officially over .
but with the german public appearing more than willing to continue supporting the conservative cdu / csu and social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- alliance , that is of little relevance .
angela merkel is enjoying massive popularity and opinion polls suggest that her party is steaming ahead of their coalition partner , the spd . but at the federal elections last september , the picture was quite different .
the two main parties were unable to beat each other , and the results of the ballot made it impossible for either the cdu / csu to form a coalition with the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- or for the spd-green alliance to continue running the country .
the additional parliamentary presence of the left party meant the only alternative was to form a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder fought it out for the top spot and that very coalition , so it turns out , is what the majority of german voters wanted .

becoming germany 's first female leader was not easy , but angela merkel has already carved her name high up in the popularity stakes . the grand coalition has been in office for a full 100 days , which means the period of grace traditionally granted a new government , is officially over .
but with the german public appearing more than willing to continue supporting the conservative cdu / csu and social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- alliance , that is of little relevance .
angela merkel is enjoying massive popularity and opinion polls suggest that her party is steaming ahead of their coalition partner , the spd . but at the federal elections last september , the picture was quite different .
the two main parties were unable to beat each other , and the results of the ballot made it impossible for either the cdu / csu to form a coalition with the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- or for the spd-green alliance to continue running the country .
the additional parliamentary presence of the left party meant the only alternative was to form a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder fought it out for the top spot and that very coalition , so it turns out , is what the majority of german voters wanted .
in it , they see the possibility of fulfilled expectations and greater harmony .
on the latter point , with coalition partners who treat one another with care and are quick to resolve budding disputes , the electorate can be satisfied . yet , on the former , expectations regarding unemployment reduction remain unfulfilled .

the additional parliamentary presence of the left party meant the only alternative was to form a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder fought it out for the top spot and that very coalition , so it turns out , is what the majority of german voters wanted .
in it , they see the possibility of fulfilled expectations and greater harmony .
on the latter point , with coalition partners who treat one another with care and are quick to resolve budding disputes , the electorate can be satisfied . yet , on the former , expectations regarding unemployment reduction remain unfulfilled .
there is also reason to believe that the two sides will clash over continued welfare and health reforms . showing germany 's new face abroad on the international stage , merkel made a good first impression .
she breezed confidently through her debut visits to paris , london and washington , but they were not meant to serve as opportunities to iron out any serious conflicts of interest .
merkel has not yet shown what position she will take on washington 's stance on the iranian nuclear program .
and although the new german leader 's appearance at the eu budget summit met with applause , it 's not entirely clear to what extent that was the result of her financial generosity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vice chancellor and labor minister , franz müntefering meanwhile , the grand coalition is an acid test for the social democrats who are trying to profile themselves .
thus far , labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering has been viewed as the spd heavyweight in the cabinet , but he is not coordinating well with the new party head , matthias platzeck , and internal conflicts could become a problem for the coalition . although on the whole germany 's grand coalition conveys a stable impression , keeping it up depends on how much space the two partners have for profiling themselves .
merkel is making something of a name for herself as a leader who moderates discussions without clearly stating her position .
for the chancellor of a grand coalition that could be a good technique , but the question is whether it is sustainable beyond regional elections at the end of march . heinz dylong -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de refining merkel 's makeover angela merkel has come a long way from fashion fiasco to chic chancellor .

it was the first case in germany of the bird flu being transmitted to a mammal . meanwhile , a government crisis team continued to meet in berlin , to discuss measures against the deadliest form of the virus . who : ' no i n creased huma n threat ' the cat grabbed the headlines in several countries in europe , but the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- in geneva said it did not increase the threat to human health from the virus .
since late 2003 , 93 people have died from bird flu , but they have contracted the virus from contact with infected birds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dead cat on rügen was said to be a stray " there is no present evidence that domestic cats play a role in the transmission cycle of h5n1 viruses .
to date , no human case has been linked to exposure to a diseased cat , " it said .
" unlike the case in domestic and wild birds , there is no evidence that domestic cats are a reservoir of the virus . " bird flu has killed or led to the culling of some 200 million birds since it re-emerged in asia in late 2003 .
the real fear for human health is that the virus will mutate into a form that passes easily from person to person , sparking a pandemic in which millions could die . representatives of german state and local governments today agreed in a telephone conference to examine dead mammals found in areas already known to contain the h5n1 virus , or those where deaths seem suspicious . bird lockdow n could drag o n but they recommended against vaccinating house cats , saying it was not target-oriented enough , since there is no appropriate vaccination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers in protective clothing combed the island of rügen for dead fowl meanwhile , germany 's agriculture ministry has said germany may be forced to keep domesticated birds enclosed through april . " we may have no choice , if the flu keeps raging beyond the migration period , " said agriculture secretary gert lindemann , who is heading up the task force that met in berlin wednesday . a n imal supporters war n of pa n ic the german animal protection league warned of an unnecessary panic outbreak .
cats do not need to be kept indoors germany-wide , they said in a statement , but in areas where the bird flu has already been found , owners should keep close watch over their animals . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu jumps to cat in germany a dead cat in germany has tested positive for the h5n1 type of bird flu in the first case in the country of the virus spreading from birds to mammals , the national veterinary laboratory said on wednesday .

matters worsened for the visitors three minutes later . del piero 's quickly-taken free-kick surprised the german back four and sent gilardino racing clear towards goal .
the 23-year-old ac milan striker looked up and unselfishly slid the ball across to give toni a tap-in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luca toni celebrated after just seven minutes italy might have had a third moments later when del piero 's crossed free-kick found gilardino unmarked , but he failed by just a few inches to make a connection . germany then sliced italy open with their first genuine attack , but gianluigi buffon pulled off a superb save to keep out sebastian deisler 's vicious drive . de rossi made it 3-0 in the 39th minute , applying the finishing touch to mauro camoranesi 's cross as the german defense suffered another alarming lapse in concentration . " it 's i n explicable " limiting the damage was germany 's task now , but they leaked another goal in the 56th minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniele de rossi -lrb- right -rrb- and robert huth -lrb- left -rrb- gilardino 's cross from the left was headed back across goal by camoranesi and del piero dived low to head past a helpless lehmann . huth 's late strike was of little consolation for the poor germans . " it 's inexplicable how one can fall back so quickly , " said german captain michael ballack , who added that italy 's early lead had made his team insecure .
" the mistakes we made were punished hard .
thankfully there will be another match in three weeks and then it 's going to be a different german national team . " national coach jürgen klinsmann also said that he still had high hopes for his team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann " of course we 're disappointed - we had high hopes and there were smashed within the first minutes , " said german national coach jürgen klinsmann .
" it was a frustrating lesson for us , but we believe in this team and we believe in the young players .
we 're confident that everything will work in 100 days . " but the weak performance had commentators worried about the team 's readiness to succeed in the world cup this summer at home . " if the italians were to really go for it , germany would look even worse , " said reinhold beckmann , the match 's commentator for german public broadcaster ard .
" the real question is whether the german team is just too young . " the team still has three chances to prove that it is ready for the world cup .
on march 22 , it will face the us , followed by matches against japan on may 30 and colombia on june 2 . the german team opens the world cup on june 9 against costa rica . hooliga n s n ot impressed by pope 's appeal before the match , a message by pope benedict xvi called for an end to racist chanting and emblems at football matches and urged football fans to adopt " respect and dialogue " ahead of this summer 's world cup in his native germany . both nations ' football authorities had dedicated the match to opposing all forms of racial violence .
racism has been a serious problem in italy 's elite seria a league this season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-born pope got a world cup pennant from german soccer legend franz beckenbauer last october the 78-year-old pontiff said he appreciated the initiative to combat racial discrimination , which he said would " consolidate awareness of the important educative function of sport in the service of solidarity and peace . " but before the match , german and italian hooligans tried to start a fight and fired off signal rockets .
according to the german soccer federation , 900 tickets had been sold to german fans , with 600 seated in a closed-off area .

as such , it invests more in research and development than any other branch in germany . the development race is a moveable feast , an ongoing process of honing and fine-tuning the already state-of-the-art .
as fashions shift , so too do motorized visions .
the latest comes in the form of a zero-emissions hydrogen-fuelled model , which - although still in its infant stages of development - has already generated a climate of intense competition among the big name manufacturers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling up on a tank load of diesel until the motor of the future is ready to hit the road -lrb- and that is not expected for at least another 15 years -rrb- , the search for alternative sources of fuel will continue . " we spend between 30 and 35 percent of our overall budget on engine technology and fuel , " said volkswagen head of research , franz-josef paefgen .
" we had a look at exactly what we could do with existing technology and our development findings , and realized that over the next few years , europe could replace half its fuel consumption with alternative fuel sources . " long haul there is no doubt , however , that it will take a long time to get away from oil altogether .
there is no single great way to cleaner cars , but a whole host of possibilities which range from the hybrid combustion-electric engine to a mixture of bio fuels . bernd gottschalk , president of the association of the german automobile industry , said they have recognized that so-called " designer fuels , " with biomass or cellulose components , are ideal for future generations of engines . " they are steps towards reducing co2 by 90 percent , which would be a win-win situation for everyone , " gottschalk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new cars wait in line there is not , however , much use in equipping cars with futuristic engines if there are no gas stations for filling up the tank .
in that regard , germany lags miles behind the likes of sweden , which with its 300 gas-ethanol stations has made ford 's flexi-fuel technology the order of the day . as it stands , germany has but one such filling station in the whole country , and although that is clearly not enough , bernhard mattes , head of ford germany , said it is a step in the right direction . " at ford , we invest heavily in research and development because we believe that sustainable mobility can only work if we develop alternative engines , and continue research into driving dynamics and automobile security , " he said . the broader picture but finding a balance between making motoring safer for the environment and those on the roads is a tricky business . thomas weber , a daimlerchrysler board member and head of development at the mercedes car group said environmentally friendly engines and crash structures both make cars heavier . # b # " we know that an additional 20 kilos increases fuel consumption by one percent , so we have to ensure that however innovative the technology , the cars are not too heavy , " weber said .
" if we are clever , we will find a solution to benefit both the environment and the customer . " the race is definitely on .
with the number of cars on the roads expected to double in the next 15 years , manufacturers are not only working against each other , but against the clock to come up with sustainable solutions for generations to come . henrik böhme -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese cars pick up speed in germany even as german automobile manufactures look to china 's millions of people to boost profits , the first chinese cars are rolling down the export ramp and into mercedes and bmw territory .

matters worsened for the visitors three minutes later . del piero 's quickly-taken free-kick surprised the german back four and sent gilardino racing clear towards goal .
the 23-year-old ac milan striker looked up and unselfishly slid the ball across to give toni a tap-in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luca toni celebrated after just seven minutes italy might have had a third moments later when del piero 's crossed free-kick found gilardino unmarked , but he failed by just a few inches to make a connection . germany then sliced italy open with their first genuine attack , but gianluigi buffon pulled off a superb save to keep out sebastian deisler 's vicious drive . de rossi made it 3-0 in the 39th minute , applying the finishing touch to mauro camoranesi 's cross as the german defense suffered another alarming lapse in concentration . " it 's i n explicable " limiting the damage was germany 's task now , but they leaked another goal in the 56th minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniele de rossi -lrb- right -rrb- and robert huth -lrb- left -rrb- gilardino 's cross from the left was headed back across goal by camoranesi and del piero dived low to head past a helpless lehmann . huth 's late strike was of little consolation for the poor germans . " it 's inexplicable how one can fall back so quickly , " said german captain michael ballack , who added that italy 's early lead had made his team insecure .
" the mistakes we made were punished hard .
thankfully there will be another match in three weeks and then it 's going to be a different german national team . " national coach jürgen klinsmann also said that he still had high hopes for his team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann " of course we 're disappointed - we had high hopes and there were smashed within the first minutes , " said german national coach jürgen klinsmann .
" it was a frustrating lesson for us , but we believe in this team and we believe in the young players .
we 're confident that everything will work in 100 days . " but the weak performance had commentators worried about the team 's readiness to succeed in the world cup this summer at home . " if the italians were to really go for it , germany would look even worse , " said reinhold beckmann , the match 's commentator for german public broadcaster ard .
" the real question is whether the german team is just too young . " the team still has three chances to prove that it is ready for the world cup .
on march 22 , it will face the us , followed by matches against japan on may 30 and colombia on june 2 . the german team opens the world cup on june 9 against costa rica . hooliga n s n ot impressed by pope 's appeal before the match , a message by pope benedict xvi called for an end to racist chanting and emblems at football matches and urged football fans to adopt " respect and dialogue " ahead of this summer 's world cup in his native germany . both nations ' football authorities had dedicated the match to opposing all forms of racial violence .
racism has been a serious problem in italy 's elite seria a league this season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-born pope got a world cup pennant from german soccer legend franz beckenbauer last october the 78-year-old pontiff said he appreciated the initiative to combat racial discrimination , which he said would " consolidate awareness of the important educative function of sport in the service of solidarity and peace . " but before the match , german and italian hooligans tried to start a fight and fired off signal rockets .
according to the german soccer federation , 900 tickets had been sold to german fans , with 600 seated in a closed-off area .

the new york times web site reported this week that german agents provided us intelligence with an iraqi defense plan shortly before the us-led invasion .
dw-radio spoke to michael r. gordon , who broke the scoop . michael r. gordon : i did n't produce the american military report .
i faithfully quoted and presented the quotes in the report .
they 're in my book , " cobra ii : the inside story of the invasion and occupation of iraq , " and they 're on the website of the new york times , presented exactly as they are in that report . what strikes me is that the account of the german role is so specific and the description of the institutional arrangements they describe of the german intelligence liaison officer in qatar .
they describe him handing off a document to a defense intelligence agency official .
they say that there were two german agents in baghdad .
there are so many details here that , while i ca n't personally say with 100 percent confidence that they 're right or wrong , i do think that the report on its face appears to be highly credible and warrants more scrutiny and investigation than i think has been carried out so far . dw-radio : how did you end up with this report ? i certainly did n't set out to report on germany .
i have been working on a book on iraq for the last two years .
in the process of working on this book , i was very interested in the research that the american military had done on their iraqi counterparts .
after every war , militaries study the foe and try to figure out what the other guy was doing while they were fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militaries regularly review past actions to learn from them as i accessed a report on this , i saw that there was a very detailed discussion of saddam 's plans to defend baghdad and the pros and cons of saddam 's plan .
and in this section of the report , there was a bit of an aside which explained how this scheme for the defense of baghdad came to the attention of the united states central command , which was general tommy franks ' command .
and in no uncertain terms , this report said that the sketch of the defense arrangements for the defense of baghdad was supplied by a german liaison officer in qatar , and that he gave it to a member of the united states defense intelligence agency who worked in general franks ' headquarters . that caught my attention .
i was really struck by how explicit the account was of the german role and how detailed it was . you 've heard no doubt that a lot of people in germany are saying this was a so-called targeted leak designed to punish the previous german administration for opposing the iraq war .
what is your response ? that was certainly not my intention , nor the intention of anybody who provided access to this .
again , this is a study that i accessed not to learn about germany but to learn about what the iraqis were up to , and which i accessed some months ago .
the german portion of this report is rather small . the reason that this is coming out now is my book is coming out in march .
since completing my book leave i 've returned to the new york times , and i 've begun to harvest the material in the book and make it available to the times ' readers .
if i 'd finished my book a little earlier , it would have come out a few months ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us agents could have been inserted into the embassies of allies ' in baghdad , gordon said this type of cooperation - passing information back and forth - is this at all unusual among intelligence services ? i think it 's entirely understandable and not surprising .
intelligence agencies have relationships which continue despite political problems between capitals , and that 's because the services need to work together even after their regimes change .
in the case of iraq , the united states really did n't have very good intelligence - this i think ought to be clear , i mean , there was no wmd , the us was wrong on that .
and it 's a matter of public record that the united states did n't have a single spy in iraq with direct access to iraq 's wmd programs .
nor was the intelligence on the south particularly good .
it 'd be quite understandable that the americans would want to rely on those allies , such as germany , which did have an embassy in baghdad and therefore the capacity to insert agents under diplomatic cover .

there have been more than 100 cases of h5n1-infected wild birds found in germany . the finding could increase concern that the virus could spread to other species in europe as it has in several cases in other parts of the world . " it has been known for some time that cats can become infected by eating infected birds , " thomas mettenleiter , president of the institute , told reuters . several large cats in asian zoos have died after being fed infected birds and domestic cats have been shown to be especially vulnerable to the disease , the institute said . the h5n1 strain , which has caused illness and even fatalities in humans in turkey and asia , has been detected in a leopard , tigers , civet cats and two domestic cats in thailand .
but the world health organization said in 2004 that the infection of cats was unlikely to enhance the risks to humans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers gather dead birds on the island of rügen the the federal research institute for animal health has called on cat owners on the german island to keep their animals away from the area where the infection seems to be centered and to take special hygenic precautions . " a transmission , which can not be completely ruled out , would only be possible through very intimate contact with an infected animal , " said mettenleiter . further spread among birds in the bird population , the disease was spreading further across europe and africa . france began vaccinating 700,000 domestic ducks and geese on farms after it announced at the weekend the first outbreak of h5n1 bird flu in a european union poultry farm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wild geese fly over a decontamination area in eastern france the commercial repercussions of the french outbreak were driven home tuesday as the government announced that some 30 countries were now restricting or banning imports of poultry and poultry products from france . sweden for the first time detected in ducks an unidentified strain of bird flu , feared to be the h5n1 strain . initial tests at sweden 's the national veterinary institute " show that we 're probably talking about the same virus that has been spreading in russia and china , " said the swedish agriculture board . elsewhere , h5n1 was detected for the first time in bosnia , the southern german state of bavaria and a poultry farm in southwestern russia where 103,000 birds were reported to have died in a week . britain said it was unlikely to escape .
" i would anticipate that avian flu will arrive at some point in the uk , " said british chief scientific advisor professor sir david king , predicting that the disease would stay for at least five years . " we are talking about the possibility of this disease being endemic here in the uk as it did in china .
it is a long-term factor , " he told the bbc . africa but world experts fretted mostly about africa , where many countries are ill equipped to detect or impede the spread of the disease . ethiopian officials were testing some of more than 6,000 chickens that died suddenly on a poultry farm in endibir 175 kilometers -lrb- 108 miles -rrb- southwest of addis ababa .
a day earlier the world organization for animal health -lrb- oie -rrb- reported the first cases of h5n1 in niger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strain of the h5n1 bird flu virus has been found in poultry stocks in nigeria in neighboring nigeria - where more than 300,000 infected fowl have already died or been slaughtered - h5n1 was detected in two more states in the north .
in the kenyan capital nairobi , the authorities said initial tests on 400 dead chickens showed no sign of bird flu .
cases of h5n1 have also been reported in egypt . human deaths have already been recorded after the disease jumped from bird to human in cambodia , china , indonesia , iraq , thailand , turkey and vietnam .

the new york times web site reported this week that german agents provided us intelligence with an iraqi defense plan shortly before the us-led invasion .
dw-radio spoke to michael r. gordon , who broke the scoop . michael r. gordon : i did n't produce the american military report .
i faithfully quoted and presented the quotes in the report .
they 're in my book , " cobra ii : the inside story of the invasion and occupation of iraq , " and they 're on the website of the new york times , presented exactly as they are in that report . what strikes me is that the account of the german role is so specific and the description of the institutional arrangements they describe of the german intelligence liaison officer in qatar .
they describe him handing off a document to a defense intelligence agency official .
they say that there were two german agents in baghdad .
there are so many details here that , while i ca n't personally say with 100 percent confidence that they 're right or wrong , i do think that the report on its face appears to be highly credible and warrants more scrutiny and investigation than i think has been carried out so far . dw-radio : how did you end up with this report ? i certainly did n't set out to report on germany .
i have been working on a book on iraq for the last two years .
in the process of working on this book , i was very interested in the research that the american military had done on their iraqi counterparts .
after every war , militaries study the foe and try to figure out what the other guy was doing while they were fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militaries regularly review past actions to learn from them as i accessed a report on this , i saw that there was a very detailed discussion of saddam 's plans to defend baghdad and the pros and cons of saddam 's plan .
and in this section of the report , there was a bit of an aside which explained how this scheme for the defense of baghdad came to the attention of the united states central command , which was general tommy franks ' command .
and in no uncertain terms , this report said that the sketch of the defense arrangements for the defense of baghdad was supplied by a german liaison officer in qatar , and that he gave it to a member of the united states defense intelligence agency who worked in general franks ' headquarters . that caught my attention .
i was really struck by how explicit the account was of the german role and how detailed it was . you 've heard no doubt that a lot of people in germany are saying this was a so-called targeted leak designed to punish the previous german administration for opposing the iraq war .
what is your response ? that was certainly not my intention , nor the intention of anybody who provided access to this .
again , this is a study that i accessed not to learn about germany but to learn about what the iraqis were up to , and which i accessed some months ago .
the german portion of this report is rather small . the reason that this is coming out now is my book is coming out in march .
since completing my book leave i 've returned to the new york times , and i 've begun to harvest the material in the book and make it available to the times ' readers .
if i 'd finished my book a little earlier , it would have come out a few months ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us agents could have been inserted into the embassies of allies ' in baghdad , gordon said this type of cooperation - passing information back and forth - is this at all unusual among intelligence services ? i think it 's entirely understandable and not surprising .
intelligence agencies have relationships which continue despite political problems between capitals , and that 's because the services need to work together even after their regimes change .
in the case of iraq , the united states really did n't have very good intelligence - this i think ought to be clear , i mean , there was no wmd , the us was wrong on that .
and it 's a matter of public record that the united states did n't have a single spy in iraq with direct access to iraq 's wmd programs .
nor was the intelligence on the south particularly good .
it 'd be quite understandable that the americans would want to rely on those allies , such as germany , which did have an embassy in baghdad and therefore the capacity to insert agents under diplomatic cover .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael gordon , a new york times reporter embedded with coalition forces at camp doha , kuwait nor do i find it surprising that the german government has acknowledged it did provide some limited support to the american military .
despite its opposition to the war , germany did nothing to obstruct the american military preparations and indirectly helped in a number of ways : safeguarding sea lanes , facilitating the transport of american forces from germany that fought in the war , providing troops in kuwait to protect kuwaiti citizens against chemical weapons attacks , not objecting to nato efforts to send awacs or patriot missile defense interceptors to turkey . germany 's posture was basically : they were n't going to too directly assist the war effort , but they were n't going to frustrate it either . steve zwick interviewed michael r. gordon -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : who 's taking aim at berlin ?

matters worsened for the visitors three minutes later . del piero 's quickly-taken free-kick surprised the german back four and sent gilardino racing clear towards goal .
the 23-year-old ac milan striker looked up and unselfishly slid the ball across to give toni a tap-in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luca toni celebrated after just seven minutes italy might have had a third moments later when del piero 's crossed free-kick found gilardino unmarked , but he failed by just a few inches to make a connection . germany then sliced italy open with their first genuine attack , but gianluigi buffon pulled off a superb save to keep out sebastian deisler 's vicious drive . de rossi made it 3-0 in the 39th minute , applying the finishing touch to mauro camoranesi 's cross as the german defense suffered another alarming lapse in concentration . " it 's i n explicable " limiting the damage was germany 's task now , but they leaked another goal in the 56th minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniele de rossi -lrb- right -rrb- and robert huth -lrb- left -rrb- gilardino 's cross from the left was headed back across goal by camoranesi and del piero dived low to head past a helpless lehmann . huth 's late strike was of little consolation for the poor germans . " it 's inexplicable how one can fall back so quickly , " said german captain michael ballack , who added that italy 's early lead had made his team insecure .
" the mistakes we made were punished hard .
thankfully there will be another match in three weeks and then it 's going to be a different german national team . " national coach jürgen klinsmann also said that he still had high hopes for his team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann " of course we 're disappointed - we had high hopes and there were smashed within the first minutes , " said german national coach jürgen klinsmann .
" it was a frustrating lesson for us , but we believe in this team and we believe in the young players .
we 're confident that everything will work in 100 days . " but the weak performance had commentators worried about the team 's readiness to succeed in the world cup this summer at home . " if the italians were to really go for it , germany would look even worse , " said reinhold beckmann , the match 's commentator for german public broadcaster ard .
" the real question is whether the german team is just too young . " the team still has three chances to prove that it is ready for the world cup .
on march 22 , it will face the us , followed by matches against japan on may 30 and colombia on june 2 . the german team opens the world cup on june 9 against costa rica . hooliga n s n ot impressed by pope 's appeal before the match , a message by pope benedict xvi called for an end to racist chanting and emblems at football matches and urged football fans to adopt " respect and dialogue " ahead of this summer 's world cup in his native germany . both nations ' football authorities had dedicated the match to opposing all forms of racial violence .
racism has been a serious problem in italy 's elite seria a league this season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-born pope got a world cup pennant from german soccer legend franz beckenbauer last october the 78-year-old pontiff said he appreciated the initiative to combat racial discrimination , which he said would " consolidate awareness of the important educative function of sport in the service of solidarity and peace . " but before the match , german and italian hooligans tried to start a fight and fired off signal rockets .
according to the german soccer federation , 900 tickets had been sold to german fans , with 600 seated in a closed-off area .

there have been more than 100 cases of h5n1-infected wild birds found in germany . the finding could increase concern that the virus could spread to other species in europe as it has in several cases in other parts of the world . " it has been known for some time that cats can become infected by eating infected birds , " thomas mettenleiter , president of the institute , told reuters . several large cats in asian zoos have died after being fed infected birds and domestic cats have been shown to be especially vulnerable to the disease , the institute said . the h5n1 strain , which has caused illness and even fatalities in humans in turkey and asia , has been detected in a leopard , tigers , civet cats and two domestic cats in thailand .
but the world health organization said in 2004 that the infection of cats was unlikely to enhance the risks to humans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers gather dead birds on the island of rügen the the federal research institute for animal health has called on cat owners on the german island to keep their animals away from the area where the infection seems to be centered and to take special hygenic precautions . " a transmission , which can not be completely ruled out , would only be possible through very intimate contact with an infected animal , " said mettenleiter . further spread among birds in the bird population , the disease was spreading further across europe and africa . france began vaccinating 700,000 domestic ducks and geese on farms after it announced at the weekend the first outbreak of h5n1 bird flu in a european union poultry farm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wild geese fly over a decontamination area in eastern france the commercial repercussions of the french outbreak were driven home tuesday as the government announced that some 30 countries were now restricting or banning imports of poultry and poultry products from france . sweden for the first time detected in ducks an unidentified strain of bird flu , feared to be the h5n1 strain . initial tests at sweden 's the national veterinary institute " show that we 're probably talking about the same virus that has been spreading in russia and china , " said the swedish agriculture board . elsewhere , h5n1 was detected for the first time in bosnia , the southern german state of bavaria and a poultry farm in southwestern russia where 103,000 birds were reported to have died in a week . britain said it was unlikely to escape .
" i would anticipate that avian flu will arrive at some point in the uk , " said british chief scientific advisor professor sir david king , predicting that the disease would stay for at least five years . " we are talking about the possibility of this disease being endemic here in the uk as it did in china .
it is a long-term factor , " he told the bbc . africa but world experts fretted mostly about africa , where many countries are ill equipped to detect or impede the spread of the disease . ethiopian officials were testing some of more than 6,000 chickens that died suddenly on a poultry farm in endibir 175 kilometers -lrb- 108 miles -rrb- southwest of addis ababa .
a day earlier the world organization for animal health -lrb- oie -rrb- reported the first cases of h5n1 in niger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strain of the h5n1 bird flu virus has been found in poultry stocks in nigeria in neighboring nigeria - where more than 300,000 infected fowl have already died or been slaughtered - h5n1 was detected in two more states in the north .
in the kenyan capital nairobi , the authorities said initial tests on 400 dead chickens showed no sign of bird flu .
cases of h5n1 have also been reported in egypt . human deaths have already been recorded after the disease jumped from bird to human in cambodia , china , indonesia , iraq , thailand , turkey and vietnam .

however , it called for better oversight and regulation by national parliaments and judicial bodies when human rights abuses were suspected and better controls of foreign intelligence services .
" europe 's skies appear to be excessively open , " davis said .
" very few countries seem to have adopted an adequate and effective way to monitor who and what is transiting through their airports and airspace .

becoming germany 's first female leader was not easy , but angela merkel has already carved her name high up in the popularity stakes . the grand coalition has been in office for a full 100 days , which means the period of grace traditionally granted a new government , is officially over .
but with the german public appearing more than willing to continue supporting the conservative cdu / csu and social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- alliance , that is of little relevance .
angela merkel is enjoying massive popularity and opinion polls suggest that her party is steaming ahead of their coalition partner , the spd . but at the federal elections last september , the picture was quite different .
the two main parties were unable to beat each other , and the results of the ballot made it impossible for either the cdu / csu to form a coalition with the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- or for the spd-green alliance to continue running the country .
the additional parliamentary presence of the left party meant the only alternative was to form a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder fought it out for the top spot and that very coalition , so it turns out , is what the majority of german voters wanted .
in it , they see the possibility of fulfilled expectations and greater harmony .
on the latter point , with coalition partners who treat one another with care and are quick to resolve budding disputes , the electorate can be satisfied . yet , on the former , expectations regarding unemployment reduction remain unfulfilled .
there is also reason to believe that the two sides will clash over continued welfare and health reforms . showing germany 's new face abroad on the international stage , merkel made a good first impression .
she breezed confidently through her debut visits to paris , london and washington , but they were not meant to serve as opportunities to iron out any serious conflicts of interest .
merkel has not yet shown what position she will take on washington 's stance on the iranian nuclear program .
and although the new german leader 's appearance at the eu budget summit met with applause , it 's not entirely clear to what extent that was the result of her financial generosity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vice chancellor and labor minister , franz müntefering meanwhile , the grand coalition is an acid test for the social democrats who are trying to profile themselves .
thus far , labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering has been viewed as the spd heavyweight in the cabinet , but he is not coordinating well with the new party head , matthias platzeck , and internal conflicts could become a problem for the coalition . although on the whole germany 's grand coalition conveys a stable impression , keeping it up depends on how much space the two partners have for profiling themselves .
merkel is making something of a name for herself as a leader who moderates discussions without clearly stating her position .
for the chancellor of a grand coalition that could be a good technique , but the question is whether it is sustainable beyond regional elections at the end of march . heinz dylong -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de refining merkel 's makeover angela merkel has come a long way from fashion fiasco to chic chancellor .

the body called for new laws to control spies . in a report examining the possible role of european countries in the alleged illegal cia transfer of terrorist suspects and secret detentions , the council of europe criticized its member states for a lack of legislative control of foreign secret services operating on their territory .

matters worsened for the visitors three minutes later . del piero 's quickly-taken free-kick surprised the german back four and sent gilardino racing clear towards goal .
the 23-year-old ac milan striker looked up and unselfishly slid the ball across to give toni a tap-in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luca toni celebrated after just seven minutes italy might have had a third moments later when del piero 's crossed free-kick found gilardino unmarked , but he failed by just a few inches to make a connection . germany then sliced italy open with their first genuine attack , but gianluigi buffon pulled off a superb save to keep out sebastian deisler 's vicious drive . de rossi made it 3-0 in the 39th minute , applying the finishing touch to mauro camoranesi 's cross as the german defense suffered another alarming lapse in concentration . " it 's i n explicable " limiting the damage was germany 's task now , but they leaked another goal in the 56th minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniele de rossi -lrb- right -rrb- and robert huth -lrb- left -rrb- gilardino 's cross from the left was headed back across goal by camoranesi and del piero dived low to head past a helpless lehmann . huth 's late strike was of little consolation for the poor germans . " it 's inexplicable how one can fall back so quickly , " said german captain michael ballack , who added that italy 's early lead had made his team insecure .
" the mistakes we made were punished hard .
thankfully there will be another match in three weeks and then it 's going to be a different german national team . " national coach jürgen klinsmann also said that he still had high hopes for his team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann " of course we 're disappointed - we had high hopes and there were smashed within the first minutes , " said german national coach jürgen klinsmann .
" it was a frustrating lesson for us , but we believe in this team and we believe in the young players .
we 're confident that everything will work in 100 days . " but the weak performance had commentators worried about the team 's readiness to succeed in the world cup this summer at home . " if the italians were to really go for it , germany would look even worse , " said reinhold beckmann , the match 's commentator for german public broadcaster ard .
" the real question is whether the german team is just too young . " the team still has three chances to prove that it is ready for the world cup .
on march 22 , it will face the us , followed by matches against japan on may 30 and colombia on june 2 . the german team opens the world cup on june 9 against costa rica . hooliga n s n ot impressed by pope 's appeal before the match , a message by pope benedict xvi called for an end to racist chanting and emblems at football matches and urged football fans to adopt " respect and dialogue " ahead of this summer 's world cup in his native germany . both nations ' football authorities had dedicated the match to opposing all forms of racial violence .
racism has been a serious problem in italy 's elite seria a league this season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-born pope got a world cup pennant from german soccer legend franz beckenbauer last october the 78-year-old pontiff said he appreciated the initiative to combat racial discrimination , which he said would " consolidate awareness of the important educative function of sport in the service of solidarity and peace . " but before the match , german and italian hooligans tried to start a fight and fired off signal rockets .
according to the german soccer federation , 900 tickets had been sold to german fans , with 600 seated in a closed-off area .
another 600 german hooligans reportedly managed to buy tickets meant to go to italians ahead of the match . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany gears up for friendly against italy european soccer superpowers italy and germany are preparing for wednesday 's friendly that will help gauge their world cup preparedness .

germany ordered cats to be kept indoors and dogs on leashes in five states hit by bird flu . after the deadly bird flu was found to have killed a cat on the german baltic sea island of rügen , where the virus was first detected in the country , consumer protection agency officials said cats must be kept indoors , and dogs on leashes . the government said the order would take effect immediately in a radius of three kilometers -lrb- 1.8 miles -rrb- of all areas where infected wild birds have been found . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when outdoors , cats may look for birds so far , the flu has been found in bavaria , baden-württemberg , brandenburg , schleswig-holstein , and mecklenburg-western pomerania . crisis team meeti n g the cat , which authorities said was a stray , was found on the baltic sea island of rügen , where the deadly h5n1 was detected in birds earlier this month .

" unlike the case in domestic and wild birds , there is no evidence that domestic cats are a reservoir of the virus . " bird flu has killed or led to the culling of some 200 million birds since it re-emerged in asia in late 2003 .
the real fear for human health is that the virus will mutate into a form that passes easily from person to person , sparking a pandemic in which millions could die . representatives of german state and local governments today agreed in a telephone conference to examine dead mammals found in areas already known to contain the h5n1 virus , or those where deaths seem suspicious . bird lockdow n could drag o n but they recommended against vaccinating house cats , saying it was not target-oriented enough , since there is no appropriate vaccination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers in protective clothing combed the island of rügen for dead fowl meanwhile , germany 's agriculture ministry has said germany may be forced to keep domesticated birds enclosed through april .

european soccer superpowers italy and germany are preparing for wednesday 's friendly that will help gauge their world cup preparedness .
with three world cup wins apiece , they are both among the tournament favorites . italy coach marcello lippi is relishing the opportunity to pit his wits against the tournament hosts .
" they are a great team with a wonderful history , and as hosts of the world cup they are very ambitious , " he said .
" for us it 's one of the last real tests before we fly out to germany , one that we hope will build our confidence . " lippi added that he hoped the italy fans would get behind his team at the artemio franchi stadium , home of serie a side fiorentina .
" we are playing in florence where the people are passionate about soccer and a lot will depend on their support . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a young side " germany coach jürgen klinsmann is playing down his side 's chances of victory in wednesday 's match .
" italy have quality in every position , and lippi 's squad is more mature and more experienced than ours , " said the 41-year-old , who took control of germany in july 2004 .
" they have a team full of champions while we are a young side looking for its identity , one that plays aggressive , attacking soccer . " restructuring italian squad klinsmann expressed his sadness over the injury to italy 's talismanic number 10 francesco totti , whose chances of featuring in germany are hanging in the balance after he broke a bone in his left leg . " i 'm sad to see him injured , he 's an exceptional player , " he said .
" however , alessandro del piero can replace him or lippi can change his system .
he has players who can adapt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian soccer star , francesco totti the last time germany saw off one of the game 's so-called soccer heavyweights was back in october 2000 , when they beat england 1-0 in a 2002 world cup qualifier , and klinsmann is desperate to put that right .
" we want to put an end to our negative run against big name opposition , " he said . drawing on klinsmann 's experience klinsmann knows what it takes to unlock an italian defense having played for inter milan from 1989 to 1992 .
he scored 36 goals and helped inter win the uefa cup in 1991 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team coach , jürgen klinsmann germany 's first-choice goalkeeper oliver kahn has been ruled out due to a thigh strain , so arsenal 's jens lehmann will deputize , while stuttgart keeper timo hildebrand will act as lehmann 's understudy .
with italy 's left-sided defender gianluca zambrotta unavailable , fiorentina defender manuel pasqual could make his first appearance for italy in front of his home crowd . wednesday 's match revives memories of the classic 1982 world cup final in spain which italy won 3-1 .

the new york times web site reported this week that german agents provided us intelligence with an iraqi defense plan shortly before the us-led invasion .
dw-radio spoke to michael r. gordon , who broke the scoop . michael r. gordon : i did n't produce the american military report .
i faithfully quoted and presented the quotes in the report .
they 're in my book , " cobra ii : the inside story of the invasion and occupation of iraq , " and they 're on the website of the new york times , presented exactly as they are in that report . what strikes me is that the account of the german role is so specific and the description of the institutional arrangements they describe of the german intelligence liaison officer in qatar .
they describe him handing off a document to a defense intelligence agency official .
they say that there were two german agents in baghdad .
there are so many details here that , while i ca n't personally say with 100 percent confidence that they 're right or wrong , i do think that the report on its face appears to be highly credible and warrants more scrutiny and investigation than i think has been carried out so far . dw-radio : how did you end up with this report ? i certainly did n't set out to report on germany .
i have been working on a book on iraq for the last two years .
in the process of working on this book , i was very interested in the research that the american military had done on their iraqi counterparts .
after every war , militaries study the foe and try to figure out what the other guy was doing while they were fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militaries regularly review past actions to learn from them as i accessed a report on this , i saw that there was a very detailed discussion of saddam 's plans to defend baghdad and the pros and cons of saddam 's plan .
and in this section of the report , there was a bit of an aside which explained how this scheme for the defense of baghdad came to the attention of the united states central command , which was general tommy franks ' command .
and in no uncertain terms , this report said that the sketch of the defense arrangements for the defense of baghdad was supplied by a german liaison officer in qatar , and that he gave it to a member of the united states defense intelligence agency who worked in general franks ' headquarters . that caught my attention .
i was really struck by how explicit the account was of the german role and how detailed it was . you 've heard no doubt that a lot of people in germany are saying this was a so-called targeted leak designed to punish the previous german administration for opposing the iraq war .
what is your response ? that was certainly not my intention , nor the intention of anybody who provided access to this .
again , this is a study that i accessed not to learn about germany but to learn about what the iraqis were up to , and which i accessed some months ago .
the german portion of this report is rather small . the reason that this is coming out now is my book is coming out in march .
since completing my book leave i 've returned to the new york times , and i 've begun to harvest the material in the book and make it available to the times ' readers .
if i 'd finished my book a little earlier , it would have come out a few months ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us agents could have been inserted into the embassies of allies ' in baghdad , gordon said this type of cooperation - passing information back and forth - is this at all unusual among intelligence services ? i think it 's entirely understandable and not surprising .
intelligence agencies have relationships which continue despite political problems between capitals , and that 's because the services need to work together even after their regimes change .
in the case of iraq , the united states really did n't have very good intelligence - this i think ought to be clear , i mean , there was no wmd , the us was wrong on that .
and it 's a matter of public record that the united states did n't have a single spy in iraq with direct access to iraq 's wmd programs .
nor was the intelligence on the south particularly good .
it 'd be quite understandable that the americans would want to rely on those allies , such as germany , which did have an embassy in baghdad and therefore the capacity to insert agents under diplomatic cover .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael gordon , a new york times reporter embedded with coalition forces at camp doha , kuwait nor do i find it surprising that the german government has acknowledged it did provide some limited support to the american military .
despite its opposition to the war , germany did nothing to obstruct the american military preparations and indirectly helped in a number of ways : safeguarding sea lanes , facilitating the transport of american forces from germany that fought in the war , providing troops in kuwait to protect kuwaiti citizens against chemical weapons attacks , not objecting to nato efforts to send awacs or patriot missile defense interceptors to turkey . germany 's posture was basically : they were n't going to too directly assist the war effort , but they were n't going to frustrate it either . steve zwick interviewed michael r. gordon -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : who 's taking aim at berlin ?
a news report claiming german secret agents gave the us iraq 's war plans has drawn indignant denials from both berlin and washington .
dw 's daniel scheschkewitz believes the leak must have been carefully planned .
-lrb- feb .
28 , 2006 -rrb- germany denies giving baghdad defense plan to us a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq .

matters worsened for the visitors three minutes later . del piero 's quickly-taken free-kick surprised the german back four and sent gilardino racing clear towards goal .
the 23-year-old ac milan striker looked up and unselfishly slid the ball across to give toni a tap-in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luca toni celebrated after just seven minutes italy might have had a third moments later when del piero 's crossed free-kick found gilardino unmarked , but he failed by just a few inches to make a connection . germany then sliced italy open with their first genuine attack , but gianluigi buffon pulled off a superb save to keep out sebastian deisler 's vicious drive . de rossi made it 3-0 in the 39th minute , applying the finishing touch to mauro camoranesi 's cross as the german defense suffered another alarming lapse in concentration . " it 's i n explicable " limiting the damage was germany 's task now , but they leaked another goal in the 56th minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniele de rossi -lrb- right -rrb- and robert huth -lrb- left -rrb- gilardino 's cross from the left was headed back across goal by camoranesi and del piero dived low to head past a helpless lehmann . huth 's late strike was of little consolation for the poor germans . " it 's inexplicable how one can fall back so quickly , " said german captain michael ballack , who added that italy 's early lead had made his team insecure .
" the mistakes we made were punished hard .
thankfully there will be another match in three weeks and then it 's going to be a different german national team . " national coach jürgen klinsmann also said that he still had high hopes for his team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann " of course we 're disappointed - we had high hopes and there were smashed within the first minutes , " said german national coach jürgen klinsmann .
" it was a frustrating lesson for us , but we believe in this team and we believe in the young players .
we 're confident that everything will work in 100 days . " but the weak performance had commentators worried about the team 's readiness to succeed in the world cup this summer at home . " if the italians were to really go for it , germany would look even worse , " said reinhold beckmann , the match 's commentator for german public broadcaster ard .
" the real question is whether the german team is just too young . " the team still has three chances to prove that it is ready for the world cup .
on march 22 , it will face the us , followed by matches against japan on may 30 and colombia on june 2 . the german team opens the world cup on june 9 against costa rica . hooliga n s n ot impressed by pope 's appeal before the match , a message by pope benedict xvi called for an end to racist chanting and emblems at football matches and urged football fans to adopt " respect and dialogue " ahead of this summer 's world cup in his native germany . both nations ' football authorities had dedicated the match to opposing all forms of racial violence .
racism has been a serious problem in italy 's elite seria a league this season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-born pope got a world cup pennant from german soccer legend franz beckenbauer last october the 78-year-old pontiff said he appreciated the initiative to combat racial discrimination , which he said would " consolidate awareness of the important educative function of sport in the service of solidarity and peace . " but before the match , german and italian hooligans tried to start a fight and fired off signal rockets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.03.2006 investing in the future face of automobiles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german car-makers want to make emissions a thing of the past although germany might be lagging a little on the international research and development stage , when it comes to the evolution of the automobile , the nation is keen to be in pole position . in this land of sophisticated motoring and unrestricted freeway speed limits , home to the likes of mercedes , volkswagen , bmw et al . , every seventh job is in some way related to the automobile industry .
as such , it invests more in research and development than any other branch in germany . the development race is a moveable feast , an ongoing process of honing and fine-tuning the already state-of-the-art .
as fashions shift , so too do motorized visions .
the latest comes in the form of a zero-emissions hydrogen-fuelled model , which - although still in its infant stages of development - has already generated a climate of intense competition among the big name manufacturers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling up on a tank load of diesel until the motor of the future is ready to hit the road -lrb- and that is not expected for at least another 15 years -rrb- , the search for alternative sources of fuel will continue . " we spend between 30 and 35 percent of our overall budget on engine technology and fuel , " said volkswagen head of research , franz-josef paefgen .
" we had a look at exactly what we could do with existing technology and our development findings , and realized that over the next few years , europe could replace half its fuel consumption with alternative fuel sources . " long haul there is no doubt , however , that it will take a long time to get away from oil altogether .
there is no single great way to cleaner cars , but a whole host of possibilities which range from the hybrid combustion-electric engine to a mixture of bio fuels . bernd gottschalk , president of the association of the german automobile industry , said they have recognized that so-called " designer fuels , " with biomass or cellulose components , are ideal for future generations of engines . " they are steps towards reducing co2 by 90 percent , which would be a win-win situation for everyone , " gottschalk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new cars wait in line there is not , however , much use in equipping cars with futuristic engines if there are no gas stations for filling up the tank .
in that regard , germany lags miles behind the likes of sweden , which with its 300 gas-ethanol stations has made ford 's flexi-fuel technology the order of the day . as it stands , germany has but one such filling station in the whole country , and although that is clearly not enough , bernhard mattes , head of ford germany , said it is a step in the right direction . " at ford , we invest heavily in research and development because we believe that sustainable mobility can only work if we develop alternative engines , and continue research into driving dynamics and automobile security , " he said . the broader picture but finding a balance between making motoring safer for the environment and those on the roads is a tricky business . thomas weber , a daimlerchrysler board member and head of development at the mercedes car group said environmentally friendly engines and crash structures both make cars heavier . # b # " we know that an additional 20 kilos increases fuel consumption by one percent , so we have to ensure that however innovative the technology , the cars are not too heavy , " weber said .
" if we are clever , we will find a solution to benefit both the environment and the customer . " the race is definitely on .
with the number of cars on the roads expected to double in the next 15 years , manufacturers are not only working against each other , but against the clock to come up with sustainable solutions for generations to come . henrik böhme -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese cars pick up speed in germany even as german automobile manufactures look to china 's millions of people to boost profits , the first chinese cars are rolling down the export ramp and into mercedes and bmw territory .

germany ordered cats to be kept indoors and dogs on leashes in five states hit by bird flu . after the deadly bird flu was found to have killed a cat on the german baltic sea island of rügen , where the virus was first detected in the country , consumer protection agency officials said cats must be kept indoors , and dogs on leashes . the government said the order would take effect immediately in a radius of three kilometers -lrb- 1.8 miles -rrb- of all areas where infected wild birds have been found . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when outdoors , cats may look for birds so far , the flu has been found in bavaria , baden-württemberg , brandenburg , schleswig-holstein , and mecklenburg-western pomerania . crisis team meeti n g the cat , which authorities said was a stray , was found on the baltic sea island of rügen , where the deadly h5n1 was detected in birds earlier this month .
it was the first case in germany of the bird flu being transmitted to a mammal . meanwhile , a government crisis team continued to meet in berlin , to discuss measures against the deadliest form of the virus . who : ' no i n creased huma n threat ' the cat grabbed the headlines in several countries in europe , but the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- in geneva said it did not increase the threat to human health from the virus .
since late 2003 , 93 people have died from bird flu , but they have contracted the virus from contact with infected birds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dead cat on rügen was said to be a stray " there is no present evidence that domestic cats play a role in the transmission cycle of h5n1 viruses .
to date , no human case has been linked to exposure to a diseased cat , " it said .
" unlike the case in domestic and wild birds , there is no evidence that domestic cats are a reservoir of the virus . " bird flu has killed or led to the culling of some 200 million birds since it re-emerged in asia in late 2003 .
the real fear for human health is that the virus will mutate into a form that passes easily from person to person , sparking a pandemic in which millions could die . representatives of german state and local governments today agreed in a telephone conference to examine dead mammals found in areas already known to contain the h5n1 virus , or those where deaths seem suspicious . bird lockdow n could drag o n but they recommended against vaccinating house cats , saying it was not target-oriented enough , since there is no appropriate vaccination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers in protective clothing combed the island of rügen for dead fowl meanwhile , germany 's agriculture ministry has said germany may be forced to keep domesticated birds enclosed through april . " we may have no choice , if the flu keeps raging beyond the migration period , " said agriculture secretary gert lindemann , who is heading up the task force that met in berlin wednesday . a n imal supporters war n of pa n ic the german animal protection league warned of an unnecessary panic outbreak .
cats do not need to be kept indoors germany-wide , they said in a statement , but in areas where the bird flu has already been found , owners should keep close watch over their animals . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu jumps to cat in germany a dead cat in germany has tested positive for the h5n1 type of bird flu in the first case in the country of the virus spreading from birds to mammals , the national veterinary laboratory said on wednesday .

on the contrary , harmony is the watchword so far .
political scientist klaus detterbeck looks back and ahead . dw-world : the grand coalition 's grace period - its first hundred days - is now over .
one gets the impression that the government has made a better impression than was once expected . klaus detterbeck : i think so too .
surveys regarding angela merkel and the christian democrats are good right now .
there are two reasons for this relatively good start for the grand coalition .
first , there have been successes , like chancellor merkel 's trip to the us , to russia and at the eu summit , as well as some overall positive economic developments .
secondly , the populace has given the chancellor something of an advance when it comes to trust .
people are willing to give this coalition some time to find its footing .
a majority of people have the feeling that a solid , capable team is at the helm , as opposed to that of the last schröder government . so are the individuals in the government less important than the " team " as a whole ? yes , you could say that .
that has to do with chancellor merkel 's role as a director .
she is not a big personality out front , who calls all the shots .
rather she 's the person who steers the entire team .
that makes her different than schröder , who was something of a showman who pranced on the political stage . despite the laurels , has the country really progressed toward finding solutions to some of its problems ? it 's true that there have been no big decisions made as yet .
there is this positive impression , a positive undertone , but the real foundation for new policies has n't yet been laid .
negotiations still have to take place about federalism reform , and other big reform projects have yet to be tackled . angela merkel enjoys a good deal of sympathy from journalists of all stripes .
she is also respected by foreign leaders .

instead , she tries to enact good policies for the good of the country .
in the grand coalition , she is engaging in the politics of inclusion .
that 's to her great credit . will she be successful if she continues to follow this strategy ?
what about when she has to get down to the nitty-gritty ? one of her strengths is her ability to hold the two camps together .
but in fact , this advantage could turn into a disadvantage if it comes time to make difficult decisions and she finds it hard to assert her authority , depending on a consensus for decisions . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have lost popularity among voters .
does the party have the wrong party chairman or is its strategy faulty ? the spd has two problems .
for one , they have the rather " unpleasant " ministries : -lrb- franz -rrb- müntefering at labor and -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrück at finance .
on the other hand , people still are n't sure what this party actually stands for .
is it a reform party , which is how it 's been seen over the past few years under schröder ?
or is it headed back in a more traditional , union-oriented direction ?
-lrb- matthias -rrb- platzeck is still not in the position to explain where the party should go from here and it 's hurting because of that . let 's look at the opposition .
does one actually still exist and if so , is it able to attract any attention to itself ? it 's true that the opposition parties have problems finding an audience .
the left party is mostly concerned with itself these days ; the greens have n't found their direction yet ; and the free democrats are having a hard time making their mark .
these are tough times for the smaller parties .

a majority of people have the feeling that a solid , capable team is at the helm , as opposed to that of the last schröder government . so are the individuals in the government less important than the " team " as a whole ? yes , you could say that .
that has to do with chancellor merkel 's role as a director .

rather she 's the person who steers the entire team .
that makes her different than schröder , who was something of a showman who pranced on the political stage . despite the laurels , has the country really progressed toward finding solutions to some of its problems ? it 's true that there have been no big decisions made as yet .
there is this positive impression , a positive undertone , but the real foundation for new policies has n't yet been laid .
negotiations still have to take place about federalism reform , and other big reform projects have yet to be tackled . angela merkel enjoys a good deal of sympathy from journalists of all stripes .
she is also respected by foreign leaders .
what is different about her ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular with journalists these days she leaves the impression of being someone who does solid work and does n't push her way to the front .
instead , she tries to enact good policies for the good of the country .
in the grand coalition , she is engaging in the politics of inclusion .
that 's to her great credit . will she be successful if she continues to follow this strategy ?
what about when she has to get down to the nitty-gritty ? one of her strengths is her ability to hold the two camps together .
but in fact , this advantage could turn into a disadvantage if it comes time to make difficult decisions and she finds it hard to assert her authority , depending on a consensus for decisions . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have lost popularity among voters .

on the other hand , people still are n't sure what this party actually stands for .

european soccer superpowers italy and germany are preparing for wednesday 's friendly that will help gauge their world cup preparedness .
with three world cup wins apiece , they are both among the tournament favorites . italy coach marcello lippi is relishing the opportunity to pit his wits against the tournament hosts .
" they are a great team with a wonderful history , and as hosts of the world cup they are very ambitious , " he said .
" for us it 's one of the last real tests before we fly out to germany , one that we hope will build our confidence . " lippi added that he hoped the italy fans would get behind his team at the artemio franchi stadium , home of serie a side fiorentina .
" we are playing in florence where the people are passionate about soccer and a lot will depend on their support . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a young side " germany coach jürgen klinsmann is playing down his side 's chances of victory in wednesday 's match .
" italy have quality in every position , and lippi 's squad is more mature and more experienced than ours , " said the 41-year-old , who took control of germany in july 2004 .
" they have a team full of champions while we are a young side looking for its identity , one that plays aggressive , attacking soccer . " restructuring italian squad klinsmann expressed his sadness over the injury to italy 's talismanic number 10 francesco totti , whose chances of featuring in germany are hanging in the balance after he broke a bone in his left leg . " i 'm sad to see him injured , he 's an exceptional player , " he said .
" however , alessandro del piero can replace him or lippi can change his system .
he has players who can adapt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian soccer star , francesco totti the last time germany saw off one of the game 's so-called soccer heavyweights was back in october 2000 , when they beat england 1-0 in a 2002 world cup qualifier , and klinsmann is desperate to put that right .
" we want to put an end to our negative run against big name opposition , " he said . drawing on klinsmann 's experience klinsmann knows what it takes to unlock an italian defense having played for inter milan from 1989 to 1992 .
he scored 36 goals and helped inter win the uefa cup in 1991 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team coach , jürgen klinsmann germany 's first-choice goalkeeper oliver kahn has been ruled out due to a thigh strain , so arsenal 's jens lehmann will deputize , while stuttgart keeper timo hildebrand will act as lehmann 's understudy .
with italy 's left-sided defender gianluca zambrotta unavailable , fiorentina defender manuel pasqual could make his first appearance for italy in front of his home crowd . wednesday 's match revives memories of the classic 1982 world cup final in spain which italy won 3-1 .
the most memorable image of the tournament was marco tardelli 's uninhibited celebrations - wild eyes and pumping fists - after scoring italy 's second goal . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we can play a very good world cup " despite his resignation in 2004 , germany 's former top soccer coach keeps tabs on the team .

european soccer superpowers italy and germany are preparing for wednesday 's friendly that will help gauge their world cup preparedness .
with three world cup wins apiece , they are both among the tournament favorites . italy coach marcello lippi is relishing the opportunity to pit his wits against the tournament hosts .
" they are a great team with a wonderful history , and as hosts of the world cup they are very ambitious , " he said .
" for us it 's one of the last real tests before we fly out to germany , one that we hope will build our confidence . " lippi added that he hoped the italy fans would get behind his team at the artemio franchi stadium , home of serie a side fiorentina .
" we are playing in florence where the people are passionate about soccer and a lot will depend on their support . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a young side " germany coach jürgen klinsmann is playing down his side 's chances of victory in wednesday 's match .
" italy have quality in every position , and lippi 's squad is more mature and more experienced than ours , " said the 41-year-old , who took control of germany in july 2004 .
" they have a team full of champions while we are a young side looking for its identity , one that plays aggressive , attacking soccer . " restructuring italian squad klinsmann expressed his sadness over the injury to italy 's talismanic number 10 francesco totti , whose chances of featuring in germany are hanging in the balance after he broke a bone in his left leg . " i 'm sad to see him injured , he 's an exceptional player , " he said .
" however , alessandro del piero can replace him or lippi can change his system .
he has players who can adapt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian soccer star , francesco totti the last time germany saw off one of the game 's so-called soccer heavyweights was back in october 2000 , when they beat england 1-0 in a 2002 world cup qualifier , and klinsmann is desperate to put that right .
" we want to put an end to our negative run against big name opposition , " he said . drawing on klinsmann 's experience klinsmann knows what it takes to unlock an italian defense having played for inter milan from 1989 to 1992 .
he scored 36 goals and helped inter win the uefa cup in 1991 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team coach , jürgen klinsmann germany 's first-choice goalkeeper oliver kahn has been ruled out due to a thigh strain , so arsenal 's jens lehmann will deputize , while stuttgart keeper timo hildebrand will act as lehmann 's understudy .
with italy 's left-sided defender gianluca zambrotta unavailable , fiorentina defender manuel pasqual could make his first appearance for italy in front of his home crowd . wednesday 's match revives memories of the classic 1982 world cup final in spain which italy won 3-1 .
the most memorable image of the tournament was marco tardelli 's uninhibited celebrations - wild eyes and pumping fists - after scoring italy 's second goal . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we can play a very good world cup " despite his resignation in 2004 , germany 's former top soccer coach keeps tabs on the team .

becoming germany 's first female leader was not easy , but angela merkel has already carved her name high up in the popularity stakes . the grand coalition has been in office for a full 100 days , which means the period of grace traditionally granted a new government , is officially over .
but with the german public appearing more than willing to continue supporting the conservative cdu / csu and social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- alliance , that is of little relevance .
angela merkel is enjoying massive popularity and opinion polls suggest that her party is steaming ahead of their coalition partner , the spd . but at the federal elections last september , the picture was quite different .
the two main parties were unable to beat each other , and the results of the ballot made it impossible for either the cdu / csu to form a coalition with the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- or for the spd-green alliance to continue running the country .
the additional parliamentary presence of the left party meant the only alternative was to form a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder fought it out for the top spot and that very coalition , so it turns out , is what the majority of german voters wanted .
in it , they see the possibility of fulfilled expectations and greater harmony .
on the latter point , with coalition partners who treat one another with care and are quick to resolve budding disputes , the electorate can be satisfied . yet , on the former , expectations regarding unemployment reduction remain unfulfilled .
there is also reason to believe that the two sides will clash over continued welfare and health reforms . showing germany 's new face abroad on the international stage , merkel made a good first impression .
she breezed confidently through her debut visits to paris , london and washington , but they were not meant to serve as opportunities to iron out any serious conflicts of interest .
merkel has not yet shown what position she will take on washington 's stance on the iranian nuclear program .
and although the new german leader 's appearance at the eu budget summit met with applause , it 's not entirely clear to what extent that was the result of her financial generosity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vice chancellor and labor minister , franz müntefering meanwhile , the grand coalition is an acid test for the social democrats who are trying to profile themselves .
thus far , labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering has been viewed as the spd heavyweight in the cabinet , but he is not coordinating well with the new party head , matthias platzeck , and internal conflicts could become a problem for the coalition . although on the whole germany 's grand coalition conveys a stable impression , keeping it up depends on how much space the two partners have for profiling themselves .
merkel is making something of a name for herself as a leader who moderates discussions without clearly stating her position .

the new york times web site reported this week that german agents provided us intelligence with an iraqi defense plan shortly before the us-led invasion .
dw-radio spoke to michael r. gordon , who broke the scoop . michael r. gordon : i did n't produce the american military report .
i faithfully quoted and presented the quotes in the report .
they 're in my book , " cobra ii : the inside story of the invasion and occupation of iraq , " and they 're on the website of the new york times , presented exactly as they are in that report . what strikes me is that the account of the german role is so specific and the description of the institutional arrangements they describe of the german intelligence liaison officer in qatar .
they describe him handing off a document to a defense intelligence agency official .
they say that there were two german agents in baghdad .
there are so many details here that , while i ca n't personally say with 100 percent confidence that they 're right or wrong , i do think that the report on its face appears to be highly credible and warrants more scrutiny and investigation than i think has been carried out so far . dw-radio : how did you end up with this report ? i certainly did n't set out to report on germany .
i have been working on a book on iraq for the last two years .
in the process of working on this book , i was very interested in the research that the american military had done on their iraqi counterparts .
after every war , militaries study the foe and try to figure out what the other guy was doing while they were fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militaries regularly review past actions to learn from them as i accessed a report on this , i saw that there was a very detailed discussion of saddam 's plans to defend baghdad and the pros and cons of saddam 's plan .
and in this section of the report , there was a bit of an aside which explained how this scheme for the defense of baghdad came to the attention of the united states central command , which was general tommy franks ' command .
and in no uncertain terms , this report said that the sketch of the defense arrangements for the defense of baghdad was supplied by a german liaison officer in qatar , and that he gave it to a member of the united states defense intelligence agency who worked in general franks ' headquarters . that caught my attention .
i was really struck by how explicit the account was of the german role and how detailed it was . you 've heard no doubt that a lot of people in germany are saying this was a so-called targeted leak designed to punish the previous german administration for opposing the iraq war .
what is your response ? that was certainly not my intention , nor the intention of anybody who provided access to this .
again , this is a study that i accessed not to learn about germany but to learn about what the iraqis were up to , and which i accessed some months ago .
the german portion of this report is rather small . the reason that this is coming out now is my book is coming out in march .
since completing my book leave i 've returned to the new york times , and i 've begun to harvest the material in the book and make it available to the times ' readers .
if i 'd finished my book a little earlier , it would have come out a few months ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us agents could have been inserted into the embassies of allies ' in baghdad , gordon said this type of cooperation - passing information back and forth - is this at all unusual among intelligence services ? i think it 's entirely understandable and not surprising .
intelligence agencies have relationships which continue despite political problems between capitals , and that 's because the services need to work together even after their regimes change .
in the case of iraq , the united states really did n't have very good intelligence - this i think ought to be clear , i mean , there was no wmd , the us was wrong on that .
and it 's a matter of public record that the united states did n't have a single spy in iraq with direct access to iraq 's wmd programs .
nor was the intelligence on the south particularly good .
it 'd be quite understandable that the americans would want to rely on those allies , such as germany , which did have an embassy in baghdad and therefore the capacity to insert agents under diplomatic cover .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael gordon , a new york times reporter embedded with coalition forces at camp doha , kuwait nor do i find it surprising that the german government has acknowledged it did provide some limited support to the american military .
despite its opposition to the war , germany did nothing to obstruct the american military preparations and indirectly helped in a number of ways : safeguarding sea lanes , facilitating the transport of american forces from germany that fought in the war , providing troops in kuwait to protect kuwaiti citizens against chemical weapons attacks , not objecting to nato efforts to send awacs or patriot missile defense interceptors to turkey . germany 's posture was basically : they were n't going to too directly assist the war effort , but they were n't going to frustrate it either . steve zwick interviewed michael r. gordon -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : who 's taking aim at berlin ?
a news report claiming german secret agents gave the us iraq 's war plans has drawn indignant denials from both berlin and washington .
dw 's daniel scheschkewitz believes the leak must have been carefully planned .

germany ordered cats to be kept indoors and dogs on leashes in five states hit by bird flu . after the deadly bird flu was found to have killed a cat on the german baltic sea island of rügen , where the virus was first detected in the country , consumer protection agency officials said cats must be kept indoors , and dogs on leashes . the government said the order would take effect immediately in a radius of three kilometers -lrb- 1.8 miles -rrb- of all areas where infected wild birds have been found . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when outdoors , cats may look for birds so far , the flu has been found in bavaria , baden-württemberg , brandenburg , schleswig-holstein , and mecklenburg-western pomerania . crisis team meeti n g the cat , which authorities said was a stray , was found on the baltic sea island of rügen , where the deadly h5n1 was detected in birds earlier this month .

becoming germany 's first female leader was not easy , but angela merkel has already carved her name high up in the popularity stakes . the grand coalition has been in office for a full 100 days , which means the period of grace traditionally granted a new government , is officially over .
but with the german public appearing more than willing to continue supporting the conservative cdu / csu and social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- alliance , that is of little relevance .
angela merkel is enjoying massive popularity and opinion polls suggest that her party is steaming ahead of their coalition partner , the spd . but at the federal elections last september , the picture was quite different .
the two main parties were unable to beat each other , and the results of the ballot made it impossible for either the cdu / csu to form a coalition with the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- or for the spd-green alliance to continue running the country .
the additional parliamentary presence of the left party meant the only alternative was to form a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder fought it out for the top spot and that very coalition , so it turns out , is what the majority of german voters wanted .
in it , they see the possibility of fulfilled expectations and greater harmony .
on the latter point , with coalition partners who treat one another with care and are quick to resolve budding disputes , the electorate can be satisfied . yet , on the former , expectations regarding unemployment reduction remain unfulfilled .
there is also reason to believe that the two sides will clash over continued welfare and health reforms . showing germany 's new face abroad on the international stage , merkel made a good first impression .
she breezed confidently through her debut visits to paris , london and washington , but they were not meant to serve as opportunities to iron out any serious conflicts of interest .
merkel has not yet shown what position she will take on washington 's stance on the iranian nuclear program .
and although the new german leader 's appearance at the eu budget summit met with applause , it 's not entirely clear to what extent that was the result of her financial generosity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vice chancellor and labor minister , franz müntefering meanwhile , the grand coalition is an acid test for the social democrats who are trying to profile themselves .
thus far , labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering has been viewed as the spd heavyweight in the cabinet , but he is not coordinating well with the new party head , matthias platzeck , and internal conflicts could become a problem for the coalition . although on the whole germany 's grand coalition conveys a stable impression , keeping it up depends on how much space the two partners have for profiling themselves .
merkel is making something of a name for herself as a leader who moderates discussions without clearly stating her position .
for the chancellor of a grand coalition that could be a good technique , but the question is whether it is sustainable beyond regional elections at the end of march . heinz dylong -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de refining merkel 's makeover angela merkel has come a long way from fashion fiasco to chic chancellor .

there have been more than 100 cases of h5n1-infected wild birds found in germany . the finding could increase concern that the virus could spread to other species in europe as it has in several cases in other parts of the world . " it has been known for some time that cats can become infected by eating infected birds , " thomas mettenleiter , president of the institute , told reuters . several large cats in asian zoos have died after being fed infected birds and domestic cats have been shown to be especially vulnerable to the disease , the institute said . the h5n1 strain , which has caused illness and even fatalities in humans in turkey and asia , has been detected in a leopard , tigers , civet cats and two domestic cats in thailand .
but the world health organization said in 2004 that the infection of cats was unlikely to enhance the risks to humans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers gather dead birds on the island of rügen the the federal research institute for animal health has called on cat owners on the german island to keep their animals away from the area where the infection seems to be centered and to take special hygenic precautions . " a transmission , which can not be completely ruled out , would only be possible through very intimate contact with an infected animal , " said mettenleiter . further spread among birds in the bird population , the disease was spreading further across europe and africa . france began vaccinating 700,000 domestic ducks and geese on farms after it announced at the weekend the first outbreak of h5n1 bird flu in a european union poultry farm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wild geese fly over a decontamination area in eastern france the commercial repercussions of the french outbreak were driven home tuesday as the government announced that some 30 countries were now restricting or banning imports of poultry and poultry products from france . sweden for the first time detected in ducks an unidentified strain of bird flu , feared to be the h5n1 strain . initial tests at sweden 's the national veterinary institute " show that we 're probably talking about the same virus that has been spreading in russia and china , " said the swedish agriculture board . elsewhere , h5n1 was detected for the first time in bosnia , the southern german state of bavaria and a poultry farm in southwestern russia where 103,000 birds were reported to have died in a week . britain said it was unlikely to escape .
" i would anticipate that avian flu will arrive at some point in the uk , " said british chief scientific advisor professor sir david king , predicting that the disease would stay for at least five years . " we are talking about the possibility of this disease being endemic here in the uk as it did in china .
it is a long-term factor , " he told the bbc . africa but world experts fretted mostly about africa , where many countries are ill equipped to detect or impede the spread of the disease . ethiopian officials were testing some of more than 6,000 chickens that died suddenly on a poultry farm in endibir 175 kilometers -lrb- 108 miles -rrb- southwest of addis ababa .
a day earlier the world organization for animal health -lrb- oie -rrb- reported the first cases of h5n1 in niger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strain of the h5n1 bird flu virus has been found in poultry stocks in nigeria in neighboring nigeria - where more than 300,000 infected fowl have already died or been slaughtered - h5n1 was detected in two more states in the north .
in the kenyan capital nairobi , the authorities said initial tests on 400 dead chickens showed no sign of bird flu .
cases of h5n1 have also been reported in egypt . human deaths have already been recorded after the disease jumped from bird to human in cambodia , china , indonesia , iraq , thailand , turkey and vietnam .
some 40 countries have now been hit by the h5n1 strain . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the continuing threat dw-world looks at the latest stories from the front line and the efforts of those attempting to stop the deadly h5n1 virus .

but now , there 's an expectation that she will transfer this success to the domestic front , and especially the economy , which is sorely in need of sustained growth after years of sub-par performance . merkel could extend her honeymoon with the german people , the pundits say , but only if she can deliver the cuts in unemployment that her government has promised . it 's a tall order .
while current economic data point to a recovery , experts say it 's a shaky one at best . jobless figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : february 's unemployment statistics pointed to a slight recovery february 's jobless figures , released just as merkel celebrated her first 100 days as chancellor , were n't all bad news .
although the unadjusted rate of unemployment showed a 12 percent increase to 5.05 million , when adjusted for seasonal swings , the number of unemployed people fell roughly 5,000 to 4.695 million .
this decrease was less than the fall of 20,000 expected by economists , however . on the plus side , business confidence in germany is at a 14-year high point and consumers are feeling increasingly optimistic as the recovery in the eurozone 's biggest economy gathers pace . still , experts are wary of being overly optimistic , cautioning that the current " feel-good " sentiment had yet to be reflected in real economic data . slow progress ? many observers have voiced fears that the forced political alliance between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will result in stagnation on pressing economic issues . " when it comes to economics , i 'm not disappointed , because i did n't expect too much to begin with , " said paul clemens friedhoff , economics expert for the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" the two partners in this coalition are far from singing the same song . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer spending is going up now , but experts say that will change with the planned vat hike the cdu and spd have managed to agree on a 25-billion euro -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- investment program to jump-start the economy , but critics say the program will be ineffectual come next year when consumer spending is expected to dip due to the cdu 's three-percent increase in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- . no shortage of issues merkel 's coalition will also have to make up its mind on how to regulate the low-wage sector .
a debate about the introduction of a minimum wage for all sectors is in full swing now , but a decision is not expected before the second half of this year . among other economic issues demanding the government 's attention is a corporate tax reform - on the back burner for the moment because the coalition partners can ’ t agree on a sustainable model . there 's also the issue of fresh borrowing .
in 2006 , over 38 billion euros will be added to germany 's pile of debt , with a turnaround on this front only expected in 2007 . a more immediate concern is the current atmosphere of discontent , with tens of thousands of public-sector employees , including garbage collectors , hospital staff and child-care workers on strike all around the country in protest against longer working hours and cuts in bonuses . " if we are seeing a recovery in germany it is not a very strong one , " said adam posen , an economist at the institute for international economics in washington .

western classical music is rising fast - and germany has plans to get in on the ground floor of a huge culture market . in the booming southern chinese province of guangdong , the world 's largest piano factory , pearl river , is planning to roll out its one-millionth instrument this march .
china does n't just build pianos , though .
it plays them - sometimes on the world stage . that was n't always the case .
young chinese virtuosos like lang lang have had international success in recent years , but western music first entered chinese concert halls in the 1980s , after the country relaxed controls on its economy .
now , those chinese who can afford it make sure their only child learns a western music instrument . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese piano virtuoso lang lang as part of the trend , the popularity of classical music is soaring in china .
mozart , whose 250th anniversary is being celebrated throughout the world in 2006 , is currently high on the list of most-beloved western composers . this interest in european music has not gone unnoticed by the german music council , germany 's largest umbrella association for music .
the council 's president , martin krüger , recently visited china , with the aim of improving musical ties between the two countries . wagner 's ' ring ' in china german music has been particularly popular in china recently .
in october , 2005 , the staatstheater nuremberg performed richard wagner 's monumental ring cycle in its entirety .
the stuttgart radio orchestra was featured at the beijing music festival , as was the berlin symphonic orchestra , which also went on to perform in shanghai . according to krüger , talks between the german music council and its chinese equivalent were fruitful , especially on the topic of an exchange program between the two nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right now , austrian composer mozart is big in china " our current plan is nothing new .
the special part is that it is taking place at an official , national level , " krüger said .
" questions of protocol play a big role in china . " improving musical ties now , the german music council has named a german-trained chinese musician , yang lin , to represent the council in china .
the main goal of the cooperation is to improve musical ties between the two countries .
to this end , it has already set up a few joint projects , including agreeing to form a german-chinese ensemble that would play at appropriate occasions - for example , the opening of the chinese cultural center in berlin .
and with a german-chinese year of culture planned for 2007 , the groups also planned to create a joint youth symphony orchestra . matthias von hein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sino-german pop walks on the wild side ever heard a german band singing beatles hits in chinese ?

the new york times web site reported this week that german agents provided us intelligence with an iraqi defense plan shortly before the us-led invasion .
dw-radio spoke to michael r. gordon , who broke the scoop . michael r. gordon : i did n't produce the american military report .
i faithfully quoted and presented the quotes in the report .
they 're in my book , " cobra ii : the inside story of the invasion and occupation of iraq , " and they 're on the website of the new york times , presented exactly as they are in that report . what strikes me is that the account of the german role is so specific and the description of the institutional arrangements they describe of the german intelligence liaison officer in qatar .
they describe him handing off a document to a defense intelligence agency official .
they say that there were two german agents in baghdad .
there are so many details here that , while i ca n't personally say with 100 percent confidence that they 're right or wrong , i do think that the report on its face appears to be highly credible and warrants more scrutiny and investigation than i think has been carried out so far . dw-radio : how did you end up with this report ? i certainly did n't set out to report on germany .
i have been working on a book on iraq for the last two years .
in the process of working on this book , i was very interested in the research that the american military had done on their iraqi counterparts .
after every war , militaries study the foe and try to figure out what the other guy was doing while they were fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militaries regularly review past actions to learn from them as i accessed a report on this , i saw that there was a very detailed discussion of saddam 's plans to defend baghdad and the pros and cons of saddam 's plan .
and in this section of the report , there was a bit of an aside which explained how this scheme for the defense of baghdad came to the attention of the united states central command , which was general tommy franks ' command .
and in no uncertain terms , this report said that the sketch of the defense arrangements for the defense of baghdad was supplied by a german liaison officer in qatar , and that he gave it to a member of the united states defense intelligence agency who worked in general franks ' headquarters . that caught my attention .
i was really struck by how explicit the account was of the german role and how detailed it was . you 've heard no doubt that a lot of people in germany are saying this was a so-called targeted leak designed to punish the previous german administration for opposing the iraq war .
what is your response ? that was certainly not my intention , nor the intention of anybody who provided access to this .
again , this is a study that i accessed not to learn about germany but to learn about what the iraqis were up to , and which i accessed some months ago .
the german portion of this report is rather small . the reason that this is coming out now is my book is coming out in march .
since completing my book leave i 've returned to the new york times , and i 've begun to harvest the material in the book and make it available to the times ' readers .
if i 'd finished my book a little earlier , it would have come out a few months ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us agents could have been inserted into the embassies of allies ' in baghdad , gordon said this type of cooperation - passing information back and forth - is this at all unusual among intelligence services ? i think it 's entirely understandable and not surprising .
intelligence agencies have relationships which continue despite political problems between capitals , and that 's because the services need to work together even after their regimes change .
in the case of iraq , the united states really did n't have very good intelligence - this i think ought to be clear , i mean , there was no wmd , the us was wrong on that .
and it 's a matter of public record that the united states did n't have a single spy in iraq with direct access to iraq 's wmd programs .
nor was the intelligence on the south particularly good .
it 'd be quite understandable that the americans would want to rely on those allies , such as germany , which did have an embassy in baghdad and therefore the capacity to insert agents under diplomatic cover .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael gordon , a new york times reporter embedded with coalition forces at camp doha , kuwait nor do i find it surprising that the german government has acknowledged it did provide some limited support to the american military .
despite its opposition to the war , germany did nothing to obstruct the american military preparations and indirectly helped in a number of ways : safeguarding sea lanes , facilitating the transport of american forces from germany that fought in the war , providing troops in kuwait to protect kuwaiti citizens against chemical weapons attacks , not objecting to nato efforts to send awacs or patriot missile defense interceptors to turkey . germany 's posture was basically : they were n't going to too directly assist the war effort , but they were n't going to frustrate it either . steve zwick interviewed michael r. gordon -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : who 's taking aim at berlin ?

the new york times web site reported this week that german agents provided us intelligence with an iraqi defense plan shortly before the us-led invasion .
dw-radio spoke to michael r. gordon , who broke the scoop . michael r. gordon : i did n't produce the american military report .
i faithfully quoted and presented the quotes in the report .
they 're in my book , " cobra ii : the inside story of the invasion and occupation of iraq , " and they 're on the website of the new york times , presented exactly as they are in that report . what strikes me is that the account of the german role is so specific and the description of the institutional arrangements they describe of the german intelligence liaison officer in qatar .
they describe him handing off a document to a defense intelligence agency official .
they say that there were two german agents in baghdad .
there are so many details here that , while i ca n't personally say with 100 percent confidence that they 're right or wrong , i do think that the report on its face appears to be highly credible and warrants more scrutiny and investigation than i think has been carried out so far . dw-radio : how did you end up with this report ? i certainly did n't set out to report on germany .
i have been working on a book on iraq for the last two years .
in the process of working on this book , i was very interested in the research that the american military had done on their iraqi counterparts .
after every war , militaries study the foe and try to figure out what the other guy was doing while they were fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militaries regularly review past actions to learn from them as i accessed a report on this , i saw that there was a very detailed discussion of saddam 's plans to defend baghdad and the pros and cons of saddam 's plan .
and in this section of the report , there was a bit of an aside which explained how this scheme for the defense of baghdad came to the attention of the united states central command , which was general tommy franks ' command .
and in no uncertain terms , this report said that the sketch of the defense arrangements for the defense of baghdad was supplied by a german liaison officer in qatar , and that he gave it to a member of the united states defense intelligence agency who worked in general franks ' headquarters . that caught my attention .
i was really struck by how explicit the account was of the german role and how detailed it was . you 've heard no doubt that a lot of people in germany are saying this was a so-called targeted leak designed to punish the previous german administration for opposing the iraq war .
what is your response ? that was certainly not my intention , nor the intention of anybody who provided access to this .
again , this is a study that i accessed not to learn about germany but to learn about what the iraqis were up to , and which i accessed some months ago .
the german portion of this report is rather small . the reason that this is coming out now is my book is coming out in march .

intelligence agencies have relationships which continue despite political problems between capitals , and that 's because the services need to work together even after their regimes change .
in the case of iraq , the united states really did n't have very good intelligence - this i think ought to be clear , i mean , there was no wmd , the us was wrong on that .
and it 's a matter of public record that the united states did n't have a single spy in iraq with direct access to iraq 's wmd programs .
nor was the intelligence on the south particularly good .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : merkel 's record so far it 's the economy , angela chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days opinion : 100 days of angela merkel new german government has nation in buoyant mood germany -pipe- 01.03.2006 press review : merkel 's first 100 days großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flattery will get you everywhere : merkel as elastigirl from " the incredibles " during carnival applause for her performance abroad , doubts about what 's to come at home - european editorial writers were kind in their reviews of angela merkel 's first 100 days in office , but fear the honeymoon could soon end . the french paper le figaro congratulated merkel on her successful foreign policy during her first 100 days in office .
" from warsaw to london and davos , in jerusalem and ramallah , merkel succeeded in combining the diplomatic inheritance of her mentor , helmut kohl , with that of her predecessor , gerhard schröder - the european and atlantic tradition of the one , and the defense of national interests of the other , " the paper commented .
a question of gender ? britain 's financial times decided to speculate on whether the initial successes of merkel 's chancellorship could be put down to a certain " female touch " she brings to foreign policy .
well aware that such a hypothesis could be thrown out by some as " thinly veiled discrimination , " the paper nonetheless made a case for its assumption , arguing : " after all , she visited president george w. bush in washington to relaunch a productive german-american relationship but uttered clear words on the need to close down the guantanamo prison .
she decided not to embrace -lrb- nor kiss à la gerhard schröder -rrb- vladimir putin , russia 's president , and sent strong signals to hamas .
from these initial - and very successful - moves we may draw two rules that seem to apply to ms. merkel 's ' female ' foreign policy : firm but sober on principles , tough but patient on implementation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a less-than-flattering view of merkel 's relationship with the us administration the swiss paper der bund took a closer look at what 's behind the praise being heaped on the merkel administration , and found that the positive reviews are deceptive .
it commented that " the team around the cdu leader profited to a large extent from the implosion of the red-green coalition in 2005 , and the paralysis that set in after the indecisive election .
compared to that uncertainty , the unspectacular but solidly working government is a boon , no matter whether or not you agree with what it 's doing . "
but the paper feared that this would not be enough in the long run , and predicted that merkel - who it described as more of a social democrat in some points than the social democrats themselves - risks frustrating her grand coalition partners . the paris-based paper libération also foresaw difficulties for merkel in the future , mainly because , as it commented , " she has not even had to get to grips with the bigger stones lying in her path . "
everyone 's waiting for merkel to tackle issues such as unemployment and the financing of health care - issues where the cdu and the spd do not at all see eye to eye , the paper wrote . unemployment the true test britain 's the times , however , said that merkel 's aura has already begun to fade , and predicted that the issue of unemployment will be her undoing .
" dozens of bouquets have been prepared to mark her 100th day as chancellor , but the only number that seemed to count was the 5,048,000 on the dole , " the paper wrote .
on the domestic front , merkel has changed the law to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 and increase vat by three points , but according to the times , " neither initiative addresses the dilemma of how to translate higher growth - now predicted to be 1.5 percent this year - into jobs . " but the belgian paper la libre belgique thought that the honeymoon could continue , just a little longer .
" even critical observers admit that she 's not made a single faux pas , " the paper commented .
" it 's gone on for so long as to have almost become boring .

" from warsaw to london and davos , in jerusalem and ramallah , merkel succeeded in combining the diplomatic inheritance of her mentor , helmut kohl , with that of her predecessor , gerhard schröder - the european and atlantic tradition of the one , and the defense of national interests of the other , " the paper commented .
a question of gender ? britain 's financial times decided to speculate on whether the initial successes of merkel 's chancellorship could be put down to a certain " female touch " she brings to foreign policy .

she decided not to embrace -lrb- nor kiss à la gerhard schröder -rrb- vladimir putin , russia 's president , and sent strong signals to hamas .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a less-than-flattering view of merkel 's relationship with the us administration the swiss paper der bund took a closer look at what 's behind the praise being heaped on the merkel administration , and found that the positive reviews are deceptive .
it commented that " the team around the cdu leader profited to a large extent from the implosion of the red-green coalition in 2005 , and the paralysis that set in after the indecisive election .
compared to that uncertainty , the unspectacular but solidly working government is a boon , no matter whether or not you agree with what it 's doing . "
but the paper feared that this would not be enough in the long run , and predicted that merkel - who it described as more of a social democrat in some points than the social democrats themselves - risks frustrating her grand coalition partners . the paris-based paper libération also foresaw difficulties for merkel in the future , mainly because , as it commented , " she has not even had to get to grips with the bigger stones lying in her path . "
everyone 's waiting for merkel to tackle issues such as unemployment and the financing of health care - issues where the cdu and the spd do not at all see eye to eye , the paper wrote . unemployment the true test britain 's the times , however , said that merkel 's aura has already begun to fade , and predicted that the issue of unemployment will be her undoing .
" dozens of bouquets have been prepared to mark her 100th day as chancellor , but the only number that seemed to count was the 5,048,000 on the dole , " the paper wrote .
on the domestic front , merkel has changed the law to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 and increase vat by three points , but according to the times , " neither initiative addresses the dilemma of how to translate higher growth - now predicted to be 1.5 percent this year - into jobs . " but the belgian paper la libre belgique thought that the honeymoon could continue , just a little longer .

" from warsaw to london and davos , in jerusalem and ramallah , merkel succeeded in combining the diplomatic inheritance of her mentor , helmut kohl , with that of her predecessor , gerhard schröder - the european and atlantic tradition of the one , and the defense of national interests of the other , " the paper commented .
a question of gender ? britain 's financial times decided to speculate on whether the initial successes of merkel 's chancellorship could be put down to a certain " female touch " she brings to foreign policy .
well aware that such a hypothesis could be thrown out by some as " thinly veiled discrimination , " the paper nonetheless made a case for its assumption , arguing : " after all , she visited president george w. bush in washington to relaunch a productive german-american relationship but uttered clear words on the need to close down the guantanamo prison .
she decided not to embrace -lrb- nor kiss à la gerhard schröder -rrb- vladimir putin , russia 's president , and sent strong signals to hamas .

on the contrary , harmony is the watchword so far .
political scientist klaus detterbeck looks back and ahead . dw-world : the grand coalition 's grace period - its first hundred days - is now over .
one gets the impression that the government has made a better impression than was once expected . klaus detterbeck : i think so too .
surveys regarding angela merkel and the christian democrats are good right now .
there are two reasons for this relatively good start for the grand coalition .
first , there have been successes , like chancellor merkel 's trip to the us , to russia and at the eu summit , as well as some overall positive economic developments .
secondly , the populace has given the chancellor something of an advance when it comes to trust .
people are willing to give this coalition some time to find its footing .
a majority of people have the feeling that a solid , capable team is at the helm , as opposed to that of the last schröder government . so are the individuals in the government less important than the " team " as a whole ? yes , you could say that .
that has to do with chancellor merkel 's role as a director .
she is not a big personality out front , who calls all the shots .
rather she 's the person who steers the entire team .
that makes her different than schröder , who was something of a showman who pranced on the political stage . despite the laurels , has the country really progressed toward finding solutions to some of its problems ? it 's true that there have been no big decisions made as yet .
there is this positive impression , a positive undertone , but the real foundation for new policies has n't yet been laid .
negotiations still have to take place about federalism reform , and other big reform projects have yet to be tackled . angela merkel enjoys a good deal of sympathy from journalists of all stripes .
she is also respected by foreign leaders .
what is different about her ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular with journalists these days she leaves the impression of being someone who does solid work and does n't push her way to the front .
instead , she tries to enact good policies for the good of the country .
in the grand coalition , she is engaging in the politics of inclusion .
that 's to her great credit . will she be successful if she continues to follow this strategy ?
what about when she has to get down to the nitty-gritty ? one of her strengths is her ability to hold the two camps together .
but in fact , this advantage could turn into a disadvantage if it comes time to make difficult decisions and she finds it hard to assert her authority , depending on a consensus for decisions . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have lost popularity among voters .
does the party have the wrong party chairman or is its strategy faulty ? the spd has two problems .
for one , they have the rather " unpleasant " ministries : -lrb- franz -rrb- müntefering at labor and -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrück at finance .
on the other hand , people still are n't sure what this party actually stands for .
is it a reform party , which is how it 's been seen over the past few years under schröder ?
or is it headed back in a more traditional , union-oriented direction ?
-lrb- matthias -rrb- platzeck is still not in the position to explain where the party should go from here and it 's hurting because of that . let 's look at the opposition .
does one actually still exist and if so , is it able to attract any attention to itself ? it 's true that the opposition parties have problems finding an audience .
the left party is mostly concerned with itself these days ; the greens have n't found their direction yet ; and the free democrats are having a hard time making their mark .
these are tough times for the smaller parties .
we 'll have to see how they do at the end of march , when there are elections in rheinland-palatinate , saxony-anhalt and baden-württemberg . political scientist klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . steffen leidel spoke with klaus detterbeck send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges recovery and resolve in first speech angela merkel gave her first speech to parliament as german chancellor wednesday and spoke of a strong germany full of opportunities and a country that would stand firm on the issues of justice and equal rights .

on the contrary , harmony is the watchword so far .
political scientist klaus detterbeck looks back and ahead . dw-world : the grand coalition 's grace period - its first hundred days - is now over .
one gets the impression that the government has made a better impression than was once expected . klaus detterbeck : i think so too .
surveys regarding angela merkel and the christian democrats are good right now .
there are two reasons for this relatively good start for the grand coalition .
first , there have been successes , like chancellor merkel 's trip to the us , to russia and at the eu summit , as well as some overall positive economic developments .
secondly , the populace has given the chancellor something of an advance when it comes to trust .
people are willing to give this coalition some time to find its footing .
a majority of people have the feeling that a solid , capable team is at the helm , as opposed to that of the last schröder government . so are the individuals in the government less important than the " team " as a whole ? yes , you could say that .
that has to do with chancellor merkel 's role as a director .
she is not a big personality out front , who calls all the shots .
rather she 's the person who steers the entire team .
that makes her different than schröder , who was something of a showman who pranced on the political stage . despite the laurels , has the country really progressed toward finding solutions to some of its problems ? it 's true that there have been no big decisions made as yet .
there is this positive impression , a positive undertone , but the real foundation for new policies has n't yet been laid .
negotiations still have to take place about federalism reform , and other big reform projects have yet to be tackled . angela merkel enjoys a good deal of sympathy from journalists of all stripes .
she is also respected by foreign leaders .
what is different about her ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular with journalists these days she leaves the impression of being someone who does solid work and does n't push her way to the front .
instead , she tries to enact good policies for the good of the country .
in the grand coalition , she is engaging in the politics of inclusion .
that 's to her great credit . will she be successful if she continues to follow this strategy ?
what about when she has to get down to the nitty-gritty ? one of her strengths is her ability to hold the two camps together .
but in fact , this advantage could turn into a disadvantage if it comes time to make difficult decisions and she finds it hard to assert her authority , depending on a consensus for decisions . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have lost popularity among voters .
does the party have the wrong party chairman or is its strategy faulty ? the spd has two problems .
for one , they have the rather " unpleasant " ministries : -lrb- franz -rrb- müntefering at labor and -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrück at finance .
on the other hand , people still are n't sure what this party actually stands for .
is it a reform party , which is how it 's been seen over the past few years under schröder ?

" we want to put an end to our negative run against big name opposition , " he said . drawing on klinsmann 's experience klinsmann knows what it takes to unlock an italian defense having played for inter milan from 1989 to 1992 .
he scored 36 goals and helped inter win the uefa cup in 1991 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team coach , jürgen klinsmann germany 's first-choice goalkeeper oliver kahn has been ruled out due to a thigh strain , so arsenal 's jens lehmann will deputize , while stuttgart keeper timo hildebrand will act as lehmann 's understudy .
with italy 's left-sided defender gianluca zambrotta unavailable , fiorentina defender manuel pasqual could make his first appearance for italy in front of his home crowd . wednesday 's match revives memories of the classic 1982 world cup final in spain which italy won 3-1 .

becoming germany 's first female leader was not easy , but angela merkel has already carved her name high up in the popularity stakes . the grand coalition has been in office for a full 100 days , which means the period of grace traditionally granted a new government , is officially over .
but with the german public appearing more than willing to continue supporting the conservative cdu / csu and social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- alliance , that is of little relevance .
angela merkel is enjoying massive popularity and opinion polls suggest that her party is steaming ahead of their coalition partner , the spd . but at the federal elections last september , the picture was quite different .
the two main parties were unable to beat each other , and the results of the ballot made it impossible for either the cdu / csu to form a coalition with the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- or for the spd-green alliance to continue running the country .
the additional parliamentary presence of the left party meant the only alternative was to form a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder fought it out for the top spot and that very coalition , so it turns out , is what the majority of german voters wanted .
in it , they see the possibility of fulfilled expectations and greater harmony .
on the latter point , with coalition partners who treat one another with care and are quick to resolve budding disputes , the electorate can be satisfied . yet , on the former , expectations regarding unemployment reduction remain unfulfilled .
there is also reason to believe that the two sides will clash over continued welfare and health reforms . showing germany 's new face abroad on the international stage , merkel made a good first impression .
she breezed confidently through her debut visits to paris , london and washington , but they were not meant to serve as opportunities to iron out any serious conflicts of interest .
merkel has not yet shown what position she will take on washington 's stance on the iranian nuclear program .
and although the new german leader 's appearance at the eu budget summit met with applause , it 's not entirely clear to what extent that was the result of her financial generosity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vice chancellor and labor minister , franz müntefering meanwhile , the grand coalition is an acid test for the social democrats who are trying to profile themselves .
thus far , labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering has been viewed as the spd heavyweight in the cabinet , but he is not coordinating well with the new party head , matthias platzeck , and internal conflicts could become a problem for the coalition . although on the whole germany 's grand coalition conveys a stable impression , keeping it up depends on how much space the two partners have for profiling themselves .
merkel is making something of a name for herself as a leader who moderates discussions without clearly stating her position .

becoming germany 's first female leader was not easy , but angela merkel has already carved her name high up in the popularity stakes . the grand coalition has been in office for a full 100 days , which means the period of grace traditionally granted a new government , is officially over .
but with the german public appearing more than willing to continue supporting the conservative cdu / csu and social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- alliance , that is of little relevance .
angela merkel is enjoying massive popularity and opinion polls suggest that her party is steaming ahead of their coalition partner , the spd . but at the federal elections last september , the picture was quite different .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : merkel 's record so far it 's the economy , angela press review : merkel 's first 100 days chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days new german government has nation in buoyant mood germany -pipe- 01.03.2006 opinion : 100 days of angela merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and müntefering : still smiling after the honeymoon ?
becoming germany 's first female leader was not easy , but angela merkel has already carved her name high up in the popularity stakes . the grand coalition has been in office for a full 100 days , which means the period of grace traditionally granted a new government , is officially over .
but with the german public appearing more than willing to continue supporting the conservative cdu / csu and social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- alliance , that is of little relevance .
angela merkel is enjoying massive popularity and opinion polls suggest that her party is steaming ahead of their coalition partner , the spd . but at the federal elections last september , the picture was quite different .
the two main parties were unable to beat each other , and the results of the ballot made it impossible for either the cdu / csu to form a coalition with the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- or for the spd-green alliance to continue running the country .
the additional parliamentary presence of the left party meant the only alternative was to form a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder fought it out for the top spot and that very coalition , so it turns out , is what the majority of german voters wanted .
in it , they see the possibility of fulfilled expectations and greater harmony .
on the latter point , with coalition partners who treat one another with care and are quick to resolve budding disputes , the electorate can be satisfied . yet , on the former , expectations regarding unemployment reduction remain unfulfilled .
there is also reason to believe that the two sides will clash over continued welfare and health reforms . showing germany 's new face abroad on the international stage , merkel made a good first impression .
she breezed confidently through her debut visits to paris , london and washington , but they were not meant to serve as opportunities to iron out any serious conflicts of interest .
merkel has not yet shown what position she will take on washington 's stance on the iranian nuclear program .
and although the new german leader 's appearance at the eu budget summit met with applause , it 's not entirely clear to what extent that was the result of her financial generosity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vice chancellor and labor minister , franz müntefering meanwhile , the grand coalition is an acid test for the social democrats who are trying to profile themselves .
thus far , labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering has been viewed as the spd heavyweight in the cabinet , but he is not coordinating well with the new party head , matthias platzeck , and internal conflicts could become a problem for the coalition . although on the whole germany 's grand coalition conveys a stable impression , keeping it up depends on how much space the two partners have for profiling themselves .
merkel is making something of a name for herself as a leader who moderates discussions without clearly stating her position .
for the chancellor of a grand coalition that could be a good technique , but the question is whether it is sustainable beyond regional elections at the end of march . heinz dylong -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de refining merkel 's makeover angela merkel has come a long way from fashion fiasco to chic chancellor .
but at least one controversial designer seems to think there 's still room for improvement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 01.03.2006 germans suffer bitter defeat in friendly against italy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack -lrb- left -rrb- and bernd schneider had no reason to cheer italy 's national team sent their german guest home with a bitter 4-1 defeat in wednesday 's friendly that had commentators worry about the german team 's readiness for the world cup . in a surprisingly one-sided international friendly in florence , italy , the home side took early control , storming into a two-goal lead inside the first seven minutes at the artemio franchi stadium , home of serie a side fiorentina . alberto gilardino pounced from close range before setting up luca toni for an easy second in front of his home crowd . daniele de rossi 's header before the break practically killed off german hopes of mounting a comeback , and alessendro del piero added to their misery 11 minutes into the second half . robert huth pulled one back for germany eight minutes from time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto gilardino was the first to score germany managed just three efforts on target and their lame performance suggested they will pose little threat in this summer 's tournament , even with home advantage . their defense , the rock upon which the great german teams of the past have been built , was exposed time after time by italy 's pace and movement . the italians , on the other hand , demonstrated their true quality with a flawless display that oozed class , defensive solidity complimented by a clinical forward line . germa n defe n se caught n appi n g germany 's defense was caught napping at a free-kick in the fourth minute after fabio grosso had been fouled on the left wing . del piero swung the ball over for fabio cannavaro whose point blank header was only parried by german goalkeeper jens lehmann , and gilardino snapped up the loose ball .
matters worsened for the visitors three minutes later . del piero 's quickly-taken free-kick surprised the german back four and sent gilardino racing clear towards goal .
the 23-year-old ac milan striker looked up and unselfishly slid the ball across to give toni a tap-in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luca toni celebrated after just seven minutes italy might have had a third moments later when del piero 's crossed free-kick found gilardino unmarked , but he failed by just a few inches to make a connection . germany then sliced italy open with their first genuine attack , but gianluigi buffon pulled off a superb save to keep out sebastian deisler 's vicious drive . de rossi made it 3-0 in the 39th minute , applying the finishing touch to mauro camoranesi 's cross as the german defense suffered another alarming lapse in concentration . " it 's i n explicable " limiting the damage was germany 's task now , but they leaked another goal in the 56th minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniele de rossi -lrb- right -rrb- and robert huth -lrb- left -rrb- gilardino 's cross from the left was headed back across goal by camoranesi and del piero dived low to head past a helpless lehmann . huth 's late strike was of little consolation for the poor germans . " it 's inexplicable how one can fall back so quickly , " said german captain michael ballack , who added that italy 's early lead had made his team insecure .
" the mistakes we made were punished hard .
thankfully there will be another match in three weeks and then it 's going to be a different german national team . " national coach jürgen klinsmann also said that he still had high hopes for his team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann " of course we 're disappointed - we had high hopes and there were smashed within the first minutes , " said german national coach jürgen klinsmann .
" it was a frustrating lesson for us , but we believe in this team and we believe in the young players .
we 're confident that everything will work in 100 days . " but the weak performance had commentators worried about the team 's readiness to succeed in the world cup this summer at home . " if the italians were to really go for it , germany would look even worse , " said reinhold beckmann , the match 's commentator for german public broadcaster ard .
" the real question is whether the german team is just too young . " the team still has three chances to prove that it is ready for the world cup .
on march 22 , it will face the us , followed by matches against japan on may 30 and colombia on june 2 . the german team opens the world cup on june 9 against costa rica . hooliga n s n ot impressed by pope 's appeal before the match , a message by pope benedict xvi called for an end to racist chanting and emblems at football matches and urged football fans to adopt " respect and dialogue " ahead of this summer 's world cup in his native germany . both nations ' football authorities had dedicated the match to opposing all forms of racial violence .
racism has been a serious problem in italy 's elite seria a league this season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-born pope got a world cup pennant from german soccer legend franz beckenbauer last october the 78-year-old pontiff said he appreciated the initiative to combat racial discrimination , which he said would " consolidate awareness of the important educative function of sport in the service of solidarity and peace . " but before the match , german and italian hooligans tried to start a fight and fired off signal rockets .
according to the german soccer federation , 900 tickets had been sold to german fans , with 600 seated in a closed-off area .

the new york times web site reported this week that german agents provided us intelligence with an iraqi defense plan shortly before the us-led invasion .
dw-radio spoke to michael r. gordon , who broke the scoop . michael r. gordon : i did n't produce the american military report .
i faithfully quoted and presented the quotes in the report .
they 're in my book , " cobra ii : the inside story of the invasion and occupation of iraq , " and they 're on the website of the new york times , presented exactly as they are in that report . what strikes me is that the account of the german role is so specific and the description of the institutional arrangements they describe of the german intelligence liaison officer in qatar .
they describe him handing off a document to a defense intelligence agency official .
they say that there were two german agents in baghdad .
there are so many details here that , while i ca n't personally say with 100 percent confidence that they 're right or wrong , i do think that the report on its face appears to be highly credible and warrants more scrutiny and investigation than i think has been carried out so far . dw-radio : how did you end up with this report ? i certainly did n't set out to report on germany .
i have been working on a book on iraq for the last two years .
in the process of working on this book , i was very interested in the research that the american military had done on their iraqi counterparts .
after every war , militaries study the foe and try to figure out what the other guy was doing while they were fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militaries regularly review past actions to learn from them as i accessed a report on this , i saw that there was a very detailed discussion of saddam 's plans to defend baghdad and the pros and cons of saddam 's plan .
and in this section of the report , there was a bit of an aside which explained how this scheme for the defense of baghdad came to the attention of the united states central command , which was general tommy franks ' command .
and in no uncertain terms , this report said that the sketch of the defense arrangements for the defense of baghdad was supplied by a german liaison officer in qatar , and that he gave it to a member of the united states defense intelligence agency who worked in general franks ' headquarters . that caught my attention .
i was really struck by how explicit the account was of the german role and how detailed it was . you 've heard no doubt that a lot of people in germany are saying this was a so-called targeted leak designed to punish the previous german administration for opposing the iraq war .
what is your response ? that was certainly not my intention , nor the intention of anybody who provided access to this .
again , this is a study that i accessed not to learn about germany but to learn about what the iraqis were up to , and which i accessed some months ago .
the german portion of this report is rather small . the reason that this is coming out now is my book is coming out in march .
since completing my book leave i 've returned to the new york times , and i 've begun to harvest the material in the book and make it available to the times ' readers .
if i 'd finished my book a little earlier , it would have come out a few months ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us agents could have been inserted into the embassies of allies ' in baghdad , gordon said this type of cooperation - passing information back and forth - is this at all unusual among intelligence services ? i think it 's entirely understandable and not surprising .
intelligence agencies have relationships which continue despite political problems between capitals , and that 's because the services need to work together even after their regimes change .
in the case of iraq , the united states really did n't have very good intelligence - this i think ought to be clear , i mean , there was no wmd , the us was wrong on that .
and it 's a matter of public record that the united states did n't have a single spy in iraq with direct access to iraq 's wmd programs .
nor was the intelligence on the south particularly good .
it 'd be quite understandable that the americans would want to rely on those allies , such as germany , which did have an embassy in baghdad and therefore the capacity to insert agents under diplomatic cover .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael gordon , a new york times reporter embedded with coalition forces at camp doha , kuwait nor do i find it surprising that the german government has acknowledged it did provide some limited support to the american military .
despite its opposition to the war , germany did nothing to obstruct the american military preparations and indirectly helped in a number of ways : safeguarding sea lanes , facilitating the transport of american forces from germany that fought in the war , providing troops in kuwait to protect kuwaiti citizens against chemical weapons attacks , not objecting to nato efforts to send awacs or patriot missile defense interceptors to turkey . germany 's posture was basically : they were n't going to too directly assist the war effort , but they were n't going to frustrate it either . steve zwick interviewed michael r. gordon -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : who 's taking aim at berlin ?
a news report claiming german secret agents gave the us iraq 's war plans has drawn indignant denials from both berlin and washington .
dw 's daniel scheschkewitz believes the leak must have been carefully planned .

i was really struck by how explicit the account was of the german role and how detailed it was . you 've heard no doubt that a lot of people in germany are saying this was a so-called targeted leak designed to punish the previous german administration for opposing the iraq war .
what is your response ? that was certainly not my intention , nor the intention of anybody who provided access to this .
again , this is a study that i accessed not to learn about germany but to learn about what the iraqis were up to , and which i accessed some months ago .
the german portion of this report is rather small . the reason that this is coming out now is my book is coming out in march .
since completing my book leave i 've returned to the new york times , and i 've begun to harvest the material in the book and make it available to the times ' readers .
if i 'd finished my book a little earlier , it would have come out a few months ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us agents could have been inserted into the embassies of allies ' in baghdad , gordon said this type of cooperation - passing information back and forth - is this at all unusual among intelligence services ? i think it 's entirely understandable and not surprising .
intelligence agencies have relationships which continue despite political problems between capitals , and that 's because the services need to work together even after their regimes change .
in the case of iraq , the united states really did n't have very good intelligence - this i think ought to be clear , i mean , there was no wmd , the us was wrong on that .
and it 's a matter of public record that the united states did n't have a single spy in iraq with direct access to iraq 's wmd programs .
nor was the intelligence on the south particularly good .
it 'd be quite understandable that the americans would want to rely on those allies , such as germany , which did have an embassy in baghdad and therefore the capacity to insert agents under diplomatic cover .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael gordon , a new york times reporter embedded with coalition forces at camp doha , kuwait nor do i find it surprising that the german government has acknowledged it did provide some limited support to the american military .
despite its opposition to the war , germany did nothing to obstruct the american military preparations and indirectly helped in a number of ways : safeguarding sea lanes , facilitating the transport of american forces from germany that fought in the war , providing troops in kuwait to protect kuwaiti citizens against chemical weapons attacks , not objecting to nato efforts to send awacs or patriot missile defense interceptors to turkey . germany 's posture was basically : they were n't going to too directly assist the war effort , but they were n't going to frustrate it either . steve zwick interviewed michael r. gordon -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : who 's taking aim at berlin ?
a news report claiming german secret agents gave the us iraq 's war plans has drawn indignant denials from both berlin and washington .

on the contrary , harmony is the watchword so far .
political scientist klaus detterbeck looks back and ahead . dw-world : the grand coalition 's grace period - its first hundred days - is now over .
one gets the impression that the government has made a better impression than was once expected . klaus detterbeck : i think so too .
surveys regarding angela merkel and the christian democrats are good right now .
there are two reasons for this relatively good start for the grand coalition .
first , there have been successes , like chancellor merkel 's trip to the us , to russia and at the eu summit , as well as some overall positive economic developments .
secondly , the populace has given the chancellor something of an advance when it comes to trust .
people are willing to give this coalition some time to find its footing .
a majority of people have the feeling that a solid , capable team is at the helm , as opposed to that of the last schröder government . so are the individuals in the government less important than the " team " as a whole ? yes , you could say that .
that has to do with chancellor merkel 's role as a director .
she is not a big personality out front , who calls all the shots .
rather she 's the person who steers the entire team .
that makes her different than schröder , who was something of a showman who pranced on the political stage . despite the laurels , has the country really progressed toward finding solutions to some of its problems ? it 's true that there have been no big decisions made as yet .
there is this positive impression , a positive undertone , but the real foundation for new policies has n't yet been laid .
negotiations still have to take place about federalism reform , and other big reform projects have yet to be tackled . angela merkel enjoys a good deal of sympathy from journalists of all stripes .
she is also respected by foreign leaders .
what is different about her ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular with journalists these days she leaves the impression of being someone who does solid work and does n't push her way to the front .
instead , she tries to enact good policies for the good of the country .
in the grand coalition , she is engaging in the politics of inclusion .
that 's to her great credit . will she be successful if she continues to follow this strategy ?
what about when she has to get down to the nitty-gritty ? one of her strengths is her ability to hold the two camps together .
but in fact , this advantage could turn into a disadvantage if it comes time to make difficult decisions and she finds it hard to assert her authority , depending on a consensus for decisions . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have lost popularity among voters .
does the party have the wrong party chairman or is its strategy faulty ? the spd has two problems .
for one , they have the rather " unpleasant " ministries : -lrb- franz -rrb- müntefering at labor and -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrück at finance .
on the other hand , people still are n't sure what this party actually stands for .
is it a reform party , which is how it 's been seen over the past few years under schröder ?
or is it headed back in a more traditional , union-oriented direction ?
-lrb- matthias -rrb- platzeck is still not in the position to explain where the party should go from here and it 's hurting because of that . let 's look at the opposition .
does one actually still exist and if so , is it able to attract any attention to itself ? it 's true that the opposition parties have problems finding an audience .
the left party is mostly concerned with itself these days ; the greens have n't found their direction yet ; and the free democrats are having a hard time making their mark .
these are tough times for the smaller parties .
we 'll have to see how they do at the end of march , when there are elections in rheinland-palatinate , saxony-anhalt and baden-württemberg . political scientist klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . steffen leidel spoke with klaus detterbeck send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges recovery and resolve in first speech angela merkel gave her first speech to parliament as german chancellor wednesday and spoke of a strong germany full of opportunities and a country that would stand firm on the issues of justice and equal rights .

but now , there 's an expectation that she will transfer this success to the domestic front , and especially the economy , which is sorely in need of sustained growth after years of sub-par performance . merkel could extend her honeymoon with the german people , the pundits say , but only if she can deliver the cuts in unemployment that her government has promised . it 's a tall order .
while current economic data point to a recovery , experts say it 's a shaky one at best . jobless figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : february 's unemployment statistics pointed to a slight recovery february 's jobless figures , released just as merkel celebrated her first 100 days as chancellor , were n't all bad news .
although the unadjusted rate of unemployment showed a 12 percent increase to 5.05 million , when adjusted for seasonal swings , the number of unemployed people fell roughly 5,000 to 4.695 million .
this decrease was less than the fall of 20,000 expected by economists , however . on the plus side , business confidence in germany is at a 14-year high point and consumers are feeling increasingly optimistic as the recovery in the eurozone 's biggest economy gathers pace . still , experts are wary of being overly optimistic , cautioning that the current " feel-good " sentiment had yet to be reflected in real economic data . slow progress ? many observers have voiced fears that the forced political alliance between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will result in stagnation on pressing economic issues . " when it comes to economics , i 'm not disappointed , because i did n't expect too much to begin with , " said paul clemens friedhoff , economics expert for the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" the two partners in this coalition are far from singing the same song . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer spending is going up now , but experts say that will change with the planned vat hike the cdu and spd have managed to agree on a 25-billion euro -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- investment program to jump-start the economy , but critics say the program will be ineffectual come next year when consumer spending is expected to dip due to the cdu 's three-percent increase in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- . no shortage of issues merkel 's coalition will also have to make up its mind on how to regulate the low-wage sector .
a debate about the introduction of a minimum wage for all sectors is in full swing now , but a decision is not expected before the second half of this year . among other economic issues demanding the government 's attention is a corporate tax reform - on the back burner for the moment because the coalition partners can ’ t agree on a sustainable model . there 's also the issue of fresh borrowing .
in 2006 , over 38 billion euros will be added to germany 's pile of debt , with a turnaround on this front only expected in 2007 . a more immediate concern is the current atmosphere of discontent , with tens of thousands of public-sector employees , including garbage collectors , hospital staff and child-care workers on strike all around the country in protest against longer working hours and cuts in bonuses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.03.2006 investing in the future face of automobiles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german car-makers want to make emissions a thing of the past although germany might be lagging a little on the international research and development stage , when it comes to the evolution of the automobile , the nation is keen to be in pole position . in this land of sophisticated motoring and unrestricted freeway speed limits , home to the likes of mercedes , volkswagen , bmw et al . , every seventh job is in some way related to the automobile industry .
as such , it invests more in research and development than any other branch in germany . the development race is a moveable feast , an ongoing process of honing and fine-tuning the already state-of-the-art .
as fashions shift , so too do motorized visions .
the latest comes in the form of a zero-emissions hydrogen-fuelled model , which - although still in its infant stages of development - has already generated a climate of intense competition among the big name manufacturers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling up on a tank load of diesel until the motor of the future is ready to hit the road -lrb- and that is not expected for at least another 15 years -rrb- , the search for alternative sources of fuel will continue . " we spend between 30 and 35 percent of our overall budget on engine technology and fuel , " said volkswagen head of research , franz-josef paefgen .
" we had a look at exactly what we could do with existing technology and our development findings , and realized that over the next few years , europe could replace half its fuel consumption with alternative fuel sources . " long haul there is no doubt , however , that it will take a long time to get away from oil altogether .
there is no single great way to cleaner cars , but a whole host of possibilities which range from the hybrid combustion-electric engine to a mixture of bio fuels . bernd gottschalk , president of the association of the german automobile industry , said they have recognized that so-called " designer fuels , " with biomass or cellulose components , are ideal for future generations of engines . " they are steps towards reducing co2 by 90 percent , which would be a win-win situation for everyone , " gottschalk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new cars wait in line there is not , however , much use in equipping cars with futuristic engines if there are no gas stations for filling up the tank .
in that regard , germany lags miles behind the likes of sweden , which with its 300 gas-ethanol stations has made ford 's flexi-fuel technology the order of the day . as it stands , germany has but one such filling station in the whole country , and although that is clearly not enough , bernhard mattes , head of ford germany , said it is a step in the right direction . " at ford , we invest heavily in research and development because we believe that sustainable mobility can only work if we develop alternative engines , and continue research into driving dynamics and automobile security , " he said . the broader picture but finding a balance between making motoring safer for the environment and those on the roads is a tricky business . thomas weber , a daimlerchrysler board member and head of development at the mercedes car group said environmentally friendly engines and crash structures both make cars heavier . # b # " we know that an additional 20 kilos increases fuel consumption by one percent , so we have to ensure that however innovative the technology , the cars are not too heavy , " weber said .
" if we are clever , we will find a solution to benefit both the environment and the customer . " the race is definitely on .
with the number of cars on the roads expected to double in the next 15 years , manufacturers are not only working against each other , but against the clock to come up with sustainable solutions for generations to come . henrik böhme -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese cars pick up speed in germany even as german automobile manufactures look to china 's millions of people to boost profits , the first chinese cars are rolling down the export ramp and into mercedes and bmw territory .

a question of gender ? britain 's financial times decided to speculate on whether the initial successes of merkel 's chancellorship could be put down to a certain " female touch " she brings to foreign policy .

it commented that " the team around the cdu leader profited to a large extent from the implosion of the red-green coalition in 2005 , and the paralysis that set in after the indecisive election .

" dozens of bouquets have been prepared to mark her 100th day as chancellor , but the only number that seemed to count was the 5,048,000 on the dole , " the paper wrote .
on the domestic front , merkel has changed the law to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 and increase vat by three points , but according to the times , " neither initiative addresses the dilemma of how to translate higher growth - now predicted to be 1.5 percent this year - into jobs .

but now , there 's an expectation that she will transfer this success to the domestic front , and especially the economy , which is sorely in need of sustained growth after years of sub-par performance . merkel could extend her honeymoon with the german people , the pundits say , but only if she can deliver the cuts in unemployment that her government has promised . it 's a tall order .
while current economic data point to a recovery , experts say it 's a shaky one at best . jobless figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : february 's unemployment statistics pointed to a slight recovery february 's jobless figures , released just as merkel celebrated her first 100 days as chancellor , were n't all bad news .
although the unadjusted rate of unemployment showed a 12 percent increase to 5.05 million , when adjusted for seasonal swings , the number of unemployed people fell roughly 5,000 to 4.695 million .
this decrease was less than the fall of 20,000 expected by economists , however . on the plus side , business confidence in germany is at a 14-year high point and consumers are feeling increasingly optimistic as the recovery in the eurozone 's biggest economy gathers pace . still , experts are wary of being overly optimistic , cautioning that the current " feel-good " sentiment had yet to be reflected in real economic data . slow progress ? many observers have voiced fears that the forced political alliance between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will result in stagnation on pressing economic issues . " when it comes to economics , i 'm not disappointed , because i did n't expect too much to begin with , " said paul clemens friedhoff , economics expert for the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" the two partners in this coalition are far from singing the same song . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer spending is going up now , but experts say that will change with the planned vat hike the cdu and spd have managed to agree on a 25-billion euro -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- investment program to jump-start the economy , but critics say the program will be ineffectual come next year when consumer spending is expected to dip due to the cdu 's three-percent increase in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- . no shortage of issues merkel 's coalition will also have to make up its mind on how to regulate the low-wage sector .
a debate about the introduction of a minimum wage for all sectors is in full swing now , but a decision is not expected before the second half of this year . among other economic issues demanding the government 's attention is a corporate tax reform - on the back burner for the moment because the coalition partners can ’ t agree on a sustainable model . there 's also the issue of fresh borrowing .
in 2006 , over 38 billion euros will be added to germany 's pile of debt , with a turnaround on this front only expected in 2007 . a more immediate concern is the current atmosphere of discontent , with tens of thousands of public-sector employees , including garbage collectors , hospital staff and child-care workers on strike all around the country in protest against longer working hours and cuts in bonuses . " if we are seeing a recovery in germany it is not a very strong one , " said adam posen , an economist at the institute for international economics in washington .

there have been more than 100 cases of h5n1-infected wild birds found in germany . the finding could increase concern that the virus could spread to other species in europe as it has in several cases in other parts of the world . " it has been known for some time that cats can become infected by eating infected birds , " thomas mettenleiter , president of the institute , told reuters . several large cats in asian zoos have died after being fed infected birds and domestic cats have been shown to be especially vulnerable to the disease , the institute said . the h5n1 strain , which has caused illness and even fatalities in humans in turkey and asia , has been detected in a leopard , tigers , civet cats and two domestic cats in thailand .
but the world health organization said in 2004 that the infection of cats was unlikely to enhance the risks to humans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers gather dead birds on the island of rügen the the federal research institute for animal health has called on cat owners on the german island to keep their animals away from the area where the infection seems to be centered and to take special hygenic precautions . " a transmission , which can not be completely ruled out , would only be possible through very intimate contact with an infected animal , " said mettenleiter . further spread among birds in the bird population , the disease was spreading further across europe and africa . france began vaccinating 700,000 domestic ducks and geese on farms after it announced at the weekend the first outbreak of h5n1 bird flu in a european union poultry farm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wild geese fly over a decontamination area in eastern france the commercial repercussions of the french outbreak were driven home tuesday as the government announced that some 30 countries were now restricting or banning imports of poultry and poultry products from france . sweden for the first time detected in ducks an unidentified strain of bird flu , feared to be the h5n1 strain . initial tests at sweden 's the national veterinary institute " show that we 're probably talking about the same virus that has been spreading in russia and china , " said the swedish agriculture board . elsewhere , h5n1 was detected for the first time in bosnia , the southern german state of bavaria and a poultry farm in southwestern russia where 103,000 birds were reported to have died in a week . britain said it was unlikely to escape .
" i would anticipate that avian flu will arrive at some point in the uk , " said british chief scientific advisor professor sir david king , predicting that the disease would stay for at least five years . " we are talking about the possibility of this disease being endemic here in the uk as it did in china .
it is a long-term factor , " he told the bbc . africa but world experts fretted mostly about africa , where many countries are ill equipped to detect or impede the spread of the disease . ethiopian officials were testing some of more than 6,000 chickens that died suddenly on a poultry farm in endibir 175 kilometers -lrb- 108 miles -rrb- southwest of addis ababa .

becoming germany 's first female leader was not easy , but angela merkel has already carved her name high up in the popularity stakes . the grand coalition has been in office for a full 100 days , which means the period of grace traditionally granted a new government , is officially over .
but with the german public appearing more than willing to continue supporting the conservative cdu / csu and social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- alliance , that is of little relevance .
angela merkel is enjoying massive popularity and opinion polls suggest that her party is steaming ahead of their coalition partner , the spd . but at the federal elections last september , the picture was quite different .
the two main parties were unable to beat each other , and the results of the ballot made it impossible for either the cdu / csu to form a coalition with the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- or for the spd-green alliance to continue running the country .
the additional parliamentary presence of the left party meant the only alternative was to form a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder fought it out for the top spot and that very coalition , so it turns out , is what the majority of german voters wanted .
in it , they see the possibility of fulfilled expectations and greater harmony .
on the latter point , with coalition partners who treat one another with care and are quick to resolve budding disputes , the electorate can be satisfied . yet , on the former , expectations regarding unemployment reduction remain unfulfilled .
there is also reason to believe that the two sides will clash over continued welfare and health reforms . showing germany 's new face abroad on the international stage , merkel made a good first impression .
she breezed confidently through her debut visits to paris , london and washington , but they were not meant to serve as opportunities to iron out any serious conflicts of interest .
merkel has not yet shown what position she will take on washington 's stance on the iranian nuclear program .
and although the new german leader 's appearance at the eu budget summit met with applause , it 's not entirely clear to what extent that was the result of her financial generosity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vice chancellor and labor minister , franz müntefering meanwhile , the grand coalition is an acid test for the social democrats who are trying to profile themselves .
thus far , labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering has been viewed as the spd heavyweight in the cabinet , but he is not coordinating well with the new party head , matthias platzeck , and internal conflicts could become a problem for the coalition . although on the whole germany 's grand coalition conveys a stable impression , keeping it up depends on how much space the two partners have for profiling themselves .
merkel is making something of a name for herself as a leader who moderates discussions without clearly stating her position .

but now , there 's an expectation that she will transfer this success to the domestic front , and especially the economy , which is sorely in need of sustained growth after years of sub-par performance . merkel could extend her honeymoon with the german people , the pundits say , but only if she can deliver the cuts in unemployment that her government has promised . it 's a tall order .

" from warsaw to london and davos , in jerusalem and ramallah , merkel succeeded in combining the diplomatic inheritance of her mentor , helmut kohl , with that of her predecessor , gerhard schröder - the european and atlantic tradition of the one , and the defense of national interests of the other , " the paper commented .
a question of gender ? britain 's financial times decided to speculate on whether the initial successes of merkel 's chancellorship could be put down to a certain " female touch " she brings to foreign policy .
well aware that such a hypothesis could be thrown out by some as " thinly veiled discrimination , " the paper nonetheless made a case for its assumption , arguing : " after all , she visited president george w. bush in washington to relaunch a productive german-american relationship but uttered clear words on the need to close down the guantanamo prison .
she decided not to embrace -lrb- nor kiss à la gerhard schröder -rrb- vladimir putin , russia 's president , and sent strong signals to hamas .
from these initial - and very successful - moves we may draw two rules that seem to apply to ms. merkel 's ' female ' foreign policy : firm but sober on principles , tough but patient on implementation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a less-than-flattering view of merkel 's relationship with the us administration the swiss paper der bund took a closer look at what 's behind the praise being heaped on the merkel administration , and found that the positive reviews are deceptive .
it commented that " the team around the cdu leader profited to a large extent from the implosion of the red-green coalition in 2005 , and the paralysis that set in after the indecisive election .
compared to that uncertainty , the unspectacular but solidly working government is a boon , no matter whether or not you agree with what it 's doing . "
but the paper feared that this would not be enough in the long run , and predicted that merkel - who it described as more of a social democrat in some points than the social democrats themselves - risks frustrating her grand coalition partners . the paris-based paper libération also foresaw difficulties for merkel in the future , mainly because , as it commented , " she has not even had to get to grips with the bigger stones lying in her path . "
everyone 's waiting for merkel to tackle issues such as unemployment and the financing of health care - issues where the cdu and the spd do not at all see eye to eye , the paper wrote . unemployment the true test britain 's the times , however , said that merkel 's aura has already begun to fade , and predicted that the issue of unemployment will be her undoing .
" dozens of bouquets have been prepared to mark her 100th day as chancellor , but the only number that seemed to count was the 5,048,000 on the dole , " the paper wrote .
on the domestic front , merkel has changed the law to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 and increase vat by three points , but according to the times , " neither initiative addresses the dilemma of how to translate higher growth - now predicted to be 1.5 percent this year - into jobs . " but the belgian paper la libre belgique thought that the honeymoon could continue , just a little longer .
" even critical observers admit that she 's not made a single faux pas , " the paper commented .
" it 's gone on for so long as to have almost become boring .

as such , it invests more in research and development than any other branch in germany . the development race is a moveable feast , an ongoing process of honing and fine-tuning the already state-of-the-art .
as fashions shift , so too do motorized visions .
the latest comes in the form of a zero-emissions hydrogen-fuelled model , which - although still in its infant stages of development - has already generated a climate of intense competition among the big name manufacturers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling up on a tank load of diesel until the motor of the future is ready to hit the road -lrb- and that is not expected for at least another 15 years -rrb- , the search for alternative sources of fuel will continue . " we spend between 30 and 35 percent of our overall budget on engine technology and fuel , " said volkswagen head of research , franz-josef paefgen .
" we had a look at exactly what we could do with existing technology and our development findings , and realized that over the next few years , europe could replace half its fuel consumption with alternative fuel sources . " long haul there is no doubt , however , that it will take a long time to get away from oil altogether .
there is no single great way to cleaner cars , but a whole host of possibilities which range from the hybrid combustion-electric engine to a mixture of bio fuels . bernd gottschalk , president of the association of the german automobile industry , said they have recognized that so-called " designer fuels , " with biomass or cellulose components , are ideal for future generations of engines . " they are steps towards reducing co2 by 90 percent , which would be a win-win situation for everyone , " gottschalk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new cars wait in line there is not , however , much use in equipping cars with futuristic engines if there are no gas stations for filling up the tank .
in that regard , germany lags miles behind the likes of sweden , which with its 300 gas-ethanol stations has made ford 's flexi-fuel technology the order of the day . as it stands , germany has but one such filling station in the whole country , and although that is clearly not enough , bernhard mattes , head of ford germany , said it is a step in the right direction . " at ford , we invest heavily in research and development because we believe that sustainable mobility can only work if we develop alternative engines , and continue research into driving dynamics and automobile security , " he said . the broader picture but finding a balance between making motoring safer for the environment and those on the roads is a tricky business . thomas weber , a daimlerchrysler board member and head of development at the mercedes car group said environmentally friendly engines and crash structures both make cars heavier . # b # " we know that an additional 20 kilos increases fuel consumption by one percent , so we have to ensure that however innovative the technology , the cars are not too heavy , " weber said .
" if we are clever , we will find a solution to benefit both the environment and the customer . " the race is definitely on .
with the number of cars on the roads expected to double in the next 15 years , manufacturers are not only working against each other , but against the clock to come up with sustainable solutions for generations to come . henrik böhme -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese cars pick up speed in germany even as german automobile manufactures look to china 's millions of people to boost profits , the first chinese cars are rolling down the export ramp and into mercedes and bmw territory .

but now , there 's an expectation that she will transfer this success to the domestic front , and especially the economy , which is sorely in need of sustained growth after years of sub-par performance . merkel could extend her honeymoon with the german people , the pundits say , but only if she can deliver the cuts in unemployment that her government has promised . it 's a tall order .
while current economic data point to a recovery , experts say it 's a shaky one at best . jobless figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : february 's unemployment statistics pointed to a slight recovery february 's jobless figures , released just as merkel celebrated her first 100 days as chancellor , were n't all bad news .
although the unadjusted rate of unemployment showed a 12 percent increase to 5.05 million , when adjusted for seasonal swings , the number of unemployed people fell roughly 5,000 to 4.695 million .
this decrease was less than the fall of 20,000 expected by economists , however . on the plus side , business confidence in germany is at a 14-year high point and consumers are feeling increasingly optimistic as the recovery in the eurozone 's biggest economy gathers pace . still , experts are wary of being overly optimistic , cautioning that the current " feel-good " sentiment had yet to be reflected in real economic data . slow progress ? many observers have voiced fears that the forced political alliance between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will result in stagnation on pressing economic issues . " when it comes to economics , i 'm not disappointed , because i did n't expect too much to begin with , " said paul clemens friedhoff , economics expert for the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" the two partners in this coalition are far from singing the same song . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer spending is going up now , but experts say that will change with the planned vat hike the cdu and spd have managed to agree on a 25-billion euro -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- investment program to jump-start the economy , but critics say the program will be ineffectual come next year when consumer spending is expected to dip due to the cdu 's three-percent increase in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- . no shortage of issues merkel 's coalition will also have to make up its mind on how to regulate the low-wage sector .
a debate about the introduction of a minimum wage for all sectors is in full swing now , but a decision is not expected before the second half of this year . among other economic issues demanding the government 's attention is a corporate tax reform - on the back burner for the moment because the coalition partners can ’ t agree on a sustainable model . there 's also the issue of fresh borrowing .
in 2006 , over 38 billion euros will be added to germany 's pile of debt , with a turnaround on this front only expected in 2007 . a more immediate concern is the current atmosphere of discontent , with tens of thousands of public-sector employees , including garbage collectors , hospital staff and child-care workers on strike all around the country in protest against longer working hours and cuts in bonuses . " if we are seeing a recovery in germany it is not a very strong one , " said adam posen , an economist at the institute for international economics in washington .

they say that there were two german agents in baghdad .
there are so many details here that , while i ca n't personally say with 100 percent confidence that they 're right or wrong , i do think that the report on its face appears to be highly credible and warrants more scrutiny and investigation than i think has been carried out so far . dw-radio : how did you end up with this report ? i certainly did n't set out to report on germany .

the body called for new laws to control spies . in a report examining the possible role of european countries in the alleged illegal cia transfer of terrorist suspects and secret detentions , the council of europe criticized its member states for a lack of legislative control of foreign secret services operating on their territory . " it would appear that most of europe is a happy hunting ground for foreign security services , " secretary general terry davis told a news conference after the report 's release at the body 's headquarters in the french city of strasbourg .
" hardly any country has any legal provisions to ensure an effective oversight over the activities of foreign security services on their territory . " the report did not produce evidence that the us had run secret jails in europe .
however , it called for better oversight and regulation by national parliaments and judicial bodies when human rights abuses were suspected and better controls of foreign intelligence services .
" europe 's skies appear to be excessively open , " davis said .
" very few countries seem to have adopted an adequate and effective way to monitor who and what is transiting through their airports and airspace .
indeed , no member state appears to have established any kind of procedure in order to assess whether civil aircraft are used for purposes which would be incompatible with internationally recognized human rights standards . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in europe , only hungary has effective laws to monitor foreign secret services , davis said " this is alarming because the explanations provided on the specific point of controls over aircraft allegedly used for rendition show that existing procedures do not provide adequate safeguards against abuse , " he said .
lack of cooperation davis also criticized four of the council 's 46 members - italy , bosnia-herzegovina , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , and poland - for their inadequate response to the body 's investigation into cia renditions .
he said he would continue probing those countries .
he praised germany , saying that of the four countries whose responses he had been most concerned to receive due to possible events there , it was the only one that had responded expansively to the questionnaire sent to the member states . davis ' is one of two investigations into the issue of cia rendition and secret jails that the council is carrying out .

one gets the impression that the government has made a better impression than was once expected . klaus detterbeck : i think so too .
surveys regarding angela merkel and the christian democrats are good right now .
there are two reasons for this relatively good start for the grand coalition .
first , there have been successes , like chancellor merkel 's trip to the us , to russia and at the eu summit , as well as some overall positive economic developments .
secondly , the populace has given the chancellor something of an advance when it comes to trust .

that has to do with chancellor merkel 's role as a director .
she is not a big personality out front , who calls all the shots .

in the grand coalition , she is engaging in the politics of inclusion .

what about when she has to get down to the nitty-gritty ? one of her strengths is her ability to hold the two camps together .

on the other hand , people still are n't sure what this party actually stands for .

western classical music is rising fast - and germany has plans to get in on the ground floor of a huge culture market . in the booming southern chinese province of guangdong , the world 's largest piano factory , pearl river , is planning to roll out its one-millionth instrument this march .
china does n't just build pianos , though .
it plays them - sometimes on the world stage . that was n't always the case .
young chinese virtuosos like lang lang have had international success in recent years , but western music first entered chinese concert halls in the 1980s , after the country relaxed controls on its economy .
now , those chinese who can afford it make sure their only child learns a western music instrument . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese piano virtuoso lang lang as part of the trend , the popularity of classical music is soaring in china .
mozart , whose 250th anniversary is being celebrated throughout the world in 2006 , is currently high on the list of most-beloved western composers . this interest in european music has not gone unnoticed by the german music council , germany 's largest umbrella association for music .
the council 's president , martin krüger , recently visited china , with the aim of improving musical ties between the two countries . wagner 's ' ring ' in china german music has been particularly popular in china recently .
in october , 2005 , the staatstheater nuremberg performed richard wagner 's monumental ring cycle in its entirety .
the stuttgart radio orchestra was featured at the beijing music festival , as was the berlin symphonic orchestra , which also went on to perform in shanghai . according to krüger , talks between the german music council and its chinese equivalent were fruitful , especially on the topic of an exchange program between the two nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right now , austrian composer mozart is big in china " our current plan is nothing new .
the special part is that it is taking place at an official , national level , " krüger said .
" questions of protocol play a big role in china . " improving musical ties now , the german music council has named a german-trained chinese musician , yang lin , to represent the council in china .
the main goal of the cooperation is to improve musical ties between the two countries .
to this end , it has already set up a few joint projects , including agreeing to form a german-chinese ensemble that would play at appropriate occasions - for example , the opening of the chinese cultural center in berlin .
and with a german-chinese year of culture planned for 2007 , the groups also planned to create a joint youth symphony orchestra . matthias von hein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sino-german pop walks on the wild side ever heard a german band singing beatles hits in chinese ?

on the contrary , harmony is the watchword so far .
political scientist klaus detterbeck looks back and ahead . dw-world : the grand coalition 's grace period - its first hundred days - is now over .
one gets the impression that the government has made a better impression than was once expected . klaus detterbeck : i think so too .
surveys regarding angela merkel and the christian democrats are good right now .
there are two reasons for this relatively good start for the grand coalition .
first , there have been successes , like chancellor merkel 's trip to the us , to russia and at the eu summit , as well as some overall positive economic developments .
secondly , the populace has given the chancellor something of an advance when it comes to trust .
people are willing to give this coalition some time to find its footing .
a majority of people have the feeling that a solid , capable team is at the helm , as opposed to that of the last schröder government . so are the individuals in the government less important than the " team " as a whole ? yes , you could say that .
that has to do with chancellor merkel 's role as a director .
she is not a big personality out front , who calls all the shots .
rather she 's the person who steers the entire team .
that makes her different than schröder , who was something of a showman who pranced on the political stage . despite the laurels , has the country really progressed toward finding solutions to some of its problems ? it 's true that there have been no big decisions made as yet .
there is this positive impression , a positive undertone , but the real foundation for new policies has n't yet been laid .
negotiations still have to take place about federalism reform , and other big reform projects have yet to be tackled . angela merkel enjoys a good deal of sympathy from journalists of all stripes .
she is also respected by foreign leaders .
what is different about her ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular with journalists these days she leaves the impression of being someone who does solid work and does n't push her way to the front .
instead , she tries to enact good policies for the good of the country .
in the grand coalition , she is engaging in the politics of inclusion .
that 's to her great credit . will she be successful if she continues to follow this strategy ?
what about when she has to get down to the nitty-gritty ? one of her strengths is her ability to hold the two camps together .
but in fact , this advantage could turn into a disadvantage if it comes time to make difficult decisions and she finds it hard to assert her authority , depending on a consensus for decisions . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have lost popularity among voters .
does the party have the wrong party chairman or is its strategy faulty ? the spd has two problems .
for one , they have the rather " unpleasant " ministries : -lrb- franz -rrb- müntefering at labor and -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrück at finance .
on the other hand , people still are n't sure what this party actually stands for .
is it a reform party , which is how it 's been seen over the past few years under schröder ?
or is it headed back in a more traditional , union-oriented direction ?
-lrb- matthias -rrb- platzeck is still not in the position to explain where the party should go from here and it 's hurting because of that . let 's look at the opposition .
does one actually still exist and if so , is it able to attract any attention to itself ? it 's true that the opposition parties have problems finding an audience .
the left party is mostly concerned with itself these days ; the greens have n't found their direction yet ; and the free democrats are having a hard time making their mark .
these are tough times for the smaller parties .

becoming germany 's first female leader was not easy , but angela merkel has already carved her name high up in the popularity stakes . the grand coalition has been in office for a full 100 days , which means the period of grace traditionally granted a new government , is officially over .
but with the german public appearing more than willing to continue supporting the conservative cdu / csu and social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- alliance , that is of little relevance .
angela merkel is enjoying massive popularity and opinion polls suggest that her party is steaming ahead of their coalition partner , the spd . but at the federal elections last september , the picture was quite different .
the two main parties were unable to beat each other , and the results of the ballot made it impossible for either the cdu / csu to form a coalition with the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- or for the spd-green alliance to continue running the country .
the additional parliamentary presence of the left party meant the only alternative was to form a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder fought it out for the top spot and that very coalition , so it turns out , is what the majority of german voters wanted .
in it , they see the possibility of fulfilled expectations and greater harmony .
on the latter point , with coalition partners who treat one another with care and are quick to resolve budding disputes , the electorate can be satisfied . yet , on the former , expectations regarding unemployment reduction remain unfulfilled .
there is also reason to believe that the two sides will clash over continued welfare and health reforms . showing germany 's new face abroad on the international stage , merkel made a good first impression .
she breezed confidently through her debut visits to paris , london and washington , but they were not meant to serve as opportunities to iron out any serious conflicts of interest .
merkel has not yet shown what position she will take on washington 's stance on the iranian nuclear program .
and although the new german leader 's appearance at the eu budget summit met with applause , it 's not entirely clear to what extent that was the result of her financial generosity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vice chancellor and labor minister , franz müntefering meanwhile , the grand coalition is an acid test for the social democrats who are trying to profile themselves .
thus far , labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering has been viewed as the spd heavyweight in the cabinet , but he is not coordinating well with the new party head , matthias platzeck , and internal conflicts could become a problem for the coalition . although on the whole germany 's grand coalition conveys a stable impression , keeping it up depends on how much space the two partners have for profiling themselves .
merkel is making something of a name for herself as a leader who moderates discussions without clearly stating her position .
for the chancellor of a grand coalition that could be a good technique , but the question is whether it is sustainable beyond regional elections at the end of march . heinz dylong -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de refining merkel 's makeover angela merkel has come a long way from fashion fiasco to chic chancellor .

the body called for new laws to control spies . in a report examining the possible role of european countries in the alleged illegal cia transfer of terrorist suspects and secret detentions , the council of europe criticized its member states for a lack of legislative control of foreign secret services operating on their territory . " it would appear that most of europe is a happy hunting ground for foreign security services , " secretary general terry davis told a news conference after the report 's release at the body 's headquarters in the french city of strasbourg .

however , it called for better oversight and regulation by national parliaments and judicial bodies when human rights abuses were suspected and better controls of foreign intelligence services .

he said he would continue probing those countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.03.2006 " the account of the german role was explicit " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did german intelligence help the us topple saddam hussein ?
the new york times web site reported this week that german agents provided us intelligence with an iraqi defense plan shortly before the us-led invasion .
dw-radio spoke to michael r. gordon , who broke the scoop . michael r. gordon : i did n't produce the american military report .
i faithfully quoted and presented the quotes in the report .
they 're in my book , " cobra ii : the inside story of the invasion and occupation of iraq , " and they 're on the website of the new york times , presented exactly as they are in that report . what strikes me is that the account of the german role is so specific and the description of the institutional arrangements they describe of the german intelligence liaison officer in qatar .
they describe him handing off a document to a defense intelligence agency official .
they say that there were two german agents in baghdad .
there are so many details here that , while i ca n't personally say with 100 percent confidence that they 're right or wrong , i do think that the report on its face appears to be highly credible and warrants more scrutiny and investigation than i think has been carried out so far . dw-radio : how did you end up with this report ? i certainly did n't set out to report on germany .
i have been working on a book on iraq for the last two years .
in the process of working on this book , i was very interested in the research that the american military had done on their iraqi counterparts .
after every war , militaries study the foe and try to figure out what the other guy was doing while they were fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militaries regularly review past actions to learn from them as i accessed a report on this , i saw that there was a very detailed discussion of saddam 's plans to defend baghdad and the pros and cons of saddam 's plan .
and in this section of the report , there was a bit of an aside which explained how this scheme for the defense of baghdad came to the attention of the united states central command , which was general tommy franks ' command .
and in no uncertain terms , this report said that the sketch of the defense arrangements for the defense of baghdad was supplied by a german liaison officer in qatar , and that he gave it to a member of the united states defense intelligence agency who worked in general franks ' headquarters . that caught my attention .
i was really struck by how explicit the account was of the german role and how detailed it was . you 've heard no doubt that a lot of people in germany are saying this was a so-called targeted leak designed to punish the previous german administration for opposing the iraq war .
what is your response ? that was certainly not my intention , nor the intention of anybody who provided access to this .
again , this is a study that i accessed not to learn about germany but to learn about what the iraqis were up to , and which i accessed some months ago .
the german portion of this report is rather small . the reason that this is coming out now is my book is coming out in march .
since completing my book leave i 've returned to the new york times , and i 've begun to harvest the material in the book and make it available to the times ' readers .
if i 'd finished my book a little earlier , it would have come out a few months ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us agents could have been inserted into the embassies of allies ' in baghdad , gordon said this type of cooperation - passing information back and forth - is this at all unusual among intelligence services ? i think it 's entirely understandable and not surprising .
intelligence agencies have relationships which continue despite political problems between capitals , and that 's because the services need to work together even after their regimes change .
in the case of iraq , the united states really did n't have very good intelligence - this i think ought to be clear , i mean , there was no wmd , the us was wrong on that .
and it 's a matter of public record that the united states did n't have a single spy in iraq with direct access to iraq 's wmd programs .
nor was the intelligence on the south particularly good .
it 'd be quite understandable that the americans would want to rely on those allies , such as germany , which did have an embassy in baghdad and therefore the capacity to insert agents under diplomatic cover .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael gordon , a new york times reporter embedded with coalition forces at camp doha , kuwait nor do i find it surprising that the german government has acknowledged it did provide some limited support to the american military .
despite its opposition to the war , germany did nothing to obstruct the american military preparations and indirectly helped in a number of ways : safeguarding sea lanes , facilitating the transport of american forces from germany that fought in the war , providing troops in kuwait to protect kuwaiti citizens against chemical weapons attacks , not objecting to nato efforts to send awacs or patriot missile defense interceptors to turkey . germany 's posture was basically : they were n't going to too directly assist the war effort , but they were n't going to frustrate it either . steve zwick interviewed michael r. gordon -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : who 's taking aim at berlin ?
a news report claiming german secret agents gave the us iraq 's war plans has drawn indignant denials from both berlin and washington .
dw 's daniel scheschkewitz believes the leak must have been carefully planned .
-lrb- feb .
28 , 2006 -rrb- germany denies giving baghdad defense plan to us a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq .

instead , it has raised more questions than it answered .

germany ordered cats to be kept indoors and dogs on leashes in five states hit by bird flu . after the deadly bird flu was found to have killed a cat on the german baltic sea island of rügen , where the virus was first detected in the country , consumer protection agency officials said cats must be kept indoors , and dogs on leashes . the government said the order would take effect immediately in a radius of three kilometers -lrb- 1.8 miles -rrb- of all areas where infected wild birds have been found . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when outdoors , cats may look for birds so far , the flu has been found in bavaria , baden-württemberg , brandenburg , schleswig-holstein , and mecklenburg-western pomerania . crisis team meeti n g the cat , which authorities said was a stray , was found on the baltic sea island of rügen , where the deadly h5n1 was detected in birds earlier this month .
it was the first case in germany of the bird flu being transmitted to a mammal . meanwhile , a government crisis team continued to meet in berlin , to discuss measures against the deadliest form of the virus . who : ' no i n creased huma n threat ' the cat grabbed the headlines in several countries in europe , but the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- in geneva said it did not increase the threat to human health from the virus .
since late 2003 , 93 people have died from bird flu , but they have contracted the virus from contact with infected birds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dead cat on rügen was said to be a stray " there is no present evidence that domestic cats play a role in the transmission cycle of h5n1 viruses .
to date , no human case has been linked to exposure to a diseased cat , " it said .
" unlike the case in domestic and wild birds , there is no evidence that domestic cats are a reservoir of the virus . " bird flu has killed or led to the culling of some 200 million birds since it re-emerged in asia in late 2003 .
the real fear for human health is that the virus will mutate into a form that passes easily from person to person , sparking a pandemic in which millions could die . representatives of german state and local governments today agreed in a telephone conference to examine dead mammals found in areas already known to contain the h5n1 virus , or those where deaths seem suspicious . bird lockdow n could drag o n but they recommended against vaccinating house cats , saying it was not target-oriented enough , since there is no appropriate vaccination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers in protective clothing combed the island of rügen for dead fowl meanwhile , germany 's agriculture ministry has said germany may be forced to keep domesticated birds enclosed through april . " we may have no choice , if the flu keeps raging beyond the migration period , " said agriculture secretary gert lindemann , who is heading up the task force that met in berlin wednesday . a n imal supporters war n of pa n ic the german animal protection league warned of an unnecessary panic outbreak .
cats do not need to be kept indoors germany-wide , they said in a statement , but in areas where the bird flu has already been found , owners should keep close watch over their animals . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu jumps to cat in germany a dead cat in germany has tested positive for the h5n1 type of bird flu in the first case in the country of the virus spreading from birds to mammals , the national veterinary laboratory said on wednesday .

the real fear for human health is that the virus will mutate into a form that passes easily from person to person , sparking a pandemic in which millions could die . representatives of german state and local governments today agreed in a telephone conference to examine dead mammals found in areas already known to contain the h5n1 virus , or those where deaths seem suspicious . bird lockdow n could drag o n but they recommended against vaccinating house cats , saying it was not target-oriented enough , since there is no appropriate vaccination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers in protective clothing combed the island of rügen for dead fowl meanwhile , germany 's agriculture ministry has said germany may be forced to keep domesticated birds enclosed through april .

the body called for new laws to control spies . in a report examining the possible role of european countries in the alleged illegal cia transfer of terrorist suspects and secret detentions , the council of europe criticized its member states for a lack of legislative control of foreign secret services operating on their territory . " it would appear that most of europe is a happy hunting ground for foreign security services , " secretary general terry davis told a news conference after the report 's release at the body 's headquarters in the french city of strasbourg .
" hardly any country has any legal provisions to ensure an effective oversight over the activities of foreign security services on their territory . " the report did not produce evidence that the us had run secret jails in europe .
however , it called for better oversight and regulation by national parliaments and judicial bodies when human rights abuses were suspected and better controls of foreign intelligence services .
" europe 's skies appear to be excessively open , " davis said .
" very few countries seem to have adopted an adequate and effective way to monitor who and what is transiting through their airports and airspace .
indeed , no member state appears to have established any kind of procedure in order to assess whether civil aircraft are used for purposes which would be incompatible with internationally recognized human rights standards . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in europe , only hungary has effective laws to monitor foreign secret services , davis said " this is alarming because the explanations provided on the specific point of controls over aircraft allegedly used for rendition show that existing procedures do not provide adequate safeguards against abuse , " he said .
lack of cooperation davis also criticized four of the council 's 46 members - italy , bosnia-herzegovina , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , and poland - for their inadequate response to the body 's investigation into cia renditions .
he said he would continue probing those countries .
he praised germany , saying that of the four countries whose responses he had been most concerned to receive due to possible events there , it was the only one that had responded expansively to the questionnaire sent to the member states . davis ' is one of two investigations into the issue of cia rendition and secret jails that the council is carrying out .

as such , it invests more in research and development than any other branch in germany . the development race is a moveable feast , an ongoing process of honing and fine-tuning the already state-of-the-art .
as fashions shift , so too do motorized visions .
the latest comes in the form of a zero-emissions hydrogen-fuelled model , which - although still in its infant stages of development - has already generated a climate of intense competition among the big name manufacturers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling up on a tank load of diesel until the motor of the future is ready to hit the road -lrb- and that is not expected for at least another 15 years -rrb- , the search for alternative sources of fuel will continue . " we spend between 30 and 35 percent of our overall budget on engine technology and fuel , " said volkswagen head of research , franz-josef paefgen .
" we had a look at exactly what we could do with existing technology and our development findings , and realized that over the next few years , europe could replace half its fuel consumption with alternative fuel sources . " long haul there is no doubt , however , that it will take a long time to get away from oil altogether .
there is no single great way to cleaner cars , but a whole host of possibilities which range from the hybrid combustion-electric engine to a mixture of bio fuels . bernd gottschalk , president of the association of the german automobile industry , said they have recognized that so-called " designer fuels , " with biomass or cellulose components , are ideal for future generations of engines . " they are steps towards reducing co2 by 90 percent , which would be a win-win situation for everyone , " gottschalk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new cars wait in line there is not , however , much use in equipping cars with futuristic engines if there are no gas stations for filling up the tank .
in that regard , germany lags miles behind the likes of sweden , which with its 300 gas-ethanol stations has made ford 's flexi-fuel technology the order of the day . as it stands , germany has but one such filling station in the whole country , and although that is clearly not enough , bernhard mattes , head of ford germany , said it is a step in the right direction . " at ford , we invest heavily in research and development because we believe that sustainable mobility can only work if we develop alternative engines , and continue research into driving dynamics and automobile security , " he said . the broader picture but finding a balance between making motoring safer for the environment and those on the roads is a tricky business . thomas weber , a daimlerchrysler board member and head of development at the mercedes car group said environmentally friendly engines and crash structures both make cars heavier . # b # " we know that an additional 20 kilos increases fuel consumption by one percent , so we have to ensure that however innovative the technology , the cars are not too heavy , " weber said .
" if we are clever , we will find a solution to benefit both the environment and the customer . " the race is definitely on .
with the number of cars on the roads expected to double in the next 15 years , manufacturers are not only working against each other , but against the clock to come up with sustainable solutions for generations to come . henrik böhme -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese cars pick up speed in germany even as german automobile manufactures look to china 's millions of people to boost profits , the first chinese cars are rolling down the export ramp and into mercedes and bmw territory .

european soccer superpowers italy and germany are preparing for wednesday 's friendly that will help gauge their world cup preparedness .
with three world cup wins apiece , they are both among the tournament favorites . italy coach marcello lippi is relishing the opportunity to pit his wits against the tournament hosts .
" they are a great team with a wonderful history , and as hosts of the world cup they are very ambitious , " he said .
" for us it 's one of the last real tests before we fly out to germany , one that we hope will build our confidence . " lippi added that he hoped the italy fans would get behind his team at the artemio franchi stadium , home of serie a side fiorentina .
" we are playing in florence where the people are passionate about soccer and a lot will depend on their support . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a young side " germany coach jürgen klinsmann is playing down his side 's chances of victory in wednesday 's match .
" italy have quality in every position , and lippi 's squad is more mature and more experienced than ours , " said the 41-year-old , who took control of germany in july 2004 .
" they have a team full of champions while we are a young side looking for its identity , one that plays aggressive , attacking soccer . " restructuring italian squad klinsmann expressed his sadness over the injury to italy 's talismanic number 10 francesco totti , whose chances of featuring in germany are hanging in the balance after he broke a bone in his left leg . " i 'm sad to see him injured , he 's an exceptional player , " he said .
" however , alessandro del piero can replace him or lippi can change his system .
he has players who can adapt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian soccer star , francesco totti the last time germany saw off one of the game 's so-called soccer heavyweights was back in october 2000 , when they beat england 1-0 in a 2002 world cup qualifier , and klinsmann is desperate to put that right .
" we want to put an end to our negative run against big name opposition , " he said . drawing on klinsmann 's experience klinsmann knows what it takes to unlock an italian defense having played for inter milan from 1989 to 1992 .
he scored 36 goals and helped inter win the uefa cup in 1991 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team coach , jürgen klinsmann germany 's first-choice goalkeeper oliver kahn has been ruled out due to a thigh strain , so arsenal 's jens lehmann will deputize , while stuttgart keeper timo hildebrand will act as lehmann 's understudy .
with italy 's left-sided defender gianluca zambrotta unavailable , fiorentina defender manuel pasqual could make his first appearance for italy in front of his home crowd . wednesday 's match revives memories of the classic 1982 world cup final in spain which italy won 3-1 .

matters worsened for the visitors three minutes later . del piero 's quickly-taken free-kick surprised the german back four and sent gilardino racing clear towards goal .
the 23-year-old ac milan striker looked up and unselfishly slid the ball across to give toni a tap-in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luca toni celebrated after just seven minutes italy might have had a third moments later when del piero 's crossed free-kick found gilardino unmarked , but he failed by just a few inches to make a connection . germany then sliced italy open with their first genuine attack , but gianluigi buffon pulled off a superb save to keep out sebastian deisler 's vicious drive . de rossi made it 3-0 in the 39th minute , applying the finishing touch to mauro camoranesi 's cross as the german defense suffered another alarming lapse in concentration . " it 's i n explicable " limiting the damage was germany 's task now , but they leaked another goal in the 56th minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniele de rossi -lrb- right -rrb- and robert huth -lrb- left -rrb- gilardino 's cross from the left was headed back across goal by camoranesi and del piero dived low to head past a helpless lehmann . huth 's late strike was of little consolation for the poor germans . " it 's inexplicable how one can fall back so quickly , " said german captain michael ballack , who added that italy 's early lead had made his team insecure .
" the mistakes we made were punished hard .
thankfully there will be another match in three weeks and then it 's going to be a different german national team . " national coach jürgen klinsmann also said that he still had high hopes for his team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann " of course we 're disappointed - we had high hopes and there were smashed within the first minutes , " said german national coach jürgen klinsmann .
" it was a frustrating lesson for us , but we believe in this team and we believe in the young players .
we 're confident that everything will work in 100 days . " but the weak performance had commentators worried about the team 's readiness to succeed in the world cup this summer at home . " if the italians were to really go for it , germany would look even worse , " said reinhold beckmann , the match 's commentator for german public broadcaster ard .
" the real question is whether the german team is just too young . " the team still has three chances to prove that it is ready for the world cup .
on march 22 , it will face the us , followed by matches against japan on may 30 and colombia on june 2 . the german team opens the world cup on june 9 against costa rica . hooliga n s n ot impressed by pope 's appeal before the match , a message by pope benedict xvi called for an end to racist chanting and emblems at football matches and urged football fans to adopt " respect and dialogue " ahead of this summer 's world cup in his native germany . both nations ' football authorities had dedicated the match to opposing all forms of racial violence .
racism has been a serious problem in italy 's elite seria a league this season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-born pope got a world cup pennant from german soccer legend franz beckenbauer last october the 78-year-old pontiff said he appreciated the initiative to combat racial discrimination , which he said would " consolidate awareness of the important educative function of sport in the service of solidarity and peace . " but before the match , german and italian hooligans tried to start a fight and fired off signal rockets .

germany ordered cats to be kept indoors and dogs on leashes in five states hit by bird flu . after the deadly bird flu was found to have killed a cat on the german baltic sea island of rügen , where the virus was first detected in the country , consumer protection agency officials said cats must be kept indoors , and dogs on leashes . the government said the order would take effect immediately in a radius of three kilometers -lrb- 1.8 miles -rrb- of all areas where infected wild birds have been found . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when outdoors , cats may look for birds so far , the flu has been found in bavaria , baden-württemberg , brandenburg , schleswig-holstein , and mecklenburg-western pomerania . crisis team meeti n g the cat , which authorities said was a stray , was found on the baltic sea island of rügen , where the deadly h5n1 was detected in birds earlier this month .
it was the first case in germany of the bird flu being transmitted to a mammal . meanwhile , a government crisis team continued to meet in berlin , to discuss measures against the deadliest form of the virus . who : ' no i n creased huma n threat ' the cat grabbed the headlines in several countries in europe , but the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- in geneva said it did not increase the threat to human health from the virus .
since late 2003 , 93 people have died from bird flu , but they have contracted the virus from contact with infected birds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dead cat on rügen was said to be a stray " there is no present evidence that domestic cats play a role in the transmission cycle of h5n1 viruses .
to date , no human case has been linked to exposure to a diseased cat , " it said .
" unlike the case in domestic and wild birds , there is no evidence that domestic cats are a reservoir of the virus . " bird flu has killed or led to the culling of some 200 million birds since it re-emerged in asia in late 2003 .
the real fear for human health is that the virus will mutate into a form that passes easily from person to person , sparking a pandemic in which millions could die . representatives of german state and local governments today agreed in a telephone conference to examine dead mammals found in areas already known to contain the h5n1 virus , or those where deaths seem suspicious . bird lockdow n could drag o n but they recommended against vaccinating house cats , saying it was not target-oriented enough , since there is no appropriate vaccination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers in protective clothing combed the island of rügen for dead fowl meanwhile , germany 's agriculture ministry has said germany may be forced to keep domesticated birds enclosed through april . " we may have no choice , if the flu keeps raging beyond the migration period , " said agriculture secretary gert lindemann , who is heading up the task force that met in berlin wednesday . a n imal supporters war n of pa n ic the german animal protection league warned of an unnecessary panic outbreak .
cats do not need to be kept indoors germany-wide , they said in a statement , but in areas where the bird flu has already been found , owners should keep close watch over their animals . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu jumps to cat in germany a dead cat in germany has tested positive for the h5n1 type of bird flu in the first case in the country of the virus spreading from birds to mammals , the national veterinary laboratory said on wednesday .

as such , it invests more in research and development than any other branch in germany . the development race is a moveable feast , an ongoing process of honing and fine-tuning the already state-of-the-art .
as fashions shift , so too do motorized visions .
the latest comes in the form of a zero-emissions hydrogen-fuelled model , which - although still in its infant stages of development - has already generated a climate of intense competition among the big name manufacturers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling up on a tank load of diesel until the motor of the future is ready to hit the road -lrb- and that is not expected for at least another 15 years -rrb- , the search for alternative sources of fuel will continue . " we spend between 30 and 35 percent of our overall budget on engine technology and fuel , " said volkswagen head of research , franz-josef paefgen .
" we had a look at exactly what we could do with existing technology and our development findings , and realized that over the next few years , europe could replace half its fuel consumption with alternative fuel sources . " long haul there is no doubt , however , that it will take a long time to get away from oil altogether .
there is no single great way to cleaner cars , but a whole host of possibilities which range from the hybrid combustion-electric engine to a mixture of bio fuels . bernd gottschalk , president of the association of the german automobile industry , said they have recognized that so-called " designer fuels , " with biomass or cellulose components , are ideal for future generations of engines . " they are steps towards reducing co2 by 90 percent , which would be a win-win situation for everyone , " gottschalk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new cars wait in line there is not , however , much use in equipping cars with futuristic engines if there are no gas stations for filling up the tank .
in that regard , germany lags miles behind the likes of sweden , which with its 300 gas-ethanol stations has made ford 's flexi-fuel technology the order of the day . as it stands , germany has but one such filling station in the whole country , and although that is clearly not enough , bernhard mattes , head of ford germany , said it is a step in the right direction . " at ford , we invest heavily in research and development because we believe that sustainable mobility can only work if we develop alternative engines , and continue research into driving dynamics and automobile security , " he said . the broader picture but finding a balance between making motoring safer for the environment and those on the roads is a tricky business . thomas weber , a daimlerchrysler board member and head of development at the mercedes car group said environmentally friendly engines and crash structures both make cars heavier . # b # " we know that an additional 20 kilos increases fuel consumption by one percent , so we have to ensure that however innovative the technology , the cars are not too heavy , " weber said .
" if we are clever , we will find a solution to benefit both the environment and the customer . " the race is definitely on .
with the number of cars on the roads expected to double in the next 15 years , manufacturers are not only working against each other , but against the clock to come up with sustainable solutions for generations to come . henrik böhme -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese cars pick up speed in germany even as german automobile manufactures look to china 's millions of people to boost profits , the first chinese cars are rolling down the export ramp and into mercedes and bmw territory .

the body called for new laws to control spies . in a report examining the possible role of european countries in the alleged illegal cia transfer of terrorist suspects and secret detentions , the council of europe criticized its member states for a lack of legislative control of foreign secret services operating on their territory . " it would appear that most of europe is a happy hunting ground for foreign security services , " secretary general terry davis told a news conference after the report 's release at the body 's headquarters in the french city of strasbourg .
" hardly any country has any legal provisions to ensure an effective oversight over the activities of foreign security services on their territory . " the report did not produce evidence that the us had run secret jails in europe .
however , it called for better oversight and regulation by national parliaments and judicial bodies when human rights abuses were suspected and better controls of foreign intelligence services .
" europe 's skies appear to be excessively open , " davis said .
" very few countries seem to have adopted an adequate and effective way to monitor who and what is transiting through their airports and airspace .
indeed , no member state appears to have established any kind of procedure in order to assess whether civil aircraft are used for purposes which would be incompatible with internationally recognized human rights standards . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in europe , only hungary has effective laws to monitor foreign secret services , davis said " this is alarming because the explanations provided on the specific point of controls over aircraft allegedly used for rendition show that existing procedures do not provide adequate safeguards against abuse , " he said .
lack of cooperation davis also criticized four of the council 's 46 members - italy , bosnia-herzegovina , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , and poland - for their inadequate response to the body 's investigation into cia renditions .
he said he would continue probing those countries .
he praised germany , saying that of the four countries whose responses he had been most concerned to receive due to possible events there , it was the only one that had responded expansively to the questionnaire sent to the member states . davis ' is one of two investigations into the issue of cia rendition and secret jails that the council is carrying out .

becoming germany 's first female leader was not easy , but angela merkel has already carved her name high up in the popularity stakes . the grand coalition has been in office for a full 100 days , which means the period of grace traditionally granted a new government , is officially over .
but with the german public appearing more than willing to continue supporting the conservative cdu / csu and social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- alliance , that is of little relevance .
angela merkel is enjoying massive popularity and opinion polls suggest that her party is steaming ahead of their coalition partner , the spd . but at the federal elections last september , the picture was quite different .
the two main parties were unable to beat each other , and the results of the ballot made it impossible for either the cdu / csu to form a coalition with the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- or for the spd-green alliance to continue running the country .
the additional parliamentary presence of the left party meant the only alternative was to form a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder fought it out for the top spot and that very coalition , so it turns out , is what the majority of german voters wanted .
in it , they see the possibility of fulfilled expectations and greater harmony .
on the latter point , with coalition partners who treat one another with care and are quick to resolve budding disputes , the electorate can be satisfied . yet , on the former , expectations regarding unemployment reduction remain unfulfilled .
there is also reason to believe that the two sides will clash over continued welfare and health reforms . showing germany 's new face abroad on the international stage , merkel made a good first impression .
she breezed confidently through her debut visits to paris , london and washington , but they were not meant to serve as opportunities to iron out any serious conflicts of interest .
merkel has not yet shown what position she will take on washington 's stance on the iranian nuclear program .
and although the new german leader 's appearance at the eu budget summit met with applause , it 's not entirely clear to what extent that was the result of her financial generosity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vice chancellor and labor minister , franz müntefering meanwhile , the grand coalition is an acid test for the social democrats who are trying to profile themselves .
thus far , labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering has been viewed as the spd heavyweight in the cabinet , but he is not coordinating well with the new party head , matthias platzeck , and internal conflicts could become a problem for the coalition . although on the whole germany 's grand coalition conveys a stable impression , keeping it up depends on how much space the two partners have for profiling themselves .
merkel is making something of a name for herself as a leader who moderates discussions without clearly stating her position .
for the chancellor of a grand coalition that could be a good technique , but the question is whether it is sustainable beyond regional elections at the end of march . heinz dylong -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de refining merkel 's makeover angela merkel has come a long way from fashion fiasco to chic chancellor .

" from warsaw to london and davos , in jerusalem and ramallah , merkel succeeded in combining the diplomatic inheritance of her mentor , helmut kohl , with that of her predecessor , gerhard schröder - the european and atlantic tradition of the one , and the defense of national interests of the other , " the paper commented .
a question of gender ? britain 's financial times decided to speculate on whether the initial successes of merkel 's chancellorship could be put down to a certain " female touch " she brings to foreign policy .
well aware that such a hypothesis could be thrown out by some as " thinly veiled discrimination , " the paper nonetheless made a case for its assumption , arguing : " after all , she visited president george w. bush in washington to relaunch a productive german-american relationship but uttered clear words on the need to close down the guantanamo prison .
she decided not to embrace -lrb- nor kiss à la gerhard schröder -rrb- vladimir putin , russia 's president , and sent strong signals to hamas .
from these initial - and very successful - moves we may draw two rules that seem to apply to ms. merkel 's ' female ' foreign policy : firm but sober on principles , tough but patient on implementation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a less-than-flattering view of merkel 's relationship with the us administration the swiss paper der bund took a closer look at what 's behind the praise being heaped on the merkel administration , and found that the positive reviews are deceptive .
it commented that " the team around the cdu leader profited to a large extent from the implosion of the red-green coalition in 2005 , and the paralysis that set in after the indecisive election .
compared to that uncertainty , the unspectacular but solidly working government is a boon , no matter whether or not you agree with what it 's doing . "
but the paper feared that this would not be enough in the long run , and predicted that merkel - who it described as more of a social democrat in some points than the social democrats themselves - risks frustrating her grand coalition partners . the paris-based paper libération also foresaw difficulties for merkel in the future , mainly because , as it commented , " she has not even had to get to grips with the bigger stones lying in her path . "
everyone 's waiting for merkel to tackle issues such as unemployment and the financing of health care - issues where the cdu and the spd do not at all see eye to eye , the paper wrote . unemployment the true test britain 's the times , however , said that merkel 's aura has already begun to fade , and predicted that the issue of unemployment will be her undoing .
" dozens of bouquets have been prepared to mark her 100th day as chancellor , but the only number that seemed to count was the 5,048,000 on the dole , " the paper wrote .
on the domestic front , merkel has changed the law to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 and increase vat by three points , but according to the times , " neither initiative addresses the dilemma of how to translate higher growth - now predicted to be 1.5 percent this year - into jobs . " but the belgian paper la libre belgique thought that the honeymoon could continue , just a little longer .
" even critical observers admit that she 's not made a single faux pas , " the paper commented .
" it 's gone on for so long as to have almost become boring .

as such , it invests more in research and development than any other branch in germany . the development race is a moveable feast , an ongoing process of honing and fine-tuning the already state-of-the-art .
as fashions shift , so too do motorized visions .
the latest comes in the form of a zero-emissions hydrogen-fuelled model , which - although still in its infant stages of development - has already generated a climate of intense competition among the big name manufacturers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling up on a tank load of diesel until the motor of the future is ready to hit the road -lrb- and that is not expected for at least another 15 years -rrb- , the search for alternative sources of fuel will continue . " we spend between 30 and 35 percent of our overall budget on engine technology and fuel , " said volkswagen head of research , franz-josef paefgen .
" we had a look at exactly what we could do with existing technology and our development findings , and realized that over the next few years , europe could replace half its fuel consumption with alternative fuel sources . " long haul there is no doubt , however , that it will take a long time to get away from oil altogether .
there is no single great way to cleaner cars , but a whole host of possibilities which range from the hybrid combustion-electric engine to a mixture of bio fuels . bernd gottschalk , president of the association of the german automobile industry , said they have recognized that so-called " designer fuels , " with biomass or cellulose components , are ideal for future generations of engines . " they are steps towards reducing co2 by 90 percent , which would be a win-win situation for everyone , " gottschalk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new cars wait in line there is not , however , much use in equipping cars with futuristic engines if there are no gas stations for filling up the tank .
in that regard , germany lags miles behind the likes of sweden , which with its 300 gas-ethanol stations has made ford 's flexi-fuel technology the order of the day . as it stands , germany has but one such filling station in the whole country , and although that is clearly not enough , bernhard mattes , head of ford germany , said it is a step in the right direction . " at ford , we invest heavily in research and development because we believe that sustainable mobility can only work if we develop alternative engines , and continue research into driving dynamics and automobile security , " he said . the broader picture but finding a balance between making motoring safer for the environment and those on the roads is a tricky business . thomas weber , a daimlerchrysler board member and head of development at the mercedes car group said environmentally friendly engines and crash structures both make cars heavier . # b # " we know that an additional 20 kilos increases fuel consumption by one percent , so we have to ensure that however innovative the technology , the cars are not too heavy , " weber said .
" if we are clever , we will find a solution to benefit both the environment and the customer . " the race is definitely on .
with the number of cars on the roads expected to double in the next 15 years , manufacturers are not only working against each other , but against the clock to come up with sustainable solutions for generations to come . henrik böhme -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese cars pick up speed in germany even as german automobile manufactures look to china 's millions of people to boost profits , the first chinese cars are rolling down the export ramp and into mercedes and bmw territory .

becoming germany 's first female leader was not easy , but angela merkel has already carved her name high up in the popularity stakes . the grand coalition has been in office for a full 100 days , which means the period of grace traditionally granted a new government , is officially over .
but with the german public appearing more than willing to continue supporting the conservative cdu / csu and social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- alliance , that is of little relevance .
angela merkel is enjoying massive popularity and opinion polls suggest that her party is steaming ahead of their coalition partner , the spd . but at the federal elections last september , the picture was quite different .
the two main parties were unable to beat each other , and the results of the ballot made it impossible for either the cdu / csu to form a coalition with the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- or for the spd-green alliance to continue running the country .
the additional parliamentary presence of the left party meant the only alternative was to form a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder fought it out for the top spot and that very coalition , so it turns out , is what the majority of german voters wanted .
in it , they see the possibility of fulfilled expectations and greater harmony .
on the latter point , with coalition partners who treat one another with care and are quick to resolve budding disputes , the electorate can be satisfied . yet , on the former , expectations regarding unemployment reduction remain unfulfilled .
there is also reason to believe that the two sides will clash over continued welfare and health reforms . showing germany 's new face abroad on the international stage , merkel made a good first impression .
she breezed confidently through her debut visits to paris , london and washington , but they were not meant to serve as opportunities to iron out any serious conflicts of interest .
merkel has not yet shown what position she will take on washington 's stance on the iranian nuclear program .
and although the new german leader 's appearance at the eu budget summit met with applause , it 's not entirely clear to what extent that was the result of her financial generosity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vice chancellor and labor minister , franz müntefering meanwhile , the grand coalition is an acid test for the social democrats who are trying to profile themselves .
thus far , labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering has been viewed as the spd heavyweight in the cabinet , but he is not coordinating well with the new party head , matthias platzeck , and internal conflicts could become a problem for the coalition . although on the whole germany 's grand coalition conveys a stable impression , keeping it up depends on how much space the two partners have for profiling themselves .
merkel is making something of a name for herself as a leader who moderates discussions without clearly stating her position .

becoming germany 's first female leader was not easy , but angela merkel has already carved her name high up in the popularity stakes . the grand coalition has been in office for a full 100 days , which means the period of grace traditionally granted a new government , is officially over .
but with the german public appearing more than willing to continue supporting the conservative cdu / csu and social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- alliance , that is of little relevance .
angela merkel is enjoying massive popularity and opinion polls suggest that her party is steaming ahead of their coalition partner , the spd . but at the federal elections last september , the picture was quite different .
the two main parties were unable to beat each other , and the results of the ballot made it impossible for either the cdu / csu to form a coalition with the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- or for the spd-green alliance to continue running the country .
the additional parliamentary presence of the left party meant the only alternative was to form a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder fought it out for the top spot and that very coalition , so it turns out , is what the majority of german voters wanted .
in it , they see the possibility of fulfilled expectations and greater harmony .
on the latter point , with coalition partners who treat one another with care and are quick to resolve budding disputes , the electorate can be satisfied . yet , on the former , expectations regarding unemployment reduction remain unfulfilled .
there is also reason to believe that the two sides will clash over continued welfare and health reforms . showing germany 's new face abroad on the international stage , merkel made a good first impression .
she breezed confidently through her debut visits to paris , london and washington , but they were not meant to serve as opportunities to iron out any serious conflicts of interest .
merkel has not yet shown what position she will take on washington 's stance on the iranian nuclear program .
and although the new german leader 's appearance at the eu budget summit met with applause , it 's not entirely clear to what extent that was the result of her financial generosity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vice chancellor and labor minister , franz müntefering meanwhile , the grand coalition is an acid test for the social democrats who are trying to profile themselves .
thus far , labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering has been viewed as the spd heavyweight in the cabinet , but he is not coordinating well with the new party head , matthias platzeck , and internal conflicts could become a problem for the coalition . although on the whole germany 's grand coalition conveys a stable impression , keeping it up depends on how much space the two partners have for profiling themselves .
merkel is making something of a name for herself as a leader who moderates discussions without clearly stating her position .
for the chancellor of a grand coalition that could be a good technique , but the question is whether it is sustainable beyond regional elections at the end of march . heinz dylong -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de refining merkel 's makeover angela merkel has come a long way from fashion fiasco to chic chancellor .

" they are a great team with a wonderful history , and as hosts of the world cup they are very ambitious , " he said .

becoming germany 's first female leader was not easy , but angela merkel has already carved her name high up in the popularity stakes . the grand coalition has been in office for a full 100 days , which means the period of grace traditionally granted a new government , is officially over .
but with the german public appearing more than willing to continue supporting the conservative cdu / csu and social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- alliance , that is of little relevance .
angela merkel is enjoying massive popularity and opinion polls suggest that her party is steaming ahead of their coalition partner , the spd . but at the federal elections last september , the picture was quite different .
the two main parties were unable to beat each other , and the results of the ballot made it impossible for either the cdu / csu to form a coalition with the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- or for the spd-green alliance to continue running the country .
the additional parliamentary presence of the left party meant the only alternative was to form a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder fought it out for the top spot and that very coalition , so it turns out , is what the majority of german voters wanted .
in it , they see the possibility of fulfilled expectations and greater harmony .
on the latter point , with coalition partners who treat one another with care and are quick to resolve budding disputes , the electorate can be satisfied . yet , on the former , expectations regarding unemployment reduction remain unfulfilled .
there is also reason to believe that the two sides will clash over continued welfare and health reforms . showing germany 's new face abroad on the international stage , merkel made a good first impression .
she breezed confidently through her debut visits to paris , london and washington , but they were not meant to serve as opportunities to iron out any serious conflicts of interest .
merkel has not yet shown what position she will take on washington 's stance on the iranian nuclear program .
and although the new german leader 's appearance at the eu budget summit met with applause , it 's not entirely clear to what extent that was the result of her financial generosity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vice chancellor and labor minister , franz müntefering meanwhile , the grand coalition is an acid test for the social democrats who are trying to profile themselves .
thus far , labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering has been viewed as the spd heavyweight in the cabinet , but he is not coordinating well with the new party head , matthias platzeck , and internal conflicts could become a problem for the coalition . although on the whole germany 's grand coalition conveys a stable impression , keeping it up depends on how much space the two partners have for profiling themselves .
merkel is making something of a name for herself as a leader who moderates discussions without clearly stating her position .
for the chancellor of a grand coalition that could be a good technique , but the question is whether it is sustainable beyond regional elections at the end of march . heinz dylong -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de refining merkel 's makeover angela merkel has come a long way from fashion fiasco to chic chancellor .

but now , there 's an expectation that she will transfer this success to the domestic front , and especially the economy , which is sorely in need of sustained growth after years of sub-par performance . merkel could extend her honeymoon with the german people , the pundits say , but only if she can deliver the cuts in unemployment that her government has promised . it 's a tall order .
while current economic data point to a recovery , experts say it 's a shaky one at best . jobless figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : february 's unemployment statistics pointed to a slight recovery february 's jobless figures , released just as merkel celebrated her first 100 days as chancellor , were n't all bad news .
although the unadjusted rate of unemployment showed a 12 percent increase to 5.05 million , when adjusted for seasonal swings , the number of unemployed people fell roughly 5,000 to 4.695 million .
this decrease was less than the fall of 20,000 expected by economists , however . on the plus side , business confidence in germany is at a 14-year high point and consumers are feeling increasingly optimistic as the recovery in the eurozone 's biggest economy gathers pace . still , experts are wary of being overly optimistic , cautioning that the current " feel-good " sentiment had yet to be reflected in real economic data . slow progress ? many observers have voiced fears that the forced political alliance between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will result in stagnation on pressing economic issues . " when it comes to economics , i 'm not disappointed , because i did n't expect too much to begin with , " said paul clemens friedhoff , economics expert for the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" the two partners in this coalition are far from singing the same song . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer spending is going up now , but experts say that will change with the planned vat hike the cdu and spd have managed to agree on a 25-billion euro -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- investment program to jump-start the economy , but critics say the program will be ineffectual come next year when consumer spending is expected to dip due to the cdu 's three-percent increase in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- . no shortage of issues merkel 's coalition will also have to make up its mind on how to regulate the low-wage sector .
a debate about the introduction of a minimum wage for all sectors is in full swing now , but a decision is not expected before the second half of this year . among other economic issues demanding the government 's attention is a corporate tax reform - on the back burner for the moment because the coalition partners can ’ t agree on a sustainable model . there 's also the issue of fresh borrowing .
in 2006 , over 38 billion euros will be added to germany 's pile of debt , with a turnaround on this front only expected in 2007 . a more immediate concern is the current atmosphere of discontent , with tens of thousands of public-sector employees , including garbage collectors , hospital staff and child-care workers on strike all around the country in protest against longer working hours and cuts in bonuses . " if we are seeing a recovery in germany it is not a very strong one , " said adam posen , an economist at the institute for international economics in washington .

the body called for new laws to control spies . in a report examining the possible role of european countries in the alleged illegal cia transfer of terrorist suspects and secret detentions , the council of europe criticized its member states for a lack of legislative control of foreign secret services operating on their territory . " it would appear that most of europe is a happy hunting ground for foreign security services , " secretary general terry davis told a news conference after the report 's release at the body 's headquarters in the french city of strasbourg .
" hardly any country has any legal provisions to ensure an effective oversight over the activities of foreign security services on their territory . " the report did not produce evidence that the us had run secret jails in europe .
however , it called for better oversight and regulation by national parliaments and judicial bodies when human rights abuses were suspected and better controls of foreign intelligence services .
" europe 's skies appear to be excessively open , " davis said .
" very few countries seem to have adopted an adequate and effective way to monitor who and what is transiting through their airports and airspace .
indeed , no member state appears to have established any kind of procedure in order to assess whether civil aircraft are used for purposes which would be incompatible with internationally recognized human rights standards . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in europe , only hungary has effective laws to monitor foreign secret services , davis said " this is alarming because the explanations provided on the specific point of controls over aircraft allegedly used for rendition show that existing procedures do not provide adequate safeguards against abuse , " he said .

the body called for new laws to control spies . in a report examining the possible role of european countries in the alleged illegal cia transfer of terrorist suspects and secret detentions , the council of europe criticized its member states for a lack of legislative control of foreign secret services operating on their territory . " it would appear that most of europe is a happy hunting ground for foreign security services , " secretary general terry davis told a news conference after the report 's release at the body 's headquarters in the french city of strasbourg .
" hardly any country has any legal provisions to ensure an effective oversight over the activities of foreign security services on their territory . " the report did not produce evidence that the us had run secret jails in europe .
however , it called for better oversight and regulation by national parliaments and judicial bodies when human rights abuses were suspected and better controls of foreign intelligence services .
" europe 's skies appear to be excessively open , " davis said .
" very few countries seem to have adopted an adequate and effective way to monitor who and what is transiting through their airports and airspace .
indeed , no member state appears to have established any kind of procedure in order to assess whether civil aircraft are used for purposes which would be incompatible with internationally recognized human rights standards . "

matters worsened for the visitors three minutes later . del piero 's quickly-taken free-kick surprised the german back four and sent gilardino racing clear towards goal .
the 23-year-old ac milan striker looked up and unselfishly slid the ball across to give toni a tap-in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luca toni celebrated after just seven minutes italy might have had a third moments later when del piero 's crossed free-kick found gilardino unmarked , but he failed by just a few inches to make a connection . germany then sliced italy open with their first genuine attack , but gianluigi buffon pulled off a superb save to keep out sebastian deisler 's vicious drive . de rossi made it 3-0 in the 39th minute , applying the finishing touch to mauro camoranesi 's cross as the german defense suffered another alarming lapse in concentration . " it 's i n explicable " limiting the damage was germany 's task now , but they leaked another goal in the 56th minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniele de rossi -lrb- right -rrb- and robert huth -lrb- left -rrb- gilardino 's cross from the left was headed back across goal by camoranesi and del piero dived low to head past a helpless lehmann . huth 's late strike was of little consolation for the poor germans . " it 's inexplicable how one can fall back so quickly , " said german captain michael ballack , who added that italy 's early lead had made his team insecure .
" the mistakes we made were punished hard .
thankfully there will be another match in three weeks and then it 's going to be a different german national team . " national coach jürgen klinsmann also said that he still had high hopes for his team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann " of course we 're disappointed - we had high hopes and there were smashed within the first minutes , " said german national coach jürgen klinsmann .
" it was a frustrating lesson for us , but we believe in this team and we believe in the young players .
we 're confident that everything will work in 100 days . " but the weak performance had commentators worried about the team 's readiness to succeed in the world cup this summer at home . " if the italians were to really go for it , germany would look even worse , " said reinhold beckmann , the match 's commentator for german public broadcaster ard .
" the real question is whether the german team is just too young . " the team still has three chances to prove that it is ready for the world cup .
on march 22 , it will face the us , followed by matches against japan on may 30 and colombia on june 2 . the german team opens the world cup on june 9 against costa rica . hooliga n s n ot impressed by pope 's appeal before the match , a message by pope benedict xvi called for an end to racist chanting and emblems at football matches and urged football fans to adopt " respect and dialogue " ahead of this summer 's world cup in his native germany . both nations ' football authorities had dedicated the match to opposing all forms of racial violence .
racism has been a serious problem in italy 's elite seria a league this season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-born pope got a world cup pennant from german soccer legend franz beckenbauer last october the 78-year-old pontiff said he appreciated the initiative to combat racial discrimination , which he said would " consolidate awareness of the important educative function of sport in the service of solidarity and peace . " but before the match , german and italian hooligans tried to start a fight and fired off signal rockets .

there have been more than 100 cases of h5n1-infected wild birds found in germany . the finding could increase concern that the virus could spread to other species in europe as it has in several cases in other parts of the world . " it has been known for some time that cats can become infected by eating infected birds , " thomas mettenleiter , president of the institute , told reuters . several large cats in asian zoos have died after being fed infected birds and domestic cats have been shown to be especially vulnerable to the disease , the institute said . the h5n1 strain , which has caused illness and even fatalities in humans in turkey and asia , has been detected in a leopard , tigers , civet cats and two domestic cats in thailand .
but the world health organization said in 2004 that the infection of cats was unlikely to enhance the risks to humans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers gather dead birds on the island of rügen the the federal research institute for animal health has called on cat owners on the german island to keep their animals away from the area where the infection seems to be centered and to take special hygenic precautions . " a transmission , which can not be completely ruled out , would only be possible through very intimate contact with an infected animal , " said mettenleiter . further spread among birds in the bird population , the disease was spreading further across europe and africa . france began vaccinating 700,000 domestic ducks and geese on farms after it announced at the weekend the first outbreak of h5n1 bird flu in a european union poultry farm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wild geese fly over a decontamination area in eastern france the commercial repercussions of the french outbreak were driven home tuesday as the government announced that some 30 countries were now restricting or banning imports of poultry and poultry products from france . sweden for the first time detected in ducks an unidentified strain of bird flu , feared to be the h5n1 strain . initial tests at sweden 's the national veterinary institute " show that we 're probably talking about the same virus that has been spreading in russia and china , " said the swedish agriculture board . elsewhere , h5n1 was detected for the first time in bosnia , the southern german state of bavaria and a poultry farm in southwestern russia where 103,000 birds were reported to have died in a week . britain said it was unlikely to escape .
" i would anticipate that avian flu will arrive at some point in the uk , " said british chief scientific advisor professor sir david king , predicting that the disease would stay for at least five years . " we are talking about the possibility of this disease being endemic here in the uk as it did in china .
it is a long-term factor , " he told the bbc . africa but world experts fretted mostly about africa , where many countries are ill equipped to detect or impede the spread of the disease . ethiopian officials were testing some of more than 6,000 chickens that died suddenly on a poultry farm in endibir 175 kilometers -lrb- 108 miles -rrb- southwest of addis ababa .
a day earlier the world organization for animal health -lrb- oie -rrb- reported the first cases of h5n1 in niger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strain of the h5n1 bird flu virus has been found in poultry stocks in nigeria in neighboring nigeria - where more than 300,000 infected fowl have already died or been slaughtered - h5n1 was detected in two more states in the north .
in the kenyan capital nairobi , the authorities said initial tests on 400 dead chickens showed no sign of bird flu .
cases of h5n1 have also been reported in egypt . human deaths have already been recorded after the disease jumped from bird to human in cambodia , china , indonesia , iraq , thailand , turkey and vietnam .

matters worsened for the visitors three minutes later . del piero 's quickly-taken free-kick surprised the german back four and sent gilardino racing clear towards goal .
the 23-year-old ac milan striker looked up and unselfishly slid the ball across to give toni a tap-in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luca toni celebrated after just seven minutes italy might have had a third moments later when del piero 's crossed free-kick found gilardino unmarked , but he failed by just a few inches to make a connection . germany then sliced italy open with their first genuine attack , but gianluigi buffon pulled off a superb save to keep out sebastian deisler 's vicious drive . de rossi made it 3-0 in the 39th minute , applying the finishing touch to mauro camoranesi 's cross as the german defense suffered another alarming lapse in concentration . " it 's i n explicable " limiting the damage was germany 's task now , but they leaked another goal in the 56th minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniele de rossi -lrb- right -rrb- and robert huth -lrb- left -rrb- gilardino 's cross from the left was headed back across goal by camoranesi and del piero dived low to head past a helpless lehmann . huth 's late strike was of little consolation for the poor germans . " it 's inexplicable how one can fall back so quickly , " said german captain michael ballack , who added that italy 's early lead had made his team insecure .
" the mistakes we made were punished hard .
thankfully there will be another match in three weeks and then it 's going to be a different german national team . " national coach jürgen klinsmann also said that he still had high hopes for his team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann " of course we 're disappointed - we had high hopes and there were smashed within the first minutes , " said german national coach jürgen klinsmann .
" it was a frustrating lesson for us , but we believe in this team and we believe in the young players .
we 're confident that everything will work in 100 days . " but the weak performance had commentators worried about the team 's readiness to succeed in the world cup this summer at home . " if the italians were to really go for it , germany would look even worse , " said reinhold beckmann , the match 's commentator for german public broadcaster ard .
" the real question is whether the german team is just too young . " the team still has three chances to prove that it is ready for the world cup .
on march 22 , it will face the us , followed by matches against japan on may 30 and colombia on june 2 . the german team opens the world cup on june 9 against costa rica . hooliga n s n ot impressed by pope 's appeal before the match , a message by pope benedict xvi called for an end to racist chanting and emblems at football matches and urged football fans to adopt " respect and dialogue " ahead of this summer 's world cup in his native germany . both nations ' football authorities had dedicated the match to opposing all forms of racial violence .
racism has been a serious problem in italy 's elite seria a league this season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-born pope got a world cup pennant from german soccer legend franz beckenbauer last october the 78-year-old pontiff said he appreciated the initiative to combat racial discrimination , which he said would " consolidate awareness of the important educative function of sport in the service of solidarity and peace . " but before the match , german and italian hooligans tried to start a fight and fired off signal rockets .
according to the german soccer federation , 900 tickets had been sold to german fans , with 600 seated in a closed-off area .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : merkel 's record so far it 's the economy , angela press review : merkel 's first 100 days opinion : 100 days of angela merkel new german government has nation in buoyant mood germany -pipe- 01.03.2006 chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been enjoying good press from journalists of all stripes the dire predictions once made about germany 's current " grand coalition " government have proven untrue .
on the contrary , harmony is the watchword so far .
political scientist klaus detterbeck looks back and ahead . dw-world : the grand coalition 's grace period - its first hundred days - is now over .
one gets the impression that the government has made a better impression than was once expected . klaus detterbeck : i think so too .
surveys regarding angela merkel and the christian democrats are good right now .
there are two reasons for this relatively good start for the grand coalition .
first , there have been successes , like chancellor merkel 's trip to the us , to russia and at the eu summit , as well as some overall positive economic developments .
secondly , the populace has given the chancellor something of an advance when it comes to trust .
people are willing to give this coalition some time to find its footing .
a majority of people have the feeling that a solid , capable team is at the helm , as opposed to that of the last schröder government . so are the individuals in the government less important than the " team " as a whole ? yes , you could say that .
that has to do with chancellor merkel 's role as a director .
she is not a big personality out front , who calls all the shots .
rather she 's the person who steers the entire team .
that makes her different than schröder , who was something of a showman who pranced on the political stage . despite the laurels , has the country really progressed toward finding solutions to some of its problems ? it 's true that there have been no big decisions made as yet .
there is this positive impression , a positive undertone , but the real foundation for new policies has n't yet been laid .
negotiations still have to take place about federalism reform , and other big reform projects have yet to be tackled . angela merkel enjoys a good deal of sympathy from journalists of all stripes .
she is also respected by foreign leaders .
what is different about her ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular with journalists these days she leaves the impression of being someone who does solid work and does n't push her way to the front .
instead , she tries to enact good policies for the good of the country .
in the grand coalition , she is engaging in the politics of inclusion .
that 's to her great credit . will she be successful if she continues to follow this strategy ?
what about when she has to get down to the nitty-gritty ? one of her strengths is her ability to hold the two camps together .
but in fact , this advantage could turn into a disadvantage if it comes time to make difficult decisions and she finds it hard to assert her authority , depending on a consensus for decisions . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have lost popularity among voters .
does the party have the wrong party chairman or is its strategy faulty ? the spd has two problems .
for one , they have the rather " unpleasant " ministries : -lrb- franz -rrb- müntefering at labor and -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrück at finance .
on the other hand , people still are n't sure what this party actually stands for .
is it a reform party , which is how it 's been seen over the past few years under schröder ?
or is it headed back in a more traditional , union-oriented direction ?
-lrb- matthias -rrb- platzeck is still not in the position to explain where the party should go from here and it 's hurting because of that . let 's look at the opposition .
does one actually still exist and if so , is it able to attract any attention to itself ? it 's true that the opposition parties have problems finding an audience .
the left party is mostly concerned with itself these days ; the greens have n't found their direction yet ; and the free democrats are having a hard time making their mark .
these are tough times for the smaller parties .
we 'll have to see how they do at the end of march , when there are elections in rheinland-palatinate , saxony-anhalt and baden-württemberg . political scientist klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . steffen leidel spoke with klaus detterbeck send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges recovery and resolve in first speech angela merkel gave her first speech to parliament as german chancellor wednesday and spoke of a strong germany full of opportunities and a country that would stand firm on the issues of justice and equal rights .

on the contrary , harmony is the watchword so far .
political scientist klaus detterbeck looks back and ahead . dw-world : the grand coalition 's grace period - its first hundred days - is now over .
one gets the impression that the government has made a better impression than was once expected . klaus detterbeck : i think so too .
surveys regarding angela merkel and the christian democrats are good right now .
there are two reasons for this relatively good start for the grand coalition .
first , there have been successes , like chancellor merkel 's trip to the us , to russia and at the eu summit , as well as some overall positive economic developments .
secondly , the populace has given the chancellor something of an advance when it comes to trust .
people are willing to give this coalition some time to find its footing .
a majority of people have the feeling that a solid , capable team is at the helm , as opposed to that of the last schröder government . so are the individuals in the government less important than the " team " as a whole ? yes , you could say that .
that has to do with chancellor merkel 's role as a director .
she is not a big personality out front , who calls all the shots .
rather she 's the person who steers the entire team .
that makes her different than schröder , who was something of a showman who pranced on the political stage . despite the laurels , has the country really progressed toward finding solutions to some of its problems ? it 's true that there have been no big decisions made as yet .
there is this positive impression , a positive undertone , but the real foundation for new policies has n't yet been laid .
negotiations still have to take place about federalism reform , and other big reform projects have yet to be tackled . angela merkel enjoys a good deal of sympathy from journalists of all stripes .
she is also respected by foreign leaders .
what is different about her ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular with journalists these days she leaves the impression of being someone who does solid work and does n't push her way to the front .
instead , she tries to enact good policies for the good of the country .
in the grand coalition , she is engaging in the politics of inclusion .
that 's to her great credit . will she be successful if she continues to follow this strategy ?
what about when she has to get down to the nitty-gritty ? one of her strengths is her ability to hold the two camps together .
but in fact , this advantage could turn into a disadvantage if it comes time to make difficult decisions and she finds it hard to assert her authority , depending on a consensus for decisions . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have lost popularity among voters .
does the party have the wrong party chairman or is its strategy faulty ? the spd has two problems .
for one , they have the rather " unpleasant " ministries : -lrb- franz -rrb- müntefering at labor and -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrück at finance .
on the other hand , people still are n't sure what this party actually stands for .
is it a reform party , which is how it 's been seen over the past few years under schröder ?
or is it headed back in a more traditional , union-oriented direction ?
-lrb- matthias -rrb- platzeck is still not in the position to explain where the party should go from here and it 's hurting because of that . let 's look at the opposition .
does one actually still exist and if so , is it able to attract any attention to itself ? it 's true that the opposition parties have problems finding an audience .
the left party is mostly concerned with itself these days ; the greens have n't found their direction yet ; and the free democrats are having a hard time making their mark .
these are tough times for the smaller parties .

on the contrary , harmony is the watchword so far .
political scientist klaus detterbeck looks back and ahead . dw-world : the grand coalition 's grace period - its first hundred days - is now over .
one gets the impression that the government has made a better impression than was once expected . klaus detterbeck : i think so too .
surveys regarding angela merkel and the christian democrats are good right now .
there are two reasons for this relatively good start for the grand coalition .
first , there have been successes , like chancellor merkel 's trip to the us , to russia and at the eu summit , as well as some overall positive economic developments .
secondly , the populace has given the chancellor something of an advance when it comes to trust .
people are willing to give this coalition some time to find its footing .
a majority of people have the feeling that a solid , capable team is at the helm , as opposed to that of the last schröder government . so are the individuals in the government less important than the " team " as a whole ? yes , you could say that .
that has to do with chancellor merkel 's role as a director .
she is not a big personality out front , who calls all the shots .
rather she 's the person who steers the entire team .
that makes her different than schröder , who was something of a showman who pranced on the political stage . despite the laurels , has the country really progressed toward finding solutions to some of its problems ? it 's true that there have been no big decisions made as yet .
there is this positive impression , a positive undertone , but the real foundation for new policies has n't yet been laid .
negotiations still have to take place about federalism reform , and other big reform projects have yet to be tackled . angela merkel enjoys a good deal of sympathy from journalists of all stripes .
she is also respected by foreign leaders .
what is different about her ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular with journalists these days she leaves the impression of being someone who does solid work and does n't push her way to the front .
instead , she tries to enact good policies for the good of the country .
in the grand coalition , she is engaging in the politics of inclusion .
that 's to her great credit . will she be successful if she continues to follow this strategy ?
what about when she has to get down to the nitty-gritty ? one of her strengths is her ability to hold the two camps together .
but in fact , this advantage could turn into a disadvantage if it comes time to make difficult decisions and she finds it hard to assert her authority , depending on a consensus for decisions . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have lost popularity among voters .
does the party have the wrong party chairman or is its strategy faulty ? the spd has two problems .
for one , they have the rather " unpleasant " ministries : -lrb- franz -rrb- müntefering at labor and -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrück at finance .
on the other hand , people still are n't sure what this party actually stands for .
is it a reform party , which is how it 's been seen over the past few years under schröder ?
or is it headed back in a more traditional , union-oriented direction ?
-lrb- matthias -rrb- platzeck is still not in the position to explain where the party should go from here and it 's hurting because of that . let 's look at the opposition .
does one actually still exist and if so , is it able to attract any attention to itself ? it 's true that the opposition parties have problems finding an audience .
the left party is mostly concerned with itself these days ; the greens have n't found their direction yet ; and the free democrats are having a hard time making their mark .
these are tough times for the smaller parties .

a question of gender ? britain 's financial times decided to speculate on whether the initial successes of merkel 's chancellorship could be put down to a certain " female touch " she brings to foreign policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.03.2006 " the account of the german role was explicit " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did german intelligence help the us topple saddam hussein ?
the new york times web site reported this week that german agents provided us intelligence with an iraqi defense plan shortly before the us-led invasion .
dw-radio spoke to michael r. gordon , who broke the scoop . michael r. gordon : i did n't produce the american military report .
i faithfully quoted and presented the quotes in the report .
they 're in my book , " cobra ii : the inside story of the invasion and occupation of iraq , " and they 're on the website of the new york times , presented exactly as they are in that report . what strikes me is that the account of the german role is so specific and the description of the institutional arrangements they describe of the german intelligence liaison officer in qatar .
they describe him handing off a document to a defense intelligence agency official .
they say that there were two german agents in baghdad .
there are so many details here that , while i ca n't personally say with 100 percent confidence that they 're right or wrong , i do think that the report on its face appears to be highly credible and warrants more scrutiny and investigation than i think has been carried out so far . dw-radio : how did you end up with this report ? i certainly did n't set out to report on germany .
i have been working on a book on iraq for the last two years .
in the process of working on this book , i was very interested in the research that the american military had done on their iraqi counterparts .
after every war , militaries study the foe and try to figure out what the other guy was doing while they were fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militaries regularly review past actions to learn from them as i accessed a report on this , i saw that there was a very detailed discussion of saddam 's plans to defend baghdad and the pros and cons of saddam 's plan .
and in this section of the report , there was a bit of an aside which explained how this scheme for the defense of baghdad came to the attention of the united states central command , which was general tommy franks ' command .
and in no uncertain terms , this report said that the sketch of the defense arrangements for the defense of baghdad was supplied by a german liaison officer in qatar , and that he gave it to a member of the united states defense intelligence agency who worked in general franks ' headquarters . that caught my attention .
i was really struck by how explicit the account was of the german role and how detailed it was . you 've heard no doubt that a lot of people in germany are saying this was a so-called targeted leak designed to punish the previous german administration for opposing the iraq war .
what is your response ? that was certainly not my intention , nor the intention of anybody who provided access to this .
again , this is a study that i accessed not to learn about germany but to learn about what the iraqis were up to , and which i accessed some months ago .
the german portion of this report is rather small . the reason that this is coming out now is my book is coming out in march .
since completing my book leave i 've returned to the new york times , and i 've begun to harvest the material in the book and make it available to the times ' readers .
if i 'd finished my book a little earlier , it would have come out a few months ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us agents could have been inserted into the embassies of allies ' in baghdad , gordon said this type of cooperation - passing information back and forth - is this at all unusual among intelligence services ? i think it 's entirely understandable and not surprising .
intelligence agencies have relationships which continue despite political problems between capitals , and that 's because the services need to work together even after their regimes change .
in the case of iraq , the united states really did n't have very good intelligence - this i think ought to be clear , i mean , there was no wmd , the us was wrong on that .
and it 's a matter of public record that the united states did n't have a single spy in iraq with direct access to iraq 's wmd programs .

the new york times web site reported this week that german agents provided us intelligence with an iraqi defense plan shortly before the us-led invasion .
dw-radio spoke to michael r. gordon , who broke the scoop . michael r. gordon : i did n't produce the american military report .
i faithfully quoted and presented the quotes in the report .
they 're in my book , " cobra ii : the inside story of the invasion and occupation of iraq , " and they 're on the website of the new york times , presented exactly as they are in that report . what strikes me is that the account of the german role is so specific and the description of the institutional arrangements they describe of the german intelligence liaison officer in qatar .
they describe him handing off a document to a defense intelligence agency official .
they say that there were two german agents in baghdad .
there are so many details here that , while i ca n't personally say with 100 percent confidence that they 're right or wrong , i do think that the report on its face appears to be highly credible and warrants more scrutiny and investigation than i think has been carried out so far . dw-radio : how did you end up with this report ? i certainly did n't set out to report on germany .
i have been working on a book on iraq for the last two years .
in the process of working on this book , i was very interested in the research that the american military had done on their iraqi counterparts .
after every war , militaries study the foe and try to figure out what the other guy was doing while they were fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militaries regularly review past actions to learn from them as i accessed a report on this , i saw that there was a very detailed discussion of saddam 's plans to defend baghdad and the pros and cons of saddam 's plan .
and in this section of the report , there was a bit of an aside which explained how this scheme for the defense of baghdad came to the attention of the united states central command , which was general tommy franks ' command .
and in no uncertain terms , this report said that the sketch of the defense arrangements for the defense of baghdad was supplied by a german liaison officer in qatar , and that he gave it to a member of the united states defense intelligence agency who worked in general franks ' headquarters . that caught my attention .
i was really struck by how explicit the account was of the german role and how detailed it was . you 've heard no doubt that a lot of people in germany are saying this was a so-called targeted leak designed to punish the previous german administration for opposing the iraq war .
what is your response ? that was certainly not my intention , nor the intention of anybody who provided access to this .
again , this is a study that i accessed not to learn about germany but to learn about what the iraqis were up to , and which i accessed some months ago .
the german portion of this report is rather small . the reason that this is coming out now is my book is coming out in march .
since completing my book leave i 've returned to the new york times , and i 've begun to harvest the material in the book and make it available to the times ' readers .
if i 'd finished my book a little earlier , it would have come out a few months ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us agents could have been inserted into the embassies of allies ' in baghdad , gordon said this type of cooperation - passing information back and forth - is this at all unusual among intelligence services ? i think it 's entirely understandable and not surprising .
intelligence agencies have relationships which continue despite political problems between capitals , and that 's because the services need to work together even after their regimes change .
in the case of iraq , the united states really did n't have very good intelligence - this i think ought to be clear , i mean , there was no wmd , the us was wrong on that .
and it 's a matter of public record that the united states did n't have a single spy in iraq with direct access to iraq 's wmd programs .

the new york times web site reported this week that german agents provided us intelligence with an iraqi defense plan shortly before the us-led invasion .
dw-radio spoke to michael r. gordon , who broke the scoop . michael r. gordon : i did n't produce the american military report .
i faithfully quoted and presented the quotes in the report .
they 're in my book , " cobra ii : the inside story of the invasion and occupation of iraq , " and they 're on the website of the new york times , presented exactly as they are in that report . what strikes me is that the account of the german role is so specific and the description of the institutional arrangements they describe of the german intelligence liaison officer in qatar .
they describe him handing off a document to a defense intelligence agency official .
they say that there were two german agents in baghdad .
there are so many details here that , while i ca n't personally say with 100 percent confidence that they 're right or wrong , i do think that the report on its face appears to be highly credible and warrants more scrutiny and investigation than i think has been carried out so far . dw-radio : how did you end up with this report ? i certainly did n't set out to report on germany .
i have been working on a book on iraq for the last two years .
in the process of working on this book , i was very interested in the research that the american military had done on their iraqi counterparts .
after every war , militaries study the foe and try to figure out what the other guy was doing while they were fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militaries regularly review past actions to learn from them as i accessed a report on this , i saw that there was a very detailed discussion of saddam 's plans to defend baghdad and the pros and cons of saddam 's plan .
and in this section of the report , there was a bit of an aside which explained how this scheme for the defense of baghdad came to the attention of the united states central command , which was general tommy franks ' command .
and in no uncertain terms , this report said that the sketch of the defense arrangements for the defense of baghdad was supplied by a german liaison officer in qatar , and that he gave it to a member of the united states defense intelligence agency who worked in general franks ' headquarters . that caught my attention .
i was really struck by how explicit the account was of the german role and how detailed it was . you 've heard no doubt that a lot of people in germany are saying this was a so-called targeted leak designed to punish the previous german administration for opposing the iraq war .
what is your response ? that was certainly not my intention , nor the intention of anybody who provided access to this .
again , this is a study that i accessed not to learn about germany but to learn about what the iraqis were up to , and which i accessed some months ago .
the german portion of this report is rather small . the reason that this is coming out now is my book is coming out in march .
since completing my book leave i 've returned to the new york times , and i 've begun to harvest the material in the book and make it available to the times ' readers .
if i 'd finished my book a little earlier , it would have come out a few months ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us agents could have been inserted into the embassies of allies ' in baghdad , gordon said this type of cooperation - passing information back and forth - is this at all unusual among intelligence services ? i think it 's entirely understandable and not surprising .

there have been more than 100 cases of h5n1-infected wild birds found in germany . the finding could increase concern that the virus could spread to other species in europe as it has in several cases in other parts of the world . " it has been known for some time that cats can become infected by eating infected birds , " thomas mettenleiter , president of the institute , told reuters . several large cats in asian zoos have died after being fed infected birds and domestic cats have been shown to be especially vulnerable to the disease , the institute said . the h5n1 strain , which has caused illness and even fatalities in humans in turkey and asia , has been detected in a leopard , tigers , civet cats and two domestic cats in thailand .
but the world health organization said in 2004 that the infection of cats was unlikely to enhance the risks to humans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers gather dead birds on the island of rügen the the federal research institute for animal health has called on cat owners on the german island to keep their animals away from the area where the infection seems to be centered and to take special hygenic precautions . " a transmission , which can not be completely ruled out , would only be possible through very intimate contact with an infected animal , " said mettenleiter . further spread among birds in the bird population , the disease was spreading further across europe and africa . france began vaccinating 700,000 domestic ducks and geese on farms after it announced at the weekend the first outbreak of h5n1 bird flu in a european union poultry farm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wild geese fly over a decontamination area in eastern france the commercial repercussions of the french outbreak were driven home tuesday as the government announced that some 30 countries were now restricting or banning imports of poultry and poultry products from france . sweden for the first time detected in ducks an unidentified strain of bird flu , feared to be the h5n1 strain . initial tests at sweden 's the national veterinary institute " show that we 're probably talking about the same virus that has been spreading in russia and china , " said the swedish agriculture board . elsewhere , h5n1 was detected for the first time in bosnia , the southern german state of bavaria and a poultry farm in southwestern russia where 103,000 birds were reported to have died in a week . britain said it was unlikely to escape .
" i would anticipate that avian flu will arrive at some point in the uk , " said british chief scientific advisor professor sir david king , predicting that the disease would stay for at least five years . " we are talking about the possibility of this disease being endemic here in the uk as it did in china .
it is a long-term factor , " he told the bbc . africa but world experts fretted mostly about africa , where many countries are ill equipped to detect or impede the spread of the disease . ethiopian officials were testing some of more than 6,000 chickens that died suddenly on a poultry farm in endibir 175 kilometers -lrb- 108 miles -rrb- southwest of addis ababa .
a day earlier the world organization for animal health -lrb- oie -rrb- reported the first cases of h5n1 in niger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strain of the h5n1 bird flu virus has been found in poultry stocks in nigeria in neighboring nigeria - where more than 300,000 infected fowl have already died or been slaughtered - h5n1 was detected in two more states in the north .
in the kenyan capital nairobi , the authorities said initial tests on 400 dead chickens showed no sign of bird flu .
cases of h5n1 have also been reported in egypt . human deaths have already been recorded after the disease jumped from bird to human in cambodia , china , indonesia , iraq , thailand , turkey and vietnam .

but now , there 's an expectation that she will transfer this success to the domestic front , and especially the economy , which is sorely in need of sustained growth after years of sub-par performance . merkel could extend her honeymoon with the german people , the pundits say , but only if she can deliver the cuts in unemployment that her government has promised . it 's a tall order .
while current economic data point to a recovery , experts say it 's a shaky one at best . jobless figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : february 's unemployment statistics pointed to a slight recovery february 's jobless figures , released just as merkel celebrated her first 100 days as chancellor , were n't all bad news .
although the unadjusted rate of unemployment showed a 12 percent increase to 5.05 million , when adjusted for seasonal swings , the number of unemployed people fell roughly 5,000 to 4.695 million .
this decrease was less than the fall of 20,000 expected by economists , however . on the plus side , business confidence in germany is at a 14-year high point and consumers are feeling increasingly optimistic as the recovery in the eurozone 's biggest economy gathers pace . still , experts are wary of being overly optimistic , cautioning that the current " feel-good " sentiment had yet to be reflected in real economic data . slow progress ? many observers have voiced fears that the forced political alliance between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will result in stagnation on pressing economic issues .

the body called for new laws to control spies . in a report examining the possible role of european countries in the alleged illegal cia transfer of terrorist suspects and secret detentions , the council of europe criticized its member states for a lack of legislative control of foreign secret services operating on their territory . " it would appear that most of europe is a happy hunting ground for foreign security services , " secretary general terry davis told a news conference after the report 's release at the body 's headquarters in the french city of strasbourg .
" hardly any country has any legal provisions to ensure an effective oversight over the activities of foreign security services on their territory . " the report did not produce evidence that the us had run secret jails in europe .
however , it called for better oversight and regulation by national parliaments and judicial bodies when human rights abuses were suspected and better controls of foreign intelligence services .
" europe 's skies appear to be excessively open , " davis said .
" very few countries seem to have adopted an adequate and effective way to monitor who and what is transiting through their airports and airspace .
indeed , no member state appears to have established any kind of procedure in order to assess whether civil aircraft are used for purposes which would be incompatible with internationally recognized human rights standards . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in europe , only hungary has effective laws to monitor foreign secret services , davis said " this is alarming because the explanations provided on the specific point of controls over aircraft allegedly used for rendition show that existing procedures do not provide adequate safeguards against abuse , " he said .
lack of cooperation davis also criticized four of the council 's 46 members - italy , bosnia-herzegovina , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , and poland - for their inadequate response to the body 's investigation into cia renditions .
he said he would continue probing those countries .
he praised germany , saying that of the four countries whose responses he had been most concerned to receive due to possible events there , it was the only one that had responded expansively to the questionnaire sent to the member states . davis ' is one of two investigations into the issue of cia rendition and secret jails that the council is carrying out .

" for us it 's one of the last real tests before we fly out to germany , one that we hope will build our confidence . " lippi added that he hoped the italy fans would get behind his team at the artemio franchi stadium , home of serie a side fiorentina .
" we are playing in florence where the people are passionate about soccer and a lot will depend on their support . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a young side " germany coach jürgen klinsmann is playing down his side 's chances of victory in wednesday 's match .
" italy have quality in every position , and lippi 's squad is more mature and more experienced than ours , " said the 41-year-old , who took control of germany in july 2004 .
" they have a team full of champions while we are a young side looking for its identity , one that plays aggressive , attacking soccer . " restructuring italian squad klinsmann expressed his sadness over the injury to italy 's talismanic number 10 francesco totti , whose chances of featuring in germany are hanging in the balance after he broke a bone in his left leg . " i 'm sad to see him injured , he 's an exceptional player , " he said .
" however , alessandro del piero can replace him or lippi can change his system .
he has players who can adapt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian soccer star , francesco totti the last time germany saw off one of the game 's so-called soccer heavyweights was back in october 2000 , when they beat england 1-0 in a 2002 world cup qualifier , and klinsmann is desperate to put that right .
" we want to put an end to our negative run against big name opposition , " he said . drawing on klinsmann 's experience klinsmann knows what it takes to unlock an italian defense having played for inter milan from 1989 to 1992 .
he scored 36 goals and helped inter win the uefa cup in 1991 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team coach , jürgen klinsmann germany 's first-choice goalkeeper oliver kahn has been ruled out due to a thigh strain , so arsenal 's jens lehmann will deputize , while stuttgart keeper timo hildebrand will act as lehmann 's understudy .
with italy 's left-sided defender gianluca zambrotta unavailable , fiorentina defender manuel pasqual could make his first appearance for italy in front of his home crowd . wednesday 's match revives memories of the classic 1982 world cup final in spain which italy won 3-1 .

the body called for new laws to control spies . in a report examining the possible role of european countries in the alleged illegal cia transfer of terrorist suspects and secret detentions , the council of europe criticized its member states for a lack of legislative control of foreign secret services operating on their territory . " it would appear that most of europe is a happy hunting ground for foreign security services , " secretary general terry davis told a news conference after the report 's release at the body 's headquarters in the french city of strasbourg .
" hardly any country has any legal provisions to ensure an effective oversight over the activities of foreign security services on their territory . " the report did not produce evidence that the us had run secret jails in europe .
however , it called for better oversight and regulation by national parliaments and judicial bodies when human rights abuses were suspected and better controls of foreign intelligence services .
" europe 's skies appear to be excessively open , " davis said .
" very few countries seem to have adopted an adequate and effective way to monitor who and what is transiting through their airports and airspace .
indeed , no member state appears to have established any kind of procedure in order to assess whether civil aircraft are used for purposes which would be incompatible with internationally recognized human rights standards . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in europe , only hungary has effective laws to monitor foreign secret services , davis said " this is alarming because the explanations provided on the specific point of controls over aircraft allegedly used for rendition show that existing procedures do not provide adequate safeguards against abuse , " he said .
lack of cooperation davis also criticized four of the council 's 46 members - italy , bosnia-herzegovina , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , and poland - for their inadequate response to the body 's investigation into cia renditions .
he said he would continue probing those countries .
he praised germany , saying that of the four countries whose responses he had been most concerned to receive due to possible events there , it was the only one that had responded expansively to the questionnaire sent to the member states . davis ' is one of two investigations into the issue of cia rendition and secret jails that the council is carrying out .
swiss senator dick marty presented preliminary results last week in which he also criticized governments for not cooperating adequately . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's cia investigation lacks concrete evidence despite receiving requested status reports from all 46 council of europe members , european investigators have yet to find any hard evidence of cia rendition flights or secret prisons .

the body called for new laws to control spies . in a report examining the possible role of european countries in the alleged illegal cia transfer of terrorist suspects and secret detentions , the council of europe criticized its member states for a lack of legislative control of foreign secret services operating on their territory . " it would appear that most of europe is a happy hunting ground for foreign security services , " secretary general terry davis told a news conference after the report 's release at the body 's headquarters in the french city of strasbourg .
" hardly any country has any legal provisions to ensure an effective oversight over the activities of foreign security services on their territory . " the report did not produce evidence that the us had run secret jails in europe .
however , it called for better oversight and regulation by national parliaments and judicial bodies when human rights abuses were suspected and better controls of foreign intelligence services .
" europe 's skies appear to be excessively open , " davis said .
" very few countries seem to have adopted an adequate and effective way to monitor who and what is transiting through their airports and airspace .
indeed , no member state appears to have established any kind of procedure in order to assess whether civil aircraft are used for purposes which would be incompatible with internationally recognized human rights standards . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in europe , only hungary has effective laws to monitor foreign secret services , davis said " this is alarming because the explanations provided on the specific point of controls over aircraft allegedly used for rendition show that existing procedures do not provide adequate safeguards against abuse , " he said .
lack of cooperation davis also criticized four of the council 's 46 members - italy , bosnia-herzegovina , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , and poland - for their inadequate response to the body 's investigation into cia renditions .
he said he would continue probing those countries .
he praised germany , saying that of the four countries whose responses he had been most concerned to receive due to possible events there , it was the only one that had responded expansively to the questionnaire sent to the member states . davis ' is one of two investigations into the issue of cia rendition and secret jails that the council is carrying out .

" from warsaw to london and davos , in jerusalem and ramallah , merkel succeeded in combining the diplomatic inheritance of her mentor , helmut kohl , with that of her predecessor , gerhard schröder - the european and atlantic tradition of the one , and the defense of national interests of the other , " the paper commented .
a question of gender ? britain 's financial times decided to speculate on whether the initial successes of merkel 's chancellorship could be put down to a certain " female touch " she brings to foreign policy .

"
everyone 's waiting for merkel to tackle issues such as unemployment and the financing of health care - issues where the cdu and the spd do not at all see eye to eye , the paper wrote . unemployment the true test britain 's the times , however , said that merkel 's aura has already begun to fade , and predicted that the issue of unemployment will be her undoing .
" dozens of bouquets have been prepared to mark her 100th day as chancellor , but the only number that seemed to count was the 5,048,000 on the dole , " the paper wrote .
on the domestic front , merkel has changed the law to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 and increase vat by three points , but according to the times , " neither initiative addresses the dilemma of how to translate higher growth - now predicted to be 1.5 percent this year - into jobs .

but the paper feared that this would not be enough in the long run , and predicted that merkel - who it described as more of a social democrat in some points than the social democrats themselves - risks frustrating her grand coalition partners . the paris-based paper libération also foresaw difficulties for merkel in the future , mainly because , as it commented , " she has not even had to get to grips with the bigger stones lying in her path .

this decrease was less than the fall of 20,000 expected by economists , however . on the plus side , business confidence in germany is at a 14-year high point and consumers are feeling increasingly optimistic as the recovery in the eurozone 's biggest economy gathers pace . still , experts are wary of being overly optimistic , cautioning that the current " feel-good " sentiment had yet to be reflected in real economic data . slow progress ? many observers have voiced fears that the forced political alliance between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will result in stagnation on pressing economic issues .

but now , there 's an expectation that she will transfer this success to the domestic front , and especially the economy , which is sorely in need of sustained growth after years of sub-par performance . merkel could extend her honeymoon with the german people , the pundits say , but only if she can deliver the cuts in unemployment that her government has promised . it 's a tall order .
while current economic data point to a recovery , experts say it 's a shaky one at best . jobless figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : february 's unemployment statistics pointed to a slight recovery february 's jobless figures , released just as merkel celebrated her first 100 days as chancellor , were n't all bad news .
although the unadjusted rate of unemployment showed a 12 percent increase to 5.05 million , when adjusted for seasonal swings , the number of unemployed people fell roughly 5,000 to 4.695 million .
this decrease was less than the fall of 20,000 expected by economists , however . on the plus side , business confidence in germany is at a 14-year high point and consumers are feeling increasingly optimistic as the recovery in the eurozone 's biggest economy gathers pace . still , experts are wary of being overly optimistic , cautioning that the current " feel-good " sentiment had yet to be reflected in real economic data . slow progress ? many observers have voiced fears that the forced political alliance between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will result in stagnation on pressing economic issues . " when it comes to economics , i 'm not disappointed , because i did n't expect too much to begin with , " said paul clemens friedhoff , economics expert for the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" the two partners in this coalition are far from singing the same song . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer spending is going up now , but experts say that will change with the planned vat hike the cdu and spd have managed to agree on a 25-billion euro -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- investment program to jump-start the economy , but critics say the program will be ineffectual come next year when consumer spending is expected to dip due to the cdu 's three-percent increase in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- . no shortage of issues merkel 's coalition will also have to make up its mind on how to regulate the low-wage sector .
a debate about the introduction of a minimum wage for all sectors is in full swing now , but a decision is not expected before the second half of this year . among other economic issues demanding the government 's attention is a corporate tax reform - on the back burner for the moment because the coalition partners can ’ t agree on a sustainable model . there 's also the issue of fresh borrowing .
in 2006 , over 38 billion euros will be added to germany 's pile of debt , with a turnaround on this front only expected in 2007 . a more immediate concern is the current atmosphere of discontent , with tens of thousands of public-sector employees , including garbage collectors , hospital staff and child-care workers on strike all around the country in protest against longer working hours and cuts in bonuses . " if we are seeing a recovery in germany it is not a very strong one , " said adam posen , an economist at the institute for international economics in washington .
" merkel will ultimately be judged on whether she can push through reforms and deliver on the economy .

western classical music is rising fast - and germany has plans to get in on the ground floor of a huge culture market . in the booming southern chinese province of guangdong , the world 's largest piano factory , pearl river , is planning to roll out its one-millionth instrument this march .
china does n't just build pianos , though .
it plays them - sometimes on the world stage . that was n't always the case .
young chinese virtuosos like lang lang have had international success in recent years , but western music first entered chinese concert halls in the 1980s , after the country relaxed controls on its economy .
now , those chinese who can afford it make sure their only child learns a western music instrument . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese piano virtuoso lang lang as part of the trend , the popularity of classical music is soaring in china .
mozart , whose 250th anniversary is being celebrated throughout the world in 2006 , is currently high on the list of most-beloved western composers . this interest in european music has not gone unnoticed by the german music council , germany 's largest umbrella association for music .
the council 's president , martin krüger , recently visited china , with the aim of improving musical ties between the two countries . wagner 's ' ring ' in china german music has been particularly popular in china recently .
in october , 2005 , the staatstheater nuremberg performed richard wagner 's monumental ring cycle in its entirety .
the stuttgart radio orchestra was featured at the beijing music festival , as was the berlin symphonic orchestra , which also went on to perform in shanghai . according to krüger , talks between the german music council and its chinese equivalent were fruitful , especially on the topic of an exchange program between the two nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right now , austrian composer mozart is big in china " our current plan is nothing new .
the special part is that it is taking place at an official , national level , " krüger said .
" questions of protocol play a big role in china . " improving musical ties now , the german music council has named a german-trained chinese musician , yang lin , to represent the council in china .
the main goal of the cooperation is to improve musical ties between the two countries .
to this end , it has already set up a few joint projects , including agreeing to form a german-chinese ensemble that would play at appropriate occasions - for example , the opening of the chinese cultural center in berlin .
and with a german-chinese year of culture planned for 2007 , the groups also planned to create a joint youth symphony orchestra . matthias von hein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sino-german pop walks on the wild side ever heard a german band singing beatles hits in chinese ?

the new york times web site reported this week that german agents provided us intelligence with an iraqi defense plan shortly before the us-led invasion .
dw-radio spoke to michael r. gordon , who broke the scoop . michael r. gordon : i did n't produce the american military report .
i faithfully quoted and presented the quotes in the report .
they 're in my book , " cobra ii : the inside story of the invasion and occupation of iraq , " and they 're on the website of the new york times , presented exactly as they are in that report . what strikes me is that the account of the german role is so specific and the description of the institutional arrangements they describe of the german intelligence liaison officer in qatar .
they describe him handing off a document to a defense intelligence agency official .
they say that there were two german agents in baghdad .
there are so many details here that , while i ca n't personally say with 100 percent confidence that they 're right or wrong , i do think that the report on its face appears to be highly credible and warrants more scrutiny and investigation than i think has been carried out so far . dw-radio : how did you end up with this report ? i certainly did n't set out to report on germany .
i have been working on a book on iraq for the last two years .
in the process of working on this book , i was very interested in the research that the american military had done on their iraqi counterparts .
after every war , militaries study the foe and try to figure out what the other guy was doing while they were fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militaries regularly review past actions to learn from them as i accessed a report on this , i saw that there was a very detailed discussion of saddam 's plans to defend baghdad and the pros and cons of saddam 's plan .
and in this section of the report , there was a bit of an aside which explained how this scheme for the defense of baghdad came to the attention of the united states central command , which was general tommy franks ' command .
and in no uncertain terms , this report said that the sketch of the defense arrangements for the defense of baghdad was supplied by a german liaison officer in qatar , and that he gave it to a member of the united states defense intelligence agency who worked in general franks ' headquarters . that caught my attention .
i was really struck by how explicit the account was of the german role and how detailed it was . you 've heard no doubt that a lot of people in germany are saying this was a so-called targeted leak designed to punish the previous german administration for opposing the iraq war .
what is your response ? that was certainly not my intention , nor the intention of anybody who provided access to this .
again , this is a study that i accessed not to learn about germany but to learn about what the iraqis were up to , and which i accessed some months ago .
the german portion of this report is rather small . the reason that this is coming out now is my book is coming out in march .
since completing my book leave i 've returned to the new york times , and i 've begun to harvest the material in the book and make it available to the times ' readers .
if i 'd finished my book a little earlier , it would have come out a few months ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us agents could have been inserted into the embassies of allies ' in baghdad , gordon said this type of cooperation - passing information back and forth - is this at all unusual among intelligence services ? i think it 's entirely understandable and not surprising .
intelligence agencies have relationships which continue despite political problems between capitals , and that 's because the services need to work together even after their regimes change .
in the case of iraq , the united states really did n't have very good intelligence - this i think ought to be clear , i mean , there was no wmd , the us was wrong on that .
and it 's a matter of public record that the united states did n't have a single spy in iraq with direct access to iraq 's wmd programs .
nor was the intelligence on the south particularly good .
it 'd be quite understandable that the americans would want to rely on those allies , such as germany , which did have an embassy in baghdad and therefore the capacity to insert agents under diplomatic cover .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael gordon , a new york times reporter embedded with coalition forces at camp doha , kuwait nor do i find it surprising that the german government has acknowledged it did provide some limited support to the american military .
despite its opposition to the war , germany did nothing to obstruct the american military preparations and indirectly helped in a number of ways : safeguarding sea lanes , facilitating the transport of american forces from germany that fought in the war , providing troops in kuwait to protect kuwaiti citizens against chemical weapons attacks , not objecting to nato efforts to send awacs or patriot missile defense interceptors to turkey . germany 's posture was basically : they were n't going to too directly assist the war effort , but they were n't going to frustrate it either . steve zwick interviewed michael r. gordon -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : who 's taking aim at berlin ?

the new york times web site reported this week that german agents provided us intelligence with an iraqi defense plan shortly before the us-led invasion .
dw-radio spoke to michael r. gordon , who broke the scoop . michael r. gordon : i did n't produce the american military report .
i faithfully quoted and presented the quotes in the report .
they 're in my book , " cobra ii : the inside story of the invasion and occupation of iraq , " and they 're on the website of the new york times , presented exactly as they are in that report . what strikes me is that the account of the german role is so specific and the description of the institutional arrangements they describe of the german intelligence liaison officer in qatar .
they describe him handing off a document to a defense intelligence agency official .
they say that there were two german agents in baghdad .
there are so many details here that , while i ca n't personally say with 100 percent confidence that they 're right or wrong , i do think that the report on its face appears to be highly credible and warrants more scrutiny and investigation than i think has been carried out so far . dw-radio : how did you end up with this report ? i certainly did n't set out to report on germany .
i have been working on a book on iraq for the last two years .
in the process of working on this book , i was very interested in the research that the american military had done on their iraqi counterparts .
after every war , militaries study the foe and try to figure out what the other guy was doing while they were fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militaries regularly review past actions to learn from them as i accessed a report on this , i saw that there was a very detailed discussion of saddam 's plans to defend baghdad and the pros and cons of saddam 's plan .
and in this section of the report , there was a bit of an aside which explained how this scheme for the defense of baghdad came to the attention of the united states central command , which was general tommy franks ' command .
and in no uncertain terms , this report said that the sketch of the defense arrangements for the defense of baghdad was supplied by a german liaison officer in qatar , and that he gave it to a member of the united states defense intelligence agency who worked in general franks ' headquarters . that caught my attention .
i was really struck by how explicit the account was of the german role and how detailed it was . you 've heard no doubt that a lot of people in germany are saying this was a so-called targeted leak designed to punish the previous german administration for opposing the iraq war .
what is your response ? that was certainly not my intention , nor the intention of anybody who provided access to this .
again , this is a study that i accessed not to learn about germany but to learn about what the iraqis were up to , and which i accessed some months ago .
the german portion of this report is rather small . the reason that this is coming out now is my book is coming out in march .
since completing my book leave i 've returned to the new york times , and i 've begun to harvest the material in the book and make it available to the times ' readers .
if i 'd finished my book a little earlier , it would have come out a few months ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us agents could have been inserted into the embassies of allies ' in baghdad , gordon said this type of cooperation - passing information back and forth - is this at all unusual among intelligence services ? i think it 's entirely understandable and not surprising .
intelligence agencies have relationships which continue despite political problems between capitals , and that 's because the services need to work together even after their regimes change .
in the case of iraq , the united states really did n't have very good intelligence - this i think ought to be clear , i mean , there was no wmd , the us was wrong on that .
and it 's a matter of public record that the united states did n't have a single spy in iraq with direct access to iraq 's wmd programs .
nor was the intelligence on the south particularly good .
it 'd be quite understandable that the americans would want to rely on those allies , such as germany , which did have an embassy in baghdad and therefore the capacity to insert agents under diplomatic cover .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael gordon , a new york times reporter embedded with coalition forces at camp doha , kuwait nor do i find it surprising that the german government has acknowledged it did provide some limited support to the american military .
despite its opposition to the war , germany did nothing to obstruct the american military preparations and indirectly helped in a number of ways : safeguarding sea lanes , facilitating the transport of american forces from germany that fought in the war , providing troops in kuwait to protect kuwaiti citizens against chemical weapons attacks , not objecting to nato efforts to send awacs or patriot missile defense interceptors to turkey . germany 's posture was basically : they were n't going to too directly assist the war effort , but they were n't going to frustrate it either . steve zwick interviewed michael r. gordon -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : who 's taking aim at berlin ?

the new york times web site reported this week that german agents provided us intelligence with an iraqi defense plan shortly before the us-led invasion .
dw-radio spoke to michael r. gordon , who broke the scoop . michael r. gordon : i did n't produce the american military report .
i faithfully quoted and presented the quotes in the report .
they 're in my book , " cobra ii : the inside story of the invasion and occupation of iraq , " and they 're on the website of the new york times , presented exactly as they are in that report . what strikes me is that the account of the german role is so specific and the description of the institutional arrangements they describe of the german intelligence liaison officer in qatar .
they describe him handing off a document to a defense intelligence agency official .
they say that there were two german agents in baghdad .
there are so many details here that , while i ca n't personally say with 100 percent confidence that they 're right or wrong , i do think that the report on its face appears to be highly credible and warrants more scrutiny and investigation than i think has been carried out so far . dw-radio : how did you end up with this report ? i certainly did n't set out to report on germany .
i have been working on a book on iraq for the last two years .
in the process of working on this book , i was very interested in the research that the american military had done on their iraqi counterparts .
after every war , militaries study the foe and try to figure out what the other guy was doing while they were fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militaries regularly review past actions to learn from them as i accessed a report on this , i saw that there was a very detailed discussion of saddam 's plans to defend baghdad and the pros and cons of saddam 's plan .
and in this section of the report , there was a bit of an aside which explained how this scheme for the defense of baghdad came to the attention of the united states central command , which was general tommy franks ' command .
and in no uncertain terms , this report said that the sketch of the defense arrangements for the defense of baghdad was supplied by a german liaison officer in qatar , and that he gave it to a member of the united states defense intelligence agency who worked in general franks ' headquarters . that caught my attention .
i was really struck by how explicit the account was of the german role and how detailed it was . you 've heard no doubt that a lot of people in germany are saying this was a so-called targeted leak designed to punish the previous german administration for opposing the iraq war .
what is your response ? that was certainly not my intention , nor the intention of anybody who provided access to this .
again , this is a study that i accessed not to learn about germany but to learn about what the iraqis were up to , and which i accessed some months ago .
the german portion of this report is rather small . the reason that this is coming out now is my book is coming out in march .
since completing my book leave i 've returned to the new york times , and i 've begun to harvest the material in the book and make it available to the times ' readers .
if i 'd finished my book a little earlier , it would have come out a few months ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us agents could have been inserted into the embassies of allies ' in baghdad , gordon said this type of cooperation - passing information back and forth - is this at all unusual among intelligence services ? i think it 's entirely understandable and not surprising .
intelligence agencies have relationships which continue despite political problems between capitals , and that 's because the services need to work together even after their regimes change .
in the case of iraq , the united states really did n't have very good intelligence - this i think ought to be clear , i mean , there was no wmd , the us was wrong on that .
and it 's a matter of public record that the united states did n't have a single spy in iraq with direct access to iraq 's wmd programs .
nor was the intelligence on the south particularly good .
it 'd be quite understandable that the americans would want to rely on those allies , such as germany , which did have an embassy in baghdad and therefore the capacity to insert agents under diplomatic cover .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael gordon , a new york times reporter embedded with coalition forces at camp doha , kuwait nor do i find it surprising that the german government has acknowledged it did provide some limited support to the american military .
despite its opposition to the war , germany did nothing to obstruct the american military preparations and indirectly helped in a number of ways : safeguarding sea lanes , facilitating the transport of american forces from germany that fought in the war , providing troops in kuwait to protect kuwaiti citizens against chemical weapons attacks , not objecting to nato efforts to send awacs or patriot missile defense interceptors to turkey . germany 's posture was basically : they were n't going to too directly assist the war effort , but they were n't going to frustrate it either . steve zwick interviewed michael r. gordon -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : who 's taking aim at berlin ?

matters worsened for the visitors three minutes later . del piero 's quickly-taken free-kick surprised the german back four and sent gilardino racing clear towards goal .
the 23-year-old ac milan striker looked up and unselfishly slid the ball across to give toni a tap-in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luca toni celebrated after just seven minutes italy might have had a third moments later when del piero 's crossed free-kick found gilardino unmarked , but he failed by just a few inches to make a connection . germany then sliced italy open with their first genuine attack , but gianluigi buffon pulled off a superb save to keep out sebastian deisler 's vicious drive . de rossi made it 3-0 in the 39th minute , applying the finishing touch to mauro camoranesi 's cross as the german defense suffered another alarming lapse in concentration . " it 's i n explicable " limiting the damage was germany 's task now , but they leaked another goal in the 56th minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniele de rossi -lrb- right -rrb- and robert huth -lrb- left -rrb- gilardino 's cross from the left was headed back across goal by camoranesi and del piero dived low to head past a helpless lehmann . huth 's late strike was of little consolation for the poor germans . " it 's inexplicable how one can fall back so quickly , " said german captain michael ballack , who added that italy 's early lead had made his team insecure .
" the mistakes we made were punished hard .
thankfully there will be another match in three weeks and then it 's going to be a different german national team . " national coach jürgen klinsmann also said that he still had high hopes for his team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann " of course we 're disappointed - we had high hopes and there were smashed within the first minutes , " said german national coach jürgen klinsmann .
" it was a frustrating lesson for us , but we believe in this team and we believe in the young players .
we 're confident that everything will work in 100 days . " but the weak performance had commentators worried about the team 's readiness to succeed in the world cup this summer at home . " if the italians were to really go for it , germany would look even worse , " said reinhold beckmann , the match 's commentator for german public broadcaster ard .
" the real question is whether the german team is just too young . " the team still has three chances to prove that it is ready for the world cup .
on march 22 , it will face the us , followed by matches against japan on may 30 and colombia on june 2 . the german team opens the world cup on june 9 against costa rica . hooliga n s n ot impressed by pope 's appeal before the match , a message by pope benedict xvi called for an end to racist chanting and emblems at football matches and urged football fans to adopt " respect and dialogue " ahead of this summer 's world cup in his native germany . both nations ' football authorities had dedicated the match to opposing all forms of racial violence .
racism has been a serious problem in italy 's elite seria a league this season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-born pope got a world cup pennant from german soccer legend franz beckenbauer last october the 78-year-old pontiff said he appreciated the initiative to combat racial discrimination , which he said would " consolidate awareness of the important educative function of sport in the service of solidarity and peace . " but before the match , german and italian hooligans tried to start a fight and fired off signal rockets .
according to the german soccer federation , 900 tickets had been sold to german fans , with 600 seated in a closed-off area .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : merkel 's record so far it 's the economy , angela press review : merkel 's first 100 days opinion : 100 days of angela merkel new german government has nation in buoyant mood germany -pipe- 01.03.2006 chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been enjoying good press from journalists of all stripes the dire predictions once made about germany 's current " grand coalition " government have proven untrue .
on the contrary , harmony is the watchword so far .
political scientist klaus detterbeck looks back and ahead . dw-world : the grand coalition 's grace period - its first hundred days - is now over .
one gets the impression that the government has made a better impression than was once expected . klaus detterbeck : i think so too .
surveys regarding angela merkel and the christian democrats are good right now .
there are two reasons for this relatively good start for the grand coalition .
first , there have been successes , like chancellor merkel 's trip to the us , to russia and at the eu summit , as well as some overall positive economic developments .
secondly , the populace has given the chancellor something of an advance when it comes to trust .
people are willing to give this coalition some time to find its footing .
a majority of people have the feeling that a solid , capable team is at the helm , as opposed to that of the last schröder government . so are the individuals in the government less important than the " team " as a whole ? yes , you could say that .
that has to do with chancellor merkel 's role as a director .
she is not a big personality out front , who calls all the shots .
rather she 's the person who steers the entire team .
that makes her different than schröder , who was something of a showman who pranced on the political stage . despite the laurels , has the country really progressed toward finding solutions to some of its problems ? it 's true that there have been no big decisions made as yet .
there is this positive impression , a positive undertone , but the real foundation for new policies has n't yet been laid .
negotiations still have to take place about federalism reform , and other big reform projects have yet to be tackled . angela merkel enjoys a good deal of sympathy from journalists of all stripes .
she is also respected by foreign leaders .
what is different about her ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular with journalists these days she leaves the impression of being someone who does solid work and does n't push her way to the front .
instead , she tries to enact good policies for the good of the country .
in the grand coalition , she is engaging in the politics of inclusion .
that 's to her great credit . will she be successful if she continues to follow this strategy ?
what about when she has to get down to the nitty-gritty ? one of her strengths is her ability to hold the two camps together .
but in fact , this advantage could turn into a disadvantage if it comes time to make difficult decisions and she finds it hard to assert her authority , depending on a consensus for decisions . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have lost popularity among voters .
does the party have the wrong party chairman or is its strategy faulty ? the spd has two problems .
for one , they have the rather " unpleasant " ministries : -lrb- franz -rrb- müntefering at labor and -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrück at finance .
on the other hand , people still are n't sure what this party actually stands for .
is it a reform party , which is how it 's been seen over the past few years under schröder ?
or is it headed back in a more traditional , union-oriented direction ?
-lrb- matthias -rrb- platzeck is still not in the position to explain where the party should go from here and it 's hurting because of that . let 's look at the opposition .
does one actually still exist and if so , is it able to attract any attention to itself ? it 's true that the opposition parties have problems finding an audience .
the left party is mostly concerned with itself these days ; the greens have n't found their direction yet ; and the free democrats are having a hard time making their mark .
these are tough times for the smaller parties .
we 'll have to see how they do at the end of march , when there are elections in rheinland-palatinate , saxony-anhalt and baden-württemberg . political scientist klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . steffen leidel spoke with klaus detterbeck send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges recovery and resolve in first speech angela merkel gave her first speech to parliament as german chancellor wednesday and spoke of a strong germany full of opportunities and a country that would stand firm on the issues of justice and equal rights .
-lrb- nov .
30 , 2005 -rrb- new german government has nation in buoyant mood while the concrete achievements of germany 's " grand coalition " government in its first 100 days might be debatable , they 've left the country in a better mood .
surveys show increased confidence about the future .
-lrb- feb .
28 , 2006 -rrb- merkel asks cdu to start soul-searching german chancellor angela merkel has called for her party to review its basic beliefs and renew its emphasis , appealing for more " solidarity . "

on the contrary , harmony is the watchword so far .
political scientist klaus detterbeck looks back and ahead . dw-world : the grand coalition 's grace period - its first hundred days - is now over .
one gets the impression that the government has made a better impression than was once expected . klaus detterbeck : i think so too .
surveys regarding angela merkel and the christian democrats are good right now .
there are two reasons for this relatively good start for the grand coalition .
first , there have been successes , like chancellor merkel 's trip to the us , to russia and at the eu summit , as well as some overall positive economic developments .
secondly , the populace has given the chancellor something of an advance when it comes to trust .
people are willing to give this coalition some time to find its footing .
a majority of people have the feeling that a solid , capable team is at the helm , as opposed to that of the last schröder government . so are the individuals in the government less important than the " team " as a whole ? yes , you could say that .
that has to do with chancellor merkel 's role as a director .
she is not a big personality out front , who calls all the shots .
rather she 's the person who steers the entire team .
that makes her different than schröder , who was something of a showman who pranced on the political stage . despite the laurels , has the country really progressed toward finding solutions to some of its problems ? it 's true that there have been no big decisions made as yet .
there is this positive impression , a positive undertone , but the real foundation for new policies has n't yet been laid .
negotiations still have to take place about federalism reform , and other big reform projects have yet to be tackled . angela merkel enjoys a good deal of sympathy from journalists of all stripes .
she is also respected by foreign leaders .
what is different about her ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular with journalists these days she leaves the impression of being someone who does solid work and does n't push her way to the front .
instead , she tries to enact good policies for the good of the country .
in the grand coalition , she is engaging in the politics of inclusion .
that 's to her great credit . will she be successful if she continues to follow this strategy ?
what about when she has to get down to the nitty-gritty ? one of her strengths is her ability to hold the two camps together .
but in fact , this advantage could turn into a disadvantage if it comes time to make difficult decisions and she finds it hard to assert her authority , depending on a consensus for decisions . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have lost popularity among voters .
does the party have the wrong party chairman or is its strategy faulty ? the spd has two problems .
for one , they have the rather " unpleasant " ministries : -lrb- franz -rrb- müntefering at labor and -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrück at finance .
on the other hand , people still are n't sure what this party actually stands for .
is it a reform party , which is how it 's been seen over the past few years under schröder ?
or is it headed back in a more traditional , union-oriented direction ?
-lrb- matthias -rrb- platzeck is still not in the position to explain where the party should go from here and it 's hurting because of that . let 's look at the opposition .
does one actually still exist and if so , is it able to attract any attention to itself ? it 's true that the opposition parties have problems finding an audience .
the left party is mostly concerned with itself these days ; the greens have n't found their direction yet ; and the free democrats are having a hard time making their mark .
these are tough times for the smaller parties .
we 'll have to see how they do at the end of march , when there are elections in rheinland-palatinate , saxony-anhalt and baden-württemberg . political scientist klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . steffen leidel spoke with klaus detterbeck send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges recovery and resolve in first speech angela merkel gave her first speech to parliament as german chancellor wednesday and spoke of a strong germany full of opportunities and a country that would stand firm on the issues of justice and equal rights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.03.2006 investing in the future face of automobiles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german car-makers want to make emissions a thing of the past although germany might be lagging a little on the international research and development stage , when it comes to the evolution of the automobile , the nation is keen to be in pole position . in this land of sophisticated motoring and unrestricted freeway speed limits , home to the likes of mercedes , volkswagen , bmw et al . , every seventh job is in some way related to the automobile industry .
as such , it invests more in research and development than any other branch in germany . the development race is a moveable feast , an ongoing process of honing and fine-tuning the already state-of-the-art .
as fashions shift , so too do motorized visions .
the latest comes in the form of a zero-emissions hydrogen-fuelled model , which - although still in its infant stages of development - has already generated a climate of intense competition among the big name manufacturers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling up on a tank load of diesel until the motor of the future is ready to hit the road -lrb- and that is not expected for at least another 15 years -rrb- , the search for alternative sources of fuel will continue . " we spend between 30 and 35 percent of our overall budget on engine technology and fuel , " said volkswagen head of research , franz-josef paefgen .
" we had a look at exactly what we could do with existing technology and our development findings , and realized that over the next few years , europe could replace half its fuel consumption with alternative fuel sources . " long haul there is no doubt , however , that it will take a long time to get away from oil altogether .
there is no single great way to cleaner cars , but a whole host of possibilities which range from the hybrid combustion-electric engine to a mixture of bio fuels . bernd gottschalk , president of the association of the german automobile industry , said they have recognized that so-called " designer fuels , " with biomass or cellulose components , are ideal for future generations of engines . " they are steps towards reducing co2 by 90 percent , which would be a win-win situation for everyone , " gottschalk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new cars wait in line there is not , however , much use in equipping cars with futuristic engines if there are no gas stations for filling up the tank .
in that regard , germany lags miles behind the likes of sweden , which with its 300 gas-ethanol stations has made ford 's flexi-fuel technology the order of the day . as it stands , germany has but one such filling station in the whole country , and although that is clearly not enough , bernhard mattes , head of ford germany , said it is a step in the right direction . " at ford , we invest heavily in research and development because we believe that sustainable mobility can only work if we develop alternative engines , and continue research into driving dynamics and automobile security , " he said . the broader picture but finding a balance between making motoring safer for the environment and those on the roads is a tricky business . thomas weber , a daimlerchrysler board member and head of development at the mercedes car group said environmentally friendly engines and crash structures both make cars heavier . # b # " we know that an additional 20 kilos increases fuel consumption by one percent , so we have to ensure that however innovative the technology , the cars are not too heavy , " weber said .
" if we are clever , we will find a solution to benefit both the environment and the customer . " the race is definitely on .
with the number of cars on the roads expected to double in the next 15 years , manufacturers are not only working against each other , but against the clock to come up with sustainable solutions for generations to come . henrik böhme -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese cars pick up speed in germany even as german automobile manufactures look to china 's millions of people to boost profits , the first chinese cars are rolling down the export ramp and into mercedes and bmw territory .

5 , 2006 -rrb- in the fast lane to controversy the autobahn is a german icon , right up there with beer and oktoberfest .
so a controversial proposal to sell off the country 's renowned highway system has , expectedly , kicked up a storm of protest .

on the contrary , harmony is the watchword so far .
political scientist klaus detterbeck looks back and ahead . dw-world : the grand coalition 's grace period - its first hundred days - is now over .
one gets the impression that the government has made a better impression than was once expected . klaus detterbeck : i think so too .
surveys regarding angela merkel and the christian democrats are good right now .
there are two reasons for this relatively good start for the grand coalition .
first , there have been successes , like chancellor merkel 's trip to the us , to russia and at the eu summit , as well as some overall positive economic developments .
secondly , the populace has given the chancellor something of an advance when it comes to trust .
people are willing to give this coalition some time to find its footing .
a majority of people have the feeling that a solid , capable team is at the helm , as opposed to that of the last schröder government . so are the individuals in the government less important than the " team " as a whole ? yes , you could say that .
that has to do with chancellor merkel 's role as a director .
she is not a big personality out front , who calls all the shots .
rather she 's the person who steers the entire team .
that makes her different than schröder , who was something of a showman who pranced on the political stage . despite the laurels , has the country really progressed toward finding solutions to some of its problems ? it 's true that there have been no big decisions made as yet .
there is this positive impression , a positive undertone , but the real foundation for new policies has n't yet been laid .
negotiations still have to take place about federalism reform , and other big reform projects have yet to be tackled . angela merkel enjoys a good deal of sympathy from journalists of all stripes .
she is also respected by foreign leaders .
what is different about her ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular with journalists these days she leaves the impression of being someone who does solid work and does n't push her way to the front .
instead , she tries to enact good policies for the good of the country .
in the grand coalition , she is engaging in the politics of inclusion .
that 's to her great credit . will she be successful if she continues to follow this strategy ?
what about when she has to get down to the nitty-gritty ? one of her strengths is her ability to hold the two camps together .
but in fact , this advantage could turn into a disadvantage if it comes time to make difficult decisions and she finds it hard to assert her authority , depending on a consensus for decisions . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have lost popularity among voters .
does the party have the wrong party chairman or is its strategy faulty ? the spd has two problems .
for one , they have the rather " unpleasant " ministries : -lrb- franz -rrb- müntefering at labor and -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrück at finance .
on the other hand , people still are n't sure what this party actually stands for .
is it a reform party , which is how it 's been seen over the past few years under schröder ?
or is it headed back in a more traditional , union-oriented direction ?
-lrb- matthias -rrb- platzeck is still not in the position to explain where the party should go from here and it 's hurting because of that . let 's look at the opposition .
does one actually still exist and if so , is it able to attract any attention to itself ? it 's true that the opposition parties have problems finding an audience .
the left party is mostly concerned with itself these days ; the greens have n't found their direction yet ; and the free democrats are having a hard time making their mark .
these are tough times for the smaller parties .
we 'll have to see how they do at the end of march , when there are elections in rheinland-palatinate , saxony-anhalt and baden-württemberg . political scientist klaus detterbeck teaches at the institute for political science at the university of magdeburg . steffen leidel spoke with klaus detterbeck send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges recovery and resolve in first speech angela merkel gave her first speech to parliament as german chancellor wednesday and spoke of a strong germany full of opportunities and a country that would stand firm on the issues of justice and equal rights .

becoming germany 's first female leader was not easy , but angela merkel has already carved her name high up in the popularity stakes . the grand coalition has been in office for a full 100 days , which means the period of grace traditionally granted a new government , is officially over .
but with the german public appearing more than willing to continue supporting the conservative cdu / csu and social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- alliance , that is of little relevance .
angela merkel is enjoying massive popularity and opinion polls suggest that her party is steaming ahead of their coalition partner , the spd . but at the federal elections last september , the picture was quite different .
the two main parties were unable to beat each other , and the results of the ballot made it impossible for either the cdu / csu to form a coalition with the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- or for the spd-green alliance to continue running the country .
the additional parliamentary presence of the left party meant the only alternative was to form a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder fought it out for the top spot and that very coalition , so it turns out , is what the majority of german voters wanted .
in it , they see the possibility of fulfilled expectations and greater harmony .
on the latter point , with coalition partners who treat one another with care and are quick to resolve budding disputes , the electorate can be satisfied . yet , on the former , expectations regarding unemployment reduction remain unfulfilled .
there is also reason to believe that the two sides will clash over continued welfare and health reforms . showing germany 's new face abroad on the international stage , merkel made a good first impression .
she breezed confidently through her debut visits to paris , london and washington , but they were not meant to serve as opportunities to iron out any serious conflicts of interest .
merkel has not yet shown what position she will take on washington 's stance on the iranian nuclear program .
and although the new german leader 's appearance at the eu budget summit met with applause , it 's not entirely clear to what extent that was the result of her financial generosity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vice chancellor and labor minister , franz müntefering meanwhile , the grand coalition is an acid test for the social democrats who are trying to profile themselves .
thus far , labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering has been viewed as the spd heavyweight in the cabinet , but he is not coordinating well with the new party head , matthias platzeck , and internal conflicts could become a problem for the coalition . although on the whole germany 's grand coalition conveys a stable impression , keeping it up depends on how much space the two partners have for profiling themselves .
merkel is making something of a name for herself as a leader who moderates discussions without clearly stating her position .
for the chancellor of a grand coalition that could be a good technique , but the question is whether it is sustainable beyond regional elections at the end of march . heinz dylong -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de refining merkel 's makeover angela merkel has come a long way from fashion fiasco to chic chancellor .

matters worsened for the visitors three minutes later . del piero 's quickly-taken free-kick surprised the german back four and sent gilardino racing clear towards goal .
the 23-year-old ac milan striker looked up and unselfishly slid the ball across to give toni a tap-in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luca toni celebrated after just seven minutes italy might have had a third moments later when del piero 's crossed free-kick found gilardino unmarked , but he failed by just a few inches to make a connection . germany then sliced italy open with their first genuine attack , but gianluigi buffon pulled off a superb save to keep out sebastian deisler 's vicious drive . de rossi made it 3-0 in the 39th minute , applying the finishing touch to mauro camoranesi 's cross as the german defense suffered another alarming lapse in concentration . " it 's i n explicable " limiting the damage was germany 's task now , but they leaked another goal in the 56th minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniele de rossi -lrb- right -rrb- and robert huth -lrb- left -rrb- gilardino 's cross from the left was headed back across goal by camoranesi and del piero dived low to head past a helpless lehmann . huth 's late strike was of little consolation for the poor germans . " it 's inexplicable how one can fall back so quickly , " said german captain michael ballack , who added that italy 's early lead had made his team insecure .
" the mistakes we made were punished hard .
thankfully there will be another match in three weeks and then it 's going to be a different german national team . " national coach jürgen klinsmann also said that he still had high hopes for his team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann " of course we 're disappointed - we had high hopes and there were smashed within the first minutes , " said german national coach jürgen klinsmann .
" it was a frustrating lesson for us , but we believe in this team and we believe in the young players .
we 're confident that everything will work in 100 days . " but the weak performance had commentators worried about the team 's readiness to succeed in the world cup this summer at home . " if the italians were to really go for it , germany would look even worse , " said reinhold beckmann , the match 's commentator for german public broadcaster ard .
" the real question is whether the german team is just too young . " the team still has three chances to prove that it is ready for the world cup .
on march 22 , it will face the us , followed by matches against japan on may 30 and colombia on june 2 . the german team opens the world cup on june 9 against costa rica . hooliga n s n ot impressed by pope 's appeal before the match , a message by pope benedict xvi called for an end to racist chanting and emblems at football matches and urged football fans to adopt " respect and dialogue " ahead of this summer 's world cup in his native germany . both nations ' football authorities had dedicated the match to opposing all forms of racial violence .
racism has been a serious problem in italy 's elite seria a league this season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-born pope got a world cup pennant from german soccer legend franz beckenbauer last october the 78-year-old pontiff said he appreciated the initiative to combat racial discrimination , which he said would " consolidate awareness of the important educative function of sport in the service of solidarity and peace . " but before the match , german and italian hooligans tried to start a fight and fired off signal rockets .
according to the german soccer federation , 900 tickets had been sold to german fans , with 600 seated in a closed-off area .
another 600 german hooligans reportedly managed to buy tickets meant to go to italians ahead of the match . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany gears up for friendly against italy european soccer superpowers italy and germany are preparing for wednesday 's friendly that will help gauge their world cup preparedness .

becoming germany 's first female leader was not easy , but angela merkel has already carved her name high up in the popularity stakes . the grand coalition has been in office for a full 100 days , which means the period of grace traditionally granted a new government , is officially over .
but with the german public appearing more than willing to continue supporting the conservative cdu / csu and social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- alliance , that is of little relevance .
angela merkel is enjoying massive popularity and opinion polls suggest that her party is steaming ahead of their coalition partner , the spd . but at the federal elections last september , the picture was quite different .
the two main parties were unable to beat each other , and the results of the ballot made it impossible for either the cdu / csu to form a coalition with the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- or for the spd-green alliance to continue running the country .
the additional parliamentary presence of the left party meant the only alternative was to form a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder fought it out for the top spot and that very coalition , so it turns out , is what the majority of german voters wanted .
in it , they see the possibility of fulfilled expectations and greater harmony .
on the latter point , with coalition partners who treat one another with care and are quick to resolve budding disputes , the electorate can be satisfied . yet , on the former , expectations regarding unemployment reduction remain unfulfilled .
there is also reason to believe that the two sides will clash over continued welfare and health reforms . showing germany 's new face abroad on the international stage , merkel made a good first impression .
she breezed confidently through her debut visits to paris , london and washington , but they were not meant to serve as opportunities to iron out any serious conflicts of interest .

becoming germany 's first female leader was not easy , but angela merkel has already carved her name high up in the popularity stakes . the grand coalition has been in office for a full 100 days , which means the period of grace traditionally granted a new government , is officially over .
but with the german public appearing more than willing to continue supporting the conservative cdu / csu and social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- alliance , that is of little relevance .
angela merkel is enjoying massive popularity and opinion polls suggest that her party is steaming ahead of their coalition partner , the spd . but at the federal elections last september , the picture was quite different .
the two main parties were unable to beat each other , and the results of the ballot made it impossible for either the cdu / csu to form a coalition with the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- or for the spd-green alliance to continue running the country .
the additional parliamentary presence of the left party meant the only alternative was to form a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder fought it out for the top spot and that very coalition , so it turns out , is what the majority of german voters wanted .
in it , they see the possibility of fulfilled expectations and greater harmony .
on the latter point , with coalition partners who treat one another with care and are quick to resolve budding disputes , the electorate can be satisfied . yet , on the former , expectations regarding unemployment reduction remain unfulfilled .
there is also reason to believe that the two sides will clash over continued welfare and health reforms . showing germany 's new face abroad on the international stage , merkel made a good first impression .
she breezed confidently through her debut visits to paris , london and washington , but they were not meant to serve as opportunities to iron out any serious conflicts of interest .

there have been more than 100 cases of h5n1-infected wild birds found in germany . the finding could increase concern that the virus could spread to other species in europe as it has in several cases in other parts of the world . " it has been known for some time that cats can become infected by eating infected birds , " thomas mettenleiter , president of the institute , told reuters . several large cats in asian zoos have died after being fed infected birds and domestic cats have been shown to be especially vulnerable to the disease , the institute said . the h5n1 strain , which has caused illness and even fatalities in humans in turkey and asia , has been detected in a leopard , tigers , civet cats and two domestic cats in thailand .

there have been more than 100 cases of h5n1-infected wild birds found in germany . the finding could increase concern that the virus could spread to other species in europe as it has in several cases in other parts of the world . " it has been known for some time that cats can become infected by eating infected birds , " thomas mettenleiter , president of the institute , told reuters . several large cats in asian zoos have died after being fed infected birds and domestic cats have been shown to be especially vulnerable to the disease , the institute said . the h5n1 strain , which has caused illness and even fatalities in humans in turkey and asia , has been detected in a leopard , tigers , civet cats and two domestic cats in thailand .

mrs arroyo told national tv the review would be completed in " 24 to 72 hours " .
" i will lift the state of emergency once i am convinced ... that we are in control of the situation , " she said .
the emergency rule , imposed last week after an alleged coup threat , has been criticised as unconstitutional and as a source of further unrest .
mrs arroyo said she had asked the defence and justice ministers , and the police chief , to conduct the security review .
arroyo fails to resolve doubts " i want to lift the state of emergency at the soonest possible time , " she said .
' levelled off ' but justice secretary raul gonzales said it might be too early to lift emergency rule , which allows arrests without warrants and bans political rallies .
" i think the situation has levelled off , but to say whether we have or not neutralized the people who want to topple the government , i am not prepared to answer at this point , " he said .
police have filed charges of rebellion against 16 people for the alleged coup , including five lawmakers and soldiers .
they are accused of being involved in a plot to overthrow mrs arroyo .
the state prosecutor said the five lawmakers had lost their immunity as members of congress because they were accused of a serious offence punishable by more than six years in prison .
another suspect , whose whereabouts are unknown , is gregorio honasan , a former senator linked to more than a dozen coup attempts .
the supreme court said it would start debating petitions questioning the emergency declaration next week .

mrs arroyo told national tv the review would be completed in " 24 to 72 hours " .
" i will lift the state of emergency once i am convinced ... that we are in control of the situation , " she said .
the emergency rule , imposed last week after an alleged coup threat , has been criticised as unconstitutional and as a source of further unrest .
mrs arroyo said she had asked the defence and justice ministers , and the police chief , to conduct the security review .
arroyo fails to resolve doubts " i want to lift the state of emergency at the soonest possible time , " she said .
' levelled off ' but justice secretary raul gonzales said it might be too early to lift emergency rule , which allows arrests without warrants and bans political rallies .
" i think the situation has levelled off , but to say whether we have or not neutralized the people who want to topple the government , i am not prepared to answer at this point , " he said .
police have filed charges of rebellion against 16 people for the alleged coup , including five lawmakers and soldiers .
they are accused of being involved in a plot to overthrow mrs arroyo .
the state prosecutor said the five lawmakers had lost their immunity as members of congress because they were accused of a serious offence punishable by more than six years in prison .
another suspect , whose whereabouts are unknown , is gregorio honasan , a former senator linked to more than a dozen coup attempts .
the supreme court said it would start debating petitions questioning the emergency declaration next week .

i ca n't go home but they can have a parade ?
that 's ridiculous samuel spears former resident send us your experiences mayor eyes new term some wrapped themselves in the blue tarpaulins used to cover damaged roofs and others dressed as the mould which is present in many flood-damaged houses .
one man wore a white blanket labelled " 2,000lbs " and hung a model helicopter over his head to depict one of the sandbags dropped to try to prevent the floodwater spreading .
another group dressed as blind men with walking sticks and dark glasses , and wore t-shirts that read " levee inspector " - a reference to the breached levees that led to much of the flooding .
some of the floats showed signs of storm damage , with water marks and flaking paint .
carnival participant snooky meyaski saw his st bernard parish home swamped after katrina , but said he was all for the carnival .
" to pass it up would be to just tell the world , ' hey , we 're down for the count ' , " he said .
" and we 're not down for the count . "
continuing difficulties others have criticised the decision to go ahead - mardi gras has been cancelled before in times of national emergency .
samuel spears , now a refugee in houston , said the footage of the festivities had made him more angry .
in pictures : mardi gras " with them putting on mardi gras , without still having not addressed the basic human needs in this city , why that 's just a slap in the face , " he was quoted by the associated press news agency as saying .
" i ca n't go home , but they can have a parade ?
that 's ridiculous . "
some say the carnival has highlighted continuing difficulties .
parades have passed through areas devastated by the flood , such as the lower ninth ward .
it comes as an opinion poll published by gallup showed that the majority of residents believe that local corruption , rather than a lack of government help , is the biggest obstacle to rebuilding new orleans .
more than 1,300 people were killed across the states affected by katrina - most of them in louisiana .
the population of new orleans fell from nearly 500,000 to less than 200,000 .

a st david 's day poll for bbc wales also suggested that 60 % of people think the assembly government should have the most influence over welsh life .
but 80 % did not think £ 67m should have been spent on the new senedd building .
the bbc commissioned poll by icm research spoke to over 1,000 people across wales over three days last week .
according to the poll 's findings , public opinion in wales seems to be moving in favour of devolution and an increasing majority of people want that process to accelerate significantly .
back in 1997 , when the labour government began to implement the devolution process , almost 40 % in wales were firmly against the creation of any kind of assembly , while fewer than 20 % wanted a full law-making parliament .
figures reversed however , according to the st david 's day poll , these figures have now been completely reversed - with just 20 % wanting to abolish the assembly , 21 % wanting to keep the status quo , 39 % want a more powerful parliament -lrb- with full law-making and tax-varying powers -rrb- , and 16 % in favour of independence .
this suggests that 55 % of people in wales - a clear majority - now want significantly more devolution .
interestingly , the poll also shows stronger support from women for a parliament , and a clearer advocacy of abolition among men .
the poll also reveals that 60 % believe the welsh assembly government should have the most influence over wales , compared to just 21 % who think the uk government in westminster should have the most influence .

moreover , given that back in 2001 , nearly 65 % said the uk government had the most influence over wales , then this suggests a further erosion in how people view the uk government 's role in life in wales .
the pollsters also asked people about their feelings about the new assembly building .
despite all the publicity surrounding the senedd over a period of many years , 23 % said they were not aware that the assembly had a new home at all .

the poll also reveals that 60 % believe the welsh assembly government should have the most influence over wales , compared to just 21 % who think the uk government in westminster should have the most influence .
new building asked about their perception of the current situation in 2006 , only 40 % thought the uk government has the most influence - despite the fact that it still retains all primary legislation and taxation powers .
moreover , given that back in 2001 , nearly 65 % said the uk government had the most influence over wales , then this suggests a further erosion in how people view the uk government 's role in life in wales .
the pollsters also asked people about their feelings about the new assembly building .
despite all the publicity surrounding the senedd over a period of many years , 23 % said they were not aware that the assembly had a new home at all .
appropriate name of those questioned , 56 % felt it was right for the assembly to have a new building , with 38 % against .
but when it was pointed out that the building cost £ 67m , a massive 80 % said that paying this amount for a new building was not worth it .
a significant 58 % said the name senedd is an appropriate name for the new building - with the highest level of support amongst people aged between 18 and 34 .
however , almost a third said that the name was inappropriate , providing some more ammunition for both sides in the ongoing debate about the name of the new building .

a ceremonial mace has been flown from sydney , as a gift from the government of new south wales .
hand crafted from gold , silver and brass , the 4ft -lrb- 1.3m -rrb- mace will become the centrepiece of the new chamber .
the australian state took its name after 18th century colonialists likened the hills and valleys outside sydney to the landscape of south wales .
new south wales parliament deputy speaker john price said the links were still held dear . "
most welsh people evaporate when they come to new south wales - you ca n't find them " clive woosnam , sydney welsh choir " we 're new south wales and that puts us very close " , said mr price .
" we 're fond of the name , and we 're also fond of the welsh people who formed a significant number of our early immigrants , both as prisoners in the early days and as free settlers . "
the mace started life in 2002 , when melbourne goldsmith fortunato rocca was commissioned to come up with a design .
at first he did not know much about wales , or where the mace would be housed .
" i really do n't know too much about your parliament house ... i 've just done some research through the books of how old wales was - i do n't know much about today 's wales , " he told me .
the final , simple design was selected after consulting both welsh and new south wales governments .
fortunato - or lucky rocca as he is sometimes known - spent 300 hours crafting the mace .
" if a lot of people see it , you like to express yourself in a way that people say ' jeeze , is n't that nice , " ' he said .
new south wales still has a sizable welsh expat community , but many feel they are not as visible as other nationalities .
" most welsh people evaporate when they come to new south wales - you ca n't find them , " says clive woosnam , president of the sydney welsh choir .
" you can find the scots and you can find the irish , but the welsh blend in so well , they fit in so easily , it 's hard to find them . "
' lot to learn ' in the future , the government of new south wales also hope to send more officials to wales to build stronger political and economic ties , following up on visits to australia by wales ' first minister rhodri morgan .
" i think the smaller , provincial parliaments of the world have a lot to learn from each other , " said meredith burgmann , president of the legislative council of new south wales .
" the national parliaments have a lot of resources and they are looking at issues which are very different to the provincial parliaments , which are really looking at service issues . "
however , dr burgmann is disappointed she will not be able to attend the opening of wales ' new assembly building , and the donation of the mace , as the date clashes with the first session of the new south wales parliament .
the mace is worth 25,000 australian dollars -lrb- around £ 10,500 -rrb- .
once unveiled it will take pride of place in the new assembly chamber - and serve as a reminder of wales ' friends down under .

a ceremonial mace has been flown from sydney , as a gift from the government of new south wales .
hand crafted from gold , silver and brass , the 4ft -lrb- 1.3m -rrb- mace will become the centrepiece of the new chamber .
the australian state took its name after 18th century colonialists likened the hills and valleys outside sydney to the landscape of south wales .

" we 're fond of the name , and we 're also fond of the welsh people who formed a significant number of our early immigrants , both as prisoners in the early days and as free settlers . "
the mace started life in 2002 , when melbourne goldsmith fortunato rocca was commissioned to come up with a design .
at first he did not know much about wales , or where the mace would be housed .
" i really do n't know too much about your parliament house ... i 've just done some research through the books of how old wales was - i do n't know much about today 's wales , " he told me .
new south wales still has a sizable welsh expatriate community the final , simple design was selected after consulting both welsh and new south wales governments .

" most welsh people evaporate when they come to new south wales - you ca n't find them , " says clive woosnam , president of the sydney welsh choir .
fortunato rocca researched welsh history to design the mace " you can find the scots and you can find the irish , but the welsh blend in so well , they fit in so easily , it 's hard to find them . "

ig metall staff at a daimlerchrysler plant in the south-west of the country stopped work for several hours .
more warning strikes , in which staff temporarily down tools to emphasise their demands but do not disrupt production , are expected on wednesday .

it is seeking a 5 % rise in wages and guarantees on working hours , including the maintenance of traditional toilet breaks .
the union said that up to 1,000 staff had joined in the action at daimlerchrysler and similar stoppages would take place across the state of baden-wuerttemberg on wednesday .
carmaker porsche and bosch are expected to be targeted .
" on ash wednesday , we will begin with public actions , not just for one day and not just for one company , " joerg hofmann , the regional head of ig metall , said .

the £ 67m building , designed by richard rogers , will host its first debates in the afternoon , including first minister 's questions .
a ceremony to officially open it will take place on st david 's day , 1 march .
cancer patient jayne sullivan , who is staging a sit-in protest over the availability of the drug herceptin , will move to the new building .
finance minister sue essex , who 's been responsible for the project , had held the first government briefing for journalists in the new building .
" this is not like any other government building i 've ever seen , " she said .
" this is not forbidding .
hopefully it 's a friendly building . "
" the idea would be that a child who comes into the place is inspired by the place and decides to become an assembly member " lord richard rogers she said she was pleased that people outside of wales have been recognising the building 's quality .
" there 's been a lot of debate around the cost of the building and that 's fair but we 've kept it very tight over the last few years , " she added .
the senedd - parliament or senate in welsh - has been completed eight years after it was first announced that a landmark building would be constructed on cardiff 's waterfront to house wales ' devolved administration .
the total cost of around £ 67m - which includes spending on information technology , broadcasting equipment and furnishings - is more than five times that originally predicted .
building work was also stopped for two years because of a dispute between the welsh assembly government and lord rogers .
the first working day at the building will include questions to first minister rhodri morgan and a debate on the process of approving new drugs , including herceptin .
the new building has won praise for its construction on " green " principles using energy-saving and recycling features .
its renewable energy systems aim to reduce running costs by up to half .
other features include using the ground as a heat source and the use of wood chips or pellets for the boiler .
rainwater is also collected via the steel columns supporting the roof to supply the toilets and to wash the windows .
lord rogers said energy conservation was a central principle in the design of his building as well as creating a space where politicians and members of the public could meet .
he added : " we certainly wanted to make a statement about the importance of energy and the careful conservation of energy .
" the idea was that steps rise out of the water and there is a whole public domain where people meet each other and look down on the assembly members . "
lord rogers said he hoped the new building would prove inspirational to a new generation of politicians .
he said : " the idea would be that a child who comes into the place is inspired by the place and decides to become an assembly member . "
jayne sullivan has stayed in the current assembly building next door for six days in an attempt to make the drug herceptin more widely available for breast cancer sufferers in wales .
the 45-year-old mother plans to walk the short distance from the old to the new assembly building and resume her demonstration .

it is likely to be an accepted and , judging by early reactions , much-loved feature of the cardiff bay landscape .
after all , who today remembers those sydneysiders who protested against the ever-ballooning cost of the building they nicknamed " the drowning nun " ?
that iconic symbol is rather better known today as the sydney opera house .
few of today 's cardiffians would agree with their edwardian forebears who were aghast at the money being poured into the " monumental white elephant " of city hall .
it does not follow , of course , that a popular building will do anything for the popularity of the institution it houses .
few today remember protests about the sydney opera house the current evidence suggests that the assembly is , by now , an accepted part of welsh life .
the few opinion polls conducted on the subject suggest that fewer than a quarter of welsh voters would like to be rid of it .
the " abolish the assembly party " established in 2001 attracted so little support that after a few months it decided to abolish itself .
with the question of abolition apparently a dead duck , the real battles in coming years are set to be between those who are happy with the current settlement and those who want to see ever-stronger powers transferred to cardiff bay .
in the end , the assembly and its government will be judged not by its building but by the quality of the services delivered unsurprisingly , the strongest supporters of the status quo are to be found in westminster , while the biggest fans of increased powers are assembly members .
the greatest threat to the assembly 's legitimacy comes from the falling turnout in assembly elections .
some 47 % of welsh voters went to the polls in the first assembly election in 1999 , and only 38 % did so four years later .
while some have suggested that the falling turnout suggests that the assembly has failed to win the hearts and minds of the welsh people , it is more likely to be part of a more general trend .
cardiff city hall : a white elephant to some in edwardian days barely 40 % of us cast our votes in the 2004 european and council elections and turnout hit an all-time low of 62 % in the 2005 general election .
there is no doubt that if turnout were to drop substantially in the 2007 elections it would be a severe blow to the assembly 's credibility and might well put a brake on its ambitions .
for now though , those thoughts are far from the politicians ' minds as they enjoy the new sense of permanence and importance that the new building has given the institution .
in the end , though , the assembly and its government will be judged not by its building but by the quality of the services delivered in schools and hospitals and the rest across wales .

by wyre davies bbc 's wales correspondent the senedd will host the debates of the welsh assembly .
enlarge image it 's an expensive public building - an extension to a much criticised and pilloried institution - but it 's almost impossible to find anyone with a bad word to say about the senedd .
it 's pretty disconcerting for a journalist covering an issue to find there only appears to be " one side " to that story but , believe me , almost everyone i 've spoken to is gushing with praise for the richard rogers-designed creation in cardiff bay .
most of the plaudits relate to the new establishment 's " green " credentials .
indeed , some people are calling it " the most environmentally-advanced public building in europe " .
built principally from either renewable materials or those sourced locally in wales - the slate , glass and wooden structure is undeniably easy on the eye .
but in this case beauty is certainly more than skin deep .
even opponents admit lord rogers has done a ' pretty good job ' the circular debating chamber is partially-lit via a huge mirror which reflects daylight down into the building .
this mirror is also an integral part of the distinctive wind-cowl that dominates the roof .
helping to ventilate the chamber , by allowing hot air generated inside by the 60 assembly members to escape upwards , it fulfils a practical as well as aesthetic purpose .
it is , though , in the bowels of the building that lord rogers ' creation really earns it 's " green " tag .
all of its water needs , apart from that for human consumption , are satisfied through " grey water " - the collection of rain from the roof in huge tanks underground .
more innovative still , there 's a heat-exchange system that pumps water 100 meters down into the earth , where the ambient temperature is about 16c , bringing it back up to either heat the assembly in winter or cool it in summer .
in the beginning ... the construction site in august , 2001 all of this recently earned the new assembly building an award for sustainable constriction from the building research establishment .
sustainability aside , the other fundamental principle behind roger 's most innovative design to date is " openness " - the creation of an open space where members of the public are encouraged and inspired to come and meet their elected representatives in a relaxed , informal atmosphere .
the chamber , committee rooms and even the press briefing room are all designed to be " viewed " by people interested in following every twist and turn of the democratic process in wales .
the debating chamber in its finishing stages so , the criticism .
well , at a final cost of around £ 67m the new building is not cheap .
it is , however , a great deal cheaper that its scottish equivalent in edinburgh where costs rose to £ 430m .
even those assembly members who were always opposed to " wasting " public money on a new home when they had an existing chamber in crickhowell house admit that the rogers team has done a " pretty good job " .
there are , of course , arch anti-devolutionists who regard any expenditure on the institution in cardiff bay with suspicion .
perhaps , with most reason for resentment , are the many relatively-deprived towns and cites in other parts of wales witnessing yet more lavish public expenditure on another building in the welsh capital .
certainly there are those who would argue that , since 1999 , devolution has failed to engage and inspire the people in wales - inspiration from a new building , however much we love it already , will not deliver alone .

by wyre davies bbc 's wales correspondent the senedd will host the debates of the welsh assembly .
enlarge image it 's an expensive public building - an extension to a much criticised and pilloried institution - but it 's almost impossible to find anyone with a bad word to say about the senedd .
it 's pretty disconcerting for a journalist covering an issue to find there only appears to be " one side " to that story but , believe me , almost everyone i 've spoken to is gushing with praise for the richard rogers-designed creation in cardiff bay .
most of the plaudits relate to the new establishment 's " green " credentials .
indeed , some people are calling it " the most environmentally-advanced public building in europe " .
built principally from either renewable materials or those sourced locally in wales - the slate , glass and wooden structure is undeniably easy on the eye .
but in this case beauty is certainly more than skin deep .
even opponents admit lord rogers has done a ' pretty good job ' the circular debating chamber is partially-lit via a huge mirror which reflects daylight down into the building .
this mirror is also an integral part of the distinctive wind-cowl that dominates the roof .
helping to ventilate the chamber , by allowing hot air generated inside by the 60 assembly members to escape upwards , it fulfils a practical as well as aesthetic purpose .
it is , though , in the bowels of the building that lord rogers ' creation really earns it 's " green " tag .
all of its water needs , apart from that for human consumption , are satisfied through " grey water " - the collection of rain from the roof in huge tanks underground .
more innovative still , there 's a heat-exchange system that pumps water 100 meters down into the earth , where the ambient temperature is about 16c , bringing it back up to either heat the assembly in winter or cool it in summer .
in the beginning ... the construction site in august , 2001 all of this recently earned the new assembly building an award for sustainable constriction from the building research establishment .
sustainability aside , the other fundamental principle behind roger 's most innovative design to date is " openness " - the creation of an open space where members of the public are encouraged and inspired to come and meet their elected representatives in a relaxed , informal atmosphere .
the chamber , committee rooms and even the press briefing room are all designed to be " viewed " by people interested in following every twist and turn of the democratic process in wales .
the debating chamber in its finishing stages so , the criticism .
well , at a final cost of around £ 67m the new building is not cheap .
it is , however , a great deal cheaper that its scottish equivalent in edinburgh where costs rose to £ 430m .
even those assembly members who were always opposed to " wasting " public money on a new home when they had an existing chamber in crickhowell house admit that the rogers team has done a " pretty good job " .
there are , of course , arch anti-devolutionists who regard any expenditure on the institution in cardiff bay with suspicion .
perhaps , with most reason for resentment , are the many relatively-deprived towns and cites in other parts of wales witnessing yet more lavish public expenditure on another building in the welsh capital .
certainly there are those who would argue that , since 1999 , devolution has failed to engage and inspire the people in wales - inspiration from a new building , however much we love it already , will not deliver alone .

by carolyn hitt journalist and broadcaster the crachach : weekend retreats in pembrokeshire ...
quiz : are you crachach ?
they are the elite who look after one another - the powerful , great and good of wales .
somehow the senedd opening just would not be the same without their presence - the crachach .
so with tongue firmly embedded in cheek , social commentator carolyn hitt ponders the status of crachach in today 's wales .
so what does it mean to be crachach in modern wales ?
in an outrageous slur on my character , i was once accused of being valleys crachach because i grew up in a house with bay windows and my parents had a three- piece suite from leekes .
but rhondda was never a hotbed of crachach society .
the term used to denote local gentry but 21st century crachach is the taffia , the largely welsh-speaking elite who dominate the arts , culture and media of wales and to a lesser extent its political life .
rhodri morgan reckons there 's no place for stuck-up sorts down the bay .
" cynulliad y werin , nid cynulliad y crachach , " as he once famously declared - " an assembly of the people , not an assembly of the establishment " .
if in desperate need , they can usually be spotted here ...
but the crachach just think most assembly members are a bit thick .
see the recent arts council of wales rumpus for details .
you do n't necessarily have to be rich to be crachach , a direct bloodline to writer saunders lewis will do nicely .
their natural habitat can range from the gorsedd of the eisteddfod to a welsh national opera opening night .
they have their names inscribed on chairs in the wales millennium centre and take over tier one of st david 's hall .
they are never short of a committee to chair nor an international rugby ticket complete with canapés at half-time .
if the crachach had a coat of arms , the motto would be that old chestnut : ' it 's who you know not what you know and make sure you 're belonging to someone on the committee ' the vale , pontcanna and whitchurch are crachach property hotspots while barn conversions in llandeilo and cottages in newport , pembrokeshire , provide weekend retreats .
supremely confident in all social situations , you can spot them by their habit of looking over your left shoulder as they scan the room for someone more important than you to talk to .
while they may be vicious about each other in private they rarely fall out publicly unless they are fighting for position in the queue for the latest kyffin williams exhibition .
older crachach can be fiercely welsh nationalist yet not averse to receiving gongs from the queen .
younger arty crachach will always get their projects funded , however rubbish they may be .
media crachach are perhaps the most obnoxious members of the species , especially when misbehaving at the crachach bacchanalian extravaganza that is the bafta cymru awards .
crachach society is not a meritocracy .
if the crachach had a coat of arms , the motto would be that old chestnut : ' it 's who you know not what you know and make sure you 're belonging to someone on the committee ' , albeit written in medieval welsh in cynghanedd metre .
