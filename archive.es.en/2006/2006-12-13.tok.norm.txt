the meeting was widely considered a platform for revisionists who deny the holocaust and the existence of gas chambers under the nazis . a spokesman for the german foreign ministry , jens ploetner , said in berlin that nothing of scientific value would come out of the tehran conference , which ended tuesday . " the german government condemns all attempts to deny the holocaust and question israel 's right to independent statehood , " he said .
" for us , living in the country where the mass murder of jews was planned and carried out , we feel a special responsibility to commemorate the victims of nazi terror .
it 's in this context that we condemn any attempt to provide a forum for revisionists who are out to rewrite history in an unacceptable manner . "
iran 's leadership has defended the decision to hold the conference , styling it as a scientific forum that would seek answers to unresolved issues around the holocaust .
it turned out to be a gathering of revisionists whose main claim to fame has been the doubts they 've frequently expressed about whether the mass murder of six million jews took place at all . bundestag president norbert lammert was among the strongest critics of the conference .
in a letter to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , he said he condemned any attempt to promote anti-semitic feelings under the guise of scientific freedom and objectivity .
the secretary general of germany 's social democratic party , hubertus heil , said that anyone who denies the holocaust is the enemy of modern day germany .
anti-semitic propaganda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad -lrb- l . -rrb- shaking with anti-zionism rabbi yisroel dovid weiss gert weisskirchen , the social democrats ' foreign policy spokesman in parliament , said the conference was a direct confrontation with israel . " you only have to look at how serious current attempts are by iran and others to deny israel 's right to statehood and wipe it off the map completely , " weisskirchen said .
" you just have to consider the mood in syria and among hezbollah fighters to realize how real the threat is .
for us germans , there can be no other option than to stand firmly at the side of israel and defend it against any sort of military threat or anti-semitic propaganda . " germany 's largest-selling newspaper , bild , wrote on tuesday that awareness of the killing of six million european jews united the civilized world and made it unbearable that iran 's president put on the " so-called holocaust conference . " it is a forum for the vilest haters of jews on earth , " the paper wrote .
" one must be deeply ashamed that six germans also made it to this disgusting event .
and the iranian leadership shows its real face . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's national holocaust memorial in berlin german historian rene wildnagel said the holocaust conference served the purpose of strengthening a decades-old line of argument in many arab nations . " the holocaust issue is always debated in the arab world in line with one political pattern , " wildnagel said .
" the iranian president 's holocaust denial is just one example of this .
even those who accept that the holocaust did take place would immediately ask why the arabs should suffer from something that happened in europe and emanated from germany .
ahmadinejad himself once suggested that justice would be done by creating a jewish state on german territory . " on monday , germany hosted a separate international conference on holocaust studies .
attended by some of the world 's leading shoah researchers , the meeting provided the general public with the latest findings about the scope of the holocaust after the opening of eastern european archives in the 1990s . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians debate holocaust research in berlin leading holocaust historians gathered in berlin to discuss the current state of holocaust studies .
the meeting has been widely seen as a reaction to a controversial holocaust conference in iran .

after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies . in the first systematic cross-country study of ski areas in the alpine region , the organization for economic cooperation and development , or oecd , found that recent warming in the region , which is particularly sensitive to climate change , has been roughly three times the global average . of the countries studied , germany is most at risk , the report by the paris-based group said .
an increase in temperature by one degree could lead to a 60 percent decrease in the number of naturally snow-reliable ski areas in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the skilift was empty at the bavarian ski resort of sudelfeld earlier this month austria - where half the tourism income is from winter tourism - is slightly above average , followed by italy , france and switzerland , which would suffer the least . " the years 1994 , 2000 , 2002 , and 2003 were the warmest on record in the alps in the last 500 years , " the report found , adding that climate projections show even greater changes in the coming decades . at the moment , 90 percent of large alpine ski areas normally have adequate snow cover for at least 100 days per year , the report said , but future climate change could mean a drop in the number of snow-reliable ski areas . ski operators are already adapting to rising snow lines and shorter winter seasons , mostly with technology rather than changing behavioral patterns . artificial snow environmentally damaging artificial snow is popular and cost effective for ski operators but consumes a lot of water and energy and can harm the landscape and ecology . making artificial snow will become more expensive as temperatures rise , and it will no longer be possible if the air becomes too warm , the report said . alpine tourism plays a key role in the economies of alpine countries , with some 60 to 80 million tourists to the region each year , and a total of 160 million days recorded annually by ski lift operators in france , austria , switzerland and germany . another ski event cancelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five world cup ski races have already been cancelled this year opec 's warning came with the news of the cancellation of the women 's slalom race in the france alpine resort town of megeve because of lack of snow . the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- has so far failed to name a replacement venue for the event , which was scheduled for dec .
20 . megeve is the fifth cancellation of the alpine winter skiing season because of the unseasonably warm weather . women 's races in st. moritz in switzerland , men 's and women 's in val d 'isere in france , as well as the traditional season-opener in sölden in austria at the end of october were all called off . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de less snow and drier summers in german forecast new weather models predict arid summers and less time for winter sports in germany if climate changed is n't turned around , according to a study released this week by the max-planck institute for meteorology .

" it 's not normal that foreign motorists pay nothing for the use of our roads , " söder told the mass-market bild am sonntag newspaper .
" elsewhere in europe , they always have to pay . " the vignette sticker model , which seven countries including austria , the czech republic and switzerland also use , would be accompanied by lowering germany 's petroleum and motor vehicle taxes as a way of charging foreign cars for using german roads and discouraging gas tank tourism by lowering fuel prices in germany . mercedes and bmw outnumber fiat and renault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven european countries use a vignette toll system but only a dramatic , and unlikely , cut in the fuel tax would compensate drivers for a 100-euro windshield sticker , according to andreas hölzel a spokesman for the adac , germany 's largest automobile club . " we are not aware of a case where the tax was so drastically cut that gas tank tourism would be affected , " hölzel said , adding that of all the cars on german highways , only 5 percent have foreign license plates , making the costs of maintaining a vignette system higher than the revenue it would bring in . while a windshield sticker is the most commonly debated model in germany , 10 european countries , including france , italy , spain and poland , charge drivers based on the distance they travel instead of an annual fee , which makes considerably more sense , according to hartmut topp of the institute for mobility and traffic at the technical university of kaiserslautern . " a vignette is a crazy idea that encourages people to drive more in order to lower the cost per kilometer , " he said .
" what makes sense is a distance-based toll system . " truck tolls difficult to expand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the truck toll system started in 2005 , about a year later than planned while a similar system that was setup for heavy commercial trucks using the autobahn was plagued with delays and lost revenue when it launched in 2005 , it is now running well , topp said . but enlarging the satellite system that keeps track of about 1 million trucks on highways to encompass germany 's 44 million registered automobiles on all streets is unrealistic and does n't make sense when the state already has the money it needs for road projects , according hölzel . of the 53 billion euros collected from fuel and motor vehicle tax receipts as well as revenue from the truck toll system , about 17 billion are spent on germany 's road network , he said , calling on the government to invest money car owners pay in taxes into street projects . while no studies have been conducted to estimate the cost of creating a car toll system , the toll collect consortium received seven billion euros from german government to create the truck 's toll system .
of the 3.1 billion euros in levies toll collect delivered to the government in 2006 , it received 600 million euros -lrb- from berlin -rrb- to keep the network running . safer in the fast lane bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tolls are rare in germany but do exist on some tunnels even if the truck system could be expanded to include cars , a feat toll collect officials said may be possible but would require large additional investments , any kind of toll placed exclusively on highways could also lead to heavier traffic on smaller , local roads that tend to have more serious accidents than the highway , hölzel said . according to the adac estimates , increased traffic on smaller roads could lead to 570 more traffic deaths and 17,000 additional injuries if 20 percent of cars left the highway to get around tolls . keeping drivers from moving to toll-free streets is why any automobile toll would have to include all roads , not just highways , topp said , adding that he , contrary to hölzel , expects such technology to exist within the next five years . " at times and in places where there is an especially high demand you can charge an especially high toll , and when there are fewer drivers it can be cheaper , " he said . toll debate unlikely to disappear regardless of how many people they share the road with , german drivers , for the time being , wo n't have to worry about reaching into their wallets right away .
federal transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee has ruled out any system of car tolls , saying that none of the newest suggestions he 's heard was better than those regularly made in the past . " bad arguments do not get better when they are regularly repeated , " tiefensee , a social democrat , told reporters . despite a lack of unity on implementing a fee system in berlin , bavarian politicians have said they will consider possible automobile toll options for germany , nearly guaranteeing that the debate will come up again in 2007 . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls go out for passenger car toll on the autobahn the interior minister of bavaria , günther beckstein , has called for a toll system to be instituted on passenger cars traveling germany 's freeway system to stop " gas station tourism . " -lrb- 25.07.2006 -rrb- in the fast lane to controversy the autobahn is a german icon , right up there with beer and oktoberfest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 13.12.2006 germany protests against tehran holocaust conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of anti-zionist rabbis attended the conference german lawmakers have protested against an iranian conference on the holocaust .
the meeting was widely considered a platform for revisionists who deny the holocaust and the existence of gas chambers under the nazis . a spokesman for the german foreign ministry , jens ploetner , said in berlin that nothing of scientific value would come out of the tehran conference , which ended tuesday . " the german government condemns all attempts to deny the holocaust and question israel 's right to independent statehood , " he said .
" for us , living in the country where the mass murder of jews was planned and carried out , we feel a special responsibility to commemorate the victims of nazi terror .
it 's in this context that we condemn any attempt to provide a forum for revisionists who are out to rewrite history in an unacceptable manner . "
iran 's leadership has defended the decision to hold the conference , styling it as a scientific forum that would seek answers to unresolved issues around the holocaust .
it turned out to be a gathering of revisionists whose main claim to fame has been the doubts they 've frequently expressed about whether the mass murder of six million jews took place at all . bundestag president norbert lammert was among the strongest critics of the conference .
in a letter to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , he said he condemned any attempt to promote anti-semitic feelings under the guise of scientific freedom and objectivity .
the secretary general of germany 's social democratic party , hubertus heil , said that anyone who denies the holocaust is the enemy of modern day germany .
anti-semitic propaganda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad -lrb- l . -rrb- shaking with anti-zionism rabbi yisroel dovid weiss gert weisskirchen , the social democrats ' foreign policy spokesman in parliament , said the conference was a direct confrontation with israel . " you only have to look at how serious current attempts are by iran and others to deny israel 's right to statehood and wipe it off the map completely , " weisskirchen said .
" you just have to consider the mood in syria and among hezbollah fighters to realize how real the threat is .
for us germans , there can be no other option than to stand firmly at the side of israel and defend it against any sort of military threat or anti-semitic propaganda . " germany 's largest-selling newspaper , bild , wrote on tuesday that awareness of the killing of six million european jews united the civilized world and made it unbearable that iran 's president put on the " so-called holocaust conference . " it is a forum for the vilest haters of jews on earth , " the paper wrote .
" one must be deeply ashamed that six germans also made it to this disgusting event .
and the iranian leadership shows its real face . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's national holocaust memorial in berlin german historian rene wildnagel said the holocaust conference served the purpose of strengthening a decades-old line of argument in many arab nations . " the holocaust issue is always debated in the arab world in line with one political pattern , " wildnagel said .
" the iranian president 's holocaust denial is just one example of this .
even those who accept that the holocaust did take place would immediately ask why the arabs should suffer from something that happened in europe and emanated from germany .
ahmadinejad himself once suggested that justice would be done by creating a jewish state on german territory . " on monday , germany hosted a separate international conference on holocaust studies .
attended by some of the world 's leading shoah researchers , the meeting provided the general public with the latest findings about the scope of the holocaust after the opening of eastern european archives in the 1990s . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians debate holocaust research in berlin leading holocaust historians gathered in berlin to discuss the current state of holocaust studies .
the meeting has been widely seen as a reaction to a controversial holocaust conference in iran .

the meeting was widely considered a platform for revisionists who deny the holocaust and the existence of gas chambers under the nazis . a spokesman for the german foreign ministry , jens ploetner , said in berlin that nothing of scientific value would come out of the tehran conference , which ended tuesday . " the german government condemns all attempts to deny the holocaust and question israel 's right to independent statehood , " he said .
" for us , living in the country where the mass murder of jews was planned and carried out , we feel a special responsibility to commemorate the victims of nazi terror .
it 's in this context that we condemn any attempt to provide a forum for revisionists who are out to rewrite history in an unacceptable manner . "
iran 's leadership has defended the decision to hold the conference , styling it as a scientific forum that would seek answers to unresolved issues around the holocaust .
it turned out to be a gathering of revisionists whose main claim to fame has been the doubts they 've frequently expressed about whether the mass murder of six million jews took place at all . bundestag president norbert lammert was among the strongest critics of the conference .
in a letter to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , he said he condemned any attempt to promote anti-semitic feelings under the guise of scientific freedom and objectivity .
the secretary general of germany 's social democratic party , hubertus heil , said that anyone who denies the holocaust is the enemy of modern day germany .

" you only have to look at how serious current attempts are by iran and others to deny israel 's right to statehood and wipe it off the map completely , " weisskirchen said .
" you just have to consider the mood in syria and among hezbollah fighters to realize how real the threat is .
for us germans , there can be no other option than to stand firmly at the side of israel and defend it against any sort of military threat or anti-semitic propaganda . " germany 's largest-selling newspaper , bild , wrote on tuesday that awareness of the killing of six million european jews united the civilized world and made it unbearable that iran 's president put on the " so-called holocaust conference . " it is a forum for the vilest haters of jews on earth , " the paper wrote .
" one must be deeply ashamed that six germans also made it to this disgusting event .
and the iranian leadership shows its real face . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's national holocaust memorial in berlin german historian rene wildnagel said the holocaust conference served the purpose of strengthening a decades-old line of argument in many arab nations . " the holocaust issue is always debated in the arab world in line with one political pattern , " wildnagel said .
" the iranian president 's holocaust denial is just one example of this .
even those who accept that the holocaust did take place would immediately ask why the arabs should suffer from something that happened in europe and emanated from germany .
ahmadinejad himself once suggested that justice would be done by creating a jewish state on german territory . " on monday , germany hosted a separate international conference on holocaust studies .

could an opt-out system provide the answer ? twelve thousand people in germany are currently on the waiting list for a kidney , liver or heart transplant . tragically , many of them will die before the life-giving operation can ever take place .
this organ shortage exists even though , according to official surveys , some eighty percent of germans say , in principle , they would be prepared to become organ donors .
in reality , just a fraction of them possess organ donor cards . last year , some 3,500 organs were transplanted , but more than twice as many people joined the waiting list .
burkhardt topp from the transplant association says germans are put off from helping others by a number of factors . " i think that everything that is connected with death and dying is a taboo in germany , " he said .

" the theme of organ donation is made more difficult by everything that is somehow associated with the medical sphere and is not 100 percent upright , " he said . this insecurity has also been promoted by the long discussions here over what how to determine the time of death .
critics of organ donation argued that brain death was difficult to ascertain and that heart failure was the only reliable indicator .
lawmakers decided that transplantation could take place after brain death had been certified , but only if the patients were carriers of organ donor cards .
and that only goes for some 12 percent of the german population . in the majority of cases it is grieving relatives who are left to decide .
many have no idea what their loved ones would have wanted . " the difficulty is that the topic is not talked about enough in the family , " says topp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 13.12.2006 germany protests against tehran holocaust conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of anti-zionist rabbis attended the conference german lawmakers have protested against an iranian conference on the holocaust .
the meeting was widely considered a platform for revisionists who deny the holocaust and the existence of gas chambers under the nazis . a spokesman for the german foreign ministry , jens ploetner , said in berlin that nothing of scientific value would come out of the tehran conference , which ended tuesday . " the german government condemns all attempts to deny the holocaust and question israel 's right to independent statehood , " he said .
" for us , living in the country where the mass murder of jews was planned and carried out , we feel a special responsibility to commemorate the victims of nazi terror .
it 's in this context that we condemn any attempt to provide a forum for revisionists who are out to rewrite history in an unacceptable manner . "
iran 's leadership has defended the decision to hold the conference , styling it as a scientific forum that would seek answers to unresolved issues around the holocaust .
it turned out to be a gathering of revisionists whose main claim to fame has been the doubts they 've frequently expressed about whether the mass murder of six million jews took place at all . bundestag president norbert lammert was among the strongest critics of the conference .
in a letter to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , he said he condemned any attempt to promote anti-semitic feelings under the guise of scientific freedom and objectivity .
the secretary general of germany 's social democratic party , hubertus heil , said that anyone who denies the holocaust is the enemy of modern day germany .
anti-semitic propaganda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad -lrb- l . -rrb- shaking with anti-zionism rabbi yisroel dovid weiss gert weisskirchen , the social democrats ' foreign policy spokesman in parliament , said the conference was a direct confrontation with israel . " you only have to look at how serious current attempts are by iran and others to deny israel 's right to statehood and wipe it off the map completely , " weisskirchen said .
" you just have to consider the mood in syria and among hezbollah fighters to realize how real the threat is .
for us germans , there can be no other option than to stand firmly at the side of israel and defend it against any sort of military threat or anti-semitic propaganda . " germany 's largest-selling newspaper , bild , wrote on tuesday that awareness of the killing of six million european jews united the civilized world and made it unbearable that iran 's president put on the " so-called holocaust conference . " it is a forum for the vilest haters of jews on earth , " the paper wrote .
" one must be deeply ashamed that six germans also made it to this disgusting event .
and the iranian leadership shows its real face . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's national holocaust memorial in berlin german historian rene wildnagel said the holocaust conference served the purpose of strengthening a decades-old line of argument in many arab nations . " the holocaust issue is always debated in the arab world in line with one political pattern , " wildnagel said .
" the iranian president 's holocaust denial is just one example of this .
even those who accept that the holocaust did take place would immediately ask why the arabs should suffer from something that happened in europe and emanated from germany .
ahmadinejad himself once suggested that justice would be done by creating a jewish state on german territory . " on monday , germany hosted a separate international conference on holocaust studies .
attended by some of the world 's leading shoah researchers , the meeting provided the general public with the latest findings about the scope of the holocaust after the opening of eastern european archives in the 1990s . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians debate holocaust research in berlin leading holocaust historians gathered in berlin to discuss the current state of holocaust studies .
the meeting has been widely seen as a reaction to a controversial holocaust conference in iran .

the meeting was widely considered a platform for revisionists who deny the holocaust and the existence of gas chambers under the nazis . a spokesman for the german foreign ministry , jens ploetner , said in berlin that nothing of scientific value would come out of the tehran conference , which ended tuesday . " the german government condemns all attempts to deny the holocaust and question israel 's right to independent statehood , " he said .
" for us , living in the country where the mass murder of jews was planned and carried out , we feel a special responsibility to commemorate the victims of nazi terror .
it 's in this context that we condemn any attempt to provide a forum for revisionists who are out to rewrite history in an unacceptable manner . "
iran 's leadership has defended the decision to hold the conference , styling it as a scientific forum that would seek answers to unresolved issues around the holocaust .
it turned out to be a gathering of revisionists whose main claim to fame has been the doubts they 've frequently expressed about whether the mass murder of six million jews took place at all . bundestag president norbert lammert was among the strongest critics of the conference .
in a letter to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , he said he condemned any attempt to promote anti-semitic feelings under the guise of scientific freedom and objectivity .
the secretary general of germany 's social democratic party , hubertus heil , said that anyone who denies the holocaust is the enemy of modern day germany .
anti-semitic propaganda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad -lrb- l . -rrb- shaking with anti-zionism rabbi yisroel dovid weiss gert weisskirchen , the social democrats ' foreign policy spokesman in parliament , said the conference was a direct confrontation with israel . " you only have to look at how serious current attempts are by iran and others to deny israel 's right to statehood and wipe it off the map completely , " weisskirchen said .
" you just have to consider the mood in syria and among hezbollah fighters to realize how real the threat is .
for us germans , there can be no other option than to stand firmly at the side of israel and defend it against any sort of military threat or anti-semitic propaganda . " germany 's largest-selling newspaper , bild , wrote on tuesday that awareness of the killing of six million european jews united the civilized world and made it unbearable that iran 's president put on the " so-called holocaust conference . " it is a forum for the vilest haters of jews on earth , " the paper wrote .
" one must be deeply ashamed that six germans also made it to this disgusting event .
and the iranian leadership shows its real face . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's national holocaust memorial in berlin german historian rene wildnagel said the holocaust conference served the purpose of strengthening a decades-old line of argument in many arab nations . " the holocaust issue is always debated in the arab world in line with one political pattern , " wildnagel said .
" the iranian president 's holocaust denial is just one example of this .
even those who accept that the holocaust did take place would immediately ask why the arabs should suffer from something that happened in europe and emanated from germany .
ahmadinejad himself once suggested that justice would be done by creating a jewish state on german territory . " on monday , germany hosted a separate international conference on holocaust studies .
attended by some of the world 's leading shoah researchers , the meeting provided the general public with the latest findings about the scope of the holocaust after the opening of eastern european archives in the 1990s . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians debate holocaust research in berlin leading holocaust historians gathered in berlin to discuss the current state of holocaust studies .
the meeting has been widely seen as a reaction to a controversial holocaust conference in iran .

he has the curious distinction of being the player who , in the 69th minute of the final when the czech republic were leading 1-0 , was subbed out for the then relatively unknown oliver bierhoff who went on to score the two goals that turned the match around for germany , catapulting bierhoff to national and international fame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scholl 's international career has been more down than up scholl also played in all three of germany 's games at euro 2000 , scoring germany 's only goal in the tournament . he won his last international cap in february 2002 when germany beat israel 7-1 in kaiserslautern . before the 2006 world cup campaign , more than 100,000 people signed an online petition - " mehmet für deutschland " - for his inclusion in jürgen klinsmann 's squad for the tournament on home soil .
however , he was overlooked by his former international and club colleague . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de national soccer team redefines what it means to be german as nearly one-quarter of the german soccer team have foreign roots , cheering for the home boys means coming to terms with a germany that has become increasingly diverse ethnically .

" i have only one explanation for the presence of polonium , " dmitry kovtun said , referring to the radioactive substance found in litvinenko 's dead body and subsequently detected in properties visited by kovtun in germany . " it is that i brought -lrb- traces of -rrb- it back from london , where i met alexander litvinenko on oct .
16 , 17 and 18 , " kovtun told german television program " spiegel tv . " " the traces stay a very long time and when you then travel around the world , it leaves traces all along the way , " he added , speaking by telephone from a clinic in moscow , where he is being treated . kovtun is one of three russians who met litvinenko at a london hotel on nov .

they reportedly found no radiation on a bus litvinenko used to get to the hotel and believe he was not contaminated before the meeting . kovtun said in another interview he expected to be released from the moscow clinic where he is being treated within 10 days . " the doctors say that the situation has stabilized and that my health is recovering .
i expect to be in hospital for between a week and 10 days , " he told russia 's channel one television station .
commotion in hamburg earlier on tuesday , german authorities said four people close to kovtun had not suffered radiation contamination , despite an earlier police report that the four had shown signs of it after kovtun had stayed at their home in germany .
the ex-wife of the businessman , her two small children and current boyfriend were given the all-clear after undergoing tests in a hospital in hamburg , gerald kirchner of the federal office for radiation protection told german radio . kovtun is being investigated for bringing polonium 210 into germany in late october , when he passed through the country on his way from moscow to london .
he told " spiegel tv " he felt guilty for having been the cause of commotion in hamburg . the discovery of the substance in germany has widened the british-led investigation into litvinenko 's death .

after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies . in the first systematic cross-country study of ski areas in the alpine region , the organization for economic cooperation and development , or oecd , found that recent warming in the region , which is particularly sensitive to climate change , has been roughly three times the global average . of the countries studied , germany is most at risk , the report by the paris-based group said .
an increase in temperature by one degree could lead to a 60 percent decrease in the number of naturally snow-reliable ski areas in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the skilift was empty at the bavarian ski resort of sudelfeld earlier this month austria - where half the tourism income is from winter tourism - is slightly above average , followed by italy , france and switzerland , which would suffer the least . " the years 1994 , 2000 , 2002 , and 2003 were the warmest on record in the alps in the last 500 years , " the report found , adding that climate projections show even greater changes in the coming decades . at the moment , 90 percent of large alpine ski areas normally have adequate snow cover for at least 100 days per year , the report said , but future climate change could mean a drop in the number of snow-reliable ski areas . ski operators are already adapting to rising snow lines and shorter winter seasons , mostly with technology rather than changing behavioral patterns . artificial snow environmentally damaging artificial snow is popular and cost effective for ski operators but consumes a lot of water and energy and can harm the landscape and ecology . making artificial snow will become more expensive as temperatures rise , and it will no longer be possible if the air becomes too warm , the report said . alpine tourism plays a key role in the economies of alpine countries , with some 60 to 80 million tourists to the region each year , and a total of 160 million days recorded annually by ski lift operators in france , austria , switzerland and germany . another ski event cancelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five world cup ski races have already been cancelled this year opec 's warning came with the news of the cancellation of the women 's slalom race in the france alpine resort town of megeve because of lack of snow . the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- has so far failed to name a replacement venue for the event , which was scheduled for dec .
20 . megeve is the fifth cancellation of the alpine winter skiing season because of the unseasonably warm weather . women 's races in st. moritz in switzerland , men 's and women 's in val d 'isere in france , as well as the traditional season-opener in sölden in austria at the end of october were all called off . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de less snow and drier summers in german forecast new weather models predict arid summers and less time for winter sports in germany if climate changed is n't turned around , according to a study released this week by the max-planck institute for meteorology .

after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies . in the first systematic cross-country study of ski areas in the alpine region , the organization for economic cooperation and development , or oecd , found that recent warming in the region , which is particularly sensitive to climate change , has been roughly three times the global average . of the countries studied , germany is most at risk , the report by the paris-based group said .
an increase in temperature by one degree could lead to a 60 percent decrease in the number of naturally snow-reliable ski areas in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the skilift was empty at the bavarian ski resort of sudelfeld earlier this month austria - where half the tourism income is from winter tourism - is slightly above average , followed by italy , france and switzerland , which would suffer the least . " the years 1994 , 2000 , 2002 , and 2003 were the warmest on record in the alps in the last 500 years , " the report found , adding that climate projections show even greater changes in the coming decades . at the moment , 90 percent of large alpine ski areas normally have adequate snow cover for at least 100 days per year , the report said , but future climate change could mean a drop in the number of snow-reliable ski areas . ski operators are already adapting to rising snow lines and shorter winter seasons , mostly with technology rather than changing behavioral patterns . artificial snow environmentally damaging artificial snow is popular and cost effective for ski operators but consumes a lot of water and energy and can harm the landscape and ecology . making artificial snow will become more expensive as temperatures rise , and it will no longer be possible if the air becomes too warm , the report said . alpine tourism plays a key role in the economies of alpine countries , with some 60 to 80 million tourists to the region each year , and a total of 160 million days recorded annually by ski lift operators in france , austria , switzerland and germany . another ski event cancelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five world cup ski races have already been cancelled this year opec 's warning came with the news of the cancellation of the women 's slalom race in the france alpine resort town of megeve because of lack of snow . the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- has so far failed to name a replacement venue for the event , which was scheduled for dec .
20 . megeve is the fifth cancellation of the alpine winter skiing season because of the unseasonably warm weather . women 's races in st. moritz in switzerland , men 's and women 's in val d 'isere in france , as well as the traditional season-opener in sölden in austria at the end of october were all called off . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de less snow and drier summers in german forecast new weather models predict arid summers and less time for winter sports in germany if climate changed is n't turned around , according to a study released this week by the max-planck institute for meteorology .

" it 's not normal that foreign motorists pay nothing for the use of our roads , " söder told the mass-market bild am sonntag newspaper .
" elsewhere in europe , they always have to pay . " the vignette sticker model , which seven countries including austria , the czech republic and switzerland also use , would be accompanied by lowering germany 's petroleum and motor vehicle taxes as a way of charging foreign cars for using german roads and discouraging gas tank tourism by lowering fuel prices in germany . mercedes and bmw outnumber fiat and renault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven european countries use a vignette toll system but only a dramatic , and unlikely , cut in the fuel tax would compensate drivers for a 100-euro windshield sticker , according to andreas hölzel a spokesman for the adac , germany 's largest automobile club . " we are not aware of a case where the tax was so drastically cut that gas tank tourism would be affected , " hölzel said , adding that of all the cars on german highways , only 5 percent have foreign license plates , making the costs of maintaining a vignette system higher than the revenue it would bring in . while a windshield sticker is the most commonly debated model in germany , 10 european countries , including france , italy , spain and poland , charge drivers based on the distance they travel instead of an annual fee , which makes considerably more sense , according to hartmut topp of the institute for mobility and traffic at the technical university of kaiserslautern . " a vignette is a crazy idea that encourages people to drive more in order to lower the cost per kilometer , " he said .
" what makes sense is a distance-based toll system . " truck tolls difficult to expand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the truck toll system started in 2005 , about a year later than planned while a similar system that was setup for heavy commercial trucks using the autobahn was plagued with delays and lost revenue when it launched in 2005 , it is now running well , topp said . but enlarging the satellite system that keeps track of about 1 million trucks on highways to encompass germany 's 44 million registered automobiles on all streets is unrealistic and does n't make sense when the state already has the money it needs for road projects , according hölzel . of the 53 billion euros collected from fuel and motor vehicle tax receipts as well as revenue from the truck toll system , about 17 billion are spent on germany 's road network , he said , calling on the government to invest money car owners pay in taxes into street projects . while no studies have been conducted to estimate the cost of creating a car toll system , the toll collect consortium received seven billion euros from german government to create the truck 's toll system .
of the 3.1 billion euros in levies toll collect delivered to the government in 2006 , it received 600 million euros -lrb- from berlin -rrb- to keep the network running . safer in the fast lane bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tolls are rare in germany but do exist on some tunnels even if the truck system could be expanded to include cars , a feat toll collect officials said may be possible but would require large additional investments , any kind of toll placed exclusively on highways could also lead to heavier traffic on smaller , local roads that tend to have more serious accidents than the highway , hölzel said . according to the adac estimates , increased traffic on smaller roads could lead to 570 more traffic deaths and 17,000 additional injuries if 20 percent of cars left the highway to get around tolls . keeping drivers from moving to toll-free streets is why any automobile toll would have to include all roads , not just highways , topp said , adding that he , contrary to hölzel , expects such technology to exist within the next five years . " at times and in places where there is an especially high demand you can charge an especially high toll , and when there are fewer drivers it can be cheaper , " he said . toll debate unlikely to disappear regardless of how many people they share the road with , german drivers , for the time being , wo n't have to worry about reaching into their wallets right away .
federal transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee has ruled out any system of car tolls , saying that none of the newest suggestions he 's heard was better than those regularly made in the past . " bad arguments do not get better when they are regularly repeated , " tiefensee , a social democrat , told reporters . despite a lack of unity on implementing a fee system in berlin , bavarian politicians have said they will consider possible automobile toll options for germany , nearly guaranteeing that the debate will come up again in 2007 . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls go out for passenger car toll on the autobahn the interior minister of bavaria , günther beckstein , has called for a toll system to be instituted on passenger cars traveling germany 's freeway system to stop " gas station tourism .

he has also won 36 caps playing for germany . but 17 years at the top have taken their toll on scholl , who was an idol for fans in his youth , lauded for his technical ability , his creative playmaking , his dribbling skills and his free-kicks , and has battled throughout his career with countless muscle and ligament injuries . scholl 's latest setback came only last wednesday when he sustained a muscle fiber injury in training , meaning he wo n't be fit to play until next year . injuries restrict scholl to bit-part role in final season coach felix magath has said he intends to only use scholl as a substitute between now and the end of the season but fans can say goodbye to the player in the franz beckenbauer cup tournament against current european champions barca next august . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayern no.7 has scored many vital goals in his career since his move from karlsruhe to bayern in 1992 , scholl has achieved everything that can be achieved in german club football . apart from his eight league medals , scholl also helped bayern to five german cups as well as the 1996 uefa cup and 2001 champions league titles . in early 2001 , he was voted player of the year 2000 by the professional players of the first and second bundesliga , and in may 2005 , fans voted him one of the eleven greatest bayern players of all time an international career of disappointments scholl 's only disappointment comes from his time with the german national team .
ill-timed injuries meant he never made an appearance at a world cup and he made just three appearances at euro 1996 in england , when he was substituted each time . he played in the quarter-final , semi-final , and final .
he has the curious distinction of being the player who , in the 69th minute of the final when the czech republic were leading 1-0 , was subbed out for the then relatively unknown oliver bierhoff who went on to score the two goals that turned the match around for germany , catapulting bierhoff to national and international fame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scholl 's international career has been more down than up scholl also played in all three of germany 's games at euro 2000 , scoring germany 's only goal in the tournament . he won his last international cap in february 2002 when germany beat israel 7-1 in kaiserslautern . before the 2006 world cup campaign , more than 100,000 people signed an online petition - " mehmet für deutschland " - for his inclusion in jürgen klinsmann 's squad for the tournament on home soil .
however , he was overlooked by his former international and club colleague . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de national soccer team redefines what it means to be german as nearly one-quarter of the german soccer team have foreign roots , cheering for the home boys means coming to terms with a germany that has become increasingly diverse ethnically .

the meeting was widely considered a platform for revisionists who deny the holocaust and the existence of gas chambers under the nazis . a spokesman for the german foreign ministry , jens ploetner , said in berlin that nothing of scientific value would come out of the tehran conference , which ended tuesday . " the german government condemns all attempts to deny the holocaust and question israel 's right to independent statehood , " he said .
" for us , living in the country where the mass murder of jews was planned and carried out , we feel a special responsibility to commemorate the victims of nazi terror .
it 's in this context that we condemn any attempt to provide a forum for revisionists who are out to rewrite history in an unacceptable manner . "
iran 's leadership has defended the decision to hold the conference , styling it as a scientific forum that would seek answers to unresolved issues around the holocaust .
it turned out to be a gathering of revisionists whose main claim to fame has been the doubts they 've frequently expressed about whether the mass murder of six million jews took place at all . bundestag president norbert lammert was among the strongest critics of the conference .
in a letter to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , he said he condemned any attempt to promote anti-semitic feelings under the guise of scientific freedom and objectivity .
the secretary general of germany 's social democratic party , hubertus heil , said that anyone who denies the holocaust is the enemy of modern day germany .

" you only have to look at how serious current attempts are by iran and others to deny israel 's right to statehood and wipe it off the map completely , " weisskirchen said .
" you just have to consider the mood in syria and among hezbollah fighters to realize how real the threat is .
for us germans , there can be no other option than to stand firmly at the side of israel and defend it against any sort of military threat or anti-semitic propaganda . " germany 's largest-selling newspaper , bild , wrote on tuesday that awareness of the killing of six million european jews united the civilized world and made it unbearable that iran 's president put on the " so-called holocaust conference . " it is a forum for the vilest haters of jews on earth , " the paper wrote .
" one must be deeply ashamed that six germans also made it to this disgusting event .
and the iranian leadership shows its real face . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's national holocaust memorial in berlin german historian rene wildnagel said the holocaust conference served the purpose of strengthening a decades-old line of argument in many arab nations . " the holocaust issue is always debated in the arab world in line with one political pattern , " wildnagel said .
" the iranian president 's holocaust denial is just one example of this .
even those who accept that the holocaust did take place would immediately ask why the arabs should suffer from something that happened in europe and emanated from germany .
ahmadinejad himself once suggested that justice would be done by creating a jewish state on german territory . " on monday , germany hosted a separate international conference on holocaust studies .

after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies . in the first systematic cross-country study of ski areas in the alpine region , the organization for economic cooperation and development , or oecd , found that recent warming in the region , which is particularly sensitive to climate change , has been roughly three times the global average . of the countries studied , germany is most at risk , the report by the paris-based group said .
an increase in temperature by one degree could lead to a 60 percent decrease in the number of naturally snow-reliable ski areas in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the skilift was empty at the bavarian ski resort of sudelfeld earlier this month austria - where half the tourism income is from winter tourism - is slightly above average , followed by italy , france and switzerland , which would suffer the least . " the years 1994 , 2000 , 2002 , and 2003 were the warmest on record in the alps in the last 500 years , " the report found , adding that climate projections show even greater changes in the coming decades . at the moment , 90 percent of large alpine ski areas normally have adequate snow cover for at least 100 days per year , the report said , but future climate change could mean a drop in the number of snow-reliable ski areas . ski operators are already adapting to rising snow lines and shorter winter seasons , mostly with technology rather than changing behavioral patterns . artificial snow environmentally damaging artificial snow is popular and cost effective for ski operators but consumes a lot of water and energy and can harm the landscape and ecology . making artificial snow will become more expensive as temperatures rise , and it will no longer be possible if the air becomes too warm , the report said . alpine tourism plays a key role in the economies of alpine countries , with some 60 to 80 million tourists to the region each year , and a total of 160 million days recorded annually by ski lift operators in france , austria , switzerland and germany . another ski event cancelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five world cup ski races have already been cancelled this year opec 's warning came with the news of the cancellation of the women 's slalom race in the france alpine resort town of megeve because of lack of snow . the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- has so far failed to name a replacement venue for the event , which was scheduled for dec .
20 . megeve is the fifth cancellation of the alpine winter skiing season because of the unseasonably warm weather . women 's races in st. moritz in switzerland , men 's and women 's in val d 'isere in france , as well as the traditional season-opener in sölden in austria at the end of october were all called off . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de less snow and drier summers in german forecast new weather models predict arid summers and less time for winter sports in germany if climate changed is n't turned around , according to a study released this week by the max-planck institute for meteorology .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 13.12.2006 germany protests against tehran holocaust conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of anti-zionist rabbis attended the conference german lawmakers have protested against an iranian conference on the holocaust .
the meeting was widely considered a platform for revisionists who deny the holocaust and the existence of gas chambers under the nazis . a spokesman for the german foreign ministry , jens ploetner , said in berlin that nothing of scientific value would come out of the tehran conference , which ended tuesday . " the german government condemns all attempts to deny the holocaust and question israel 's right to independent statehood , " he said .
" for us , living in the country where the mass murder of jews was planned and carried out , we feel a special responsibility to commemorate the victims of nazi terror .
it 's in this context that we condemn any attempt to provide a forum for revisionists who are out to rewrite history in an unacceptable manner . "
iran 's leadership has defended the decision to hold the conference , styling it as a scientific forum that would seek answers to unresolved issues around the holocaust .
it turned out to be a gathering of revisionists whose main claim to fame has been the doubts they 've frequently expressed about whether the mass murder of six million jews took place at all . bundestag president norbert lammert was among the strongest critics of the conference .
in a letter to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , he said he condemned any attempt to promote anti-semitic feelings under the guise of scientific freedom and objectivity .
the secretary general of germany 's social democratic party , hubertus heil , said that anyone who denies the holocaust is the enemy of modern day germany .
anti-semitic propaganda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad -lrb- l . -rrb- shaking with anti-zionism rabbi yisroel dovid weiss gert weisskirchen , the social democrats ' foreign policy spokesman in parliament , said the conference was a direct confrontation with israel . " you only have to look at how serious current attempts are by iran and others to deny israel 's right to statehood and wipe it off the map completely , " weisskirchen said .
" you just have to consider the mood in syria and among hezbollah fighters to realize how real the threat is .
for us germans , there can be no other option than to stand firmly at the side of israel and defend it against any sort of military threat or anti-semitic propaganda . " germany 's largest-selling newspaper , bild , wrote on tuesday that awareness of the killing of six million european jews united the civilized world and made it unbearable that iran 's president put on the " so-called holocaust conference . " it is a forum for the vilest haters of jews on earth , " the paper wrote .
" one must be deeply ashamed that six germans also made it to this disgusting event .
and the iranian leadership shows its real face . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's national holocaust memorial in berlin german historian rene wildnagel said the holocaust conference served the purpose of strengthening a decades-old line of argument in many arab nations . " the holocaust issue is always debated in the arab world in line with one political pattern , " wildnagel said .
" the iranian president 's holocaust denial is just one example of this .
even those who accept that the holocaust did take place would immediately ask why the arabs should suffer from something that happened in europe and emanated from germany .
ahmadinejad himself once suggested that justice would be done by creating a jewish state on german territory . " on monday , germany hosted a separate international conference on holocaust studies .
attended by some of the world 's leading shoah researchers , the meeting provided the general public with the latest findings about the scope of the holocaust after the opening of eastern european archives in the 1990s . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians debate holocaust research in berlin leading holocaust historians gathered in berlin to discuss the current state of holocaust studies .
the meeting has been widely seen as a reaction to a controversial holocaust conference in iran .

could an opt-out system provide the answer ? twelve thousand people in germany are currently on the waiting list for a kidney , liver or heart transplant . tragically , many of them will die before the life-giving operation can ever take place .
this organ shortage exists even though , according to official surveys , some eighty percent of germans say , in principle , they would be prepared to become organ donors .
in reality , just a fraction of them possess organ donor cards . last year , some 3,500 organs were transplanted , but more than twice as many people joined the waiting list .
burkhardt topp from the transplant association says germans are put off from helping others by a number of factors . " i think that everything that is connected with death and dying is a taboo in germany , " he said .
" and organ donation is obviously linked to that .
if you think about this issue then you are also forced to think about your own possible death . " scare stories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an organ transplant in jena , germany topp says that people are also worried by scare stories in the media about organ smuggling and organ theft . " the theme of organ donation is made more difficult by everything that is somehow associated with the medical sphere and is not 100 percent upright , " he said . this insecurity has also been promoted by the long discussions here over what how to determine the time of death .
critics of organ donation argued that brain death was difficult to ascertain and that heart failure was the only reliable indicator .
lawmakers decided that transplantation could take place after brain death had been certified , but only if the patients were carriers of organ donor cards .
and that only goes for some 12 percent of the german population . in the majority of cases it is grieving relatives who are left to decide .
many have no idea what their loved ones would have wanted . " the difficulty is that the topic is not talked about enough in the family , " says topp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 13.12.2006 organ donation still a taboo topic in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , 3,500 organs were transplanted in germany the taboos surrounding organ donation in germany continue to cost hundreds of people their lives each year .
could an opt-out system provide the answer ? twelve thousand people in germany are currently on the waiting list for a kidney , liver or heart transplant . tragically , many of them will die before the life-giving operation can ever take place .
this organ shortage exists even though , according to official surveys , some eighty percent of germans say , in principle , they would be prepared to become organ donors .
in reality , just a fraction of them possess organ donor cards . last year , some 3,500 organs were transplanted , but more than twice as many people joined the waiting list .
burkhardt topp from the transplant association says germans are put off from helping others by a number of factors . " i think that everything that is connected with death and dying is a taboo in germany , " he said .
" and organ donation is obviously linked to that .
if you think about this issue then you are also forced to think about your own possible death . " scare stories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an organ transplant in jena , germany topp says that people are also worried by scare stories in the media about organ smuggling and organ theft . " the theme of organ donation is made more difficult by everything that is somehow associated with the medical sphere and is not 100 percent upright , " he said . this insecurity has also been promoted by the long discussions here over what how to determine the time of death .
critics of organ donation argued that brain death was difficult to ascertain and that heart failure was the only reliable indicator .
lawmakers decided that transplantation could take place after brain death had been certified , but only if the patients were carriers of organ donor cards .
and that only goes for some 12 percent of the german population . in the majority of cases it is grieving relatives who are left to decide .
many have no idea what their loved ones would have wanted . " the difficulty is that the topic is not talked about enough in the family , " says topp .
" in eighty percent of the cases the family has to make up their minds about the question of organ donation .
of course , that leads to a very high rejection rate . " opt-out system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dialysis machine is the only option for many waiting for a kidney transplant in europe , germany ranks in fifth place when it comes to the number of organ donors - with 15 for every one million inhabitants per year .
in the case of the top three , spain , belgium and austria , the laws relating to donation are very different .
there you have to opt out rather than opt in of the donor scheme .
everyone is a potential donor unless they lodge an objection in writing . professor christoph brölsch from the university clinic in essen thinks this solution is the only way of tackling the organ shortage problem here in germany . " i have been working on this problem for thirty years , " he said .
" i 'll readily admit that i am extremely frustrated by the fact that we need to keep on persuading people of the necessity and the propriety of organ donation . " it is a situation that leads to a harrowing race with death .
in essen alone , there are 200 people waiting for a liver transplant .
the reality in germany is , says brölsch , that forty percent of them will die before a transplant can ever take place . dw staff -lrb- jeg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tourists face unauthorized organ removal not many tourists know that they in some popular destinations , organs can be removed without consent after death .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.12.2006 car highway tolls remain taboo in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only commercial trucks currently need to pay to drive on germany 's highway network a debate surrounding tolls on german highways has broken out again , and while bavarian politicians continue pushing for an autobahn vignette , the federal government says it 's out of the question . as the german state that suffers most from " gas tank tourism " - the practice of filling up in neighboring countries where a liter of gasoline can cost up to 20 euro cents less -lrb- about $ 1 per gallon -rrb- - appeals for a german automobile toll often comes out of bavaria . markus söder , general secretary of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , raised the southern german state 's second call this year for drivers to buy a 100-euro window sticker before pulling up to the on-ramp . " it 's not normal that foreign motorists pay nothing for the use of our roads , " söder told the mass-market bild am sonntag newspaper .
" elsewhere in europe , they always have to pay . " the vignette sticker model , which seven countries including austria , the czech republic and switzerland also use , would be accompanied by lowering germany 's petroleum and motor vehicle taxes as a way of charging foreign cars for using german roads and discouraging gas tank tourism by lowering fuel prices in germany . mercedes and bmw outnumber fiat and renault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven european countries use a vignette toll system but only a dramatic , and unlikely , cut in the fuel tax would compensate drivers for a 100-euro windshield sticker , according to andreas hölzel a spokesman for the adac , germany 's largest automobile club . " we are not aware of a case where the tax was so drastically cut that gas tank tourism would be affected , " hölzel said , adding that of all the cars on german highways , only 5 percent have foreign license plates , making the costs of maintaining a vignette system higher than the revenue it would bring in . while a windshield sticker is the most commonly debated model in germany , 10 european countries , including france , italy , spain and poland , charge drivers based on the distance they travel instead of an annual fee , which makes considerably more sense , according to hartmut topp of the institute for mobility and traffic at the technical university of kaiserslautern . " a vignette is a crazy idea that encourages people to drive more in order to lower the cost per kilometer , " he said .
" what makes sense is a distance-based toll system . " truck tolls difficult to expand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the truck toll system started in 2005 , about a year later than planned while a similar system that was setup for heavy commercial trucks using the autobahn was plagued with delays and lost revenue when it launched in 2005 , it is now running well , topp said . but enlarging the satellite system that keeps track of about 1 million trucks on highways to encompass germany 's 44 million registered automobiles on all streets is unrealistic and does n't make sense when the state already has the money it needs for road projects , according hölzel . of the 53 billion euros collected from fuel and motor vehicle tax receipts as well as revenue from the truck toll system , about 17 billion are spent on germany 's road network , he said , calling on the government to invest money car owners pay in taxes into street projects . while no studies have been conducted to estimate the cost of creating a car toll system , the toll collect consortium received seven billion euros from german government to create the truck 's toll system .
of the 3.1 billion euros in levies toll collect delivered to the government in 2006 , it received 600 million euros -lrb- from berlin -rrb- to keep the network running . safer in the fast lane bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tolls are rare in germany but do exist on some tunnels even if the truck system could be expanded to include cars , a feat toll collect officials said may be possible but would require large additional investments , any kind of toll placed exclusively on highways could also lead to heavier traffic on smaller , local roads that tend to have more serious accidents than the highway , hölzel said . according to the adac estimates , increased traffic on smaller roads could lead to 570 more traffic deaths and 17,000 additional injuries if 20 percent of cars left the highway to get around tolls . keeping drivers from moving to toll-free streets is why any automobile toll would have to include all roads , not just highways , topp said , adding that he , contrary to hölzel , expects such technology to exist within the next five years . " at times and in places where there is an especially high demand you can charge an especially high toll , and when there are fewer drivers it can be cheaper , " he said . toll debate unlikely to disappear regardless of how many people they share the road with , german drivers , for the time being , wo n't have to worry about reaching into their wallets right away .
federal transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee has ruled out any system of car tolls , saying that none of the newest suggestions he 's heard was better than those regularly made in the past . " bad arguments do not get better when they are regularly repeated , " tiefensee , a social democrat , told reporters . despite a lack of unity on implementing a fee system in berlin , bavarian politicians have said they will consider possible automobile toll options for germany , nearly guaranteeing that the debate will come up again in 2007 . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls go out for passenger car toll on the autobahn the interior minister of bavaria , günther beckstein , has called for a toll system to be instituted on passenger cars traveling germany 's freeway system to stop " gas station tourism . " -lrb- 25.07.2006 -rrb- in the fast lane to controversy the autobahn is a german icon , right up there with beer and oktoberfest .
so a controversial proposal to sell off the country 's renowned highway system has , expectedly , kicked up a storm of protest .
-lrb- 17.10.2005 -rrb- german toll tipped for expansion after the successful start of germany 's long troubled highway toll system for heavy commercial trucks , suggestions are already being made to expand the satellite-based technology to surface streets and normal cars .

" it 's not normal that foreign motorists pay nothing for the use of our roads , " söder told the mass-market bild am sonntag newspaper .
" elsewhere in europe , they always have to pay . " the vignette sticker model , which seven countries including austria , the czech republic and switzerland also use , would be accompanied by lowering germany 's petroleum and motor vehicle taxes as a way of charging foreign cars for using german roads and discouraging gas tank tourism by lowering fuel prices in germany . mercedes and bmw outnumber fiat and renault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven european countries use a vignette toll system but only a dramatic , and unlikely , cut in the fuel tax would compensate drivers for a 100-euro windshield sticker , according to andreas hölzel a spokesman for the adac , germany 's largest automobile club . " we are not aware of a case where the tax was so drastically cut that gas tank tourism would be affected , " hölzel said , adding that of all the cars on german highways , only 5 percent have foreign license plates , making the costs of maintaining a vignette system higher than the revenue it would bring in . while a windshield sticker is the most commonly debated model in germany , 10 european countries , including france , italy , spain and poland , charge drivers based on the distance they travel instead of an annual fee , which makes considerably more sense , according to hartmut topp of the institute for mobility and traffic at the technical university of kaiserslautern . " a vignette is a crazy idea that encourages people to drive more in order to lower the cost per kilometer , " he said .
" what makes sense is a distance-based toll system . " truck tolls difficult to expand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the truck toll system started in 2005 , about a year later than planned while a similar system that was setup for heavy commercial trucks using the autobahn was plagued with delays and lost revenue when it launched in 2005 , it is now running well , topp said . but enlarging the satellite system that keeps track of about 1 million trucks on highways to encompass germany 's 44 million registered automobiles on all streets is unrealistic and does n't make sense when the state already has the money it needs for road projects , according hölzel . of the 53 billion euros collected from fuel and motor vehicle tax receipts as well as revenue from the truck toll system , about 17 billion are spent on germany 's road network , he said , calling on the government to invest money car owners pay in taxes into street projects . while no studies have been conducted to estimate the cost of creating a car toll system , the toll collect consortium received seven billion euros from german government to create the truck 's toll system .
of the 3.1 billion euros in levies toll collect delivered to the government in 2006 , it received 600 million euros -lrb- from berlin -rrb- to keep the network running . safer in the fast lane bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tolls are rare in germany but do exist on some tunnels even if the truck system could be expanded to include cars , a feat toll collect officials said may be possible but would require large additional investments , any kind of toll placed exclusively on highways could also lead to heavier traffic on smaller , local roads that tend to have more serious accidents than the highway , hölzel said . according to the adac estimates , increased traffic on smaller roads could lead to 570 more traffic deaths and 17,000 additional injuries if 20 percent of cars left the highway to get around tolls . keeping drivers from moving to toll-free streets is why any automobile toll would have to include all roads , not just highways , topp said , adding that he , contrary to hölzel , expects such technology to exist within the next five years . " at times and in places where there is an especially high demand you can charge an especially high toll , and when there are fewer drivers it can be cheaper , " he said . toll debate unlikely to disappear regardless of how many people they share the road with , german drivers , for the time being , wo n't have to worry about reaching into their wallets right away .
federal transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee has ruled out any system of car tolls , saying that none of the newest suggestions he 's heard was better than those regularly made in the past . " bad arguments do not get better when they are regularly repeated , " tiefensee , a social democrat , told reporters . despite a lack of unity on implementing a fee system in berlin , bavarian politicians have said they will consider possible automobile toll options for germany , nearly guaranteeing that the debate will come up again in 2007 . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls go out for passenger car toll on the autobahn the interior minister of bavaria , günther beckstein , has called for a toll system to be instituted on passenger cars traveling germany 's freeway system to stop " gas station tourism . " -lrb- 25.07.2006 -rrb- in the fast lane to controversy the autobahn is a german icon , right up there with beer and oktoberfest .
so a controversial proposal to sell off the country 's renowned highway system has , expectedly , kicked up a storm of protest .
-lrb- 17.10.2005 -rrb- german toll tipped for expansion after the successful start of germany 's long troubled highway toll system for heavy commercial trucks , suggestions are already being made to expand the satellite-based technology to surface streets and normal cars .

could an opt-out system provide the answer ? twelve thousand people in germany are currently on the waiting list for a kidney , liver or heart transplant . tragically , many of them will die before the life-giving operation can ever take place .
this organ shortage exists even though , according to official surveys , some eighty percent of germans say , in principle , they would be prepared to become organ donors .
in reality , just a fraction of them possess organ donor cards . last year , some 3,500 organs were transplanted , but more than twice as many people joined the waiting list .
burkhardt topp from the transplant association says germans are put off from helping others by a number of factors . " i think that everything that is connected with death and dying is a taboo in germany , " he said .

" the theme of organ donation is made more difficult by everything that is somehow associated with the medical sphere and is not 100 percent upright , " he said . this insecurity has also been promoted by the long discussions here over what how to determine the time of death .
critics of organ donation argued that brain death was difficult to ascertain and that heart failure was the only reliable indicator .
lawmakers decided that transplantation could take place after brain death had been certified , but only if the patients were carriers of organ donor cards .
and that only goes for some 12 percent of the german population . in the majority of cases it is grieving relatives who are left to decide .
many have no idea what their loved ones would have wanted . " the difficulty is that the topic is not talked about enough in the family , " says topp .

" the years 1994 , 2000 , 2002 , and 2003 were the warmest on record in the alps in the last 500 years , " the report found , adding that climate projections show even greater changes in the coming decades . at the moment , 90 percent of large alpine ski areas normally have adequate snow cover for at least 100 days per year , the report said , but future climate change could mean a drop in the number of snow-reliable ski areas . ski operators are already adapting to rising snow lines and shorter winter seasons , mostly with technology rather than changing behavioral patterns . artificial snow environmentally damaging artificial snow is popular and cost effective for ski operators but consumes a lot of water and energy and can harm the landscape and ecology . making artificial snow will become more expensive as temperatures rise , and it will no longer be possible if the air becomes too warm , the report said . alpine tourism plays a key role in the economies of alpine countries , with some 60 to 80 million tourists to the region each year , and a total of 160 million days recorded annually by ski lift operators in france , austria , switzerland and germany . another ski event cancelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five world cup ski races have already been cancelled this year opec 's warning came with the news of the cancellation of the women 's slalom race in the france alpine resort town of megeve because of lack of snow . the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- has so far failed to name a replacement venue for the event , which was scheduled for dec .
20 . megeve is the fifth cancellation of the alpine winter skiing season because of the unseasonably warm weather . women 's races in st. moritz in switzerland , men 's and women 's in val d 'isere in france , as well as the traditional season-opener in sölden in austria at the end of october were all called off . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de less snow and drier summers in german forecast new weather models predict arid summers and less time for winter sports in germany if climate changed is n't turned around , according to a study released this week by the max-planck institute for meteorology .

the meeting was widely considered a platform for revisionists who deny the holocaust and the existence of gas chambers under the nazis . a spokesman for the german foreign ministry , jens ploetner , said in berlin that nothing of scientific value would come out of the tehran conference , which ended tuesday . " the german government condemns all attempts to deny the holocaust and question israel 's right to independent statehood , " he said .
" for us , living in the country where the mass murder of jews was planned and carried out , we feel a special responsibility to commemorate the victims of nazi terror .
it 's in this context that we condemn any attempt to provide a forum for revisionists who are out to rewrite history in an unacceptable manner . "
iran 's leadership has defended the decision to hold the conference , styling it as a scientific forum that would seek answers to unresolved issues around the holocaust .
it turned out to be a gathering of revisionists whose main claim to fame has been the doubts they 've frequently expressed about whether the mass murder of six million jews took place at all . bundestag president norbert lammert was among the strongest critics of the conference .
in a letter to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , he said he condemned any attempt to promote anti-semitic feelings under the guise of scientific freedom and objectivity .
the secretary general of germany 's social democratic party , hubertus heil , said that anyone who denies the holocaust is the enemy of modern day germany .
anti-semitic propaganda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad -lrb- l . -rrb- shaking with anti-zionism rabbi yisroel dovid weiss gert weisskirchen , the social democrats ' foreign policy spokesman in parliament , said the conference was a direct confrontation with israel . " you only have to look at how serious current attempts are by iran and others to deny israel 's right to statehood and wipe it off the map completely , " weisskirchen said .
" you just have to consider the mood in syria and among hezbollah fighters to realize how real the threat is .
for us germans , there can be no other option than to stand firmly at the side of israel and defend it against any sort of military threat or anti-semitic propaganda . " germany 's largest-selling newspaper , bild , wrote on tuesday that awareness of the killing of six million european jews united the civilized world and made it unbearable that iran 's president put on the " so-called holocaust conference . " it is a forum for the vilest haters of jews on earth , " the paper wrote .
" one must be deeply ashamed that six germans also made it to this disgusting event .
and the iranian leadership shows its real face . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's national holocaust memorial in berlin german historian rene wildnagel said the holocaust conference served the purpose of strengthening a decades-old line of argument in many arab nations . " the holocaust issue is always debated in the arab world in line with one political pattern , " wildnagel said .
" the iranian president 's holocaust denial is just one example of this .
even those who accept that the holocaust did take place would immediately ask why the arabs should suffer from something that happened in europe and emanated from germany .
ahmadinejad himself once suggested that justice would be done by creating a jewish state on german territory . " on monday , germany hosted a separate international conference on holocaust studies .
attended by some of the world 's leading shoah researchers , the meeting provided the general public with the latest findings about the scope of the holocaust after the opening of eastern european archives in the 1990s . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians debate holocaust research in berlin leading holocaust historians gathered in berlin to discuss the current state of holocaust studies .

" at times and in places where there is an especially high demand you can charge an especially high toll , and when there are fewer drivers it can be cheaper , " he said . toll debate unlikely to disappear regardless of how many people they share the road with , german drivers , for the time being , wo n't have to worry about reaching into their wallets right away .
federal transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee has ruled out any system of car tolls , saying that none of the newest suggestions he 's heard was better than those regularly made in the past . " bad arguments do not get better when they are regularly repeated , " tiefensee , a social democrat , told reporters . despite a lack of unity on implementing a fee system in berlin , bavarian politicians have said they will consider possible automobile toll options for germany , nearly guaranteeing that the debate will come up again in 2007 . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls go out for passenger car toll on the autobahn the interior minister of bavaria , günther beckstein , has called for a toll system to be instituted on passenger cars traveling germany 's freeway system to stop " gas station tourism .

after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies . in the first systematic cross-country study of ski areas in the alpine region , the organization for economic cooperation and development , or oecd , found that recent warming in the region , which is particularly sensitive to climate change , has been roughly three times the global average . of the countries studied , germany is most at risk , the report by the paris-based group said .
an increase in temperature by one degree could lead to a 60 percent decrease in the number of naturally snow-reliable ski areas in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the skilift was empty at the bavarian ski resort of sudelfeld earlier this month austria - where half the tourism income is from winter tourism - is slightly above average , followed by italy , france and switzerland , which would suffer the least . " the years 1994 , 2000 , 2002 , and 2003 were the warmest on record in the alps in the last 500 years , " the report found , adding that climate projections show even greater changes in the coming decades . at the moment , 90 percent of large alpine ski areas normally have adequate snow cover for at least 100 days per year , the report said , but future climate change could mean a drop in the number of snow-reliable ski areas . ski operators are already adapting to rising snow lines and shorter winter seasons , mostly with technology rather than changing behavioral patterns . artificial snow environmentally damaging artificial snow is popular and cost effective for ski operators but consumes a lot of water and energy and can harm the landscape and ecology . making artificial snow will become more expensive as temperatures rise , and it will no longer be possible if the air becomes too warm , the report said . alpine tourism plays a key role in the economies of alpine countries , with some 60 to 80 million tourists to the region each year , and a total of 160 million days recorded annually by ski lift operators in france , austria , switzerland and germany . another ski event cancelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five world cup ski races have already been cancelled this year opec 's warning came with the news of the cancellation of the women 's slalom race in the france alpine resort town of megeve because of lack of snow . the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- has so far failed to name a replacement venue for the event , which was scheduled for dec .
20 . megeve is the fifth cancellation of the alpine winter skiing season because of the unseasonably warm weather . women 's races in st. moritz in switzerland , men 's and women 's in val d 'isere in france , as well as the traditional season-opener in sölden in austria at the end of october were all called off . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de less snow and drier summers in german forecast new weather models predict arid summers and less time for winter sports in germany if climate changed is n't turned around , according to a study released this week by the max-planck institute for meteorology .

could an opt-out system provide the answer ? twelve thousand people in germany are currently on the waiting list for a kidney , liver or heart transplant . tragically , many of them will die before the life-giving operation can ever take place .

" mehmet will call it a day at the end of the season , " hoeness told the bild newspaper tuesday , adding that scholl - the only professional footballer to win eight bundesliga titles - would be remaining with the club to work with the defending champions ' youth team . " he might even do this at board level , " hoeness said . " bayern are losing a much loved player , " said hoeness of the club 's longest-serving player .
scholl 's last match for the german champions will be a friendly against barcelona in august 2007 .
he extended his contract by one year in may until the end of the 2006/07 season , his 15th campaign in the number 7 jersey with the munich club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scholl has been a prolific scorer from his midfield berth the 36-year-old has played in the bundesliga since 1990 , making 384 league appearances for bayern and 58 for his hometown club , karlsruhe , scoring a total of 97 goals .
he has also won 36 caps playing for germany . but 17 years at the top have taken their toll on scholl , who was an idol for fans in his youth , lauded for his technical ability , his creative playmaking , his dribbling skills and his free-kicks , and has battled throughout his career with countless muscle and ligament injuries . scholl 's latest setback came only last wednesday when he sustained a muscle fiber injury in training , meaning he wo n't be fit to play until next year . injuries restrict scholl to bit-part role in final season coach felix magath has said he intends to only use scholl as a substitute between now and the end of the season but fans can say goodbye to the player in the franz beckenbauer cup tournament against current european champions barca next august . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayern no.7 has scored many vital goals in his career since his move from karlsruhe to bayern in 1992 , scholl has achieved everything that can be achieved in german club football . apart from his eight league medals , scholl also helped bayern to five german cups as well as the 1996 uefa cup and 2001 champions league titles . in early 2001 , he was voted player of the year 2000 by the professional players of the first and second bundesliga , and in may 2005 , fans voted him one of the eleven greatest bayern players of all time an international career of disappointments scholl 's only disappointment comes from his time with the german national team .
ill-timed injuries meant he never made an appearance at a world cup and he made just three appearances at euro 1996 in england , when he was substituted each time . he played in the quarter-final , semi-final , and final .
he has the curious distinction of being the player who , in the 69th minute of the final when the czech republic were leading 1-0 , was subbed out for the then relatively unknown oliver bierhoff who went on to score the two goals that turned the match around for germany , catapulting bierhoff to national and international fame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scholl 's international career has been more down than up scholl also played in all three of germany 's games at euro 2000 , scoring germany 's only goal in the tournament . he won his last international cap in february 2002 when germany beat israel 7-1 in kaiserslautern . before the 2006 world cup campaign , more than 100,000 people signed an online petition - " mehmet für deutschland " - for his inclusion in jürgen klinsmann 's squad for the tournament on home soil .
however , he was overlooked by his former international and club colleague . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de national soccer team redefines what it means to be german as nearly one-quarter of the german soccer team have foreign roots , cheering for the home boys means coming to terms with a germany that has become increasingly diverse ethnically .

he has the curious distinction of being the player who , in the 69th minute of the final when the czech republic were leading 1-0 , was subbed out for the then relatively unknown oliver bierhoff who went on to score the two goals that turned the match around for germany , catapulting bierhoff to national and international fame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scholl 's international career has been more down than up scholl also played in all three of germany 's games at euro 2000 , scoring germany 's only goal in the tournament . he won his last international cap in february 2002 when germany beat israel 7-1 in kaiserslautern . before the 2006 world cup campaign , more than 100,000 people signed an online petition - " mehmet für deutschland " - for his inclusion in jürgen klinsmann 's squad for the tournament on home soil .

" it is that i brought -lrb- traces of -rrb- it back from london , where i met alexander litvinenko on oct .

" " the traces stay a very long time and when you then travel around the world , it leaves traces all along the way , " he added , speaking by telephone from a clinic in moscow , where he is being treated . kovtun is one of three russians who met litvinenko at a london hotel on nov .

the meeting was widely considered a platform for revisionists who deny the holocaust and the existence of gas chambers under the nazis . a spokesman for the german foreign ministry , jens ploetner , said in berlin that nothing of scientific value would come out of the tehran conference , which ended tuesday . " the german government condemns all attempts to deny the holocaust and question israel 's right to independent statehood , " he said .

the meeting was widely considered a platform for revisionists who deny the holocaust and the existence of gas chambers under the nazis . a spokesman for the german foreign ministry , jens ploetner , said in berlin that nothing of scientific value would come out of the tehran conference , which ended tuesday . " the german government condemns all attempts to deny the holocaust and question israel 's right to independent statehood , " he said .
" for us , living in the country where the mass murder of jews was planned and carried out , we feel a special responsibility to commemorate the victims of nazi terror .
it 's in this context that we condemn any attempt to provide a forum for revisionists who are out to rewrite history in an unacceptable manner . "
iran 's leadership has defended the decision to hold the conference , styling it as a scientific forum that would seek answers to unresolved issues around the holocaust .
it turned out to be a gathering of revisionists whose main claim to fame has been the doubts they 've frequently expressed about whether the mass murder of six million jews took place at all . bundestag president norbert lammert was among the strongest critics of the conference .
in a letter to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , he said he condemned any attempt to promote anti-semitic feelings under the guise of scientific freedom and objectivity .
the secretary general of germany 's social democratic party , hubertus heil , said that anyone who denies the holocaust is the enemy of modern day germany .

" you only have to look at how serious current attempts are by iran and others to deny israel 's right to statehood and wipe it off the map completely , " weisskirchen said .
" you just have to consider the mood in syria and among hezbollah fighters to realize how real the threat is .
for us germans , there can be no other option than to stand firmly at the side of israel and defend it against any sort of military threat or anti-semitic propaganda . " germany 's largest-selling newspaper , bild , wrote on tuesday that awareness of the killing of six million european jews united the civilized world and made it unbearable that iran 's president put on the " so-called holocaust conference . " it is a forum for the vilest haters of jews on earth , " the paper wrote .
" one must be deeply ashamed that six germans also made it to this disgusting event .
and the iranian leadership shows its real face . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's national holocaust memorial in berlin german historian rene wildnagel said the holocaust conference served the purpose of strengthening a decades-old line of argument in many arab nations . " the holocaust issue is always debated in the arab world in line with one political pattern , " wildnagel said .
" the iranian president 's holocaust denial is just one example of this .
even those who accept that the holocaust did take place would immediately ask why the arabs should suffer from something that happened in europe and emanated from germany .
ahmadinejad himself once suggested that justice would be done by creating a jewish state on german territory . " on monday , germany hosted a separate international conference on holocaust studies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 13.12.2006 munich idol mehmet scholl to retire at the end of the season großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scholl taking a shower during munich 's title celebrations at the end of last season after winning everything possible in the german game and much of what europe has to offer as well , bayern munich midfielder mehmet scholl has decided to call it a day at the end of this season . bayern munich 's veteran midfielder mehmet scholl will retire from soccer at the end of the season but will remain at the club in a non-playing capacity , club manager uli hoeness said this week . " mehmet will call it a day at the end of the season , " hoeness told the bild newspaper tuesday , adding that scholl - the only professional footballer to win eight bundesliga titles - would be remaining with the club to work with the defending champions ' youth team . " he might even do this at board level , " hoeness said . " bayern are losing a much loved player , " said hoeness of the club 's longest-serving player .
scholl 's last match for the german champions will be a friendly against barcelona in august 2007 .
he extended his contract by one year in may until the end of the 2006/07 season , his 15th campaign in the number 7 jersey with the munich club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scholl has been a prolific scorer from his midfield berth the 36-year-old has played in the bundesliga since 1990 , making 384 league appearances for bayern and 58 for his hometown club , karlsruhe , scoring a total of 97 goals .
he has also won 36 caps playing for germany . but 17 years at the top have taken their toll on scholl , who was an idol for fans in his youth , lauded for his technical ability , his creative playmaking , his dribbling skills and his free-kicks , and has battled throughout his career with countless muscle and ligament injuries . scholl 's latest setback came only last wednesday when he sustained a muscle fiber injury in training , meaning he wo n't be fit to play until next year . injuries restrict scholl to bit-part role in final season coach felix magath has said he intends to only use scholl as a substitute between now and the end of the season but fans can say goodbye to the player in the franz beckenbauer cup tournament against current european champions barca next august . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayern no.7 has scored many vital goals in his career since his move from karlsruhe to bayern in 1992 , scholl has achieved everything that can be achieved in german club football . apart from his eight league medals , scholl also helped bayern to five german cups as well as the 1996 uefa cup and 2001 champions league titles . in early 2001 , he was voted player of the year 2000 by the professional players of the first and second bundesliga , and in may 2005 , fans voted him one of the eleven greatest bayern players of all time an international career of disappointments scholl 's only disappointment comes from his time with the german national team .

" mehmet will call it a day at the end of the season , " hoeness told the bild newspaper tuesday , adding that scholl - the only professional footballer to win eight bundesliga titles - would be remaining with the club to work with the defending champions ' youth team . " he might even do this at board level , " hoeness said . " bayern are losing a much loved player , " said hoeness of the club 's longest-serving player .
scholl 's last match for the german champions will be a friendly against barcelona in august 2007 .
he extended his contract by one year in may until the end of the 2006/07 season , his 15th campaign in the number 7 jersey with the munich club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scholl has been a prolific scorer from his midfield berth the 36-year-old has played in the bundesliga since 1990 , making 384 league appearances for bayern and 58 for his hometown club , karlsruhe , scoring a total of 97 goals .
he has also won 36 caps playing for germany . but 17 years at the top have taken their toll on scholl , who was an idol for fans in his youth , lauded for his technical ability , his creative playmaking , his dribbling skills and his free-kicks , and has battled throughout his career with countless muscle and ligament injuries . scholl 's latest setback came only last wednesday when he sustained a muscle fiber injury in training , meaning he wo n't be fit to play until next year . injuries restrict scholl to bit-part role in final season coach felix magath has said he intends to only use scholl as a substitute between now and the end of the season but fans can say goodbye to the player in the franz beckenbauer cup tournament against current european champions barca next august . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayern no.7 has scored many vital goals in his career since his move from karlsruhe to bayern in 1992 , scholl has achieved everything that can be achieved in german club football . apart from his eight league medals , scholl also helped bayern to five german cups as well as the 1996 uefa cup and 2001 champions league titles . in early 2001 , he was voted player of the year 2000 by the professional players of the first and second bundesliga , and in may 2005 , fans voted him one of the eleven greatest bayern players of all time an international career of disappointments scholl 's only disappointment comes from his time with the german national team .
ill-timed injuries meant he never made an appearance at a world cup and he made just three appearances at euro 1996 in england , when he was substituted each time . he played in the quarter-final , semi-final , and final .
he has the curious distinction of being the player who , in the 69th minute of the final when the czech republic were leading 1-0 , was subbed out for the then relatively unknown oliver bierhoff who went on to score the two goals that turned the match around for germany , catapulting bierhoff to national and international fame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scholl 's international career has been more down than up scholl also played in all three of germany 's games at euro 2000 , scoring germany 's only goal in the tournament . he won his last international cap in february 2002 when germany beat israel 7-1 in kaiserslautern . before the 2006 world cup campaign , more than 100,000 people signed an online petition - " mehmet für deutschland " - for his inclusion in jürgen klinsmann 's squad for the tournament on home soil .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.12.2006 car highway tolls remain taboo in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only commercial trucks currently need to pay to drive on germany 's highway network a debate surrounding tolls on german highways has broken out again , and while bavarian politicians continue pushing for an autobahn vignette , the federal government says it 's out of the question . as the german state that suffers most from " gas tank tourism " - the practice of filling up in neighboring countries where a liter of gasoline can cost up to 20 euro cents less -lrb- about $ 1 per gallon -rrb- - appeals for a german automobile toll often comes out of bavaria . markus söder , general secretary of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , raised the southern german state 's second call this year for drivers to buy a 100-euro window sticker before pulling up to the on-ramp . " it 's not normal that foreign motorists pay nothing for the use of our roads , " söder told the mass-market bild am sonntag newspaper .
" elsewhere in europe , they always have to pay . " the vignette sticker model , which seven countries including austria , the czech republic and switzerland also use , would be accompanied by lowering germany 's petroleum and motor vehicle taxes as a way of charging foreign cars for using german roads and discouraging gas tank tourism by lowering fuel prices in germany . mercedes and bmw outnumber fiat and renault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven european countries use a vignette toll system but only a dramatic , and unlikely , cut in the fuel tax would compensate drivers for a 100-euro windshield sticker , according to andreas hölzel a spokesman for the adac , germany 's largest automobile club . " we are not aware of a case where the tax was so drastically cut that gas tank tourism would be affected , " hölzel said , adding that of all the cars on german highways , only 5 percent have foreign license plates , making the costs of maintaining a vignette system higher than the revenue it would bring in . while a windshield sticker is the most commonly debated model in germany , 10 european countries , including france , italy , spain and poland , charge drivers based on the distance they travel instead of an annual fee , which makes considerably more sense , according to hartmut topp of the institute for mobility and traffic at the technical university of kaiserslautern . " a vignette is a crazy idea that encourages people to drive more in order to lower the cost per kilometer , " he said .
" what makes sense is a distance-based toll system . " truck tolls difficult to expand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the truck toll system started in 2005 , about a year later than planned while a similar system that was setup for heavy commercial trucks using the autobahn was plagued with delays and lost revenue when it launched in 2005 , it is now running well , topp said . but enlarging the satellite system that keeps track of about 1 million trucks on highways to encompass germany 's 44 million registered automobiles on all streets is unrealistic and does n't make sense when the state already has the money it needs for road projects , according hölzel . of the 53 billion euros collected from fuel and motor vehicle tax receipts as well as revenue from the truck toll system , about 17 billion are spent on germany 's road network , he said , calling on the government to invest money car owners pay in taxes into street projects . while no studies have been conducted to estimate the cost of creating a car toll system , the toll collect consortium received seven billion euros from german government to create the truck 's toll system .
of the 3.1 billion euros in levies toll collect delivered to the government in 2006 , it received 600 million euros -lrb- from berlin -rrb- to keep the network running . safer in the fast lane bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tolls are rare in germany but do exist on some tunnels even if the truck system could be expanded to include cars , a feat toll collect officials said may be possible but would require large additional investments , any kind of toll placed exclusively on highways could also lead to heavier traffic on smaller , local roads that tend to have more serious accidents than the highway , hölzel said . according to the adac estimates , increased traffic on smaller roads could lead to 570 more traffic deaths and 17,000 additional injuries if 20 percent of cars left the highway to get around tolls . keeping drivers from moving to toll-free streets is why any automobile toll would have to include all roads , not just highways , topp said , adding that he , contrary to hölzel , expects such technology to exist within the next five years . " at times and in places where there is an especially high demand you can charge an especially high toll , and when there are fewer drivers it can be cheaper , " he said . toll debate unlikely to disappear regardless of how many people they share the road with , german drivers , for the time being , wo n't have to worry about reaching into their wallets right away .
federal transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee has ruled out any system of car tolls , saying that none of the newest suggestions he 's heard was better than those regularly made in the past . " bad arguments do not get better when they are regularly repeated , " tiefensee , a social democrat , told reporters . despite a lack of unity on implementing a fee system in berlin , bavarian politicians have said they will consider possible automobile toll options for germany , nearly guaranteeing that the debate will come up again in 2007 . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls go out for passenger car toll on the autobahn the interior minister of bavaria , günther beckstein , has called for a toll system to be instituted on passenger cars traveling germany 's freeway system to stop " gas station tourism . " -lrb- 25.07.2006 -rrb- in the fast lane to controversy the autobahn is a german icon , right up there with beer and oktoberfest .
so a controversial proposal to sell off the country 's renowned highway system has , expectedly , kicked up a storm of protest .

" it 's not normal that foreign motorists pay nothing for the use of our roads , " söder told the mass-market bild am sonntag newspaper .
" elsewhere in europe , they always have to pay . " the vignette sticker model , which seven countries including austria , the czech republic and switzerland also use , would be accompanied by lowering germany 's petroleum and motor vehicle taxes as a way of charging foreign cars for using german roads and discouraging gas tank tourism by lowering fuel prices in germany . mercedes and bmw outnumber fiat and renault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven european countries use a vignette toll system but only a dramatic , and unlikely , cut in the fuel tax would compensate drivers for a 100-euro windshield sticker , according to andreas hölzel a spokesman for the adac , germany 's largest automobile club . " we are not aware of a case where the tax was so drastically cut that gas tank tourism would be affected , " hölzel said , adding that of all the cars on german highways , only 5 percent have foreign license plates , making the costs of maintaining a vignette system higher than the revenue it would bring in . while a windshield sticker is the most commonly debated model in germany , 10 european countries , including france , italy , spain and poland , charge drivers based on the distance they travel instead of an annual fee , which makes considerably more sense , according to hartmut topp of the institute for mobility and traffic at the technical university of kaiserslautern . " a vignette is a crazy idea that encourages people to drive more in order to lower the cost per kilometer , " he said .
" what makes sense is a distance-based toll system . " truck tolls difficult to expand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the truck toll system started in 2005 , about a year later than planned while a similar system that was setup for heavy commercial trucks using the autobahn was plagued with delays and lost revenue when it launched in 2005 , it is now running well , topp said . but enlarging the satellite system that keeps track of about 1 million trucks on highways to encompass germany 's 44 million registered automobiles on all streets is unrealistic and does n't make sense when the state already has the money it needs for road projects , according hölzel . of the 53 billion euros collected from fuel and motor vehicle tax receipts as well as revenue from the truck toll system , about 17 billion are spent on germany 's road network , he said , calling on the government to invest money car owners pay in taxes into street projects . while no studies have been conducted to estimate the cost of creating a car toll system , the toll collect consortium received seven billion euros from german government to create the truck 's toll system .
of the 3.1 billion euros in levies toll collect delivered to the government in 2006 , it received 600 million euros -lrb- from berlin -rrb- to keep the network running . safer in the fast lane bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tolls are rare in germany but do exist on some tunnels even if the truck system could be expanded to include cars , a feat toll collect officials said may be possible but would require large additional investments , any kind of toll placed exclusively on highways could also lead to heavier traffic on smaller , local roads that tend to have more serious accidents than the highway , hölzel said . according to the adac estimates , increased traffic on smaller roads could lead to 570 more traffic deaths and 17,000 additional injuries if 20 percent of cars left the highway to get around tolls . keeping drivers from moving to toll-free streets is why any automobile toll would have to include all roads , not just highways , topp said , adding that he , contrary to hölzel , expects such technology to exist within the next five years . " at times and in places where there is an especially high demand you can charge an especially high toll , and when there are fewer drivers it can be cheaper , " he said . toll debate unlikely to disappear regardless of how many people they share the road with , german drivers , for the time being , wo n't have to worry about reaching into their wallets right away .
federal transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee has ruled out any system of car tolls , saying that none of the newest suggestions he 's heard was better than those regularly made in the past . " bad arguments do not get better when they are regularly repeated , " tiefensee , a social democrat , told reporters . despite a lack of unity on implementing a fee system in berlin , bavarian politicians have said they will consider possible automobile toll options for germany , nearly guaranteeing that the debate will come up again in 2007 . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls go out for passenger car toll on the autobahn the interior minister of bavaria , günther beckstein , has called for a toll system to be instituted on passenger cars traveling germany 's freeway system to stop " gas station tourism .

after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies . in the first systematic cross-country study of ski areas in the alpine region , the organization for economic cooperation and development , or oecd , found that recent warming in the region , which is particularly sensitive to climate change , has been roughly three times the global average . of the countries studied , germany is most at risk , the report by the paris-based group said .
an increase in temperature by one degree could lead to a 60 percent decrease in the number of naturally snow-reliable ski areas in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the skilift was empty at the bavarian ski resort of sudelfeld earlier this month austria - where half the tourism income is from winter tourism - is slightly above average , followed by italy , france and switzerland , which would suffer the least . " the years 1994 , 2000 , 2002 , and 2003 were the warmest on record in the alps in the last 500 years , " the report found , adding that climate projections show even greater changes in the coming decades . at the moment , 90 percent of large alpine ski areas normally have adequate snow cover for at least 100 days per year , the report said , but future climate change could mean a drop in the number of snow-reliable ski areas . ski operators are already adapting to rising snow lines and shorter winter seasons , mostly with technology rather than changing behavioral patterns . artificial snow environmentally damaging artificial snow is popular and cost effective for ski operators but consumes a lot of water and energy and can harm the landscape and ecology . making artificial snow will become more expensive as temperatures rise , and it will no longer be possible if the air becomes too warm , the report said . alpine tourism plays a key role in the economies of alpine countries , with some 60 to 80 million tourists to the region each year , and a total of 160 million days recorded annually by ski lift operators in france , austria , switzerland and germany . another ski event cancelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five world cup ski races have already been cancelled this year opec 's warning came with the news of the cancellation of the women 's slalom race in the france alpine resort town of megeve because of lack of snow . the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- has so far failed to name a replacement venue for the event , which was scheduled for dec .
20 . megeve is the fifth cancellation of the alpine winter skiing season because of the unseasonably warm weather . women 's races in st. moritz in switzerland , men 's and women 's in val d 'isere in france , as well as the traditional season-opener in sölden in austria at the end of october were all called off . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de less snow and drier summers in german forecast new weather models predict arid summers and less time for winter sports in germany if climate changed is n't turned around , according to a study released this week by the max-planck institute for meteorology .

after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies . in the first systematic cross-country study of ski areas in the alpine region , the organization for economic cooperation and development , or oecd , found that recent warming in the region , which is particularly sensitive to climate change , has been roughly three times the global average . of the countries studied , germany is most at risk , the report by the paris-based group said .
an increase in temperature by one degree could lead to a 60 percent decrease in the number of naturally snow-reliable ski areas in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the skilift was empty at the bavarian ski resort of sudelfeld earlier this month austria - where half the tourism income is from winter tourism - is slightly above average , followed by italy , france and switzerland , which would suffer the least . " the years 1994 , 2000 , 2002 , and 2003 were the warmest on record in the alps in the last 500 years , " the report found , adding that climate projections show even greater changes in the coming decades . at the moment , 90 percent of large alpine ski areas normally have adequate snow cover for at least 100 days per year , the report said , but future climate change could mean a drop in the number of snow-reliable ski areas . ski operators are already adapting to rising snow lines and shorter winter seasons , mostly with technology rather than changing behavioral patterns . artificial snow environmentally damaging artificial snow is popular and cost effective for ski operators but consumes a lot of water and energy and can harm the landscape and ecology . making artificial snow will become more expensive as temperatures rise , and it will no longer be possible if the air becomes too warm , the report said . alpine tourism plays a key role in the economies of alpine countries , with some 60 to 80 million tourists to the region each year , and a total of 160 million days recorded annually by ski lift operators in france , austria , switzerland and germany . another ski event cancelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five world cup ski races have already been cancelled this year opec 's warning came with the news of the cancellation of the women 's slalom race in the france alpine resort town of megeve because of lack of snow . the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- has so far failed to name a replacement venue for the event , which was scheduled for dec .
20 . megeve is the fifth cancellation of the alpine winter skiing season because of the unseasonably warm weather . women 's races in st. moritz in switzerland , men 's and women 's in val d 'isere in france , as well as the traditional season-opener in sölden in austria at the end of october were all called off . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de less snow and drier summers in german forecast new weather models predict arid summers and less time for winter sports in germany if climate changed is n't turned around , according to a study released this week by the max-planck institute for meteorology .

after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies . in the first systematic cross-country study of ski areas in the alpine region , the organization for economic cooperation and development , or oecd , found that recent warming in the region , which is particularly sensitive to climate change , has been roughly three times the global average . of the countries studied , germany is most at risk , the report by the paris-based group said .
an increase in temperature by one degree could lead to a 60 percent decrease in the number of naturally snow-reliable ski areas in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the skilift was empty at the bavarian ski resort of sudelfeld earlier this month austria - where half the tourism income is from winter tourism - is slightly above average , followed by italy , france and switzerland , which would suffer the least . " the years 1994 , 2000 , 2002 , and 2003 were the warmest on record in the alps in the last 500 years , " the report found , adding that climate projections show even greater changes in the coming decades . at the moment , 90 percent of large alpine ski areas normally have adequate snow cover for at least 100 days per year , the report said , but future climate change could mean a drop in the number of snow-reliable ski areas . ski operators are already adapting to rising snow lines and shorter winter seasons , mostly with technology rather than changing behavioral patterns . artificial snow environmentally damaging artificial snow is popular and cost effective for ski operators but consumes a lot of water and energy and can harm the landscape and ecology . making artificial snow will become more expensive as temperatures rise , and it will no longer be possible if the air becomes too warm , the report said . alpine tourism plays a key role in the economies of alpine countries , with some 60 to 80 million tourists to the region each year , and a total of 160 million days recorded annually by ski lift operators in france , austria , switzerland and germany . another ski event cancelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five world cup ski races have already been cancelled this year opec 's warning came with the news of the cancellation of the women 's slalom race in the france alpine resort town of megeve because of lack of snow . the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- has so far failed to name a replacement venue for the event , which was scheduled for dec .
20 . megeve is the fifth cancellation of the alpine winter skiing season because of the unseasonably warm weather . women 's races in st. moritz in switzerland , men 's and women 's in val d 'isere in france , as well as the traditional season-opener in sölden in austria at the end of october were all called off . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de less snow and drier summers in german forecast new weather models predict arid summers and less time for winter sports in germany if climate changed is n't turned around , according to a study released this week by the max-planck institute for meteorology .
-lrb- 30.04.2006 -rrb- minister presses climate change action in wake of dire report on the heels of a major study that says world leaders must act urgently to avert a looming environmental catastrophe , germany 's environment minister has called on the country to invest heavily in green technology .

" mehmet will call it a day at the end of the season , " hoeness told the bild newspaper tuesday , adding that scholl - the only professional footballer to win eight bundesliga titles - would be remaining with the club to work with the defending champions ' youth team . " he might even do this at board level , " hoeness said . " bayern are losing a much loved player , " said hoeness of the club 's longest-serving player .
scholl 's last match for the german champions will be a friendly against barcelona in august 2007 .
he extended his contract by one year in may until the end of the 2006/07 season , his 15th campaign in the number 7 jersey with the munich club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scholl has been a prolific scorer from his midfield berth the 36-year-old has played in the bundesliga since 1990 , making 384 league appearances for bayern and 58 for his hometown club , karlsruhe , scoring a total of 97 goals .
he has also won 36 caps playing for germany . but 17 years at the top have taken their toll on scholl , who was an idol for fans in his youth , lauded for his technical ability , his creative playmaking , his dribbling skills and his free-kicks , and has battled throughout his career with countless muscle and ligament injuries . scholl 's latest setback came only last wednesday when he sustained a muscle fiber injury in training , meaning he wo n't be fit to play until next year . injuries restrict scholl to bit-part role in final season coach felix magath has said he intends to only use scholl as a substitute between now and the end of the season but fans can say goodbye to the player in the franz beckenbauer cup tournament against current european champions barca next august . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayern no.7 has scored many vital goals in his career since his move from karlsruhe to bayern in 1992 , scholl has achieved everything that can be achieved in german club football . apart from his eight league medals , scholl also helped bayern to five german cups as well as the 1996 uefa cup and 2001 champions league titles . in early 2001 , he was voted player of the year 2000 by the professional players of the first and second bundesliga , and in may 2005 , fans voted him one of the eleven greatest bayern players of all time an international career of disappointments scholl 's only disappointment comes from his time with the german national team .
ill-timed injuries meant he never made an appearance at a world cup and he made just three appearances at euro 1996 in england , when he was substituted each time . he played in the quarter-final , semi-final , and final .
he has the curious distinction of being the player who , in the 69th minute of the final when the czech republic were leading 1-0 , was subbed out for the then relatively unknown oliver bierhoff who went on to score the two goals that turned the match around for germany , catapulting bierhoff to national and international fame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scholl 's international career has been more down than up scholl also played in all three of germany 's games at euro 2000 , scoring germany 's only goal in the tournament . he won his last international cap in february 2002 when germany beat israel 7-1 in kaiserslautern . before the 2006 world cup campaign , more than 100,000 people signed an online petition - " mehmet für deutschland " - for his inclusion in jürgen klinsmann 's squad for the tournament on home soil .

" mehmet will call it a day at the end of the season , " hoeness told the bild newspaper tuesday , adding that scholl - the only professional footballer to win eight bundesliga titles - would be remaining with the club to work with the defending champions ' youth team . " he might even do this at board level , " hoeness said . " bayern are losing a much loved player , " said hoeness of the club 's longest-serving player .
scholl 's last match for the german champions will be a friendly against barcelona in august 2007 .
he extended his contract by one year in may until the end of the 2006/07 season , his 15th campaign in the number 7 jersey with the munich club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scholl has been a prolific scorer from his midfield berth the 36-year-old has played in the bundesliga since 1990 , making 384 league appearances for bayern and 58 for his hometown club , karlsruhe , scoring a total of 97 goals .
he has also won 36 caps playing for germany . but 17 years at the top have taken their toll on scholl , who was an idol for fans in his youth , lauded for his technical ability , his creative playmaking , his dribbling skills and his free-kicks , and has battled throughout his career with countless muscle and ligament injuries . scholl 's latest setback came only last wednesday when he sustained a muscle fiber injury in training , meaning he wo n't be fit to play until next year . injuries restrict scholl to bit-part role in final season coach felix magath has said he intends to only use scholl as a substitute between now and the end of the season but fans can say goodbye to the player in the franz beckenbauer cup tournament against current european champions barca next august . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayern no.7 has scored many vital goals in his career since his move from karlsruhe to bayern in 1992 , scholl has achieved everything that can be achieved in german club football . apart from his eight league medals , scholl also helped bayern to five german cups as well as the 1996 uefa cup and 2001 champions league titles . in early 2001 , he was voted player of the year 2000 by the professional players of the first and second bundesliga , and in may 2005 , fans voted him one of the eleven greatest bayern players of all time an international career of disappointments scholl 's only disappointment comes from his time with the german national team .
ill-timed injuries meant he never made an appearance at a world cup and he made just three appearances at euro 1996 in england , when he was substituted each time . he played in the quarter-final , semi-final , and final .
he has the curious distinction of being the player who , in the 69th minute of the final when the czech republic were leading 1-0 , was subbed out for the then relatively unknown oliver bierhoff who went on to score the two goals that turned the match around for germany , catapulting bierhoff to national and international fame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scholl 's international career has been more down than up scholl also played in all three of germany 's games at euro 2000 , scoring germany 's only goal in the tournament . he won his last international cap in february 2002 when germany beat israel 7-1 in kaiserslautern . before the 2006 world cup campaign , more than 100,000 people signed an online petition - " mehmet für deutschland " - for his inclusion in jürgen klinsmann 's squad for the tournament on home soil .
however , he was overlooked by his former international and club colleague . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de national soccer team redefines what it means to be german as nearly one-quarter of the german soccer team have foreign roots , cheering for the home boys means coming to terms with a germany that has become increasingly diverse ethnically .

" it 's not normal that foreign motorists pay nothing for the use of our roads , " söder told the mass-market bild am sonntag newspaper .
" elsewhere in europe , they always have to pay . " the vignette sticker model , which seven countries including austria , the czech republic and switzerland also use , would be accompanied by lowering germany 's petroleum and motor vehicle taxes as a way of charging foreign cars for using german roads and discouraging gas tank tourism by lowering fuel prices in germany . mercedes and bmw outnumber fiat and renault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven european countries use a vignette toll system but only a dramatic , and unlikely , cut in the fuel tax would compensate drivers for a 100-euro windshield sticker , according to andreas hölzel a spokesman for the adac , germany 's largest automobile club . " we are not aware of a case where the tax was so drastically cut that gas tank tourism would be affected , " hölzel said , adding that of all the cars on german highways , only 5 percent have foreign license plates , making the costs of maintaining a vignette system higher than the revenue it would bring in . while a windshield sticker is the most commonly debated model in germany , 10 european countries , including france , italy , spain and poland , charge drivers based on the distance they travel instead of an annual fee , which makes considerably more sense , according to hartmut topp of the institute for mobility and traffic at the technical university of kaiserslautern . " a vignette is a crazy idea that encourages people to drive more in order to lower the cost per kilometer , " he said .
" what makes sense is a distance-based toll system . " truck tolls difficult to expand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the truck toll system started in 2005 , about a year later than planned while a similar system that was setup for heavy commercial trucks using the autobahn was plagued with delays and lost revenue when it launched in 2005 , it is now running well , topp said . but enlarging the satellite system that keeps track of about 1 million trucks on highways to encompass germany 's 44 million registered automobiles on all streets is unrealistic and does n't make sense when the state already has the money it needs for road projects , according hölzel . of the 53 billion euros collected from fuel and motor vehicle tax receipts as well as revenue from the truck toll system , about 17 billion are spent on germany 's road network , he said , calling on the government to invest money car owners pay in taxes into street projects . while no studies have been conducted to estimate the cost of creating a car toll system , the toll collect consortium received seven billion euros from german government to create the truck 's toll system .
of the 3.1 billion euros in levies toll collect delivered to the government in 2006 , it received 600 million euros -lrb- from berlin -rrb- to keep the network running . safer in the fast lane bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tolls are rare in germany but do exist on some tunnels even if the truck system could be expanded to include cars , a feat toll collect officials said may be possible but would require large additional investments , any kind of toll placed exclusively on highways could also lead to heavier traffic on smaller , local roads that tend to have more serious accidents than the highway , hölzel said . according to the adac estimates , increased traffic on smaller roads could lead to 570 more traffic deaths and 17,000 additional injuries if 20 percent of cars left the highway to get around tolls . keeping drivers from moving to toll-free streets is why any automobile toll would have to include all roads , not just highways , topp said , adding that he , contrary to hölzel , expects such technology to exist within the next five years . " at times and in places where there is an especially high demand you can charge an especially high toll , and when there are fewer drivers it can be cheaper , " he said . toll debate unlikely to disappear regardless of how many people they share the road with , german drivers , for the time being , wo n't have to worry about reaching into their wallets right away .
federal transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee has ruled out any system of car tolls , saying that none of the newest suggestions he 's heard was better than those regularly made in the past . " bad arguments do not get better when they are regularly repeated , " tiefensee , a social democrat , told reporters . despite a lack of unity on implementing a fee system in berlin , bavarian politicians have said they will consider possible automobile toll options for germany , nearly guaranteeing that the debate will come up again in 2007 . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls go out for passenger car toll on the autobahn the interior minister of bavaria , günther beckstein , has called for a toll system to be instituted on passenger cars traveling germany 's freeway system to stop " gas station tourism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 13.12.2006 organ donation still a taboo topic in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , 3,500 organs were transplanted in germany the taboos surrounding organ donation in germany continue to cost hundreds of people their lives each year .
could an opt-out system provide the answer ? twelve thousand people in germany are currently on the waiting list for a kidney , liver or heart transplant . tragically , many of them will die before the life-giving operation can ever take place .
this organ shortage exists even though , according to official surveys , some eighty percent of germans say , in principle , they would be prepared to become organ donors .
in reality , just a fraction of them possess organ donor cards . last year , some 3,500 organs were transplanted , but more than twice as many people joined the waiting list .
burkhardt topp from the transplant association says germans are put off from helping others by a number of factors . " i think that everything that is connected with death and dying is a taboo in germany , " he said .
" and organ donation is obviously linked to that .
if you think about this issue then you are also forced to think about your own possible death . " scare stories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an organ transplant in jena , germany topp says that people are also worried by scare stories in the media about organ smuggling and organ theft . " the theme of organ donation is made more difficult by everything that is somehow associated with the medical sphere and is not 100 percent upright , " he said . this insecurity has also been promoted by the long discussions here over what how to determine the time of death .
critics of organ donation argued that brain death was difficult to ascertain and that heart failure was the only reliable indicator .
lawmakers decided that transplantation could take place after brain death had been certified , but only if the patients were carriers of organ donor cards .
and that only goes for some 12 percent of the german population . in the majority of cases it is grieving relatives who are left to decide .
many have no idea what their loved ones would have wanted . " the difficulty is that the topic is not talked about enough in the family , " says topp .
" in eighty percent of the cases the family has to make up their minds about the question of organ donation .
of course , that leads to a very high rejection rate . " opt-out system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dialysis machine is the only option for many waiting for a kidney transplant in europe , germany ranks in fifth place when it comes to the number of organ donors - with 15 for every one million inhabitants per year .
in the case of the top three , spain , belgium and austria , the laws relating to donation are very different .
there you have to opt out rather than opt in of the donor scheme .
everyone is a potential donor unless they lodge an objection in writing . professor christoph brölsch from the university clinic in essen thinks this solution is the only way of tackling the organ shortage problem here in germany . " i have been working on this problem for thirty years , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 13.12.2006 organ donation still a taboo topic in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , 3,500 organs were transplanted in germany the taboos surrounding organ donation in germany continue to cost hundreds of people their lives each year .
could an opt-out system provide the answer ? twelve thousand people in germany are currently on the waiting list for a kidney , liver or heart transplant . tragically , many of them will die before the life-giving operation can ever take place .
this organ shortage exists even though , according to official surveys , some eighty percent of germans say , in principle , they would be prepared to become organ donors .
in reality , just a fraction of them possess organ donor cards . last year , some 3,500 organs were transplanted , but more than twice as many people joined the waiting list .
burkhardt topp from the transplant association says germans are put off from helping others by a number of factors . " i think that everything that is connected with death and dying is a taboo in germany , " he said .
" and organ donation is obviously linked to that .
if you think about this issue then you are also forced to think about your own possible death . " scare stories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an organ transplant in jena , germany topp says that people are also worried by scare stories in the media about organ smuggling and organ theft . " the theme of organ donation is made more difficult by everything that is somehow associated with the medical sphere and is not 100 percent upright , " he said . this insecurity has also been promoted by the long discussions here over what how to determine the time of death .
critics of organ donation argued that brain death was difficult to ascertain and that heart failure was the only reliable indicator .
lawmakers decided that transplantation could take place after brain death had been certified , but only if the patients were carriers of organ donor cards .
and that only goes for some 12 percent of the german population . in the majority of cases it is grieving relatives who are left to decide .
many have no idea what their loved ones would have wanted . " the difficulty is that the topic is not talked about enough in the family , " says topp .
" in eighty percent of the cases the family has to make up their minds about the question of organ donation .
of course , that leads to a very high rejection rate . " opt-out system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dialysis machine is the only option for many waiting for a kidney transplant in europe , germany ranks in fifth place when it comes to the number of organ donors - with 15 for every one million inhabitants per year .
in the case of the top three , spain , belgium and austria , the laws relating to donation are very different .
there you have to opt out rather than opt in of the donor scheme .
everyone is a potential donor unless they lodge an objection in writing . professor christoph brölsch from the university clinic in essen thinks this solution is the only way of tackling the organ shortage problem here in germany . " i have been working on this problem for thirty years , " he said .
" i 'll readily admit that i am extremely frustrated by the fact that we need to keep on persuading people of the necessity and the propriety of organ donation . " it is a situation that leads to a harrowing race with death .

the meeting was widely considered a platform for revisionists who deny the holocaust and the existence of gas chambers under the nazis . a spokesman for the german foreign ministry , jens ploetner , said in berlin that nothing of scientific value would come out of the tehran conference , which ended tuesday . " the german government condemns all attempts to deny the holocaust and question israel 's right to independent statehood , " he said .
" for us , living in the country where the mass murder of jews was planned and carried out , we feel a special responsibility to commemorate the victims of nazi terror .
it 's in this context that we condemn any attempt to provide a forum for revisionists who are out to rewrite history in an unacceptable manner . "
iran 's leadership has defended the decision to hold the conference , styling it as a scientific forum that would seek answers to unresolved issues around the holocaust .
it turned out to be a gathering of revisionists whose main claim to fame has been the doubts they 've frequently expressed about whether the mass murder of six million jews took place at all . bundestag president norbert lammert was among the strongest critics of the conference .
in a letter to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , he said he condemned any attempt to promote anti-semitic feelings under the guise of scientific freedom and objectivity .
the secretary general of germany 's social democratic party , hubertus heil , said that anyone who denies the holocaust is the enemy of modern day germany .

" you only have to look at how serious current attempts are by iran and others to deny israel 's right to statehood and wipe it off the map completely , " weisskirchen said .
" you just have to consider the mood in syria and among hezbollah fighters to realize how real the threat is .
for us germans , there can be no other option than to stand firmly at the side of israel and defend it against any sort of military threat or anti-semitic propaganda . " germany 's largest-selling newspaper , bild , wrote on tuesday that awareness of the killing of six million european jews united the civilized world and made it unbearable that iran 's president put on the " so-called holocaust conference . " it is a forum for the vilest haters of jews on earth , " the paper wrote .
" one must be deeply ashamed that six germans also made it to this disgusting event .
and the iranian leadership shows its real face . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's national holocaust memorial in berlin german historian rene wildnagel said the holocaust conference served the purpose of strengthening a decades-old line of argument in many arab nations . " the holocaust issue is always debated in the arab world in line with one political pattern , " wildnagel said .
" the iranian president 's holocaust denial is just one example of this .
even those who accept that the holocaust did take place would immediately ask why the arabs should suffer from something that happened in europe and emanated from germany .
ahmadinejad himself once suggested that justice would be done by creating a jewish state on german territory . " on monday , germany hosted a separate international conference on holocaust studies .

after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies . in the first systematic cross-country study of ski areas in the alpine region , the organization for economic cooperation and development , or oecd , found that recent warming in the region , which is particularly sensitive to climate change , has been roughly three times the global average . of the countries studied , germany is most at risk , the report by the paris-based group said .
an increase in temperature by one degree could lead to a 60 percent decrease in the number of naturally snow-reliable ski areas in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the skilift was empty at the bavarian ski resort of sudelfeld earlier this month austria - where half the tourism income is from winter tourism - is slightly above average , followed by italy , france and switzerland , which would suffer the least . " the years 1994 , 2000 , 2002 , and 2003 were the warmest on record in the alps in the last 500 years , " the report found , adding that climate projections show even greater changes in the coming decades . at the moment , 90 percent of large alpine ski areas normally have adequate snow cover for at least 100 days per year , the report said , but future climate change could mean a drop in the number of snow-reliable ski areas . ski operators are already adapting to rising snow lines and shorter winter seasons , mostly with technology rather than changing behavioral patterns . artificial snow environmentally damaging artificial snow is popular and cost effective for ski operators but consumes a lot of water and energy and can harm the landscape and ecology . making artificial snow will become more expensive as temperatures rise , and it will no longer be possible if the air becomes too warm , the report said . alpine tourism plays a key role in the economies of alpine countries , with some 60 to 80 million tourists to the region each year , and a total of 160 million days recorded annually by ski lift operators in france , austria , switzerland and germany . another ski event cancelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five world cup ski races have already been cancelled this year opec 's warning came with the news of the cancellation of the women 's slalom race in the france alpine resort town of megeve because of lack of snow . the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- has so far failed to name a replacement venue for the event , which was scheduled for dec .
20 . megeve is the fifth cancellation of the alpine winter skiing season because of the unseasonably warm weather . women 's races in st. moritz in switzerland , men 's and women 's in val d 'isere in france , as well as the traditional season-opener in sölden in austria at the end of october were all called off . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de less snow and drier summers in german forecast new weather models predict arid summers and less time for winter sports in germany if climate changed is n't turned around , according to a study released this week by the max-planck institute for meteorology .

could an opt-out system provide the answer ? twelve thousand people in germany are currently on the waiting list for a kidney , liver or heart transplant . tragically , many of them will die before the life-giving operation can ever take place .
this organ shortage exists even though , according to official surveys , some eighty percent of germans say , in principle , they would be prepared to become organ donors .
in reality , just a fraction of them possess organ donor cards . last year , some 3,500 organs were transplanted , but more than twice as many people joined the waiting list .
burkhardt topp from the transplant association says germans are put off from helping others by a number of factors . " i think that everything that is connected with death and dying is a taboo in germany , " he said .
" and organ donation is obviously linked to that .
if you think about this issue then you are also forced to think about your own possible death . " scare stories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an organ transplant in jena , germany topp says that people are also worried by scare stories in the media about organ smuggling and organ theft . " the theme of organ donation is made more difficult by everything that is somehow associated with the medical sphere and is not 100 percent upright , " he said . this insecurity has also been promoted by the long discussions here over what how to determine the time of death .
critics of organ donation argued that brain death was difficult to ascertain and that heart failure was the only reliable indicator .
lawmakers decided that transplantation could take place after brain death had been certified , but only if the patients were carriers of organ donor cards .
and that only goes for some 12 percent of the german population . in the majority of cases it is grieving relatives who are left to decide .
many have no idea what their loved ones would have wanted . " the difficulty is that the topic is not talked about enough in the family , " says topp .
" in eighty percent of the cases the family has to make up their minds about the question of organ donation .
of course , that leads to a very high rejection rate . " opt-out system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dialysis machine is the only option for many waiting for a kidney transplant in europe , germany ranks in fifth place when it comes to the number of organ donors - with 15 for every one million inhabitants per year .

there you have to opt out rather than opt in of the donor scheme .
everyone is a potential donor unless they lodge an objection in writing . professor christoph brölsch from the university clinic in essen thinks this solution is the only way of tackling the organ shortage problem here in germany . " i have been working on this problem for thirty years , " he said .
" i 'll readily admit that i am extremely frustrated by the fact that we need to keep on persuading people of the necessity and the propriety of organ donation . " it is a situation that leads to a harrowing race with death .
in essen alone , there are 200 people waiting for a liver transplant .

after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies . in the first systematic cross-country study of ski areas in the alpine region , the organization for economic cooperation and development , or oecd , found that recent warming in the region , which is particularly sensitive to climate change , has been roughly three times the global average . of the countries studied , germany is most at risk , the report by the paris-based group said .
an increase in temperature by one degree could lead to a 60 percent decrease in the number of naturally snow-reliable ski areas in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the skilift was empty at the bavarian ski resort of sudelfeld earlier this month austria - where half the tourism income is from winter tourism - is slightly above average , followed by italy , france and switzerland , which would suffer the least . " the years 1994 , 2000 , 2002 , and 2003 were the warmest on record in the alps in the last 500 years , " the report found , adding that climate projections show even greater changes in the coming decades . at the moment , 90 percent of large alpine ski areas normally have adequate snow cover for at least 100 days per year , the report said , but future climate change could mean a drop in the number of snow-reliable ski areas . ski operators are already adapting to rising snow lines and shorter winter seasons , mostly with technology rather than changing behavioral patterns . artificial snow environmentally damaging artificial snow is popular and cost effective for ski operators but consumes a lot of water and energy and can harm the landscape and ecology . making artificial snow will become more expensive as temperatures rise , and it will no longer be possible if the air becomes too warm , the report said . alpine tourism plays a key role in the economies of alpine countries , with some 60 to 80 million tourists to the region each year , and a total of 160 million days recorded annually by ski lift operators in france , austria , switzerland and germany . another ski event cancelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five world cup ski races have already been cancelled this year opec 's warning came with the news of the cancellation of the women 's slalom race in the france alpine resort town of megeve because of lack of snow . the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- has so far failed to name a replacement venue for the event , which was scheduled for dec .
20 . megeve is the fifth cancellation of the alpine winter skiing season because of the unseasonably warm weather . women 's races in st. moritz in switzerland , men 's and women 's in val d 'isere in france , as well as the traditional season-opener in sölden in austria at the end of october were all called off . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de less snow and drier summers in german forecast new weather models predict arid summers and less time for winter sports in germany if climate changed is n't turned around , according to a study released this week by the max-planck institute for meteorology .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 13.12.2006 germany protests against tehran holocaust conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of anti-zionist rabbis attended the conference german lawmakers have protested against an iranian conference on the holocaust .
the meeting was widely considered a platform for revisionists who deny the holocaust and the existence of gas chambers under the nazis . a spokesman for the german foreign ministry , jens ploetner , said in berlin that nothing of scientific value would come out of the tehran conference , which ended tuesday . " the german government condemns all attempts to deny the holocaust and question israel 's right to independent statehood , " he said .
" for us , living in the country where the mass murder of jews was planned and carried out , we feel a special responsibility to commemorate the victims of nazi terror .
it 's in this context that we condemn any attempt to provide a forum for revisionists who are out to rewrite history in an unacceptable manner . "
iran 's leadership has defended the decision to hold the conference , styling it as a scientific forum that would seek answers to unresolved issues around the holocaust .
it turned out to be a gathering of revisionists whose main claim to fame has been the doubts they 've frequently expressed about whether the mass murder of six million jews took place at all . bundestag president norbert lammert was among the strongest critics of the conference .
in a letter to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , he said he condemned any attempt to promote anti-semitic feelings under the guise of scientific freedom and objectivity .
the secretary general of germany 's social democratic party , hubertus heil , said that anyone who denies the holocaust is the enemy of modern day germany .
anti-semitic propaganda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad -lrb- l . -rrb- shaking with anti-zionism rabbi yisroel dovid weiss gert weisskirchen , the social democrats ' foreign policy spokesman in parliament , said the conference was a direct confrontation with israel . " you only have to look at how serious current attempts are by iran and others to deny israel 's right to statehood and wipe it off the map completely , " weisskirchen said .
" you just have to consider the mood in syria and among hezbollah fighters to realize how real the threat is .
for us germans , there can be no other option than to stand firmly at the side of israel and defend it against any sort of military threat or anti-semitic propaganda . " germany 's largest-selling newspaper , bild , wrote on tuesday that awareness of the killing of six million european jews united the civilized world and made it unbearable that iran 's president put on the " so-called holocaust conference . " it is a forum for the vilest haters of jews on earth , " the paper wrote .
" one must be deeply ashamed that six germans also made it to this disgusting event .
and the iranian leadership shows its real face . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's national holocaust memorial in berlin german historian rene wildnagel said the holocaust conference served the purpose of strengthening a decades-old line of argument in many arab nations . " the holocaust issue is always debated in the arab world in line with one political pattern , " wildnagel said .
" the iranian president 's holocaust denial is just one example of this .

the meeting was widely considered a platform for revisionists who deny the holocaust and the existence of gas chambers under the nazis . a spokesman for the german foreign ministry , jens ploetner , said in berlin that nothing of scientific value would come out of the tehran conference , which ended tuesday . " the german government condemns all attempts to deny the holocaust and question israel 's right to independent statehood , " he said .
" for us , living in the country where the mass murder of jews was planned and carried out , we feel a special responsibility to commemorate the victims of nazi terror .
it 's in this context that we condemn any attempt to provide a forum for revisionists who are out to rewrite history in an unacceptable manner . "
iran 's leadership has defended the decision to hold the conference , styling it as a scientific forum that would seek answers to unresolved issues around the holocaust .
it turned out to be a gathering of revisionists whose main claim to fame has been the doubts they 've frequently expressed about whether the mass murder of six million jews took place at all . bundestag president norbert lammert was among the strongest critics of the conference .
in a letter to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , he said he condemned any attempt to promote anti-semitic feelings under the guise of scientific freedom and objectivity .
the secretary general of germany 's social democratic party , hubertus heil , said that anyone who denies the holocaust is the enemy of modern day germany .

" you only have to look at how serious current attempts are by iran and others to deny israel 's right to statehood and wipe it off the map completely , " weisskirchen said .
" you just have to consider the mood in syria and among hezbollah fighters to realize how real the threat is .
for us germans , there can be no other option than to stand firmly at the side of israel and defend it against any sort of military threat or anti-semitic propaganda . " germany 's largest-selling newspaper , bild , wrote on tuesday that awareness of the killing of six million european jews united the civilized world and made it unbearable that iran 's president put on the " so-called holocaust conference . " it is a forum for the vilest haters of jews on earth , " the paper wrote .
" one must be deeply ashamed that six germans also made it to this disgusting event .
and the iranian leadership shows its real face . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's national holocaust memorial in berlin german historian rene wildnagel said the holocaust conference served the purpose of strengthening a decades-old line of argument in many arab nations .

the meeting was widely considered a platform for revisionists who deny the holocaust and the existence of gas chambers under the nazis . a spokesman for the german foreign ministry , jens ploetner , said in berlin that nothing of scientific value would come out of the tehran conference , which ended tuesday . " the german government condemns all attempts to deny the holocaust and question israel 's right to independent statehood , " he said .
" for us , living in the country where the mass murder of jews was planned and carried out , we feel a special responsibility to commemorate the victims of nazi terror .
it 's in this context that we condemn any attempt to provide a forum for revisionists who are out to rewrite history in an unacceptable manner . "
iran 's leadership has defended the decision to hold the conference , styling it as a scientific forum that would seek answers to unresolved issues around the holocaust .
it turned out to be a gathering of revisionists whose main claim to fame has been the doubts they 've frequently expressed about whether the mass murder of six million jews took place at all . bundestag president norbert lammert was among the strongest critics of the conference .
in a letter to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , he said he condemned any attempt to promote anti-semitic feelings under the guise of scientific freedom and objectivity .
the secretary general of germany 's social democratic party , hubertus heil , said that anyone who denies the holocaust is the enemy of modern day germany .

" mehmet will call it a day at the end of the season , " hoeness told the bild newspaper tuesday , adding that scholl - the only professional footballer to win eight bundesliga titles - would be remaining with the club to work with the defending champions ' youth team . " he might even do this at board level , " hoeness said . " bayern are losing a much loved player , " said hoeness of the club 's longest-serving player .
scholl 's last match for the german champions will be a friendly against barcelona in august 2007 .
he extended his contract by one year in may until the end of the 2006/07 season , his 15th campaign in the number 7 jersey with the munich club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scholl has been a prolific scorer from his midfield berth the 36-year-old has played in the bundesliga since 1990 , making 384 league appearances for bayern and 58 for his hometown club , karlsruhe , scoring a total of 97 goals .
he has also won 36 caps playing for germany . but 17 years at the top have taken their toll on scholl , who was an idol for fans in his youth , lauded for his technical ability , his creative playmaking , his dribbling skills and his free-kicks , and has battled throughout his career with countless muscle and ligament injuries . scholl 's latest setback came only last wednesday when he sustained a muscle fiber injury in training , meaning he wo n't be fit to play until next year . injuries restrict scholl to bit-part role in final season coach felix magath has said he intends to only use scholl as a substitute between now and the end of the season but fans can say goodbye to the player in the franz beckenbauer cup tournament against current european champions barca next august . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayern no.7 has scored many vital goals in his career since his move from karlsruhe to bayern in 1992 , scholl has achieved everything that can be achieved in german club football . apart from his eight league medals , scholl also helped bayern to five german cups as well as the 1996 uefa cup and 2001 champions league titles . in early 2001 , he was voted player of the year 2000 by the professional players of the first and second bundesliga , and in may 2005 , fans voted him one of the eleven greatest bayern players of all time an international career of disappointments scholl 's only disappointment comes from his time with the german national team .
ill-timed injuries meant he never made an appearance at a world cup and he made just three appearances at euro 1996 in england , when he was substituted each time . he played in the quarter-final , semi-final , and final .
he has the curious distinction of being the player who , in the 69th minute of the final when the czech republic were leading 1-0 , was subbed out for the then relatively unknown oliver bierhoff who went on to score the two goals that turned the match around for germany , catapulting bierhoff to national and international fame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scholl 's international career has been more down than up scholl also played in all three of germany 's games at euro 2000 , scoring germany 's only goal in the tournament . he won his last international cap in february 2002 when germany beat israel 7-1 in kaiserslautern . before the 2006 world cup campaign , more than 100,000 people signed an online petition - " mehmet für deutschland " - for his inclusion in jürgen klinsmann 's squad for the tournament on home soil .
however , he was overlooked by his former international and club colleague . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de national soccer team redefines what it means to be german as nearly one-quarter of the german soccer team have foreign roots , cheering for the home boys means coming to terms with a germany that has become increasingly diverse ethnically .

he has also won 36 caps playing for germany . but 17 years at the top have taken their toll on scholl , who was an idol for fans in his youth , lauded for his technical ability , his creative playmaking , his dribbling skills and his free-kicks , and has battled throughout his career with countless muscle and ligament injuries . scholl 's latest setback came only last wednesday when he sustained a muscle fiber injury in training , meaning he wo n't be fit to play until next year . injuries restrict scholl to bit-part role in final season coach felix magath has said he intends to only use scholl as a substitute between now and the end of the season but fans can say goodbye to the player in the franz beckenbauer cup tournament against current european champions barca next august . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayern no.7 has scored many vital goals in his career since his move from karlsruhe to bayern in 1992 , scholl has achieved everything that can be achieved in german club football . apart from his eight league medals , scholl also helped bayern to five german cups as well as the 1996 uefa cup and 2001 champions league titles . in early 2001 , he was voted player of the year 2000 by the professional players of the first and second bundesliga , and in may 2005 , fans voted him one of the eleven greatest bayern players of all time an international career of disappointments scholl 's only disappointment comes from his time with the german national team .
ill-timed injuries meant he never made an appearance at a world cup and he made just three appearances at euro 1996 in england , when he was substituted each time . he played in the quarter-final , semi-final , and final .
he has the curious distinction of being the player who , in the 69th minute of the final when the czech republic were leading 1-0 , was subbed out for the then relatively unknown oliver bierhoff who went on to score the two goals that turned the match around for germany , catapulting bierhoff to national and international fame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scholl 's international career has been more down than up scholl also played in all three of germany 's games at euro 2000 , scoring germany 's only goal in the tournament . he won his last international cap in february 2002 when germany beat israel 7-1 in kaiserslautern . before the 2006 world cup campaign , more than 100,000 people signed an online petition - " mehmet für deutschland " - for his inclusion in jürgen klinsmann 's squad for the tournament on home soil .
however , he was overlooked by his former international and club colleague . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de national soccer team redefines what it means to be german as nearly one-quarter of the german soccer team have foreign roots , cheering for the home boys means coming to terms with a germany that has become increasingly diverse ethnically .

" european legislation on gmos seeks to ensure the highest protection of health and the environment , " said environment commissioner stavros dimas . " it is therefore difficult to understand why france has not complied with the judgment of the court , " he added . taking italy to the european court of justice for a second time on the same question , the commission called for fines of nearly 29 million euros plus daily penalties for failing to clean up two illegal land fills . " it is highly regrettable that we have to go to court a second time against italy and request fines , but the fundamental issue at stake here is the health of eu citizens and the protection of our environment , " dimas said . other countries in court bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all eu countries deal with their waste water in a proper way in other measures , the commission also decided to take finland , sweden and portugal to the european court of justice for failing to ensure correct treatment of urban waste water in a " significant number " of towns and cities . brussels also launched legal action against austria , italy and spain for allowing wild birds to be hunted without enough controls and failing to protect them as a result . austria , belgium , france , germany , luxembourg , the netherlands and portugal were taken to task with first formal warnings for not adopting eu landfill rules into their national laws correctly . greenhouse gases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some countries failed to comply with the eu 's emissions trading scheme austria , denmark , hungary and italy were sent warnings for missing a june deadline on notifying their plans to allocate greenhouse gas pollution quotas to industrial plants under the eu 's emissions trading scheme . france , germany , estonia , luxembourg , poland , slovenia and spain were also given warnings for submitting incomplete allocation plans to the commission . the eu executive likewise directed legal action against spain in six separate cases , mainly concerning water pollution .
greece was also rebuffed for its failure to keep water sources cleaner and allowing too high sulfur content in fuel . meanwhile , poland was given a final written warning before court action for not proposing more nature sites and was criticized for allowing eight road projects to go ahead that encroach upon designated or potential nature areas . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sets rules to save deep water fish stocks eu fisheries ministers agreed on a set of measures to slow overfishing in european waters .

judges at the european court ruled against the women , from wiltshire , by a majority of four to three , but with strong dissenting judgements .
joyce burden , 88 , and her sister sybil , 80 , were " bitterly disappointed " , said emma stradling , their legal executive .
the sisters have lived together since birth but if one of them dies the other will face a large inheritance tax bill .
they fear the one left will have to sell their family home to pay it .
discrimination they decided to take action in the wake of the civil partnership act 2004 .
it granted the same rights to gay and lesbian couples that married couples enjoy , but not to family members .
if a husband or wife dies then the estate passes to the surviving spouse without them being forced to pay tax .
the burden sisters say this amounts to discrimination under the terms of the european convention of human rights .
the sisters will now consider an appeal to the grand chamber .
the procedure for appeal allows any party to a case , within a period of three months from the date of a judgement , to apply to the grand chamber for permission to appeal .
if that permission is granted , the burden sisters will have a further hearing of their case .

judge patrick higginbotham said he had made his decision as the appeal was unlikely to result in the overturning of all skilling 's convictions .
skilling now has to report to a prison to begin his 24-year sentence .
in may he was found guilty on 19 counts of conspiracy , fraud and insider trading over enron 's collapse .
hidden debts judge higginbotham noted " serious frailties " in skilling 's convictions .
but he said those problems failed to raise a " substantial question " likely to result in the overturning of all skilling 's convictions - the standard required to grant bail during appeal .
the former chief executive of the us energy giant was convicted together with enron 's ex-chairman kenneth lay .
mr lay has since died following a heart attack in july .
under texas law , because his death came before he was able to appeal against the verdict , his conviction has been quashed .
the scandal at the one-time energy giant left 21,000 people out of work , and shook corporate america , when the firm went bankrupt in 2001 with debts of $ 31.8bn -lrb- £ 18bn -rrb- .
skilling was found to have orchestrated a series of loss-making deals and financial schemes to try to hide debts from investors .

judge patrick higginbotham said he had made his decision as the appeal was unlikely to result in the overturning of all skilling 's convictions .
skilling now has to report to a prison to begin his 24-year sentence .
in may he was found guilty on 19 counts of conspiracy , fraud and insider trading over enron 's collapse .
hidden debts judge higginbotham noted " serious frailties " in skilling 's convictions .
but he said those problems failed to raise a " substantial question " likely to result in the overturning of all skilling 's convictions - the standard required to grant bail during appeal .
kenneth lay died at his colorado ranch in july the former chief executive of the us energy giant was convicted together with enron 's ex-chairman kenneth lay .
mr lay has since died following a heart attack in july .
under texas law , because his death came before he was able to appeal against the verdict , his conviction has been quashed .
the scandal at the one-time energy giant left 21,000 people out of work , and shook corporate america , when the firm went bankrupt in 2001 with debts of $ 31.8bn -lrb- £ 18bn -rrb- .
skilling was found to have orchestrated a series of loss-making deals and financial schemes to try to hide debts from investors .

the franco-italian singer , who was playing a leading role in verdi 's aida , walked off after being booed .
his understudy had to take the stage wearing jeans for the show to continue .
the opera house management said he would not sing the remaining scheduled performances as he had technically broken his contract .
" his behaviour has created a rift between the artist and the audience , and there is no possibility of repairing this relationship , " spokesman carlo maria cella said .
" he did not leave because he was sick ; he left voluntarily . "
alagna contacted the opera company to tell them he was ready to return but was told his contract had been annulled .
he accused la scala of treating him like " a monster " and had contacted his lawyers to sue the company .
production suspension " i went there to sing , to give the audience joy and pleasure , " he told reuters news agency .
" but what was i supposed to do when some people started booing ?
what if they had thrown stones at me or some crazy person had attacked me ?
" la scala should have protected me , the show should have been suspended . "
last thursday 's production saw a star-studded audience - which included italian prime minister romano prodi and german chancellor angela merkel - welcome in la scala 's new season .
but while it received a standing ovation reviews of alagna - playing radames , the egyptian commander who must choose between his love for the slave aida and his loyalty to the pharaoh - were less than kind .
and it was during the second night 's performance that alagna was booed , causing him to vacate the stage .
understudy antonello palombi was then forced to take the stage without warning , valiantly taking over the role , minus his costume .

the franco-italian singer , who was playing a leading role in verdi 's aida , walked off after being booed .
his understudy had to take the stage wearing jeans for the show to continue .
the opera house management said he would not sing the remaining scheduled performances as he had technically broken his contract .
" his behaviour has created a rift between the artist and the audience , and there is no possibility of repairing this relationship , " spokesman carlo maria cella said .
" he did not leave because he was sick ; he left voluntarily . "
alagna contacted the opera company to tell them he was ready to return but was told his contract had been annulled .
he accused la scala of treating him like " a monster " and had contacted his lawyers to sue the company .
production suspension " i went there to sing , to give the audience joy and pleasure , " he told reuters news agency .
" but what was i supposed to do when some people started booing ?
what if they had thrown stones at me or some crazy person had attacked me ?
" la scala should have protected me , the show should have been suspended . "
last thursday 's production saw a star-studded audience - which included italian prime minister romano prodi and german chancellor angela merkel - welcome in la scala 's new season .
but while it received a standing ovation reviews of alagna - playing radames , the egyptian commander who must choose between his love for the slave aida and his loyalty to the pharaoh - were less than kind .
and it was during the second night 's performance that alagna was booed , causing him to vacate the stage .
