to the romantic ear , the german language might sound cumbersome and perfunctory , yet beyond its tonal harshness , it is as efficient as its native speakers are reputed to be .
but is that necessarily a good thing ? ever felt wearied by the world , angst at the thought of the future or completely drained of energy ? chances are you have , but will have had to fish around inarticulately for whole streams of words to describe your state of being .
not so in german , where words like weltschmerz -lrb- world-weariness -rrb- , zukunftsangst -lrb- fear of the future -rrb- , k reislaufkollaps -lrb- circulatory collapse -rrb- and morgenmuffel -lrb- a person who is grumpy in the morning -rrb- have their hard-earned places in the national lexicon .
where then , are our succinct english equivalents ?
the short answer is that there are none .
that language does not always translate tidily is no secret , but how is it that somewhere along the way , words which become an integral part of one language are deemed unnecessary in another .
ekkehard könig , a professor of linguistics at the freie university in berlin , says that language evolves to suit the needs of the people using it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afraid of the future ?
" if you gave a french man 50 euros , he would go out and spend it , whereas a german would put it in the bank , " he said .
words are created for concepts , for ideas which are important , and skepticism and a fear of the future are basic dispositions in this country . "
society creates what society needs but does the very existence of words such as zukunftsangst or weltschmerz , which so precisely describe the pains of life , work as an advertisement for more people to feel the same things ?
elizabeth couper-kuhlen , a professor of linguistics at potsdam university , says it is a chicken and egg situation .
" which came first ?
it is often said that if a language lacks a word , it is because the concept is less salient , and the more salient , the more central it is , the more likely there is to be a word for it , " the linguist said .
the debate over the power of language and words to influence the way people think and behave dates back decades , to the sapir-whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity .
and although that theory fell into disrepute in the mid-20th century , some anthropologists now believe that changes to language can bring about changes in people 's behavior .
with a chuckle , könig says that adding new and positive words such as zukunftsfreude -lrb- looking forward to the future -rrb- to the vernacular would be unlikely to change the german disposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not what you say , but how you say it couper-kuhlen believes there is a reflective relationship between language and society .
" you ca n't just change language and change society , but equally you ca n't change society without changing language , and the fact that certain words exist in a given language is a reflection of what is prevalent in that society , " she said .
" if people did not think and behave in a certain way , there may be no need for words like weltschmerz . "

as albrecht plewnia of the institute for german language says , the composite nature of german makes it much easier to invent new words to clearly reflect the issues of the moment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : launching pad for new words " it 's so much easier to debate over a single word than over bits of a sentence , they work much better in headlines , " he said .
but there is a danger that banner headlines trumpeting negative new words will be picked up from the outside and given greater weight than they actually deserve .
" outsiders looking in often tend to think there is more behind german words than is the case , " plewnia said .
" in actual fact , we just have the words we need to describe the problems that exist .
the words are born out of a need to describe specific situations . "
and for the most part , they do it well .
so perhaps german is not always the most lyrical language out there , but there is definitely something to be said for just saying it like it is . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de non-german authors bridge cultures with books in german in france or england it would n't be politically correct to label authors by nationality instead of literary style .

but there is a danger that banner headlines trumpeting negative new words will be picked up from the outside and given greater weight than they actually deserve .
" outsiders looking in often tend to think there is more behind german words than is the case , " plewnia said .
" in actual fact , we just have the words we need to describe the problems that exist .
the words are born out of a need to describe specific situations . "
and for the most part , they do it well .
so perhaps german is not always the most lyrical language out there , but there is definitely something to be said for just saying it like it is . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de non-german authors bridge cultures with books in german in france or england it would n't be politically correct to label authors by nationality instead of literary style .

in the first phase , the military should provide for internal and external security .
if you see how we do this today in our deployments , be it in bosnia , be it in iraq or afghanistan , these things are not coordinated enough . so , you 're saying that it 's not just the german government , it 's all the governments .
after all , germany is only involved in missions that are organized by others , such as nato , the eu or the united nations . absolutely .
this is not a thing that is unique to germany .
i saw this in all the nations , and if you read the book by mr. bob woodward on the campaign in iraq , you see that the americans are still struggling for a strategy , how to cope with the problems .
if you do n't do this at the very start , you have very many actors in the country who all try to do the best they can , but very often they contradict each other .
we had in kosovo , and still have , some 3,500 ngos -lrb- non-governmental organizations -rrb- and international organizations .
somehow this has to be brought together in some sort of synergistic approach for the well-being of the local population . what kind of strategy is needed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr needs to win the people 's confidence i think before we deploy into a country , the individual nations and the international community has to sit together and consider what we have to give to the country , with what means - as in personnel , medical and financial means - in order to make sure that in a bottom-up approach the conditions for the population are being met .
it 's not good enough in southern afghanistan only to fight the taliban and to be there with military forces if the living conditions for the people in all these villages are not being amended at the same time .
this has to go hand in glove , otherwise we lose the confidence of the people for whose sake we are deployed to that particular country . are you saying then that the german troops and the other troops in these missions are not fulfilling a useful function right now ? no , i 'm not saying that .
if you look at the balkans , the key function of the nato forces was to stop the war , to stop the killing , to stop the atrocities .
i think in this regard the forces did an excellent job and were very -lrb- much -rrb- welcomed by the people .
but all these terms like liberty and democracy and freedom do n't mean anything for the people as long as they do n't feel they are better off .
and if we can not guarantee - besides the stabilization of the internal situation , which has to be done by the military and the police forces - that the living conditions are improved , the military becomes an occupation force . there has been some criticism about the length of some of these missions , to the point that some feel that german troops go in but never come out .
what aspect is there in this strategy that tells you when the troops have to get out ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exit strategy should be part of the plan from the start this is a good question .
we have to establish criteria which have to be met and have to be supervised and if we have the feeling that these criteria are met to some extent , we can talk about pulling out the forces - as the germans try right now to do in bosnia-herzegovina where you have a local police , where you have some kind of local government and where you have some kind of local military forces which can take over these elements which were provided by the german contingent . michael lawton interviewed klaus reinhardt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts rethinking its foreign deployments german soldiers are engaged in eleven foreign missions .

in the first phase , the military should provide for internal and external security .
if you see how we do this today in our deployments , be it in bosnia , be it in iraq or afghanistan , these things are not coordinated enough . so , you 're saying that it 's not just the german government , it 's all the governments .
after all , germany is only involved in missions that are organized by others , such as nato , the eu or the united nations . absolutely .
this is not a thing that is unique to germany .
i saw this in all the nations , and if you read the book by mr. bob woodward on the campaign in iraq , you see that the americans are still struggling for a strategy , how to cope with the problems .
if you do n't do this at the very start , you have very many actors in the country who all try to do the best they can , but very often they contradict each other .
we had in kosovo , and still have , some 3,500 ngos -lrb- non-governmental organizations -rrb- and international organizations .
somehow this has to be brought together in some sort of synergistic approach for the well-being of the local population . what kind of strategy is needed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr needs to win the people 's confidence i think before we deploy into a country , the individual nations and the international community has to sit together and consider what we have to give to the country , with what means - as in personnel , medical and financial means - in order to make sure that in a bottom-up approach the conditions for the population are being met .
it 's not good enough in southern afghanistan only to fight the taliban and to be there with military forces if the living conditions for the people in all these villages are not being amended at the same time .
this has to go hand in glove , otherwise we lose the confidence of the people for whose sake we are deployed to that particular country . are you saying then that the german troops and the other troops in these missions are not fulfilling a useful function right now ? no , i 'm not saying that .
if you look at the balkans , the key function of the nato forces was to stop the war , to stop the killing , to stop the atrocities .
i think in this regard the forces did an excellent job and were very -lrb- much -rrb- welcomed by the people .
but all these terms like liberty and democracy and freedom do n't mean anything for the people as long as they do n't feel they are better off .
and if we can not guarantee - besides the stabilization of the internal situation , which has to be done by the military and the police forces - that the living conditions are improved , the military becomes an occupation force . there has been some criticism about the length of some of these missions , to the point that some feel that german troops go in but never come out .
what aspect is there in this strategy that tells you when the troops have to get out ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exit strategy should be part of the plan from the start this is a good question .
we have to establish criteria which have to be met and have to be supervised and if we have the feeling that these criteria are met to some extent , we can talk about pulling out the forces - as the germans try right now to do in bosnia-herzegovina where you have a local police , where you have some kind of local government and where you have some kind of local military forces which can take over these elements which were provided by the german contingent . michael lawton interviewed klaus reinhardt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts rethinking its foreign deployments german soldiers are engaged in eleven foreign missions .
but after a scandal with soldiers in afghanistan and fears that the military is overstretched , some want a reduction in the numbers of troops being sent abroad .
-lrb- 31.10.2006 -rrb- germany wants to pull troops out of bosnia from december berlin will begin gradually withdrawing its troops deployed with the international peacekeeping force in bosnia as early as december , german defense minister franz josef jung announced .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 01.11.2006 berlin smoking ban hoped to set example for rest of germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's smoke-filled cafes may be a thing of the past berlin 's local government wants a ground-breaking ban on smoking in the city 's public buildings as well as all bars and restaurants , reviving debate on outlawing smoking across the country . berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their designated coalition partners , the left party , said this week they are pressing ahead with plans to make the german capital smoke-free . " we 're planning a non-smoker protection bill , " said ingeborg junge-reyer , an spd leader in berlin and member of mayor wowereit 's cabinet , after a round of coalition talks .
she said the law could take effect as early as 2007 . " it will be a strict non-smoker protection bill .
i can well imagine a complete ban along the lines of italy or ireland , " junge-reyer said . a revolution until now , politicians in berlin have only spoken about legally outlawing smoking in public buildings and hospitals .
extending that ban to the german capital 's estimated 10,000 bars and restaurants is a new proposal and one that is likely to trigger much opposition in a country known for its tolerant attitude towards smoking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking goes hand in hand with going out in berlin one in three germans smoke , while berlin has the highest per-capita number .
most restaurants do not offer non-smoking sections .
the legislation , if passed , could indeed become something of a revolution in a country which has doggedly remained one of the last bastions for smokers in europe . it would also mark a sharp departure from the rest of germany 's federal states , which have to varying degrees resisted national restrictions on tobacco .
a previous effort to introduce a nationwide ban on smoking in restaurants , cafes and bars aimed at bringing germany into line with other european nations was blocked in september by chancellor angela merkel 's ruling conservatives . a working group made up of representatives from the spd , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as from the health and consumer protection ministry is currently exploring ways of introducing a germany-wide anti-smoking regulation . setting an example some hope that berlin will now lead the way for the rest of germany when it comes to curbing public smoking . " i hope that the other states will now realize that our fear of smoking bans is unjustified , " sabine bätzing , the federal drug commissioner , told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
berlin 's initiative is a " signal and support " for a nationwide regulation that 's urgently needed , bätzing added . carola reimann , a spokeswoman on health matters for the spd parliamentary group , also said she hoped " the capital will set an example " for the rest of germany .
" if berlin , with its thriving bar and restaurant scene , can take such a decision then it 's a signal that ca n't be overlooked , " reimann said . laws governing gastronomy and the hospitality industry are the prerogative of state governments in germany . last bastion for smokers many point out that germany 's liberal attitude to smoking is partly a reaction to nazi anti-smoking drives .
hitler is said to have donated money in 1941 to the world 's first institute dedicated to studying the dangers of tobacco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people pass over a no smoking sign in the madrid underground whatever the reason for germany 's determined resistance to anti-smoking bans , it remains the only country in the european union that has ignored and fought an eu ban on tobacco advertising . ireland imposed the world 's first nationwide public smoking ban in 2004 , followed by italy , sweden , scotland , norway and spain .

society creates what society needs but does the very existence of words such as zukunftsangst or weltschmerz , which so precisely describe the pains of life , work as an advertisement for more people to feel the same things ?
elizabeth couper-kuhlen , a professor of linguistics at potsdam university , says it is a chicken and egg situation .
" which came first ?
it is often said that if a language lacks a word , it is because the concept is less salient , and the more salient , the more central it is , the more likely there is to be a word for it , " the linguist said .
the debate over the power of language and words to influence the way people think and behave dates back decades , to the sapir-whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity .
and although that theory fell into disrepute in the mid-20th century , some anthropologists now believe that changes to language can bring about changes in people 's behavior .
with a chuckle , könig says that adding new and positive words such as zukunftsfreude -lrb- looking forward to the future -rrb- to the vernacular would be unlikely to change the german disposition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 01.11.2006 berlin smoking ban hoped to set example for rest of germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's smoke-filled cafes may be a thing of the past berlin 's local government wants a ground-breaking ban on smoking in the city 's public buildings as well as all bars and restaurants , reviving debate on outlawing smoking across the country . berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their designated coalition partners , the left party , said this week they are pressing ahead with plans to make the german capital smoke-free . " we 're planning a non-smoker protection bill , " said ingeborg junge-reyer , an spd leader in berlin and member of mayor wowereit 's cabinet , after a round of coalition talks .
she said the law could take effect as early as 2007 . " it will be a strict non-smoker protection bill .
i can well imagine a complete ban along the lines of italy or ireland , " junge-reyer said . a revolution until now , politicians in berlin have only spoken about legally outlawing smoking in public buildings and hospitals .
extending that ban to the german capital 's estimated 10,000 bars and restaurants is a new proposal and one that is likely to trigger much opposition in a country known for its tolerant attitude towards smoking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking goes hand in hand with going out in berlin one in three germans smoke , while berlin has the highest per-capita number .
most restaurants do not offer non-smoking sections .
the legislation , if passed , could indeed become something of a revolution in a country which has doggedly remained one of the last bastions for smokers in europe . it would also mark a sharp departure from the rest of germany 's federal states , which have to varying degrees resisted national restrictions on tobacco .
a previous effort to introduce a nationwide ban on smoking in restaurants , cafes and bars aimed at bringing germany into line with other european nations was blocked in september by chancellor angela merkel 's ruling conservatives . a working group made up of representatives from the spd , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as from the health and consumer protection ministry is currently exploring ways of introducing a germany-wide anti-smoking regulation . setting an example some hope that berlin will now lead the way for the rest of germany when it comes to curbing public smoking . " i hope that the other states will now realize that our fear of smoking bans is unjustified , " sabine bätzing , the federal drug commissioner , told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
berlin 's initiative is a " signal and support " for a nationwide regulation that 's urgently needed , bätzing added . carola reimann , a spokeswoman on health matters for the spd parliamentary group , also said she hoped " the capital will set an example " for the rest of germany .
" if berlin , with its thriving bar and restaurant scene , can take such a decision then it 's a signal that ca n't be overlooked , " reimann said . laws governing gastronomy and the hospitality industry are the prerogative of state governments in germany . last bastion for smokers many point out that germany 's liberal attitude to smoking is partly a reaction to nazi anti-smoking drives .
hitler is said to have donated money in 1941 to the world 's first institute dedicated to studying the dangers of tobacco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people pass over a no smoking sign in the madrid underground whatever the reason for germany 's determined resistance to anti-smoking bans , it remains the only country in the european union that has ignored and fought an eu ban on tobacco advertising . ireland imposed the world 's first nationwide public smoking ban in 2004 , followed by italy , sweden , scotland , norway and spain .
france said last month it would ban smoking in public places starting next year and in bars and clubs from 2008 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french impose smoking ban on cafes , restaurants french smokers will be headed outside as of february , when the country 's smoking ban takes effect in public places and extends to hotels , bars , restaurants and night clubs 11 months later .

" we 're planning a non-smoker protection bill , " said ingeborg junge-reyer , an spd leader in berlin and member of mayor wowereit 's cabinet , after a round of coalition talks .
she said the law could take effect as early as 2007 . " it will be a strict non-smoker protection bill .
i can well imagine a complete ban along the lines of italy or ireland , " junge-reyer said . a revolution until now , politicians in berlin have only spoken about legally outlawing smoking in public buildings and hospitals .
extending that ban to the german capital 's estimated 10,000 bars and restaurants is a new proposal and one that is likely to trigger much opposition in a country known for its tolerant attitude towards smoking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking goes hand in hand with going out in berlin one in three germans smoke , while berlin has the highest per-capita number .
most restaurants do not offer non-smoking sections .
the legislation , if passed , could indeed become something of a revolution in a country which has doggedly remained one of the last bastions for smokers in europe . it would also mark a sharp departure from the rest of germany 's federal states , which have to varying degrees resisted national restrictions on tobacco .
a previous effort to introduce a nationwide ban on smoking in restaurants , cafes and bars aimed at bringing germany into line with other european nations was blocked in september by chancellor angela merkel 's ruling conservatives . a working group made up of representatives from the spd , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as from the health and consumer protection ministry is currently exploring ways of introducing a germany-wide anti-smoking regulation . setting an example some hope that berlin will now lead the way for the rest of germany when it comes to curbing public smoking . " i hope that the other states will now realize that our fear of smoking bans is unjustified , " sabine bätzing , the federal drug commissioner , told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
berlin 's initiative is a " signal and support " for a nationwide regulation that 's urgently needed , bätzing added . carola reimann , a spokeswoman on health matters for the spd parliamentary group , also said she hoped " the capital will set an example " for the rest of germany .
" if berlin , with its thriving bar and restaurant scene , can take such a decision then it 's a signal that ca n't be overlooked , " reimann said . laws governing gastronomy and the hospitality industry are the prerogative of state governments in germany . last bastion for smokers many point out that germany 's liberal attitude to smoking is partly a reaction to nazi anti-smoking drives .
hitler is said to have donated money in 1941 to the world 's first institute dedicated to studying the dangers of tobacco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people pass over a no smoking sign in the madrid underground whatever the reason for germany 's determined resistance to anti-smoking bans , it remains the only country in the european union that has ignored and fought an eu ban on tobacco advertising . ireland imposed the world 's first nationwide public smoking ban in 2004 , followed by italy , sweden , scotland , norway and spain .

to the romantic ear , the german language might sound cumbersome and perfunctory , yet beyond its tonal harshness , it is as efficient as its native speakers are reputed to be .
but is that necessarily a good thing ? ever felt wearied by the world , angst at the thought of the future or completely drained of energy ? chances are you have , but will have had to fish around inarticulately for whole streams of words to describe your state of being .
not so in german , where words like weltschmerz -lrb- world-weariness -rrb- , zukunftsangst -lrb- fear of the future -rrb- , k reislaufkollaps -lrb- circulatory collapse -rrb- and morgenmuffel -lrb- a person who is grumpy in the morning -rrb- have their hard-earned places in the national lexicon .
where then , are our succinct english equivalents ?
the short answer is that there are none .
that language does not always translate tidily is no secret , but how is it that somewhere along the way , words which become an integral part of one language are deemed unnecessary in another .
ekkehard könig , a professor of linguistics at the freie university in berlin , says that language evolves to suit the needs of the people using it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afraid of the future ?
" if you gave a french man 50 euros , he would go out and spend it , whereas a german would put it in the bank , " he said .
words are created for concepts , for ideas which are important , and skepticism and a fear of the future are basic dispositions in this country . "
society creates what society needs but does the very existence of words such as zukunftsangst or weltschmerz , which so precisely describe the pains of life , work as an advertisement for more people to feel the same things ?
elizabeth couper-kuhlen , a professor of linguistics at potsdam university , says it is a chicken and egg situation .
" which came first ?
it is often said that if a language lacks a word , it is because the concept is less salient , and the more salient , the more central it is , the more likely there is to be a word for it , " the linguist said .
the debate over the power of language and words to influence the way people think and behave dates back decades , to the sapir-whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity .
and although that theory fell into disrepute in the mid-20th century , some anthropologists now believe that changes to language can bring about changes in people 's behavior .
with a chuckle , könig says that adding new and positive words such as zukunftsfreude -lrb- looking forward to the future -rrb- to the vernacular would be unlikely to change the german disposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not what you say , but how you say it couper-kuhlen believes there is a reflective relationship between language and society .
" you ca n't just change language and change society , but equally you ca n't change society without changing language , and the fact that certain words exist in a given language is a reflection of what is prevalent in that society , " she said .
" if people did not think and behave in a certain way , there may be no need for words like weltschmerz . "
building blocks the thing about the german language is that whilst it is systematic , it is also highly flexible , and wonderfully efficient .
it 's like a huge tub of " legos " offering endless opportunities for building words and concise means of self-expression .
weld together three completely unrelated words to make one new one which wastes not a single syllable in beating around the bush .
as albrecht plewnia of the institute for german language says , the composite nature of german makes it much easier to invent new words to clearly reflect the issues of the moment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : launching pad for new words " it 's so much easier to debate over a single word than over bits of a sentence , they work much better in headlines , " he said .
but there is a danger that banner headlines trumpeting negative new words will be picked up from the outside and given greater weight than they actually deserve .
" outsiders looking in often tend to think there is more behind german words than is the case , " plewnia said .
" in actual fact , we just have the words we need to describe the problems that exist .
the words are born out of a need to describe specific situations . "
and for the most part , they do it well .
so perhaps german is not always the most lyrical language out there , but there is definitely something to be said for just saying it like it is . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de non-german authors bridge cultures with books in german in france or england it would n't be politically correct to label authors by nationality instead of literary style .

since taking over the responsibility from the italian navy of stopping illegal arms reaching the shiite hezbollah militia , the bundesmarine vessels and helicopters have been harassed on at least two occasions by israeli warplanes . the incidents , played down by the israeli defense force -lrb- idf -rrb- and denied by the israeli ambassador to germany , shimon stein , raised questions about the wisdom of the deployment which was approved by the bundestag after a long period of soul-searching , prompted by germany 's history with israel . on the occasions when idf warplanes allegedly shot over the bows of a german surveillance ship in international waters and when bundesmarine helicopters were buzzed by jets , jung was reported to have telephoned with his israeli counterpart amir peretz to clarify the incidents and protest . israeli prime minister ehud olmert has since apologized to germany for the " misunderstandings " and highlighted the importance of the german forces ' participation in the international force deployed in lebanon . in recent days , germany and israel have agreed to review the level of military communication between the two nations in a bid to avoid further incidents or escalation . jung to discuss co-operation with israeli counterpart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung will meet israel 's defense minister amir peretz jung 's visit to tel aviv on friday is expected to include discussions with peretz on ways to improve cooperation in regard to policing lebanon which continues to live under a fragile ceasefire after the 34-day war between israel and hezbollah ended in august . before flying on to the israeli capital , jung will pay a visit to german troops deployed off the coast of lebanon and will then meet with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and defense minister elias murr . the visit comes at a time when jung himself is under growing pressure to resign after a series of gaffes and blunders which have infuriated not merely the opposition but also reportedly chancellor angela merkel . media reports say jung - a member of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - has drawn the wrath of his boss for supplying a faulty report on germany 's naval contribution to united nations forces in lebanon . defense minister 's blunders anger chancellor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was reportedly livid over jung 's gaffes merkel , quoting the defense ministry paper , publicly declared that german ships would be able to patrol inside of lebanese territorial waters within six miles from the coast .
" we can cruise in the entire area , " said the chancellor .
but in reality , lebanon 's government had demanded german ships stay outside the six-mile zone . merkel was reportedly livid after being corrected by german diplomats and military officials .
there are now accusations that she misled germany 's parliament to win approval for the mission . this debacle was followed by a series of other stumbles by jung . without informing the chancellor , jung announced at the weekend that germany planned to pull out some of its 850 troops serving with european union peacekeepers in bosnia-herzegovina . making matters even worse , he said this was necessary because german armed forces were badly overstretched - an implicit criticism of his own government recently voiced by the opposition greens .

but will the make-over help the event fend off fierce competition ? some 185 galleries from 28 different countries will be display their collections when the 40th edition of the annual art cologne fair opens its doors on wednesday .
organizers say they hope this year 's fair will attract 70,000 visitors . one of the highlights this year is the " open space " section , which is dedicated to up-and-coming young artists . " you need the next generation , " art cologne director gerard goodrow told dw-radio .
" we see this very clearly with both galleries and artists .
the potential of the next generation is a guarantee for the future since gallery owners and artists are always retiring , and collectors sometime stop buying in their later years . " the open space concentrates on installations .
but that 's not the only genre being featured at the fair . " there 's a trend toward sculpture , " goodrow said " but what we 're also seeing at art cologne is a new interest in works on paper - above all drawings . " in addition , this year 's fair includes a new section entitled " hidden treasures , " which is devoted to artists over the age of 40 whose works have yet to make the mark they deserve on the art market . productive self-questioning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hope the public will say " yes " to the new-look art fair founded in 1967 , art cologne was the world 's first art trade fair and has long been considered the most important event of its kind in germany .
but it 's suffered recently from competition from rival events in london , basel and berlin .
the number of galleries participating is down from 250 , and only three from the united states are in attendance . goodrow , who took over the fair in 2003 , has been trying to guide it out of a fallow period by emphasizing youth and innovation . " it 's something that we 've learned especially from young artists , gallery owners and collectors .
if you get too complacent , nothing happens and other cities like berlin and london gain in importance .
constantly calling yourself into question leads to innovation and progress . " in that avant-garde spirit , art cologne is staging a special showing of works by greek artist jannis kounellis .
born in 1936 , kounellis is considered a leading member of the arte povera movement .
one highlight of art cologne is a recreation of a famous kounellis installation from 1969 , consisting of 12 live horses chained to walls . art cologne 2006 runs through nov .
5 .
but whatever critics ' and art lovers ' reactions to the event , big changes are afoot .

but will the make-over help the event fend off fierce competition ? some 185 galleries from 28 different countries will be display their collections when the 40th edition of the annual art cologne fair opens its doors on wednesday .
organizers say they hope this year 's fair will attract 70,000 visitors . one of the highlights this year is the " open space " section , which is dedicated to up-and-coming young artists . " you need the next generation , " art cologne director gerard goodrow told dw-radio .
" we see this very clearly with both galleries and artists .
the potential of the next generation is a guarantee for the future since gallery owners and artists are always retiring , and collectors sometime stop buying in their later years . " the open space concentrates on installations .
but that 's not the only genre being featured at the fair . " there 's a trend toward sculpture , " goodrow said " but what we 're also seeing at art cologne is a new interest in works on paper - above all drawings . " in addition , this year 's fair includes a new section entitled " hidden treasures , " which is devoted to artists over the age of 40 whose works have yet to make the mark they deserve on the art market . productive self-questioning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hope the public will say " yes " to the new-look art fair founded in 1967 , art cologne was the world 's first art trade fair and has long been considered the most important event of its kind in germany .
but it 's suffered recently from competition from rival events in london , basel and berlin .
the number of galleries participating is down from 250 , and only three from the united states are in attendance . goodrow , who took over the fair in 2003 , has been trying to guide it out of a fallow period by emphasizing youth and innovation . " it 's something that we 've learned especially from young artists , gallery owners and collectors .
if you get too complacent , nothing happens and other cities like berlin and london gain in importance .
constantly calling yourself into question leads to innovation and progress . " in that avant-garde spirit , art cologne is staging a special showing of works by greek artist jannis kounellis .
born in 1936 , kounellis is considered a leading member of the arte povera movement .
one highlight of art cologne is a recreation of a famous kounellis installation from 1969 , consisting of 12 live horses chained to walls . art cologne 2006 runs through nov .
5 .
but whatever critics ' and art lovers ' reactions to the event , big changes are afoot .

to the romantic ear , the german language might sound cumbersome and perfunctory , yet beyond its tonal harshness , it is as efficient as its native speakers are reputed to be .
but is that necessarily a good thing ? ever felt wearied by the world , angst at the thought of the future or completely drained of energy ? chances are you have , but will have had to fish around inarticulately for whole streams of words to describe your state of being .
not so in german , where words like weltschmerz -lrb- world-weariness -rrb- , zukunftsangst -lrb- fear of the future -rrb- , k reislaufkollaps -lrb- circulatory collapse -rrb- and morgenmuffel -lrb- a person who is grumpy in the morning -rrb- have their hard-earned places in the national lexicon .
where then , are our succinct english equivalents ?
the short answer is that there are none .
that language does not always translate tidily is no secret , but how is it that somewhere along the way , words which become an integral part of one language are deemed unnecessary in another .
ekkehard könig , a professor of linguistics at the freie university in berlin , says that language evolves to suit the needs of the people using it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afraid of the future ?
" if you gave a french man 50 euros , he would go out and spend it , whereas a german would put it in the bank , " he said .
words are created for concepts , for ideas which are important , and skepticism and a fear of the future are basic dispositions in this country . "
society creates what society needs but does the very existence of words such as zukunftsangst or weltschmerz , which so precisely describe the pains of life , work as an advertisement for more people to feel the same things ?
elizabeth couper-kuhlen , a professor of linguistics at potsdam university , says it is a chicken and egg situation .
" which came first ?
it is often said that if a language lacks a word , it is because the concept is less salient , and the more salient , the more central it is , the more likely there is to be a word for it , " the linguist said .
the debate over the power of language and words to influence the way people think and behave dates back decades , to the sapir-whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity .
and although that theory fell into disrepute in the mid-20th century , some anthropologists now believe that changes to language can bring about changes in people 's behavior .
with a chuckle , könig says that adding new and positive words such as zukunftsfreude -lrb- looking forward to the future -rrb- to the vernacular would be unlikely to change the german disposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not what you say , but how you say it couper-kuhlen believes there is a reflective relationship between language and society .
" you ca n't just change language and change society , but equally you ca n't change society without changing language , and the fact that certain words exist in a given language is a reflection of what is prevalent in that society , " she said .
" if people did not think and behave in a certain way , there may be no need for words like weltschmerz . "
building blocks the thing about the german language is that whilst it is systematic , it is also highly flexible , and wonderfully efficient .
it 's like a huge tub of " legos " offering endless opportunities for building words and concise means of self-expression .
weld together three completely unrelated words to make one new one which wastes not a single syllable in beating around the bush .
as albrecht plewnia of the institute for german language says , the composite nature of german makes it much easier to invent new words to clearly reflect the issues of the moment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : launching pad for new words " it 's so much easier to debate over a single word than over bits of a sentence , they work much better in headlines , " he said .
but there is a danger that banner headlines trumpeting negative new words will be picked up from the outside and given greater weight than they actually deserve .
" outsiders looking in often tend to think there is more behind german words than is the case , " plewnia said .
" in actual fact , we just have the words we need to describe the problems that exist .
the words are born out of a need to describe specific situations . "
and for the most part , they do it well .
so perhaps german is not always the most lyrical language out there , but there is definitely something to be said for just saying it like it is . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de non-german authors bridge cultures with books in german in france or england it would n't be politically correct to label authors by nationality instead of literary style .

since taking over the responsibility from the italian navy of stopping illegal arms reaching the shiite hezbollah militia , the bundesmarine vessels and helicopters have been harassed on at least two occasions by israeli warplanes . the incidents , played down by the israeli defense force -lrb- idf -rrb- and denied by the israeli ambassador to germany , shimon stein , raised questions about the wisdom of the deployment which was approved by the bundestag after a long period of soul-searching , prompted by germany 's history with israel . on the occasions when idf warplanes allegedly shot over the bows of a german surveillance ship in international waters and when bundesmarine helicopters were buzzed by jets , jung was reported to have telephoned with his israeli counterpart amir peretz to clarify the incidents and protest . israeli prime minister ehud olmert has since apologized to germany for the " misunderstandings " and highlighted the importance of the german forces ' participation in the international force deployed in lebanon . in recent days , germany and israel have agreed to review the level of military communication between the two nations in a bid to avoid further incidents or escalation . jung to discuss co-operation with israeli counterpart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung will meet israel 's defense minister amir peretz jung 's visit to tel aviv on friday is expected to include discussions with peretz on ways to improve cooperation in regard to policing lebanon which continues to live under a fragile ceasefire after the 34-day war between israel and hezbollah ended in august . before flying on to the israeli capital , jung will pay a visit to german troops deployed off the coast of lebanon and will then meet with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and defense minister elias murr . the visit comes at a time when jung himself is under growing pressure to resign after a series of gaffes and blunders which have infuriated not merely the opposition but also reportedly chancellor angela merkel . media reports say jung - a member of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - has drawn the wrath of his boss for supplying a faulty report on germany 's naval contribution to united nations forces in lebanon . defense minister 's blunders anger chancellor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was reportedly livid over jung 's gaffes merkel , quoting the defense ministry paper , publicly declared that german ships would be able to patrol inside of lebanese territorial waters within six miles from the coast .
" we can cruise in the entire area , " said the chancellor .
but in reality , lebanon 's government had demanded german ships stay outside the six-mile zone . merkel was reportedly livid after being corrected by german diplomats and military officials .
there are now accusations that she misled germany 's parliament to win approval for the mission . this debacle was followed by a series of other stumbles by jung . without informing the chancellor , jung announced at the weekend that germany planned to pull out some of its 850 troops serving with european union peacekeepers in bosnia-herzegovina . making matters even worse , he said this was necessary because german armed forces were badly overstretched - an implicit criticism of his own government recently voiced by the opposition greens .
germany currently has about 10,000 troops on foreign missions in the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan - out of a total of 253,000 active soldiers . the cabinet 's weakest link ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung 's appointment was not widely supported critics pounced on jung 's explanation and said cutting the 6,000-member eu force in bosnia-herzegovina could only be justified by the considerable political progress in the former yugoslav territory which was torn by a bloody civil war from 1992 to 1995 . jung 's response to the publication of ugly photos showing german troops in afghanistan posing with human skulls has also been criticized . the defense minister seemed to brush aside any responsibility by stressing he had not been in office when the pictures were taken . defense minister jung has always been viewed as one of the weakest members in the german cabinet .
his selection one year ago surprised observers given that he had almost no experience in military affairs other than having done military service back in the 1960s . jung appears to have been given the post largely because the powerful cdu premier of hesse state , roland koch , insisted he was the right man for the job . middle east visit to be jung 's last ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense minister 's foreign visits could soon end according to some , however , that may not be enough to save him .
opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- leaders predict jung will either resign or be forced from office . " i believe jung will be gone by christmas , " said fdp defense expert rainer stinner while dirk nibel , the fdp secretary general , appealed to jung to take responsibility for his failings and quit . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wants to pull troops out of bosnia from december berlin will begin gradually withdrawing its troops deployed with the international peacekeeping force in bosnia as early as december , german defense minister franz josef jung announced .

germany now fears reprisals against its troops .

to the romantic ear , the german language might sound cumbersome and perfunctory , yet beyond its tonal harshness , it is as efficient as its native speakers are reputed to be .
but is that necessarily a good thing ? ever felt wearied by the world , angst at the thought of the future or completely drained of energy ? chances are you have , but will have had to fish around inarticulately for whole streams of words to describe your state of being .
not so in german , where words like weltschmerz -lrb- world-weariness -rrb- , zukunftsangst -lrb- fear of the future -rrb- , k reislaufkollaps -lrb- circulatory collapse -rrb- and morgenmuffel -lrb- a person who is grumpy in the morning -rrb- have their hard-earned places in the national lexicon .
where then , are our succinct english equivalents ?
the short answer is that there are none .
that language does not always translate tidily is no secret , but how is it that somewhere along the way , words which become an integral part of one language are deemed unnecessary in another .
ekkehard könig , a professor of linguistics at the freie university in berlin , says that language evolves to suit the needs of the people using it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afraid of the future ?
" if you gave a french man 50 euros , he would go out and spend it , whereas a german would put it in the bank , " he said .
words are created for concepts , for ideas which are important , and skepticism and a fear of the future are basic dispositions in this country . "
society creates what society needs but does the very existence of words such as zukunftsangst or weltschmerz , which so precisely describe the pains of life , work as an advertisement for more people to feel the same things ?
elizabeth couper-kuhlen , a professor of linguistics at potsdam university , says it is a chicken and egg situation .
" which came first ?
it is often said that if a language lacks a word , it is because the concept is less salient , and the more salient , the more central it is , the more likely there is to be a word for it , " the linguist said .
the debate over the power of language and words to influence the way people think and behave dates back decades , to the sapir-whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity .
and although that theory fell into disrepute in the mid-20th century , some anthropologists now believe that changes to language can bring about changes in people 's behavior .
with a chuckle , könig says that adding new and positive words such as zukunftsfreude -lrb- looking forward to the future -rrb- to the vernacular would be unlikely to change the german disposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not what you say , but how you say it couper-kuhlen believes there is a reflective relationship between language and society .
" you ca n't just change language and change society , but equally you ca n't change society without changing language , and the fact that certain words exist in a given language is a reflection of what is prevalent in that society , " she said .
" if people did not think and behave in a certain way , there may be no need for words like weltschmerz . "
building blocks the thing about the german language is that whilst it is systematic , it is also highly flexible , and wonderfully efficient .
it 's like a huge tub of " legos " offering endless opportunities for building words and concise means of self-expression .
weld together three completely unrelated words to make one new one which wastes not a single syllable in beating around the bush .
as albrecht plewnia of the institute for german language says , the composite nature of german makes it much easier to invent new words to clearly reflect the issues of the moment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : launching pad for new words " it 's so much easier to debate over a single word than over bits of a sentence , they work much better in headlines , " he said .
but there is a danger that banner headlines trumpeting negative new words will be picked up from the outside and given greater weight than they actually deserve .
" outsiders looking in often tend to think there is more behind german words than is the case , " plewnia said .
" in actual fact , we just have the words we need to describe the problems that exist .
the words are born out of a need to describe specific situations . "
and for the most part , they do it well .
so perhaps german is not always the most lyrical language out there , but there is definitely something to be said for just saying it like it is . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de non-german authors bridge cultures with books in german in france or england it would n't be politically correct to label authors by nationality instead of literary style .

to the romantic ear , the german language might sound cumbersome and perfunctory , yet beyond its tonal harshness , it is as efficient as its native speakers are reputed to be .
but is that necessarily a good thing ? ever felt wearied by the world , angst at the thought of the future or completely drained of energy ? chances are you have , but will have had to fish around inarticulately for whole streams of words to describe your state of being .
not so in german , where words like weltschmerz -lrb- world-weariness -rrb- , zukunftsangst -lrb- fear of the future -rrb- , k reislaufkollaps -lrb- circulatory collapse -rrb- and morgenmuffel -lrb- a person who is grumpy in the morning -rrb- have their hard-earned places in the national lexicon .
where then , are our succinct english equivalents ?
the short answer is that there are none .
that language does not always translate tidily is no secret , but how is it that somewhere along the way , words which become an integral part of one language are deemed unnecessary in another .
ekkehard könig , a professor of linguistics at the freie university in berlin , says that language evolves to suit the needs of the people using it .

" if you gave a french man 50 euros , he would go out and spend it , whereas a german would put it in the bank , " he said .
words are created for concepts , for ideas which are important , and skepticism and a fear of the future are basic dispositions in this country . "
society creates what society needs but does the very existence of words such as zukunftsangst or weltschmerz , which so precisely describe the pains of life , work as an advertisement for more people to feel the same things ?
elizabeth couper-kuhlen , a professor of linguistics at potsdam university , says it is a chicken and egg situation .
" which came first ?
it is often said that if a language lacks a word , it is because the concept is less salient , and the more salient , the more central it is , the more likely there is to be a word for it , " the linguist said .
the debate over the power of language and words to influence the way people think and behave dates back decades , to the sapir-whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity .
and although that theory fell into disrepute in the mid-20th century , some anthropologists now believe that changes to language can bring about changes in people 's behavior .
with a chuckle , könig says that adding new and positive words such as zukunftsfreude -lrb- looking forward to the future -rrb- to the vernacular would be unlikely to change the german disposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not what you say , but how you say it couper-kuhlen believes there is a reflective relationship between language and society .
" you ca n't just change language and change society , but equally you ca n't change society without changing language , and the fact that certain words exist in a given language is a reflection of what is prevalent in that society , " she said .
" if people did not think and behave in a certain way , there may be no need for words like weltschmerz . "

as albrecht plewnia of the institute for german language says , the composite nature of german makes it much easier to invent new words to clearly reflect the issues of the moment .

since taking over the responsibility from the italian navy of stopping illegal arms reaching the shiite hezbollah militia , the bundesmarine vessels and helicopters have been harassed on at least two occasions by israeli warplanes . the incidents , played down by the israeli defense force -lrb- idf -rrb- and denied by the israeli ambassador to germany , shimon stein , raised questions about the wisdom of the deployment which was approved by the bundestag after a long period of soul-searching , prompted by germany 's history with israel . on the occasions when idf warplanes allegedly shot over the bows of a german surveillance ship in international waters and when bundesmarine helicopters were buzzed by jets , jung was reported to have telephoned with his israeli counterpart amir peretz to clarify the incidents and protest . israeli prime minister ehud olmert has since apologized to germany for the " misunderstandings " and highlighted the importance of the german forces ' participation in the international force deployed in lebanon . in recent days , germany and israel have agreed to review the level of military communication between the two nations in a bid to avoid further incidents or escalation . jung to discuss co-operation with israeli counterpart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung will meet israel 's defense minister amir peretz jung 's visit to tel aviv on friday is expected to include discussions with peretz on ways to improve cooperation in regard to policing lebanon which continues to live under a fragile ceasefire after the 34-day war between israel and hezbollah ended in august . before flying on to the israeli capital , jung will pay a visit to german troops deployed off the coast of lebanon and will then meet with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and defense minister elias murr . the visit comes at a time when jung himself is under growing pressure to resign after a series of gaffes and blunders which have infuriated not merely the opposition but also reportedly chancellor angela merkel . media reports say jung - a member of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - has drawn the wrath of his boss for supplying a faulty report on germany 's naval contribution to united nations forces in lebanon . defense minister 's blunders anger chancellor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was reportedly livid over jung 's gaffes merkel , quoting the defense ministry paper , publicly declared that german ships would be able to patrol inside of lebanese territorial waters within six miles from the coast .
" we can cruise in the entire area , " said the chancellor .
but in reality , lebanon 's government had demanded german ships stay outside the six-mile zone . merkel was reportedly livid after being corrected by german diplomats and military officials .
there are now accusations that she misled germany 's parliament to win approval for the mission . this debacle was followed by a series of other stumbles by jung . without informing the chancellor , jung announced at the weekend that germany planned to pull out some of its 850 troops serving with european union peacekeepers in bosnia-herzegovina . making matters even worse , he said this was necessary because german armed forces were badly overstretched - an implicit criticism of his own government recently voiced by the opposition greens .
germany currently has about 10,000 troops on foreign missions in the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan - out of a total of 253,000 active soldiers . the cabinet 's weakest link ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung 's appointment was not widely supported critics pounced on jung 's explanation and said cutting the 6,000-member eu force in bosnia-herzegovina could only be justified by the considerable political progress in the former yugoslav territory which was torn by a bloody civil war from 1992 to 1995 . jung 's response to the publication of ugly photos showing german troops in afghanistan posing with human skulls has also been criticized . the defense minister seemed to brush aside any responsibility by stressing he had not been in office when the pictures were taken . defense minister jung has always been viewed as one of the weakest members in the german cabinet .
his selection one year ago surprised observers given that he had almost no experience in military affairs other than having done military service back in the 1960s . jung appears to have been given the post largely because the powerful cdu premier of hesse state , roland koch , insisted he was the right man for the job . middle east visit to be jung 's last ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense minister 's foreign visits could soon end according to some , however , that may not be enough to save him .
opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- leaders predict jung will either resign or be forced from office . " i believe jung will be gone by christmas , " said fdp defense expert rainer stinner while dirk nibel , the fdp secretary general , appealed to jung to take responsibility for his failings and quit . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wants to pull troops out of bosnia from december berlin will begin gradually withdrawing its troops deployed with the international peacekeeping force in bosnia as early as december , german defense minister franz josef jung announced .
-lrb- 30.10.2006 -rrb- germany outraged by afghan skull photos , orders probe two soldiers were brought in for questioning after a newspaper published photographs of german troops posing with a human skull while on a tour of duty in afghanistan .
germany now fears reprisals against its troops .
-lrb- 25.10.2006 -rrb- israel issues apology for military " misunderstandings " german chancellor merkel spoke with israeli prime minister olmert to clear up " misunderstandings " regarding three incidents between the israeli air force and german ships patrolling the lebanese coast .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 01.11.2006 berlin smoking ban hoped to set example for rest of germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's smoke-filled cafes may be a thing of the past berlin 's local government wants a ground-breaking ban on smoking in the city 's public buildings as well as all bars and restaurants , reviving debate on outlawing smoking across the country . berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their designated coalition partners , the left party , said this week they are pressing ahead with plans to make the german capital smoke-free . " we 're planning a non-smoker protection bill , " said ingeborg junge-reyer , an spd leader in berlin and member of mayor wowereit 's cabinet , after a round of coalition talks .
she said the law could take effect as early as 2007 . " it will be a strict non-smoker protection bill .
i can well imagine a complete ban along the lines of italy or ireland , " junge-reyer said . a revolution until now , politicians in berlin have only spoken about legally outlawing smoking in public buildings and hospitals .
extending that ban to the german capital 's estimated 10,000 bars and restaurants is a new proposal and one that is likely to trigger much opposition in a country known for its tolerant attitude towards smoking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking goes hand in hand with going out in berlin one in three germans smoke , while berlin has the highest per-capita number .
most restaurants do not offer non-smoking sections .
the legislation , if passed , could indeed become something of a revolution in a country which has doggedly remained one of the last bastions for smokers in europe . it would also mark a sharp departure from the rest of germany 's federal states , which have to varying degrees resisted national restrictions on tobacco .
a previous effort to introduce a nationwide ban on smoking in restaurants , cafes and bars aimed at bringing germany into line with other european nations was blocked in september by chancellor angela merkel 's ruling conservatives . a working group made up of representatives from the spd , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as from the health and consumer protection ministry is currently exploring ways of introducing a germany-wide anti-smoking regulation . setting an example some hope that berlin will now lead the way for the rest of germany when it comes to curbing public smoking . " i hope that the other states will now realize that our fear of smoking bans is unjustified , " sabine bätzing , the federal drug commissioner , told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
berlin 's initiative is a " signal and support " for a nationwide regulation that 's urgently needed , bätzing added . carola reimann , a spokeswoman on health matters for the spd parliamentary group , also said she hoped " the capital will set an example " for the rest of germany .
" if berlin , with its thriving bar and restaurant scene , can take such a decision then it 's a signal that ca n't be overlooked , " reimann said . laws governing gastronomy and the hospitality industry are the prerogative of state governments in germany . last bastion for smokers many point out that germany 's liberal attitude to smoking is partly a reaction to nazi anti-smoking drives .
hitler is said to have donated money in 1941 to the world 's first institute dedicated to studying the dangers of tobacco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people pass over a no smoking sign in the madrid underground whatever the reason for germany 's determined resistance to anti-smoking bans , it remains the only country in the european union that has ignored and fought an eu ban on tobacco advertising . ireland imposed the world 's first nationwide public smoking ban in 2004 , followed by italy , sweden , scotland , norway and spain .
france said last month it would ban smoking in public places starting next year and in bars and clubs from 2008 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french impose smoking ban on cafes , restaurants french smokers will be headed outside as of february , when the country 's smoking ban takes effect in public places and extends to hotels , bars , restaurants and night clubs 11 months later .
-lrb- 09.10.2006 -rrb- government accused of bowing to tobacco lobby after announcing it will drop plans to enforce a full ban on smoking in restaurants , germany 's ruling coalition came under fire from the greens who accused the government of bowing to pressure from the tobacco lobby .
-lrb- 27.09.2006 -rrb- opinion : german smokers facing tough times protecting public health is the right thing to do , but the eu 's tobacco advertising ban is the wrong way to go about it , says dw 's karl zawadzky .

" we 're a couple of weeks into a pilot project that is testing technology designed to automatically detect terrorists or other criminals entering trains and alert security personnel , " jens puls , director of corporate security at deutsche bahn , announced at the systems it trade show in munich . the project comes on the heels of foiled attempts to bomb two german regional trains in july , puls pointed out .
german investigators have meanwhile learned that the terrorists had planned to bomb trains during the world cup soccer tournament in germany earlier this year but delayed their plans due to the country 's tight security measures during the competition .
in the deutsche bahn test in mainz , special cameras scan the train station in search of 200 people who have volunteered to have their pictures stored in a database and features detected by special biometric facial recognition software .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the software compares the faces of passersby with information stored in a database the technology could help deutsche bahn pinpoint suspected terrorists among the 1.8 million passengers who travel by train every day , and take action , according to puls .
genetic information in passports in november 2005 , the country introduced a new biometric passport , valid for 10 years , which includes an embedded rfid -lrb- radio frequency identification -rrb- chip .
initially , the chip will store a digital photo of the passport holder 's face .

in the first phase , the military should provide for internal and external security .
if you see how we do this today in our deployments , be it in bosnia , be it in iraq or afghanistan , these things are not coordinated enough . so , you 're saying that it 's not just the german government , it 's all the governments .
after all , germany is only involved in missions that are organized by others , such as nato , the eu or the united nations . absolutely .
this is not a thing that is unique to germany .
i saw this in all the nations , and if you read the book by mr. bob woodward on the campaign in iraq , you see that the americans are still struggling for a strategy , how to cope with the problems .
if you do n't do this at the very start , you have very many actors in the country who all try to do the best they can , but very often they contradict each other .
we had in kosovo , and still have , some 3,500 ngos -lrb- non-governmental organizations -rrb- and international organizations .
somehow this has to be brought together in some sort of synergistic approach for the well-being of the local population . what kind of strategy is needed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr needs to win the people 's confidence i think before we deploy into a country , the individual nations and the international community has to sit together and consider what we have to give to the country , with what means - as in personnel , medical and financial means - in order to make sure that in a bottom-up approach the conditions for the population are being met .
it 's not good enough in southern afghanistan only to fight the taliban and to be there with military forces if the living conditions for the people in all these villages are not being amended at the same time .
this has to go hand in glove , otherwise we lose the confidence of the people for whose sake we are deployed to that particular country . are you saying then that the german troops and the other troops in these missions are not fulfilling a useful function right now ? no , i 'm not saying that .
if you look at the balkans , the key function of the nato forces was to stop the war , to stop the killing , to stop the atrocities .
i think in this regard the forces did an excellent job and were very -lrb- much -rrb- welcomed by the people .
but all these terms like liberty and democracy and freedom do n't mean anything for the people as long as they do n't feel they are better off .
and if we can not guarantee - besides the stabilization of the internal situation , which has to be done by the military and the police forces - that the living conditions are improved , the military becomes an occupation force . there has been some criticism about the length of some of these missions , to the point that some feel that german troops go in but never come out .
what aspect is there in this strategy that tells you when the troops have to get out ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exit strategy should be part of the plan from the start this is a good question .
we have to establish criteria which have to be met and have to be supervised and if we have the feeling that these criteria are met to some extent , we can talk about pulling out the forces - as the germans try right now to do in bosnia-herzegovina where you have a local police , where you have some kind of local government and where you have some kind of local military forces which can take over these elements which were provided by the german contingent . michael lawton interviewed klaus reinhardt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts rethinking its foreign deployments german soldiers are engaged in eleven foreign missions .
but after a scandal with soldiers in afghanistan and fears that the military is overstretched , some want a reduction in the numbers of troops being sent abroad .
-lrb- 31.10.2006 -rrb- germany wants to pull troops out of bosnia from december berlin will begin gradually withdrawing its troops deployed with the international peacekeeping force in bosnia as early as december , german defense minister franz josef jung announced .

this has to go hand in glove , otherwise we lose the confidence of the people for whose sake we are deployed to that particular country . are you saying then that the german troops and the other troops in these missions are not fulfilling a useful function right now ? no , i 'm not saying that .
if you look at the balkans , the key function of the nato forces was to stop the war , to stop the killing , to stop the atrocities .
i think in this regard the forces did an excellent job and were very -lrb- much -rrb- welcomed by the people .
but all these terms like liberty and democracy and freedom do n't mean anything for the people as long as they do n't feel they are better off .
and if we can not guarantee - besides the stabilization of the internal situation , which has to be done by the military and the police forces - that the living conditions are improved , the military becomes an occupation force . there has been some criticism about the length of some of these missions , to the point that some feel that german troops go in but never come out .
what aspect is there in this strategy that tells you when the troops have to get out ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exit strategy should be part of the plan from the start this is a good question .
we have to establish criteria which have to be met and have to be supervised and if we have the feeling that these criteria are met to some extent , we can talk about pulling out the forces - as the germans try right now to do in bosnia-herzegovina where you have a local police , where you have some kind of local government and where you have some kind of local military forces which can take over these elements which were provided by the german contingent . michael lawton interviewed klaus reinhardt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts rethinking its foreign deployments german soldiers are engaged in eleven foreign missions .
but after a scandal with soldiers in afghanistan and fears that the military is overstretched , some want a reduction in the numbers of troops being sent abroad .
-lrb- 31.10.2006 -rrb- germany wants to pull troops out of bosnia from december berlin will begin gradually withdrawing its troops deployed with the international peacekeeping force in bosnia as early as december , german defense minister franz josef jung announced .
-lrb- 30.10.2006 -rrb- skull scandal raises questions about army training methods as the scandal over photographs of german soldiers desecrating a human skull in afghanistan widens , experts in germany are calling for a review of the army 's training methods .
audios and videos on the topic afghanistan remains dangerous terrain for peackeepers is the german army overstretched ?

but will the make-over help the event fend off fierce competition ? some 185 galleries from 28 different countries will be display their collections when the 40th edition of the annual art cologne fair opens its doors on wednesday .
organizers say they hope this year 's fair will attract 70,000 visitors . one of the highlights this year is the " open space " section , which is dedicated to up-and-coming young artists . " you need the next generation , " art cologne director gerard goodrow told dw-radio .
" we see this very clearly with both galleries and artists .
the potential of the next generation is a guarantee for the future since gallery owners and artists are always retiring , and collectors sometime stop buying in their later years . " the open space concentrates on installations .
but that 's not the only genre being featured at the fair . " there 's a trend toward sculpture , " goodrow said " but what we 're also seeing at art cologne is a new interest in works on paper - above all drawings . " in addition , this year 's fair includes a new section entitled " hidden treasures , " which is devoted to artists over the age of 40 whose works have yet to make the mark they deserve on the art market . productive self-questioning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hope the public will say " yes " to the new-look art fair founded in 1967 , art cologne was the world 's first art trade fair and has long been considered the most important event of its kind in germany .
but it 's suffered recently from competition from rival events in london , basel and berlin .
the number of galleries participating is down from 250 , and only three from the united states are in attendance . goodrow , who took over the fair in 2003 , has been trying to guide it out of a fallow period by emphasizing youth and innovation . " it 's something that we 've learned especially from young artists , gallery owners and collectors .
if you get too complacent , nothing happens and other cities like berlin and london gain in importance .
constantly calling yourself into question leads to innovation and progress . " in that avant-garde spirit , art cologne is staging a special showing of works by greek artist jannis kounellis .
born in 1936 , kounellis is considered a leading member of the arte povera movement .
one highlight of art cologne is a recreation of a famous kounellis installation from 1969 , consisting of 12 live horses chained to walls . art cologne 2006 runs through nov .

to the romantic ear , the german language might sound cumbersome and perfunctory , yet beyond its tonal harshness , it is as efficient as its native speakers are reputed to be .
but is that necessarily a good thing ? ever felt wearied by the world , angst at the thought of the future or completely drained of energy ? chances are you have , but will have had to fish around inarticulately for whole streams of words to describe your state of being .
not so in german , where words like weltschmerz -lrb- world-weariness -rrb- , zukunftsangst -lrb- fear of the future -rrb- , k reislaufkollaps -lrb- circulatory collapse -rrb- and morgenmuffel -lrb- a person who is grumpy in the morning -rrb- have their hard-earned places in the national lexicon .
where then , are our succinct english equivalents ?
the short answer is that there are none .
that language does not always translate tidily is no secret , but how is it that somewhere along the way , words which become an integral part of one language are deemed unnecessary in another .
ekkehard könig , a professor of linguistics at the freie university in berlin , says that language evolves to suit the needs of the people using it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afraid of the future ?
" if you gave a french man 50 euros , he would go out and spend it , whereas a german would put it in the bank , " he said .
words are created for concepts , for ideas which are important , and skepticism and a fear of the future are basic dispositions in this country . "
society creates what society needs but does the very existence of words such as zukunftsangst or weltschmerz , which so precisely describe the pains of life , work as an advertisement for more people to feel the same things ?
elizabeth couper-kuhlen , a professor of linguistics at potsdam university , says it is a chicken and egg situation .
" which came first ?
it is often said that if a language lacks a word , it is because the concept is less salient , and the more salient , the more central it is , the more likely there is to be a word for it , " the linguist said .
the debate over the power of language and words to influence the way people think and behave dates back decades , to the sapir-whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity .
and although that theory fell into disrepute in the mid-20th century , some anthropologists now believe that changes to language can bring about changes in people 's behavior .
with a chuckle , könig says that adding new and positive words such as zukunftsfreude -lrb- looking forward to the future -rrb- to the vernacular would be unlikely to change the german disposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not what you say , but how you say it couper-kuhlen believes there is a reflective relationship between language and society .
" you ca n't just change language and change society , but equally you ca n't change society without changing language , and the fact that certain words exist in a given language is a reflection of what is prevalent in that society , " she said .
" if people did not think and behave in a certain way , there may be no need for words like weltschmerz . "
building blocks the thing about the german language is that whilst it is systematic , it is also highly flexible , and wonderfully efficient .
it 's like a huge tub of " legos " offering endless opportunities for building words and concise means of self-expression .
weld together three completely unrelated words to make one new one which wastes not a single syllable in beating around the bush .
as albrecht plewnia of the institute for german language says , the composite nature of german makes it much easier to invent new words to clearly reflect the issues of the moment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : launching pad for new words " it 's so much easier to debate over a single word than over bits of a sentence , they work much better in headlines , " he said .
but there is a danger that banner headlines trumpeting negative new words will be picked up from the outside and given greater weight than they actually deserve .
" outsiders looking in often tend to think there is more behind german words than is the case , " plewnia said .
" in actual fact , we just have the words we need to describe the problems that exist .
the words are born out of a need to describe specific situations . "
and for the most part , they do it well .
so perhaps german is not always the most lyrical language out there , but there is definitely something to be said for just saying it like it is . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de non-german authors bridge cultures with books in german in france or england it would n't be politically correct to label authors by nationality instead of literary style .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 01.11.2006 berlin smoking ban hoped to set example for rest of germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's smoke-filled cafes may be a thing of the past berlin 's local government wants a ground-breaking ban on smoking in the city 's public buildings as well as all bars and restaurants , reviving debate on outlawing smoking across the country . berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their designated coalition partners , the left party , said this week they are pressing ahead with plans to make the german capital smoke-free . " we 're planning a non-smoker protection bill , " said ingeborg junge-reyer , an spd leader in berlin and member of mayor wowereit 's cabinet , after a round of coalition talks .
she said the law could take effect as early as 2007 . " it will be a strict non-smoker protection bill .
i can well imagine a complete ban along the lines of italy or ireland , " junge-reyer said . a revolution until now , politicians in berlin have only spoken about legally outlawing smoking in public buildings and hospitals .
extending that ban to the german capital 's estimated 10,000 bars and restaurants is a new proposal and one that is likely to trigger much opposition in a country known for its tolerant attitude towards smoking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking goes hand in hand with going out in berlin one in three germans smoke , while berlin has the highest per-capita number .
most restaurants do not offer non-smoking sections .
the legislation , if passed , could indeed become something of a revolution in a country which has doggedly remained one of the last bastions for smokers in europe . it would also mark a sharp departure from the rest of germany 's federal states , which have to varying degrees resisted national restrictions on tobacco .
a previous effort to introduce a nationwide ban on smoking in restaurants , cafes and bars aimed at bringing germany into line with other european nations was blocked in september by chancellor angela merkel 's ruling conservatives . a working group made up of representatives from the spd , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as from the health and consumer protection ministry is currently exploring ways of introducing a germany-wide anti-smoking regulation . setting an example some hope that berlin will now lead the way for the rest of germany when it comes to curbing public smoking . " i hope that the other states will now realize that our fear of smoking bans is unjustified , " sabine bätzing , the federal drug commissioner , told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
berlin 's initiative is a " signal and support " for a nationwide regulation that 's urgently needed , bätzing added . carola reimann , a spokeswoman on health matters for the spd parliamentary group , also said she hoped " the capital will set an example " for the rest of germany .
" if berlin , with its thriving bar and restaurant scene , can take such a decision then it 's a signal that ca n't be overlooked , " reimann said . laws governing gastronomy and the hospitality industry are the prerogative of state governments in germany . last bastion for smokers many point out that germany 's liberal attitude to smoking is partly a reaction to nazi anti-smoking drives .
hitler is said to have donated money in 1941 to the world 's first institute dedicated to studying the dangers of tobacco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people pass over a no smoking sign in the madrid underground whatever the reason for germany 's determined resistance to anti-smoking bans , it remains the only country in the european union that has ignored and fought an eu ban on tobacco advertising . ireland imposed the world 's first nationwide public smoking ban in 2004 , followed by italy , sweden , scotland , norway and spain .
france said last month it would ban smoking in public places starting next year and in bars and clubs from 2008 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french impose smoking ban on cafes , restaurants french smokers will be headed outside as of february , when the country 's smoking ban takes effect in public places and extends to hotels , bars , restaurants and night clubs 11 months later .

" we 're planning a non-smoker protection bill , " said ingeborg junge-reyer , an spd leader in berlin and member of mayor wowereit 's cabinet , after a round of coalition talks .
she said the law could take effect as early as 2007 . " it will be a strict non-smoker protection bill .
i can well imagine a complete ban along the lines of italy or ireland , " junge-reyer said . a revolution until now , politicians in berlin have only spoken about legally outlawing smoking in public buildings and hospitals .
extending that ban to the german capital 's estimated 10,000 bars and restaurants is a new proposal and one that is likely to trigger much opposition in a country known for its tolerant attitude towards smoking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking goes hand in hand with going out in berlin one in three germans smoke , while berlin has the highest per-capita number .
most restaurants do not offer non-smoking sections .
the legislation , if passed , could indeed become something of a revolution in a country which has doggedly remained one of the last bastions for smokers in europe . it would also mark a sharp departure from the rest of germany 's federal states , which have to varying degrees resisted national restrictions on tobacco .
a previous effort to introduce a nationwide ban on smoking in restaurants , cafes and bars aimed at bringing germany into line with other european nations was blocked in september by chancellor angela merkel 's ruling conservatives . a working group made up of representatives from the spd , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as from the health and consumer protection ministry is currently exploring ways of introducing a germany-wide anti-smoking regulation . setting an example some hope that berlin will now lead the way for the rest of germany when it comes to curbing public smoking . " i hope that the other states will now realize that our fear of smoking bans is unjustified , " sabine bätzing , the federal drug commissioner , told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
berlin 's initiative is a " signal and support " for a nationwide regulation that 's urgently needed , bätzing added . carola reimann , a spokeswoman on health matters for the spd parliamentary group , also said she hoped " the capital will set an example " for the rest of germany .
" if berlin , with its thriving bar and restaurant scene , can take such a decision then it 's a signal that ca n't be overlooked , " reimann said . laws governing gastronomy and the hospitality industry are the prerogative of state governments in germany . last bastion for smokers many point out that germany 's liberal attitude to smoking is partly a reaction to nazi anti-smoking drives .
hitler is said to have donated money in 1941 to the world 's first institute dedicated to studying the dangers of tobacco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people pass over a no smoking sign in the madrid underground whatever the reason for germany 's determined resistance to anti-smoking bans , it remains the only country in the european union that has ignored and fought an eu ban on tobacco advertising . ireland imposed the world 's first nationwide public smoking ban in 2004 , followed by italy , sweden , scotland , norway and spain .

in the first phase , the military should provide for internal and external security .
if you see how we do this today in our deployments , be it in bosnia , be it in iraq or afghanistan , these things are not coordinated enough . so , you 're saying that it 's not just the german government , it 's all the governments .
after all , germany is only involved in missions that are organized by others , such as nato , the eu or the united nations . absolutely .
this is not a thing that is unique to germany .
i saw this in all the nations , and if you read the book by mr. bob woodward on the campaign in iraq , you see that the americans are still struggling for a strategy , how to cope with the problems .
if you do n't do this at the very start , you have very many actors in the country who all try to do the best they can , but very often they contradict each other .
we had in kosovo , and still have , some 3,500 ngos -lrb- non-governmental organizations -rrb- and international organizations .
somehow this has to be brought together in some sort of synergistic approach for the well-being of the local population . what kind of strategy is needed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr needs to win the people 's confidence i think before we deploy into a country , the individual nations and the international community has to sit together and consider what we have to give to the country , with what means - as in personnel , medical and financial means - in order to make sure that in a bottom-up approach the conditions for the population are being met .
it 's not good enough in southern afghanistan only to fight the taliban and to be there with military forces if the living conditions for the people in all these villages are not being amended at the same time .
this has to go hand in glove , otherwise we lose the confidence of the people for whose sake we are deployed to that particular country . are you saying then that the german troops and the other troops in these missions are not fulfilling a useful function right now ? no , i 'm not saying that .
if you look at the balkans , the key function of the nato forces was to stop the war , to stop the killing , to stop the atrocities .
i think in this regard the forces did an excellent job and were very -lrb- much -rrb- welcomed by the people .
but all these terms like liberty and democracy and freedom do n't mean anything for the people as long as they do n't feel they are better off .
and if we can not guarantee - besides the stabilization of the internal situation , which has to be done by the military and the police forces - that the living conditions are improved , the military becomes an occupation force . there has been some criticism about the length of some of these missions , to the point that some feel that german troops go in but never come out .
what aspect is there in this strategy that tells you when the troops have to get out ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exit strategy should be part of the plan from the start this is a good question .
we have to establish criteria which have to be met and have to be supervised and if we have the feeling that these criteria are met to some extent , we can talk about pulling out the forces - as the germans try right now to do in bosnia-herzegovina where you have a local police , where you have some kind of local government and where you have some kind of local military forces which can take over these elements which were provided by the german contingent . michael lawton interviewed klaus reinhardt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts rethinking its foreign deployments german soldiers are engaged in eleven foreign missions .
but after a scandal with soldiers in afghanistan and fears that the military is overstretched , some want a reduction in the numbers of troops being sent abroad .
-lrb- 31.10.2006 -rrb- germany wants to pull troops out of bosnia from december berlin will begin gradually withdrawing its troops deployed with the international peacekeeping force in bosnia as early as december , german defense minister franz josef jung announced .
-lrb- 30.10.2006 -rrb- skull scandal raises questions about army training methods as the scandal over photographs of german soldiers desecrating a human skull in afghanistan widens , experts in germany are calling for a review of the army 's training methods .

after all , germany is only involved in missions that are organized by others , such as nato , the eu or the united nations . absolutely .
this is not a thing that is unique to germany .
i saw this in all the nations , and if you read the book by mr. bob woodward on the campaign in iraq , you see that the americans are still struggling for a strategy , how to cope with the problems .

it 's not good enough in southern afghanistan only to fight the taliban and to be there with military forces if the living conditions for the people in all these villages are not being amended at the same time .
this has to go hand in glove , otherwise we lose the confidence of the people for whose sake we are deployed to that particular country . are you saying then that the german troops and the other troops in these missions are not fulfilling a useful function right now ? no , i 'm not saying that .
if you look at the balkans , the key function of the nato forces was to stop the war , to stop the killing , to stop the atrocities .
i think in this regard the forces did an excellent job and were very -lrb- much -rrb- welcomed by the people .
but all these terms like liberty and democracy and freedom do n't mean anything for the people as long as they do n't feel they are better off .
and if we can not guarantee - besides the stabilization of the internal situation , which has to be done by the military and the police forces - that the living conditions are improved , the military becomes an occupation force . there has been some criticism about the length of some of these missions , to the point that some feel that german troops go in but never come out .

" we 're planning a non-smoker protection bill , " said ingeborg junge-reyer , an spd leader in berlin and member of mayor wowereit 's cabinet , after a round of coalition talks .
she said the law could take effect as early as 2007 . " it will be a strict non-smoker protection bill .

extending that ban to the german capital 's estimated 10,000 bars and restaurants is a new proposal and one that is likely to trigger much opposition in a country known for its tolerant attitude towards smoking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking goes hand in hand with going out in berlin one in three germans smoke , while berlin has the highest per-capita number .
most restaurants do not offer non-smoking sections .
the legislation , if passed , could indeed become something of a revolution in a country which has doggedly remained one of the last bastions for smokers in europe . it would also mark a sharp departure from the rest of germany 's federal states , which have to varying degrees resisted national restrictions on tobacco .
a previous effort to introduce a nationwide ban on smoking in restaurants , cafes and bars aimed at bringing germany into line with other european nations was blocked in september by chancellor angela merkel 's ruling conservatives . a working group made up of representatives from the spd , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as from the health and consumer protection ministry is currently exploring ways of introducing a germany-wide anti-smoking regulation . setting an example some hope that berlin will now lead the way for the rest of germany when it comes to curbing public smoking . " i hope that the other states will now realize that our fear of smoking bans is unjustified , " sabine bätzing , the federal drug commissioner , told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
berlin 's initiative is a " signal and support " for a nationwide regulation that 's urgently needed , bätzing added . carola reimann , a spokeswoman on health matters for the spd parliamentary group , also said she hoped " the capital will set an example " for the rest of germany .
" if berlin , with its thriving bar and restaurant scene , can take such a decision then it 's a signal that ca n't be overlooked , " reimann said . laws governing gastronomy and the hospitality industry are the prerogative of state governments in germany . last bastion for smokers many point out that germany 's liberal attitude to smoking is partly a reaction to nazi anti-smoking drives .
hitler is said to have donated money in 1941 to the world 's first institute dedicated to studying the dangers of tobacco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people pass over a no smoking sign in the madrid underground whatever the reason for germany 's determined resistance to anti-smoking bans , it remains the only country in the european union that has ignored and fought an eu ban on tobacco advertising . ireland imposed the world 's first nationwide public smoking ban in 2004 , followed by italy , sweden , scotland , norway and spain .

in the first phase , the military should provide for internal and external security .
if you see how we do this today in our deployments , be it in bosnia , be it in iraq or afghanistan , these things are not coordinated enough . so , you 're saying that it 's not just the german government , it 's all the governments .
after all , germany is only involved in missions that are organized by others , such as nato , the eu or the united nations . absolutely .
this is not a thing that is unique to germany .
i saw this in all the nations , and if you read the book by mr. bob woodward on the campaign in iraq , you see that the americans are still struggling for a strategy , how to cope with the problems .

since taking over the responsibility from the italian navy of stopping illegal arms reaching the shiite hezbollah militia , the bundesmarine vessels and helicopters have been harassed on at least two occasions by israeli warplanes . the incidents , played down by the israeli defense force -lrb- idf -rrb- and denied by the israeli ambassador to germany , shimon stein , raised questions about the wisdom of the deployment which was approved by the bundestag after a long period of soul-searching , prompted by germany 's history with israel . on the occasions when idf warplanes allegedly shot over the bows of a german surveillance ship in international waters and when bundesmarine helicopters were buzzed by jets , jung was reported to have telephoned with his israeli counterpart amir peretz to clarify the incidents and protest . israeli prime minister ehud olmert has since apologized to germany for the " misunderstandings " and highlighted the importance of the german forces ' participation in the international force deployed in lebanon . in recent days , germany and israel have agreed to review the level of military communication between the two nations in a bid to avoid further incidents or escalation . jung to discuss co-operation with israeli counterpart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung will meet israel 's defense minister amir peretz jung 's visit to tel aviv on friday is expected to include discussions with peretz on ways to improve cooperation in regard to policing lebanon which continues to live under a fragile ceasefire after the 34-day war between israel and hezbollah ended in august . before flying on to the israeli capital , jung will pay a visit to german troops deployed off the coast of lebanon and will then meet with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and defense minister elias murr . the visit comes at a time when jung himself is under growing pressure to resign after a series of gaffes and blunders which have infuriated not merely the opposition but also reportedly chancellor angela merkel . media reports say jung - a member of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - has drawn the wrath of his boss for supplying a faulty report on germany 's naval contribution to united nations forces in lebanon . defense minister 's blunders anger chancellor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was reportedly livid over jung 's gaffes merkel , quoting the defense ministry paper , publicly declared that german ships would be able to patrol inside of lebanese territorial waters within six miles from the coast .
" we can cruise in the entire area , " said the chancellor .
but in reality , lebanon 's government had demanded german ships stay outside the six-mile zone . merkel was reportedly livid after being corrected by german diplomats and military officials .
there are now accusations that she misled germany 's parliament to win approval for the mission . this debacle was followed by a series of other stumbles by jung . without informing the chancellor , jung announced at the weekend that germany planned to pull out some of its 850 troops serving with european union peacekeepers in bosnia-herzegovina . making matters even worse , he said this was necessary because german armed forces were badly overstretched - an implicit criticism of his own government recently voiced by the opposition greens .
germany currently has about 10,000 troops on foreign missions in the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan - out of a total of 253,000 active soldiers . the cabinet 's weakest link ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung 's appointment was not widely supported critics pounced on jung 's explanation and said cutting the 6,000-member eu force in bosnia-herzegovina could only be justified by the considerable political progress in the former yugoslav territory which was torn by a bloody civil war from 1992 to 1995 . jung 's response to the publication of ugly photos showing german troops in afghanistan posing with human skulls has also been criticized . the defense minister seemed to brush aside any responsibility by stressing he had not been in office when the pictures were taken . defense minister jung has always been viewed as one of the weakest members in the german cabinet .
his selection one year ago surprised observers given that he had almost no experience in military affairs other than having done military service back in the 1960s . jung appears to have been given the post largely because the powerful cdu premier of hesse state , roland koch , insisted he was the right man for the job . middle east visit to be jung 's last ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense minister 's foreign visits could soon end according to some , however , that may not be enough to save him .
opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- leaders predict jung will either resign or be forced from office . " i believe jung will be gone by christmas , " said fdp defense expert rainer stinner while dirk nibel , the fdp secretary general , appealed to jung to take responsibility for his failings and quit . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wants to pull troops out of bosnia from december berlin will begin gradually withdrawing its troops deployed with the international peacekeeping force in bosnia as early as december , german defense minister franz josef jung announced .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on culture german theatre group stages karl marx with a twist wall of light could take place of berlin wall 18th century salons back in fashion in berlin japanese manga made in germany language -pipe- 01.11.2006 spreading the word the german way großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : make a word , any word ...
to the romantic ear , the german language might sound cumbersome and perfunctory , yet beyond its tonal harshness , it is as efficient as its native speakers are reputed to be .
but is that necessarily a good thing ? ever felt wearied by the world , angst at the thought of the future or completely drained of energy ? chances are you have , but will have had to fish around inarticulately for whole streams of words to describe your state of being .
not so in german , where words like weltschmerz -lrb- world-weariness -rrb- , zukunftsangst -lrb- fear of the future -rrb- , k reislaufkollaps -lrb- circulatory collapse -rrb- and morgenmuffel -lrb- a person who is grumpy in the morning -rrb- have their hard-earned places in the national lexicon .
where then , are our succinct english equivalents ?
the short answer is that there are none .
that language does not always translate tidily is no secret , but how is it that somewhere along the way , words which become an integral part of one language are deemed unnecessary in another .
ekkehard könig , a professor of linguistics at the freie university in berlin , says that language evolves to suit the needs of the people using it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afraid of the future ?
" if you gave a french man 50 euros , he would go out and spend it , whereas a german would put it in the bank , " he said .
words are created for concepts , for ideas which are important , and skepticism and a fear of the future are basic dispositions in this country . "
society creates what society needs but does the very existence of words such as zukunftsangst or weltschmerz , which so precisely describe the pains of life , work as an advertisement for more people to feel the same things ?
elizabeth couper-kuhlen , a professor of linguistics at potsdam university , says it is a chicken and egg situation .
" which came first ?
it is often said that if a language lacks a word , it is because the concept is less salient , and the more salient , the more central it is , the more likely there is to be a word for it , " the linguist said .
the debate over the power of language and words to influence the way people think and behave dates back decades , to the sapir-whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity .
and although that theory fell into disrepute in the mid-20th century , some anthropologists now believe that changes to language can bring about changes in people 's behavior .
with a chuckle , könig says that adding new and positive words such as zukunftsfreude -lrb- looking forward to the future -rrb- to the vernacular would be unlikely to change the german disposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not what you say , but how you say it couper-kuhlen believes there is a reflective relationship between language and society .
" you ca n't just change language and change society , but equally you ca n't change society without changing language , and the fact that certain words exist in a given language is a reflection of what is prevalent in that society , " she said .
" if people did not think and behave in a certain way , there may be no need for words like weltschmerz . "
building blocks the thing about the german language is that whilst it is systematic , it is also highly flexible , and wonderfully efficient .
it 's like a huge tub of " legos " offering endless opportunities for building words and concise means of self-expression .
weld together three completely unrelated words to make one new one which wastes not a single syllable in beating around the bush .
as albrecht plewnia of the institute for german language says , the composite nature of german makes it much easier to invent new words to clearly reflect the issues of the moment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : launching pad for new words " it 's so much easier to debate over a single word than over bits of a sentence , they work much better in headlines , " he said .
but there is a danger that banner headlines trumpeting negative new words will be picked up from the outside and given greater weight than they actually deserve .
" outsiders looking in often tend to think there is more behind german words than is the case , " plewnia said .
" in actual fact , we just have the words we need to describe the problems that exist .
the words are born out of a need to describe specific situations . "
and for the most part , they do it well .
so perhaps german is not always the most lyrical language out there , but there is definitely something to be said for just saying it like it is . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de non-german authors bridge cultures with books in german in france or england it would n't be politically correct to label authors by nationality instead of literary style .

the short answer is that there are none .
that language does not always translate tidily is no secret , but how is it that somewhere along the way , words which become an integral part of one language are deemed unnecessary in another .

" if you gave a french man 50 euros , he would go out and spend it , whereas a german would put it in the bank , " he said .

society creates what society needs but does the very existence of words such as zukunftsangst or weltschmerz , which so precisely describe the pains of life , work as an advertisement for more people to feel the same things ?
elizabeth couper-kuhlen , a professor of linguistics at potsdam university , says it is a chicken and egg situation .
" which came first ?
it is often said that if a language lacks a word , it is because the concept is less salient , and the more salient , the more central it is , the more likely there is to be a word for it , " the linguist said .
the debate over the power of language and words to influence the way people think and behave dates back decades , to the sapir-whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity .
and although that theory fell into disrepute in the mid-20th century , some anthropologists now believe that changes to language can bring about changes in people 's behavior .
with a chuckle , könig says that adding new and positive words such as zukunftsfreude -lrb- looking forward to the future -rrb- to the vernacular would be unlikely to change the german disposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not what you say , but how you say it couper-kuhlen believes there is a reflective relationship between language and society .
" you ca n't just change language and change society , but equally you ca n't change society without changing language , and the fact that certain words exist in a given language is a reflection of what is prevalent in that society , " she said .
" if people did not think and behave in a certain way , there may be no need for words like weltschmerz . "

since taking over the responsibility from the italian navy of stopping illegal arms reaching the shiite hezbollah militia , the bundesmarine vessels and helicopters have been harassed on at least two occasions by israeli warplanes . the incidents , played down by the israeli defense force -lrb- idf -rrb- and denied by the israeli ambassador to germany , shimon stein , raised questions about the wisdom of the deployment which was approved by the bundestag after a long period of soul-searching , prompted by germany 's history with israel . on the occasions when idf warplanes allegedly shot over the bows of a german surveillance ship in international waters and when bundesmarine helicopters were buzzed by jets , jung was reported to have telephoned with his israeli counterpart amir peretz to clarify the incidents and protest . israeli prime minister ehud olmert has since apologized to germany for the " misunderstandings " and highlighted the importance of the german forces ' participation in the international force deployed in lebanon . in recent days , germany and israel have agreed to review the level of military communication between the two nations in a bid to avoid further incidents or escalation . jung to discuss co-operation with israeli counterpart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung will meet israel 's defense minister amir peretz jung 's visit to tel aviv on friday is expected to include discussions with peretz on ways to improve cooperation in regard to policing lebanon which continues to live under a fragile ceasefire after the 34-day war between israel and hezbollah ended in august . before flying on to the israeli capital , jung will pay a visit to german troops deployed off the coast of lebanon and will then meet with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and defense minister elias murr . the visit comes at a time when jung himself is under growing pressure to resign after a series of gaffes and blunders which have infuriated not merely the opposition but also reportedly chancellor angela merkel . media reports say jung - a member of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - has drawn the wrath of his boss for supplying a faulty report on germany 's naval contribution to united nations forces in lebanon . defense minister 's blunders anger chancellor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was reportedly livid over jung 's gaffes merkel , quoting the defense ministry paper , publicly declared that german ships would be able to patrol inside of lebanese territorial waters within six miles from the coast .
" we can cruise in the entire area , " said the chancellor .
but in reality , lebanon 's government had demanded german ships stay outside the six-mile zone . merkel was reportedly livid after being corrected by german diplomats and military officials .
there are now accusations that she misled germany 's parliament to win approval for the mission . this debacle was followed by a series of other stumbles by jung . without informing the chancellor , jung announced at the weekend that germany planned to pull out some of its 850 troops serving with european union peacekeepers in bosnia-herzegovina . making matters even worse , he said this was necessary because german armed forces were badly overstretched - an implicit criticism of his own government recently voiced by the opposition greens .
germany currently has about 10,000 troops on foreign missions in the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan - out of a total of 253,000 active soldiers . the cabinet 's weakest link ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung 's appointment was not widely supported critics pounced on jung 's explanation and said cutting the 6,000-member eu force in bosnia-herzegovina could only be justified by the considerable political progress in the former yugoslav territory which was torn by a bloody civil war from 1992 to 1995 . jung 's response to the publication of ugly photos showing german troops in afghanistan posing with human skulls has also been criticized . the defense minister seemed to brush aside any responsibility by stressing he had not been in office when the pictures were taken . defense minister jung has always been viewed as one of the weakest members in the german cabinet .
his selection one year ago surprised observers given that he had almost no experience in military affairs other than having done military service back in the 1960s . jung appears to have been given the post largely because the powerful cdu premier of hesse state , roland koch , insisted he was the right man for the job . middle east visit to be jung 's last ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense minister 's foreign visits could soon end according to some , however , that may not be enough to save him .
opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- leaders predict jung will either resign or be forced from office . " i believe jung will be gone by christmas , " said fdp defense expert rainer stinner while dirk nibel , the fdp secretary general , appealed to jung to take responsibility for his failings and quit . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wants to pull troops out of bosnia from december berlin will begin gradually withdrawing its troops deployed with the international peacekeeping force in bosnia as early as december , german defense minister franz josef jung announced .

germany now fears reprisals against its troops .

in the first phase , the military should provide for internal and external security .
if you see how we do this today in our deployments , be it in bosnia , be it in iraq or afghanistan , these things are not coordinated enough . so , you 're saying that it 's not just the german government , it 's all the governments .
after all , germany is only involved in missions that are organized by others , such as nato , the eu or the united nations . absolutely .
this is not a thing that is unique to germany .
i saw this in all the nations , and if you read the book by mr. bob woodward on the campaign in iraq , you see that the americans are still struggling for a strategy , how to cope with the problems .
if you do n't do this at the very start , you have very many actors in the country who all try to do the best they can , but very often they contradict each other .
we had in kosovo , and still have , some 3,500 ngos -lrb- non-governmental organizations -rrb- and international organizations .
somehow this has to be brought together in some sort of synergistic approach for the well-being of the local population . what kind of strategy is needed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr needs to win the people 's confidence i think before we deploy into a country , the individual nations and the international community has to sit together and consider what we have to give to the country , with what means - as in personnel , medical and financial means - in order to make sure that in a bottom-up approach the conditions for the population are being met .
it 's not good enough in southern afghanistan only to fight the taliban and to be there with military forces if the living conditions for the people in all these villages are not being amended at the same time .
this has to go hand in glove , otherwise we lose the confidence of the people for whose sake we are deployed to that particular country . are you saying then that the german troops and the other troops in these missions are not fulfilling a useful function right now ? no , i 'm not saying that .
if you look at the balkans , the key function of the nato forces was to stop the war , to stop the killing , to stop the atrocities .
i think in this regard the forces did an excellent job and were very -lrb- much -rrb- welcomed by the people .
but all these terms like liberty and democracy and freedom do n't mean anything for the people as long as they do n't feel they are better off .
and if we can not guarantee - besides the stabilization of the internal situation , which has to be done by the military and the police forces - that the living conditions are improved , the military becomes an occupation force . there has been some criticism about the length of some of these missions , to the point that some feel that german troops go in but never come out .
what aspect is there in this strategy that tells you when the troops have to get out ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exit strategy should be part of the plan from the start this is a good question .
we have to establish criteria which have to be met and have to be supervised and if we have the feeling that these criteria are met to some extent , we can talk about pulling out the forces - as the germans try right now to do in bosnia-herzegovina where you have a local police , where you have some kind of local government and where you have some kind of local military forces which can take over these elements which were provided by the german contingent . michael lawton interviewed klaus reinhardt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts rethinking its foreign deployments german soldiers are engaged in eleven foreign missions .

in the first phase , the military should provide for internal and external security .
if you see how we do this today in our deployments , be it in bosnia , be it in iraq or afghanistan , these things are not coordinated enough . so , you 're saying that it 's not just the german government , it 's all the governments .
after all , germany is only involved in missions that are organized by others , such as nato , the eu or the united nations . absolutely .
this is not a thing that is unique to germany .
i saw this in all the nations , and if you read the book by mr. bob woodward on the campaign in iraq , you see that the americans are still struggling for a strategy , how to cope with the problems .
if you do n't do this at the very start , you have very many actors in the country who all try to do the best they can , but very often they contradict each other .
we had in kosovo , and still have , some 3,500 ngos -lrb- non-governmental organizations -rrb- and international organizations .
somehow this has to be brought together in some sort of synergistic approach for the well-being of the local population . what kind of strategy is needed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr needs to win the people 's confidence i think before we deploy into a country , the individual nations and the international community has to sit together and consider what we have to give to the country , with what means - as in personnel , medical and financial means - in order to make sure that in a bottom-up approach the conditions for the population are being met .
it 's not good enough in southern afghanistan only to fight the taliban and to be there with military forces if the living conditions for the people in all these villages are not being amended at the same time .
this has to go hand in glove , otherwise we lose the confidence of the people for whose sake we are deployed to that particular country . are you saying then that the german troops and the other troops in these missions are not fulfilling a useful function right now ? no , i 'm not saying that .
if you look at the balkans , the key function of the nato forces was to stop the war , to stop the killing , to stop the atrocities .
i think in this regard the forces did an excellent job and were very -lrb- much -rrb- welcomed by the people .
but all these terms like liberty and democracy and freedom do n't mean anything for the people as long as they do n't feel they are better off .
and if we can not guarantee - besides the stabilization of the internal situation , which has to be done by the military and the police forces - that the living conditions are improved , the military becomes an occupation force . there has been some criticism about the length of some of these missions , to the point that some feel that german troops go in but never come out .
what aspect is there in this strategy that tells you when the troops have to get out ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exit strategy should be part of the plan from the start this is a good question .
we have to establish criteria which have to be met and have to be supervised and if we have the feeling that these criteria are met to some extent , we can talk about pulling out the forces - as the germans try right now to do in bosnia-herzegovina where you have a local police , where you have some kind of local government and where you have some kind of local military forces which can take over these elements which were provided by the german contingent . michael lawton interviewed klaus reinhardt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts rethinking its foreign deployments german soldiers are engaged in eleven foreign missions .
but after a scandal with soldiers in afghanistan and fears that the military is overstretched , some want a reduction in the numbers of troops being sent abroad .
-lrb- 31.10.2006 -rrb- germany wants to pull troops out of bosnia from december berlin will begin gradually withdrawing its troops deployed with the international peacekeeping force in bosnia as early as december , german defense minister franz josef jung announced .
-lrb- 30.10.2006 -rrb- skull scandal raises questions about army training methods as the scandal over photographs of german soldiers desecrating a human skull in afghanistan widens , experts in germany are calling for a review of the army 's training methods .

to the romantic ear , the german language might sound cumbersome and perfunctory , yet beyond its tonal harshness , it is as efficient as its native speakers are reputed to be .

that language does not always translate tidily is no secret , but how is it that somewhere along the way , words which become an integral part of one language are deemed unnecessary in another .

society creates what society needs but does the very existence of words such as zukunftsangst or weltschmerz , which so precisely describe the pains of life , work as an advertisement for more people to feel the same things ?

" which came first ?
it is often said that if a language lacks a word , it is because the concept is less salient , and the more salient , the more central it is , the more likely there is to be a word for it , " the linguist said .
the debate over the power of language and words to influence the way people think and behave dates back decades , to the sapir-whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity .
and although that theory fell into disrepute in the mid-20th century , some anthropologists now believe that changes to language can bring about changes in people 's behavior .
with a chuckle , könig says that adding new and positive words such as zukunftsfreude -lrb- looking forward to the future -rrb- to the vernacular would be unlikely to change the german disposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not what you say , but how you say it couper-kuhlen believes there is a reflective relationship between language and society .
" you ca n't just change language and change society , but equally you ca n't change society without changing language , and the fact that certain words exist in a given language is a reflection of what is prevalent in that society , " she said .
" if people did not think and behave in a certain way , there may be no need for words like weltschmerz . "

but will the make-over help the event fend off fierce competition ? some 185 galleries from 28 different countries will be display their collections when the 40th edition of the annual art cologne fair opens its doors on wednesday .
organizers say they hope this year 's fair will attract 70,000 visitors . one of the highlights this year is the " open space " section , which is dedicated to up-and-coming young artists . " you need the next generation , " art cologne director gerard goodrow told dw-radio .
" we see this very clearly with both galleries and artists .
the potential of the next generation is a guarantee for the future since gallery owners and artists are always retiring , and collectors sometime stop buying in their later years . " the open space concentrates on installations .
but that 's not the only genre being featured at the fair . " there 's a trend toward sculpture , " goodrow said " but what we 're also seeing at art cologne is a new interest in works on paper - above all drawings . " in addition , this year 's fair includes a new section entitled " hidden treasures , " which is devoted to artists over the age of 40 whose works have yet to make the mark they deserve on the art market . productive self-questioning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hope the public will say " yes " to the new-look art fair founded in 1967 , art cologne was the world 's first art trade fair and has long been considered the most important event of its kind in germany .
but it 's suffered recently from competition from rival events in london , basel and berlin .
the number of galleries participating is down from 250 , and only three from the united states are in attendance . goodrow , who took over the fair in 2003 , has been trying to guide it out of a fallow period by emphasizing youth and innovation . " it 's something that we 've learned especially from young artists , gallery owners and collectors .
if you get too complacent , nothing happens and other cities like berlin and london gain in importance .

" we 're planning a non-smoker protection bill , " said ingeborg junge-reyer , an spd leader in berlin and member of mayor wowereit 's cabinet , after a round of coalition talks .
she said the law could take effect as early as 2007 . " it will be a strict non-smoker protection bill .
i can well imagine a complete ban along the lines of italy or ireland , " junge-reyer said . a revolution until now , politicians in berlin have only spoken about legally outlawing smoking in public buildings and hospitals .
extending that ban to the german capital 's estimated 10,000 bars and restaurants is a new proposal and one that is likely to trigger much opposition in a country known for its tolerant attitude towards smoking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking goes hand in hand with going out in berlin one in three germans smoke , while berlin has the highest per-capita number .
most restaurants do not offer non-smoking sections .
the legislation , if passed , could indeed become something of a revolution in a country which has doggedly remained one of the last bastions for smokers in europe . it would also mark a sharp departure from the rest of germany 's federal states , which have to varying degrees resisted national restrictions on tobacco .
a previous effort to introduce a nationwide ban on smoking in restaurants , cafes and bars aimed at bringing germany into line with other european nations was blocked in september by chancellor angela merkel 's ruling conservatives . a working group made up of representatives from the spd , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as from the health and consumer protection ministry is currently exploring ways of introducing a germany-wide anti-smoking regulation . setting an example some hope that berlin will now lead the way for the rest of germany when it comes to curbing public smoking . " i hope that the other states will now realize that our fear of smoking bans is unjustified , " sabine bätzing , the federal drug commissioner , told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
berlin 's initiative is a " signal and support " for a nationwide regulation that 's urgently needed , bätzing added . carola reimann , a spokeswoman on health matters for the spd parliamentary group , also said she hoped " the capital will set an example " for the rest of germany .
" if berlin , with its thriving bar and restaurant scene , can take such a decision then it 's a signal that ca n't be overlooked , " reimann said . laws governing gastronomy and the hospitality industry are the prerogative of state governments in germany . last bastion for smokers many point out that germany 's liberal attitude to smoking is partly a reaction to nazi anti-smoking drives .
hitler is said to have donated money in 1941 to the world 's first institute dedicated to studying the dangers of tobacco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people pass over a no smoking sign in the madrid underground whatever the reason for germany 's determined resistance to anti-smoking bans , it remains the only country in the european union that has ignored and fought an eu ban on tobacco advertising . ireland imposed the world 's first nationwide public smoking ban in 2004 , followed by italy , sweden , scotland , norway and spain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 01.11.2006 berlin smoking ban hoped to set example for rest of germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's smoke-filled cafes may be a thing of the past berlin 's local government wants a ground-breaking ban on smoking in the city 's public buildings as well as all bars and restaurants , reviving debate on outlawing smoking across the country . berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their designated coalition partners , the left party , said this week they are pressing ahead with plans to make the german capital smoke-free . " we 're planning a non-smoker protection bill , " said ingeborg junge-reyer , an spd leader in berlin and member of mayor wowereit 's cabinet , after a round of coalition talks .
she said the law could take effect as early as 2007 . " it will be a strict non-smoker protection bill .
i can well imagine a complete ban along the lines of italy or ireland , " junge-reyer said . a revolution until now , politicians in berlin have only spoken about legally outlawing smoking in public buildings and hospitals .
extending that ban to the german capital 's estimated 10,000 bars and restaurants is a new proposal and one that is likely to trigger much opposition in a country known for its tolerant attitude towards smoking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking goes hand in hand with going out in berlin one in three germans smoke , while berlin has the highest per-capita number .
most restaurants do not offer non-smoking sections .
the legislation , if passed , could indeed become something of a revolution in a country which has doggedly remained one of the last bastions for smokers in europe . it would also mark a sharp departure from the rest of germany 's federal states , which have to varying degrees resisted national restrictions on tobacco .
a previous effort to introduce a nationwide ban on smoking in restaurants , cafes and bars aimed at bringing germany into line with other european nations was blocked in september by chancellor angela merkel 's ruling conservatives . a working group made up of representatives from the spd , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as from the health and consumer protection ministry is currently exploring ways of introducing a germany-wide anti-smoking regulation . setting an example some hope that berlin will now lead the way for the rest of germany when it comes to curbing public smoking . " i hope that the other states will now realize that our fear of smoking bans is unjustified , " sabine bätzing , the federal drug commissioner , told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
berlin 's initiative is a " signal and support " for a nationwide regulation that 's urgently needed , bätzing added . carola reimann , a spokeswoman on health matters for the spd parliamentary group , also said she hoped " the capital will set an example " for the rest of germany .
" if berlin , with its thriving bar and restaurant scene , can take such a decision then it 's a signal that ca n't be overlooked , " reimann said . laws governing gastronomy and the hospitality industry are the prerogative of state governments in germany . last bastion for smokers many point out that germany 's liberal attitude to smoking is partly a reaction to nazi anti-smoking drives .
hitler is said to have donated money in 1941 to the world 's first institute dedicated to studying the dangers of tobacco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people pass over a no smoking sign in the madrid underground whatever the reason for germany 's determined resistance to anti-smoking bans , it remains the only country in the european union that has ignored and fought an eu ban on tobacco advertising . ireland imposed the world 's first nationwide public smoking ban in 2004 , followed by italy , sweden , scotland , norway and spain .
france said last month it would ban smoking in public places starting next year and in bars and clubs from 2008 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french impose smoking ban on cafes , restaurants french smokers will be headed outside as of february , when the country 's smoking ban takes effect in public places and extends to hotels , bars , restaurants and night clubs 11 months later .

" we 're a couple of weeks into a pilot project that is testing technology designed to automatically detect terrorists or other criminals entering trains and alert security personnel , " jens puls , director of corporate security at deutsche bahn , announced at the systems it trade show in munich . the project comes on the heels of foiled attempts to bomb two german regional trains in july , puls pointed out .
german investigators have meanwhile learned that the terrorists had planned to bomb trains during the world cup soccer tournament in germany earlier this year but delayed their plans due to the country 's tight security measures during the competition .

" we 're planning a non-smoker protection bill , " said ingeborg junge-reyer , an spd leader in berlin and member of mayor wowereit 's cabinet , after a round of coalition talks .
she said the law could take effect as early as 2007 . " it will be a strict non-smoker protection bill .
i can well imagine a complete ban along the lines of italy or ireland , " junge-reyer said . a revolution until now , politicians in berlin have only spoken about legally outlawing smoking in public buildings and hospitals .
extending that ban to the german capital 's estimated 10,000 bars and restaurants is a new proposal and one that is likely to trigger much opposition in a country known for its tolerant attitude towards smoking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking goes hand in hand with going out in berlin one in three germans smoke , while berlin has the highest per-capita number .
most restaurants do not offer non-smoking sections .
the legislation , if passed , could indeed become something of a revolution in a country which has doggedly remained one of the last bastions for smokers in europe . it would also mark a sharp departure from the rest of germany 's federal states , which have to varying degrees resisted national restrictions on tobacco .
a previous effort to introduce a nationwide ban on smoking in restaurants , cafes and bars aimed at bringing germany into line with other european nations was blocked in september by chancellor angela merkel 's ruling conservatives . a working group made up of representatives from the spd , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as from the health and consumer protection ministry is currently exploring ways of introducing a germany-wide anti-smoking regulation . setting an example some hope that berlin will now lead the way for the rest of germany when it comes to curbing public smoking . " i hope that the other states will now realize that our fear of smoking bans is unjustified , " sabine bätzing , the federal drug commissioner , told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
berlin 's initiative is a " signal and support " for a nationwide regulation that 's urgently needed , bätzing added . carola reimann , a spokeswoman on health matters for the spd parliamentary group , also said she hoped " the capital will set an example " for the rest of germany .
" if berlin , with its thriving bar and restaurant scene , can take such a decision then it 's a signal that ca n't be overlooked , " reimann said . laws governing gastronomy and the hospitality industry are the prerogative of state governments in germany . last bastion for smokers many point out that germany 's liberal attitude to smoking is partly a reaction to nazi anti-smoking drives .
hitler is said to have donated money in 1941 to the world 's first institute dedicated to studying the dangers of tobacco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people pass over a no smoking sign in the madrid underground whatever the reason for germany 's determined resistance to anti-smoking bans , it remains the only country in the european union that has ignored and fought an eu ban on tobacco advertising . ireland imposed the world 's first nationwide public smoking ban in 2004 , followed by italy , sweden , scotland , norway and spain .

to the romantic ear , the german language might sound cumbersome and perfunctory , yet beyond its tonal harshness , it is as efficient as its native speakers are reputed to be .
but is that necessarily a good thing ? ever felt wearied by the world , angst at the thought of the future or completely drained of energy ? chances are you have , but will have had to fish around inarticulately for whole streams of words to describe your state of being .
not so in german , where words like weltschmerz -lrb- world-weariness -rrb- , zukunftsangst -lrb- fear of the future -rrb- , k reislaufkollaps -lrb- circulatory collapse -rrb- and morgenmuffel -lrb- a person who is grumpy in the morning -rrb- have their hard-earned places in the national lexicon .
where then , are our succinct english equivalents ?
the short answer is that there are none .
that language does not always translate tidily is no secret , but how is it that somewhere along the way , words which become an integral part of one language are deemed unnecessary in another .
ekkehard könig , a professor of linguistics at the freie university in berlin , says that language evolves to suit the needs of the people using it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afraid of the future ?
" if you gave a french man 50 euros , he would go out and spend it , whereas a german would put it in the bank , " he said .
words are created for concepts , for ideas which are important , and skepticism and a fear of the future are basic dispositions in this country . "
society creates what society needs but does the very existence of words such as zukunftsangst or weltschmerz , which so precisely describe the pains of life , work as an advertisement for more people to feel the same things ?
elizabeth couper-kuhlen , a professor of linguistics at potsdam university , says it is a chicken and egg situation .
" which came first ?
it is often said that if a language lacks a word , it is because the concept is less salient , and the more salient , the more central it is , the more likely there is to be a word for it , " the linguist said .
the debate over the power of language and words to influence the way people think and behave dates back decades , to the sapir-whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity .
and although that theory fell into disrepute in the mid-20th century , some anthropologists now believe that changes to language can bring about changes in people 's behavior .
with a chuckle , könig says that adding new and positive words such as zukunftsfreude -lrb- looking forward to the future -rrb- to the vernacular would be unlikely to change the german disposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not what you say , but how you say it couper-kuhlen believes there is a reflective relationship between language and society .
" you ca n't just change language and change society , but equally you ca n't change society without changing language , and the fact that certain words exist in a given language is a reflection of what is prevalent in that society , " she said .
" if people did not think and behave in a certain way , there may be no need for words like weltschmerz . "

in the first phase , the military should provide for internal and external security .
if you see how we do this today in our deployments , be it in bosnia , be it in iraq or afghanistan , these things are not coordinated enough . so , you 're saying that it 's not just the german government , it 's all the governments .
after all , germany is only involved in missions that are organized by others , such as nato , the eu or the united nations . absolutely .
this is not a thing that is unique to germany .
i saw this in all the nations , and if you read the book by mr. bob woodward on the campaign in iraq , you see that the americans are still struggling for a strategy , how to cope with the problems .
if you do n't do this at the very start , you have very many actors in the country who all try to do the best they can , but very often they contradict each other .

it 's not good enough in southern afghanistan only to fight the taliban and to be there with military forces if the living conditions for the people in all these villages are not being amended at the same time .
this has to go hand in glove , otherwise we lose the confidence of the people for whose sake we are deployed to that particular country . are you saying then that the german troops and the other troops in these missions are not fulfilling a useful function right now ? no , i 'm not saying that .
if you look at the balkans , the key function of the nato forces was to stop the war , to stop the killing , to stop the atrocities .
i think in this regard the forces did an excellent job and were very -lrb- much -rrb- welcomed by the people .
but all these terms like liberty and democracy and freedom do n't mean anything for the people as long as they do n't feel they are better off .
and if we can not guarantee - besides the stabilization of the internal situation , which has to be done by the military and the police forces - that the living conditions are improved , the military becomes an occupation force . there has been some criticism about the length of some of these missions , to the point that some feel that german troops go in but never come out .
what aspect is there in this strategy that tells you when the troops have to get out ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exit strategy should be part of the plan from the start this is a good question .

it 's not good enough in southern afghanistan only to fight the taliban and to be there with military forces if the living conditions for the people in all these villages are not being amended at the same time .

if you look at the balkans , the key function of the nato forces was to stop the war , to stop the killing , to stop the atrocities .
i think in this regard the forces did an excellent job and were very -lrb- much -rrb- welcomed by the people .
but all these terms like liberty and democracy and freedom do n't mean anything for the people as long as they do n't feel they are better off .
and if we can not guarantee - besides the stabilization of the internal situation , which has to be done by the military and the police forces - that the living conditions are improved , the military becomes an occupation force . there has been some criticism about the length of some of these missions , to the point that some feel that german troops go in but never come out .

" we 're planning a non-smoker protection bill , " said ingeborg junge-reyer , an spd leader in berlin and member of mayor wowereit 's cabinet , after a round of coalition talks .

a previous effort to introduce a nationwide ban on smoking in restaurants , cafes and bars aimed at bringing germany into line with other european nations was blocked in september by chancellor angela merkel 's ruling conservatives . a working group made up of representatives from the spd , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as from the health and consumer protection ministry is currently exploring ways of introducing a germany-wide anti-smoking regulation . setting an example some hope that berlin will now lead the way for the rest of germany when it comes to curbing public smoking . " i hope that the other states will now realize that our fear of smoking bans is unjustified , " sabine bätzing , the federal drug commissioner , told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .

to the romantic ear , the german language might sound cumbersome and perfunctory , yet beyond its tonal harshness , it is as efficient as its native speakers are reputed to be .
but is that necessarily a good thing ? ever felt wearied by the world , angst at the thought of the future or completely drained of energy ? chances are you have , but will have had to fish around inarticulately for whole streams of words to describe your state of being .
not so in german , where words like weltschmerz -lrb- world-weariness -rrb- , zukunftsangst -lrb- fear of the future -rrb- , k reislaufkollaps -lrb- circulatory collapse -rrb- and morgenmuffel -lrb- a person who is grumpy in the morning -rrb- have their hard-earned places in the national lexicon .
where then , are our succinct english equivalents ?
the short answer is that there are none .
that language does not always translate tidily is no secret , but how is it that somewhere along the way , words which become an integral part of one language are deemed unnecessary in another .
ekkehard könig , a professor of linguistics at the freie university in berlin , says that language evolves to suit the needs of the people using it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afraid of the future ?
" if you gave a french man 50 euros , he would go out and spend it , whereas a german would put it in the bank , " he said .
words are created for concepts , for ideas which are important , and skepticism and a fear of the future are basic dispositions in this country . "
society creates what society needs but does the very existence of words such as zukunftsangst or weltschmerz , which so precisely describe the pains of life , work as an advertisement for more people to feel the same things ?
elizabeth couper-kuhlen , a professor of linguistics at potsdam university , says it is a chicken and egg situation .
" which came first ?
it is often said that if a language lacks a word , it is because the concept is less salient , and the more salient , the more central it is , the more likely there is to be a word for it , " the linguist said .
the debate over the power of language and words to influence the way people think and behave dates back decades , to the sapir-whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity .
and although that theory fell into disrepute in the mid-20th century , some anthropologists now believe that changes to language can bring about changes in people 's behavior .
with a chuckle , könig says that adding new and positive words such as zukunftsfreude -lrb- looking forward to the future -rrb- to the vernacular would be unlikely to change the german disposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not what you say , but how you say it couper-kuhlen believes there is a reflective relationship between language and society .
" you ca n't just change language and change society , but equally you ca n't change society without changing language , and the fact that certain words exist in a given language is a reflection of what is prevalent in that society , " she said .
" if people did not think and behave in a certain way , there may be no need for words like weltschmerz . "
building blocks the thing about the german language is that whilst it is systematic , it is also highly flexible , and wonderfully efficient .
it 's like a huge tub of " legos " offering endless opportunities for building words and concise means of self-expression .
weld together three completely unrelated words to make one new one which wastes not a single syllable in beating around the bush .
as albrecht plewnia of the institute for german language says , the composite nature of german makes it much easier to invent new words to clearly reflect the issues of the moment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : launching pad for new words " it 's so much easier to debate over a single word than over bits of a sentence , they work much better in headlines , " he said .
but there is a danger that banner headlines trumpeting negative new words will be picked up from the outside and given greater weight than they actually deserve .
" outsiders looking in often tend to think there is more behind german words than is the case , " plewnia said .
" in actual fact , we just have the words we need to describe the problems that exist .
the words are born out of a need to describe specific situations . "
and for the most part , they do it well .
so perhaps german is not always the most lyrical language out there , but there is definitely something to be said for just saying it like it is . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de non-german authors bridge cultures with books in german in france or england it would n't be politically correct to label authors by nationality instead of literary style .

but will the make-over help the event fend off fierce competition ? some 185 galleries from 28 different countries will be display their collections when the 40th edition of the annual art cologne fair opens its doors on wednesday .
organizers say they hope this year 's fair will attract 70,000 visitors . one of the highlights this year is the " open space " section , which is dedicated to up-and-coming young artists . " you need the next generation , " art cologne director gerard goodrow told dw-radio .
" we see this very clearly with both galleries and artists .
the potential of the next generation is a guarantee for the future since gallery owners and artists are always retiring , and collectors sometime stop buying in their later years . " the open space concentrates on installations .
but that 's not the only genre being featured at the fair . " there 's a trend toward sculpture , " goodrow said " but what we 're also seeing at art cologne is a new interest in works on paper - above all drawings . " in addition , this year 's fair includes a new section entitled " hidden treasures , " which is devoted to artists over the age of 40 whose works have yet to make the mark they deserve on the art market . productive self-questioning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hope the public will say " yes " to the new-look art fair founded in 1967 , art cologne was the world 's first art trade fair and has long been considered the most important event of its kind in germany .
but it 's suffered recently from competition from rival events in london , basel and berlin .
the number of galleries participating is down from 250 , and only three from the united states are in attendance . goodrow , who took over the fair in 2003 , has been trying to guide it out of a fallow period by emphasizing youth and innovation . " it 's something that we 've learned especially from young artists , gallery owners and collectors .
if you get too complacent , nothing happens and other cities like berlin and london gain in importance .
constantly calling yourself into question leads to innovation and progress . " in that avant-garde spirit , art cologne is staging a special showing of works by greek artist jannis kounellis .
born in 1936 , kounellis is considered a leading member of the arte povera movement .
one highlight of art cologne is a recreation of a famous kounellis installation from 1969 , consisting of 12 live horses chained to walls . art cologne 2006 runs through nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 01.11.2006 " there is no clear strategy for the bundeswehr in afghanistan " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops in afghanistan have been embroiled in a photo scandal in an interview with dw-radio , klaus reinhardt , the former commander of the kfor peacekeeping force in the balkans , criticizes the german government for lacking a strategy in its deployments of the bundeswehr . dw-radio : what would you say is the main problem with the bundeswehr 's missions abroad ? reinhardt : post-conflict operations have degenerated too much into military operations , rather than into combined civil-military operations .
in the first phase , the military should provide for internal and external security .
if you see how we do this today in our deployments , be it in bosnia , be it in iraq or afghanistan , these things are not coordinated enough . so , you 're saying that it 's not just the german government , it 's all the governments .
after all , germany is only involved in missions that are organized by others , such as nato , the eu or the united nations . absolutely .
this is not a thing that is unique to germany .
i saw this in all the nations , and if you read the book by mr. bob woodward on the campaign in iraq , you see that the americans are still struggling for a strategy , how to cope with the problems .
if you do n't do this at the very start , you have very many actors in the country who all try to do the best they can , but very often they contradict each other .
we had in kosovo , and still have , some 3,500 ngos -lrb- non-governmental organizations -rrb- and international organizations .
somehow this has to be brought together in some sort of synergistic approach for the well-being of the local population . what kind of strategy is needed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr needs to win the people 's confidence i think before we deploy into a country , the individual nations and the international community has to sit together and consider what we have to give to the country , with what means - as in personnel , medical and financial means - in order to make sure that in a bottom-up approach the conditions for the population are being met .
it 's not good enough in southern afghanistan only to fight the taliban and to be there with military forces if the living conditions for the people in all these villages are not being amended at the same time .
this has to go hand in glove , otherwise we lose the confidence of the people for whose sake we are deployed to that particular country . are you saying then that the german troops and the other troops in these missions are not fulfilling a useful function right now ? no , i 'm not saying that .
if you look at the balkans , the key function of the nato forces was to stop the war , to stop the killing , to stop the atrocities .
i think in this regard the forces did an excellent job and were very -lrb- much -rrb- welcomed by the people .
but all these terms like liberty and democracy and freedom do n't mean anything for the people as long as they do n't feel they are better off .
and if we can not guarantee - besides the stabilization of the internal situation , which has to be done by the military and the police forces - that the living conditions are improved , the military becomes an occupation force . there has been some criticism about the length of some of these missions , to the point that some feel that german troops go in but never come out .
what aspect is there in this strategy that tells you when the troops have to get out ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exit strategy should be part of the plan from the start this is a good question .
we have to establish criteria which have to be met and have to be supervised and if we have the feeling that these criteria are met to some extent , we can talk about pulling out the forces - as the germans try right now to do in bosnia-herzegovina where you have a local police , where you have some kind of local government and where you have some kind of local military forces which can take over these elements which were provided by the german contingent . michael lawton interviewed klaus reinhardt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts rethinking its foreign deployments german soldiers are engaged in eleven foreign missions .
but after a scandal with soldiers in afghanistan and fears that the military is overstretched , some want a reduction in the numbers of troops being sent abroad .
-lrb- 31.10.2006 -rrb- germany wants to pull troops out of bosnia from december berlin will begin gradually withdrawing its troops deployed with the international peacekeeping force in bosnia as early as december , german defense minister franz josef jung announced .
-lrb- 30.10.2006 -rrb- skull scandal raises questions about army training methods as the scandal over photographs of german soldiers desecrating a human skull in afghanistan widens , experts in germany are calling for a review of the army 's training methods .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 01.11.2006 berlin smoking ban hoped to set example for rest of germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's smoke-filled cafes may be a thing of the past berlin 's local government wants a ground-breaking ban on smoking in the city 's public buildings as well as all bars and restaurants , reviving debate on outlawing smoking across the country . berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their designated coalition partners , the left party , said this week they are pressing ahead with plans to make the german capital smoke-free . " we 're planning a non-smoker protection bill , " said ingeborg junge-reyer , an spd leader in berlin and member of mayor wowereit 's cabinet , after a round of coalition talks .
she said the law could take effect as early as 2007 . " it will be a strict non-smoker protection bill .
i can well imagine a complete ban along the lines of italy or ireland , " junge-reyer said . a revolution until now , politicians in berlin have only spoken about legally outlawing smoking in public buildings and hospitals .
extending that ban to the german capital 's estimated 10,000 bars and restaurants is a new proposal and one that is likely to trigger much opposition in a country known for its tolerant attitude towards smoking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking goes hand in hand with going out in berlin one in three germans smoke , while berlin has the highest per-capita number .
most restaurants do not offer non-smoking sections .
the legislation , if passed , could indeed become something of a revolution in a country which has doggedly remained one of the last bastions for smokers in europe . it would also mark a sharp departure from the rest of germany 's federal states , which have to varying degrees resisted national restrictions on tobacco .
a previous effort to introduce a nationwide ban on smoking in restaurants , cafes and bars aimed at bringing germany into line with other european nations was blocked in september by chancellor angela merkel 's ruling conservatives . a working group made up of representatives from the spd , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- as well as from the health and consumer protection ministry is currently exploring ways of introducing a germany-wide anti-smoking regulation . setting an example some hope that berlin will now lead the way for the rest of germany when it comes to curbing public smoking . " i hope that the other states will now realize that our fear of smoking bans is unjustified , " sabine bätzing , the federal drug commissioner , told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
berlin 's initiative is a " signal and support " for a nationwide regulation that 's urgently needed , bätzing added . carola reimann , a spokeswoman on health matters for the spd parliamentary group , also said she hoped " the capital will set an example " for the rest of germany .
" if berlin , with its thriving bar and restaurant scene , can take such a decision then it 's a signal that ca n't be overlooked , " reimann said . laws governing gastronomy and the hospitality industry are the prerogative of state governments in germany . last bastion for smokers many point out that germany 's liberal attitude to smoking is partly a reaction to nazi anti-smoking drives .
hitler is said to have donated money in 1941 to the world 's first institute dedicated to studying the dangers of tobacco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people pass over a no smoking sign in the madrid underground whatever the reason for germany 's determined resistance to anti-smoking bans , it remains the only country in the european union that has ignored and fought an eu ban on tobacco advertising . ireland imposed the world 's first nationwide public smoking ban in 2004 , followed by italy , sweden , scotland , norway and spain .
france said last month it would ban smoking in public places starting next year and in bars and clubs from 2008 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french impose smoking ban on cafes , restaurants french smokers will be headed outside as of february , when the country 's smoking ban takes effect in public places and extends to hotels , bars , restaurants and night clubs 11 months later .
-lrb- 09.10.2006 -rrb- government accused of bowing to tobacco lobby after announcing it will drop plans to enforce a full ban on smoking in restaurants , germany 's ruling coalition came under fire from the greens who accused the government of bowing to pressure from the tobacco lobby .

but will the make-over help the event fend off fierce competition ? some 185 galleries from 28 different countries will be display their collections when the 40th edition of the annual art cologne fair opens its doors on wednesday .
organizers say they hope this year 's fair will attract 70,000 visitors . one of the highlights this year is the " open space " section , which is dedicated to up-and-coming young artists . " you need the next generation , " art cologne director gerard goodrow told dw-radio .

to the romantic ear , the german language might sound cumbersome and perfunctory , yet beyond its tonal harshness , it is as efficient as its native speakers are reputed to be .
but is that necessarily a good thing ? ever felt wearied by the world , angst at the thought of the future or completely drained of energy ? chances are you have , but will have had to fish around inarticulately for whole streams of words to describe your state of being .
not so in german , where words like weltschmerz -lrb- world-weariness -rrb- , zukunftsangst -lrb- fear of the future -rrb- , k reislaufkollaps -lrb- circulatory collapse -rrb- and morgenmuffel -lrb- a person who is grumpy in the morning -rrb- have their hard-earned places in the national lexicon .
where then , are our succinct english equivalents ?
the short answer is that there are none .
that language does not always translate tidily is no secret , but how is it that somewhere along the way , words which become an integral part of one language are deemed unnecessary in another .
ekkehard könig , a professor of linguistics at the freie university in berlin , says that language evolves to suit the needs of the people using it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afraid of the future ?
" if you gave a french man 50 euros , he would go out and spend it , whereas a german would put it in the bank , " he said .
words are created for concepts , for ideas which are important , and skepticism and a fear of the future are basic dispositions in this country . "
society creates what society needs but does the very existence of words such as zukunftsangst or weltschmerz , which so precisely describe the pains of life , work as an advertisement for more people to feel the same things ?
elizabeth couper-kuhlen , a professor of linguistics at potsdam university , says it is a chicken and egg situation .
" which came first ?
it is often said that if a language lacks a word , it is because the concept is less salient , and the more salient , the more central it is , the more likely there is to be a word for it , " the linguist said .
the debate over the power of language and words to influence the way people think and behave dates back decades , to the sapir-whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity .
and although that theory fell into disrepute in the mid-20th century , some anthropologists now believe that changes to language can bring about changes in people 's behavior .
with a chuckle , könig says that adding new and positive words such as zukunftsfreude -lrb- looking forward to the future -rrb- to the vernacular would be unlikely to change the german disposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not what you say , but how you say it couper-kuhlen believes there is a reflective relationship between language and society .
" you ca n't just change language and change society , but equally you ca n't change society without changing language , and the fact that certain words exist in a given language is a reflection of what is prevalent in that society , " she said .
" if people did not think and behave in a certain way , there may be no need for words like weltschmerz . "
building blocks the thing about the german language is that whilst it is systematic , it is also highly flexible , and wonderfully efficient .
it 's like a huge tub of " legos " offering endless opportunities for building words and concise means of self-expression .
weld together three completely unrelated words to make one new one which wastes not a single syllable in beating around the bush .
as albrecht plewnia of the institute for german language says , the composite nature of german makes it much easier to invent new words to clearly reflect the issues of the moment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : launching pad for new words " it 's so much easier to debate over a single word than over bits of a sentence , they work much better in headlines , " he said .
but there is a danger that banner headlines trumpeting negative new words will be picked up from the outside and given greater weight than they actually deserve .
" outsiders looking in often tend to think there is more behind german words than is the case , " plewnia said .
" in actual fact , we just have the words we need to describe the problems that exist .
the words are born out of a need to describe specific situations . "
and for the most part , they do it well .
so perhaps german is not always the most lyrical language out there , but there is definitely something to be said for just saying it like it is . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de non-german authors bridge cultures with books in german in france or england it would n't be politically correct to label authors by nationality instead of literary style .
but in germany , special prizes are awarded to authors with non-german backgrounds .
-lrb- 26.08.2006 -rrb- preserving endangered species of the german language people are usually most comfortable when speaking in their mother tongue .
but that 's not always the case , as german minorities in eastern europe and central asia show .
-lrb- 23.07.2006 -rrb- german language slowly losing taboo status in israel young israelis and israeli arabs are becoming increasingly interested in learning german , something that 's been taboo since the holocaust .
and they 're finding that learning a foreign language can have healing power .

according to a government dossier reportedly seen by the sun , up to 85 % of uk cash machine crime is already committed by romanian-organised groups .
the memo raises fears " free movement " will attract more people to organised crime in the uk , the newspaper says .
the home office says it warned in september that " necessary safeguards " must be in place for the change .
the document , drawn up by ministers and seen by a cabinet committee last week , reportedly warns of increases in cash machine crime , sex trafficking , street violence and fraud . "
the establishment of the serious organised crime agency -lrb- soca -rrb- earlier this year signals our determination to make the uk one of the toughest places in the world to operate " home office a home office spokesman said that , while it did not comment on leaked documents , tackling organised crime was a " top priority for the government " .
" the establishment of the serious organised crime agency -lrb- soca -rrb- earlier this year signals our determination to make the uk one of the toughest places in the world to operate , " he added .
he pointed out that , in a speech to the police superintendents association conference on 19 september , john reid said uk law enforcement agencies had been working closely with the romanian and bulgarian governments to " identify new challenges " .
' implications considered ' in his speech , mr reid told senior officers the planned expansion of the eu would have an impact on policing and crime .
" we need to consider very carefully all the implications of the accession of new states and ensure that we have all necessary safeguards in place right down to local borough level to reassure the public that this movement will be managed fairly and competently , " mr reid said at the time .
the spokesman added that a home office-led task force made up of the police , soca and other agencies was already working on " measures to identify and tackle the full range of law enforcement issues that may arise " .
last week , mr reid unveiled limits on bulgarians ' and romanians ' right to work in the uk , saying the only unskilled working allowed would be in food processing and agriculture under a specific scheme with 20,000 places .
the government has exercised its right under the eu rules to restrict access for these workers for up to seven years .
the countries join the eu in january and mr reid is keen to avoid the large influx seen from the eight ex-communist states which joined the eu in 2004 .
eu rules mean romanians and bulgarians will be free to live in the uk and to take any job if self-employed .

" the establishment of the serious organised crime agency -lrb- soca -rrb- earlier this year signals our determination to make the uk one of the toughest places in the world to operate , " he added .
he pointed out that , in a speech to the police superintendents association conference on 19 september , john reid said uk law enforcement agencies had been working closely with the romanian and bulgarian governments to " identify new challenges " .
' implications considered ' in his speech , mr reid told senior officers the planned expansion of the eu would have an impact on policing and crime .
mr reid spoke in september about the policing implications of the change " we need to consider very carefully all the implications of the accession of new states and ensure that we have all necessary safeguards in place right down to local borough level to reassure the public that this movement will be managed fairly and competently , " mr reid said at the time .
the spokesman added that a home office-led task force made up of the police , soca and other agencies was already working on " measures to identify and tackle the full range of law enforcement issues that may arise " .
last week , mr reid unveiled limits on bulgarians ' and romanians ' right to work in the uk , saying the only unskilled working allowed would be in food processing and agriculture under a specific scheme with 20,000 places .
the government has exercised its right under the eu rules to restrict access for these workers for up to seven years .
the countries join the eu in january and mr reid is keen to avoid the large influx seen from the eight ex-communist states which joined the eu in 2004 .
eu rules mean romanians and bulgarians will be free to live in the uk and to take any job if self-employed .

according to a government dossier reportedly seen by the sun , up to 85 % of uk cash machine crime is already committed by romanian-organised groups .
the memo raises fears " free movement " will attract more people to organised crime in the uk , the newspaper says .
the home office says it warned in september that " necessary safeguards " must be in place for the change .
the document , drawn up by ministers and seen by a cabinet committee last week , reportedly warns of increases in cash machine crime , sex trafficking , street violence and fraud .
the establishment of the serious organised crime agency -lrb- soca -rrb- earlier this year signals our determination to make the uk one of the toughest places in the world to operate home office a home office spokesman said that , while it did not comment on leaked documents , tackling organised crime was a " top priority for the government " .
" the establishment of the serious organised crime agency -lrb- soca -rrb- earlier this year signals our determination to make the uk one of the toughest places in the world to operate , " he added .
he pointed out that , in a speech to the police superintendents association conference on 19 september , john reid said uk law enforcement agencies had been working closely with the romanian and bulgarian governments to " identify new challenges " .
' implications considered ' in his speech , mr reid told senior officers the planned expansion of the eu would have an impact on policing and crime .
mr reid spoke in september about the policing implications of the change " we need to consider very carefully all the implications of the accession of new states and ensure that we have all necessary safeguards in place right down to local borough level to reassure the public that this movement will be managed fairly and competently , " mr reid said at the time .
the spokesman added that a home office-led task force made up of the police , soca and other agencies was already working on " measures to identify and tackle the full range of law enforcement issues that may arise " .
last week , mr reid unveiled limits on bulgarians ' and romanians ' right to work in the uk , saying the only unskilled working allowed would be in food processing and agriculture under a specific scheme with 20,000 places .
the government has exercised its right under the eu rules to restrict access for these workers for up to seven years .
the countries join the eu in january and mr reid is keen to avoid the large influx seen from the eight ex-communist states which joined the eu in 2004 .
eu rules mean romanians and bulgarians will be free to live in the uk and to take any job if self-employed .

the site at llanymynech , near welshpool in powys , includes a 140ft hoffman kiln , one of just three left in the uk .
the work is being partially financed by a £ 452,000 grant from the heritage lottery fund awarded last autumn .
a parallel project to restore the montgomery canal which runs through the area is being carried out .
described as a site of national significance , the limeworks ' origins date back to 1763 .
the site sits across the wales-england border , with the kiln just a few hundred yards over the border in shropshire and the rest in powys .
when it opens , the museum will chart the rise of the lime industry in the area , quarrying , production and transportation via canal , tram and railway .
tony beardsell , chairman of llanymynech heritage focus group , said the work was the culmination of 30 years of effort on the parts of individuals and organisations to get the site restored .
the kiln inside is 150ft long by 50ft wide after tackling conservation issues involving a range of animals from newts to bats to herons , the site is ready for contractors to begin on wednesday .
he told bbc wales : " we 're extremely pleased it 's all happening .

seven people have been murdered in the city in the space of five days .
italy 's justice minister , clemente mastella , has said he is considering sending in troops to protect the city .
a security services report says that blood-letting between camorra clans who control some of the run-down suburbs could spill over into the city centre .
correspondents say the number of people killed or wounded in the city in recent weeks is higher than usual .
three people were killed on tuesday , taking the death toll over five days to seven .

creditors will have to vote on the plans before the end of november .
under the deal , existing shareholders would have a minimum 13 % stake in a new company that would make an offer for eurotunnel 's shares early next year .
eurotunnel , which has a debt mountain of £ 6.2bn -lrb- $ 11.7bn -rrb- , will go into administration if the plan is defeated .
bank support the restructuring plan involves the creation of a new firm , groupe eurotunnel , bolstered by a long-term loan of £ 2.84bn from a consortium of banks including goldman sachs , deutsche bank and citigroup .
groupe eurotunnel would make an exchange tender offer to current eurotunnel shareholders and would issue convertible hybrid notes worth nearly £ 1.3bn.
eurotunnel boss jacques gounon has said he believes eurotunnel is close to having the necessary majority required to approve the restructuring .
the company ran up massive debts during construction of the channel tunnel , which opened in 1994 .
eurotunnel 's business plan quickly got into difficulties when actual passenger numbers failed to meet its projections .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- poll suggests split views of nhs home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health medical notes science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : wednesday , 1 november 2006 , 09:09 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version poll suggests split views of nhs perceptions of the nhs are shaped by the media half of voters think the nhs is getting worse , but most speak highly of their last treatment , a survey has suggested .
the poll of 2,022 voters by yougov for the tuc found 46 % thought government reforms would make their local trust worse over the next five years .
but 63 % said their most recent experience of the nhs was either good or very good .
nearly three-quarters were against recent reforms including increased competition within the nhs .
the reform process has also included radical changes to the progression of doctors ' careers , and the onset of privatisation within the nhs .
of the respondents , 52 % agreed that the nhs had got much worse or a little worse since 1996 .
alarm bells and 76 % of those surveyed said the government should stop its reform and give far more control back to nhs staff .
tuc general secretary brendan barber said : " this poll should ring alarm bells in government .
" it shows that the government is not getting the credit it deserves for providing the extra funding that has allowed nhs staff to make big improvements to patient care and to cut waiting times .
" nor do voters back crucial parts of the government 's reform agenda .
" instead they want ministers to work with and to trust nhs staff to make the nhs better , not set hospitals up in competition with each other . "

fred tipson , senior policy counsel for the computer giant , said concerns over the repressive regime might force it to reconsider its business in china .
" things are getting bad ... and perhaps we have to look again at our presence there , " he told a conference in athens .
" we have to decide if the persecuting of bloggers reaches a point that it 's unacceptable to do business there . "
" we try to define those levels and the trends are not good there at the moment .
it 's a moving target . "
selling to china earlier in the day , speaking at the internet governance forum , mr tipson had defended the work microsoft was doing in china .
at a session about openness he denied that some big businesses were " colluding " with certain governments .
he was joined in the debate by art reilly , senior director at cisco systems . "
i do n't think we should make corporations responsible for securing our freedoms . "
anriette esterhuysen , executive director apc as the only two representatives of major business sat on the panel , they were the focus of accusations from some delegates that the companies were not doing all they could to enable freedom of expression .
cisco was attacked at the forum for selling equipment to police in china , while microsoft has been criticised for allegedly censoring blogs in the country .
mr tipson said : " we are maximising access to information to users in governments that amnesty is targeting for its criticism .
" it 's those users we have to keep our focus on . "
mr reilly , senior director of strategic technology policy at cisco was asked if the firm had any ethical problems with an alleged sale of router equipment to the chinese police .
human rights activists are concerned that the technology is being misused by some governments to track the online activities of people and to filter dissident comment .
he said : " we do not sell a different product in one country to another .
" it is essential that there are security and network management capabilities in a network that enable the free flow of information - it is the same technology used by parents and libraries to prevent children from accessing pornography for example . "
he added : " we are not colluding with any country to do any specific filtering . "
he said that he was not familiar with the sale of " any product to any particular entity in china " .
mr tipson said it was a condition of companies to abide by the local laws in countries with whom they do business .
mr reilly said that here had been a " substantial increase in use and ability for information to flow in china " since cisco entered the chinese market in 1994 .
there are now 120 million people online in china , up from 80,000 in 1994 .
advancing human rights " the economic value in the internet is driving growth and development in educational opportunities -lsb- in china -rsb- , " said mr tipson .
" openness is often too segmented too narrowly into a discussion around freedom of speech , " he added .
mr tipson said it was " critical not to portray the internet as a threat to governments " .
" the internet is transforming the political culture of china .
there is no question about it . "
fellow panellist , anriette esterhuysen , executive director of professional body apc , said : " i do n't think we should make corporations responsible for securing our freedoms . "

among the 250 guests at his 45-acre wiltshire mansion were people like richard curtis , anthony minghella , helena bonham carter and rowan atkinson .
but , far from enjoying the preparations for the big night , weiland had been losing sleep over his after-dinner speech .
" i 'd been to a lot of very grown-up 50th birthday parties where people like sebastian faulks were giving these most eloquent speeches , " he says .
" i thought to myself : ' what am i going to bloody say ? " '
weiland says he became " preoccupied " with the speech , racking his brains for anecdotes about his life and marriage which could entertain an audience with the highest expectations .
" and then i just had this thought , " he says , " that the last big party i 'd had , no-one really showed up to - because it was my bar mitzvah , and it was on the day of the -lsb- 1966 -rsb- world cup final .
" and the speech went down so well that , afterwards , there were quite a few producers in the audience and they came up to me and said : ' we should make that as a movie . " '
comedic highlights i did n't really think about what would happen if it went wrong gregg sulkin inspired by the reaction to his speech , weiland wrote a script outline with one of his closest friends - who just happened to be richard curtis .

john grunsfeld , an astronomer by training , will be making a third visit to the orbital observatory , which on tuesday won a reprieve when nasa agreed to briefly interrupt international space station assembly missions for a final shuttle visit to hubble .
the hubble flight is targeted for may 2008 .
without servicing by a shuttle crew , the telescope is expected to last only another two or three years .
" i feel like a mission to hubble is worth risking my life for , " dr grunsfeld said at a crew press conference in houston .
" it 's something that 's really important for our country and i firmly believe the next mission to hubble will be much safer than the missions we 've flown before . "
click here to see a summary of the hubble servicing plan last time dr grunsfeld will be reunited with his last commander , scott altman , and former crewmate mike massimino , all veterans of the fourth hubble servicing flight which took place in march 2002 .
dr grunsfeld also flew on the shuttle 's third house call to hubble in december 1999 .
joining the newest hubble repair crew are four rookie fliers : pilot greg johnson , robot arm operator megan mcarthur and spacewalkers andrew feustel and mike good .
hubble space telescope named after the great us astronomer edwin hubble launched in 1990 into a 600km-high circular orbit equipped with a 2.4m primary mirror and five instruments length : 15.9m ; diameter : 4.2m ; mass : 11,110kg observations have probed about 24,000 celestial objects made more than 93,000 trips around our planet generates about 10 gigabytes of data each day nasa expects the flight to last 11 days and include five spacewalks to install two new science instruments , repair a third instrument and replace the telescope 's batteries and gyroscopes , which are needed to position and point hubble for scientific observations .
the crew also will install a docking system so a future spacecraft can deliver a propulsion module to direct hubble to a safe atmospheric re-entry point over the ocean once the telescope 's useful life has ended .
" we really do n't , probably , have to go up there until the 2020 or 2025 timeframe , " said ed weiler , head of nasa 's goddard space flight center in greenbelt , maryland , which oversees hubble .
by then , the spacecraft being designed to replace the shuttles , which are being retired in 2010 , are scheduled to be ferrying crews and supplies to the moon .
" if the cev -lrb- crew exploration vehicle -rrb- can go to the moon , it can probably take up a solid rocket motor to hubble , " dr weiler said .
columbia legacy the us space agency reinstated the hubble servicing call following an in-depth review to assess how well safety upgrades implemented after the 2003 columbia accident were working .
nasa has flown three missions since the shuttle disaster , which claimed the lives of seven astronauts .
a ' pit stop ' in space see how the discovery shuttle will grapple hubble in pictures the agency 's last administrator had cancelled the hubble mission , saying it was too dangerous to risk a shuttle crew that could not seek shelter aboard the space station in case of serious damage to their ship .
shuttles flying to hubble 's orbit do not carry enough fuel to reach the station .
in agreeing to reinstate the mission , current administrator mike griffin ordered a second shuttle to be on the launch pad ready to fly a rescue mission in case the hubble repair crew found themselves stranded in orbit .
" the safety of our crew conducting this mission will be as much as we possibly can , " griffin said .
" we are not going to risk a crew in order to do the hubble mission . "
pad versatility devoting two shuttles to the hubble mission will take some time out of the station 's assembly schedule , but so far nasa managers are confident they will be able to complete all 16 planned flights to the station before the shuttle 's retirement .
having a second shuttle on standby for launch will complicate plans for test flights of nasa 's new ship , the crew exploration vehicle , which recently was renamed orion .
the agency had planned to turn over one of the shuttle 's two launch pads in florida to the new programme , which will modify the complex .
dr griffin said the handover would still take place , but the pad must remain suitable for shuttle use until after the hubble servicing mission .
" flying the shuttle carries with it more risk than we would like , more risk than we once thought we had , " dr griffin said .
" it can be flown safely if we are very careful . "
servicing the hubble space telescope shuttle discovery will grab hubble with a robotic arm and pull it on to a work platform to allow astronauts easy access to its interior hubble has six gyroscopes that are critical to its control and pointing systems .
these have started to fail and all will have to be replaced six new batteries will rejuvenate the electrical system ; astronauts will attach new thermal blankets to insulate sensitive components there are two instrument bays ; two new instruments will be slid into racks made vacant by the removal of older instruments an attempt will also be made to repair the space telescope imaging spectrograph -lrb- stis -rrb- which stopped working in 2004 click here to return e-mail this to a friend printable version video and audio news nasa chief mike griffin announces the mission see also hubble telescope will get upgrade 31 oct 06 -pipe- science / nature hubble mission is ' wonderful news ' 31 oct 06 -pipe- science / nature nasa to decide hubble 's fate 26 oct 06 -pipe- science / nature hubble trouble pressures shuttle 28 jun 06 -pipe- science / nature nasa spending to support shuttle 07 feb 06 -pipe- science / nature related internet links hubble space telescope hubble -lrb- esa -rrb- hubble -lrb- nasa -rrb- john grunsfeld -lrb- nasa -rrb- the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top science & environment stories obama backs giant solar project russian freighter docks in space scientists peer inside a python most popular stories now most shared most read snake bursts after gobbling gator untidy beds may keep us healthy quiz of the week 's news troubled times for malawi 's anglicans one-minute world news most popular now , in detail most shared most read ex-eating champion arrested in us komorowski set for polish victory india strike over petrol prices snake bursts after gobbling gator giant skimmer tested on oil spill apple admits iphone signal fault ss great britain : from seabed to national treasure obama backs giant solar project opposition set to win mexico poll russian freighter docks in space most popular now , in detail features , views , analysis promoting ' love ' music video builds unity in protest-hit thai capital mixed legacy how mohammed fadlallah was admired and reviled soul searching missionary lives and theological divides in malawi most popular now most popular now -pipe- 33,457 people are reading stories on the site right now .

click here to see a summary of the hubble servicing plan last time dr grunsfeld will be reunited with his last commander , scott altman , and former crewmate mike massimino , all veterans of the fourth hubble servicing flight which took place in march 2002 .
dr grunsfeld also flew on the shuttle 's third house call to hubble in december 1999 .
joining the newest hubble repair crew are four rookie fliers : pilot greg johnson , robot arm operator megan mcarthur and spacewalkers andrew feustel and mike good .
hubble space telescope named after the great us astronomer edwin hubble launched in 1990 into a 600km-high circular orbit equipped with a 2.4m primary mirror and five instruments length : 15.9m ; diameter : 4.2m ; mass : 11,110kg observations have probed about 24,000 celestial objects made more than 93,000 trips around our planet generates about 10 gigabytes of data each day nasa expects the flight to last 11 days and include five spacewalks to install two new science instruments , repair a third instrument and replace the telescope 's batteries and gyroscopes , which are needed to position and point hubble for scientific observations .
the crew also will install a docking system so a future spacecraft can deliver a propulsion module to direct hubble to a safe atmospheric re-entry point over the ocean once the telescope 's useful life has ended .
" we really do n't , probably , have to go up there until the 2020 or 2025 timeframe , " said ed weiler , head of nasa 's goddard space flight center in greenbelt , maryland , which oversees hubble .
by then , the spacecraft being designed to replace the shuttles , which are being retired in 2010 , are scheduled to be ferrying crews and supplies to the moon .
" if the cev -lrb- crew exploration vehicle -rrb- can go to the moon , it can probably take up a solid rocket motor to hubble , " dr weiler said .
columbia legacy the us space agency reinstated the hubble servicing call following an in-depth review to assess how well safety upgrades implemented after the 2003 columbia accident were working .
nasa has flown three missions since the shuttle disaster , which claimed the lives of seven astronauts .
a ' pit stop ' in space see how the discovery shuttle will grapple hubble in pictures the agency 's last administrator had cancelled the hubble mission , saying it was too dangerous to risk a shuttle crew that could not seek shelter aboard the space station in case of serious damage to their ship .
shuttles flying to hubble 's orbit do not carry enough fuel to reach the station .
in agreeing to reinstate the mission , current administrator mike griffin ordered a second shuttle to be on the launch pad ready to fly a rescue mission in case the hubble repair crew found themselves stranded in orbit .
" the safety of our crew conducting this mission will be as much as we possibly can , " griffin said .
" we are not going to risk a crew in order to do the hubble mission . "
pad versatility devoting two shuttles to the hubble mission will take some time out of the station 's assembly schedule , but so far nasa managers are confident they will be able to complete all 16 planned flights to the station before the shuttle 's retirement .
having a second shuttle on standby for launch will complicate plans for test flights of nasa 's new ship , the crew exploration vehicle , which recently was renamed orion .
the agency had planned to turn over one of the shuttle 's two launch pads in florida to the new programme , which will modify the complex .
dr griffin said the handover would still take place , but the pad must remain suitable for shuttle use until after the hubble servicing mission .
" flying the shuttle carries with it more risk than we would like , more risk than we once thought we had , " dr griffin said .
" it can be flown safely if we are very careful . "

french troops arrive in port said 10 november 1956 enlarge image the french are normally assiduous about remembering military anniversaries - even the nasty ones like dien bien phu , mers el-kebir or trafalgar .
but there is something about the suez crisis that has inspired collective amnesia .
it 's not that the french are embarrassed by what happened .
it is just that they have forgotten .
while in britain , the 50 years since the airborne invasion of the canal zone are being marked with reams of hefty analysis and a three-part bbc drama documentary called " a very british crisis " , in france the occasion is being passed by in almost total silence .
the prime reason , according to historian philippe vial , is that suez - for france - got buried by the rush of other cataclysmic events : suez convinced french leaders ... that europe was the future robert tombs cambridge historian " in britain , suez became the symbol of the end of imperial destiny .
it had huge resonance .
but in france there was too much else going on .
the government had just hardened its line against the insurrection in algeria , and then in january began the battle of algiers .
suez got squeezed out of the national memory . "
on top of that , in 1958 charles de gaulle swept to power in the wake of the algeria crisis .
with the new fifth republic , events and politicians associated with the discredited ancien regime disappeared from public consciousness .
history started all over again .
the irony , says mr vial of the defence ministry 's historical service , is that the french were in fact much more gung-ho than the british were about the co-ordinated plan - with israel - to retake the recently nationalised canal and if possible topple president gamal abdel nasser .
at the time france was closely allied to israel , which was fearful of the emerging egyptian strongman .
largely thanks to the work of a young emissary called shimon peres , paris had supplied the young state with mystere iv jets as well as technology for a nuclear bomb .
french muscle also , although the government in paris was a left-wing alliance - including francois mitterrand at justice - its views on the algerian pro-independence movement were now uncompromisingly tough .
it believed that doing away with nasser would help relieve the pressure on its beloved colony .
some 17,000 french troops were deployed , veterans say " what we know now is that france got wind of israeli plans for a pre-emptive strike on egypt , and said to them ' hang on , let 's see if we can work something out with britain ' , " says mr vial .
" britain had its own reasons for wanting to get rid of nasser , and the government was caught totally by surprise by france 's enthusiasm . "
france handed to britain military command of the invasion but it provided 50 naval vessels and several squadrons of aircraft temporarily stationed in cyprus while french paratroopers , battle-hardened in indochina , easily outperformed the british who were still traumatised by the arnhem experience .
according to the french association of veterans of suez and cyprus , 17,000 servicemen were involved - directly or indirectly - in the invasion , and there is considerable resentment today that they have never been recognised as " war veterans " .
indeed enquires today about suez at the french veterans ' affairs ministry elicit a frosty " on ne sait rien " -lrb- trans : we know nothing about it -rrb- .
" the government says we were only 60 days in the war zone so we do n't qualify because the law says you have to be there for 90 days to get social and pension rights as veterans , " says association president andre painsecq .
" but that is rubbish .
some of us were out there for much longer .
the british got far better treatment . "
new direction to mark the anniversary , the defence ministry in paris is in fact hosting a three-day seminar in the conflict which vial hopes will challenge some long-held preconceptions .
de gaulle did not want the uk in the european economic community one of the problems of french neglect of suez , he says , is that historical interpretation has been almost entirely carried out by " les anglo-saxons " .
" when you read the literature , you get the impression that this was - to quote the bbc series - a very british crisis .
" but that is not accurate .
it was a very french affair too . "
indeed for many historians , the impact of suez on france and its perception of the world was even greater - if less direct - than on britain .
the french emerged from the crisis convinced that they had been betrayed and humiliated by the british who - under pressure from the americans - had simply stopped fighting .
" so there was a complete reassessment of the relationship with the us , " says robert tombs , cambridge historian and author of that sweet enemy on franco-british relations .
" the feeling was : we can never trust them again , and we have to find new ways of making ourselves secure .
" at the same time , it affected attitudes to europe .
famously , german chancellor konrad adenauer , on learning of the disaster , told the french foreign minister ' europe will be your revenge ' .
" suez convinced french leaders - and after 1958 that meant de gaulle - that europe was the future . "
in the 1960s , de gaulle translated the new policy into action : withdrawing from the military command of nato in 1966 , and twice vetoing british entry into the european economic community - mainly out of fears that britain would adulterate europe 's vocation .
ambivalence towards " les anglo-saxons " of course predated suez .

france handed to britain military command of the invasion but it provided 50 naval vessels and several squadrons of aircraft temporarily stationed in cyprus while french paratroopers , battle-hardened in indochina , easily outperformed the british who were still traumatised by the arnhem experience .
according to the french association of veterans of suez and cyprus , 17,000 servicemen were involved - directly or indirectly - in the invasion , and there is considerable resentment today that they have never been recognised as " war veterans " .
indeed enquires today about suez at the french veterans ' affairs ministry elicit a frosty " on ne sait rien " -lrb- trans : we know nothing about it -rrb- .
" the government says we were only 60 days in the war zone so we do n't qualify because the law says you have to be there for 90 days to get social and pension rights as veterans , " says association president andre painsecq .
" but that is rubbish .
some of us were out there for much longer .
the british got far better treatment . "
new direction to mark the anniversary , the defence ministry in paris is in fact hosting a three-day seminar in the conflict which vial hopes will challenge some long-held preconceptions .
de gaulle did not want the uk in the european economic community one of the problems of french neglect of suez , he says , is that historical interpretation has been almost entirely carried out by " les anglo-saxons " .
" when you read the literature , you get the impression that this was - to quote the bbc series - a very british crisis .
" but that is not accurate .
it was a very french affair too . "
indeed for many historians , the impact of suez on france and its perception of the world was even greater - if less direct - than on britain .
the french emerged from the crisis convinced that they had been betrayed and humiliated by the british who - under pressure from the americans - had simply stopped fighting .
" so there was a complete reassessment of the relationship with the us , " says robert tombs , cambridge historian and author of that sweet enemy on franco-british relations .
" the feeling was : we can never trust them again , and we have to find new ways of making ourselves secure .
" at the same time , it affected attitudes to europe .
famously , german chancellor konrad adenauer , on learning of the disaster , told the french foreign minister ' europe will be your revenge ' .
" suez convinced french leaders - and after 1958 that meant de gaulle - that europe was the future . "
in the 1960s , de gaulle translated the new policy into action : withdrawing from the military command of nato in 1966 , and twice vetoing british entry into the european economic community - mainly out of fears that britain would adulterate europe 's vocation .
ambivalence towards " les anglo-saxons " of course predated suez .
but from the late 1950s , suspicion of britain and the us became semi-official gaullist policy , as france sought to project an independent voice in the world via europe .

the french are normally assiduous about remembering military anniversaries - even the nasty ones like dien bien phu , mers el-kebir or trafalgar .
but there is something about the suez crisis that has inspired collective amnesia .
it 's not that the french are embarrassed by what happened .
it is just that they have forgotten .
while in britain , the 50 years since the airborne invasion of the canal zone are being marked with reams of hefty analysis and a three-part bbc drama documentary called " a very british crisis " , in france the occasion is being passed by in almost total silence .
the prime reason , according to historian philippe vial , is that suez - for france - got buried by the rush of other cataclysmic events : " suez convinced french leaders ... that europe was the future " robert tombs cambridge historian " in britain , suez became the symbol of the end of imperial destiny .
it had huge resonance .
but in france there was too much else going on .
the government had just hardened its line against the insurrection in algeria , and then in january began the battle of algiers .
suez got squeezed out of the national memory . "
on top of that , in 1958 charles de gaulle swept to power in the wake of the algeria crisis .
with the new fifth republic , events and politicians associated with the discredited ancien regime disappeared from public consciousness .
history started all over again .
the irony , says mr vial of the defence ministry 's historical service , is that the french were in fact much more gung-ho than the british were about the co-ordinated plan - with israel - to retake the recently nationalised canal and if possible topple president gamal abdel nasser .
at the time france was closely allied to israel , which was fearful of the emerging egyptian strongman .
largely thanks to the work of a young emissary called shimon peres , paris had supplied the young state with mystere iv jets as well as technology for a nuclear bomb .
french muscle also , although the government in paris was a left-wing alliance - including francois mitterrand at justice - its views on the algerian pro-independence movement were now uncompromisingly tough .
it believed that doing away with nasser would help relieve the pressure on its beloved colony .
" what we know now is that france got wind of israeli plans for a pre-emptive strike on egypt , and said to them ' hang on , let 's see if we can work something out with britain ' , " says mr vial .
" britain had its own reasons for wanting to get rid of nasser , and the government was caught totally by surprise by france 's enthusiasm . "
france handed to britain military command of the invasion but it provided 50 naval vessels and several squadrons of aircraft temporarily stationed in cyprus while french paratroopers , battle-hardened in indochina , easily outperformed the british who were still traumatised by the arnhem experience .
according to the french association of veterans of suez and cyprus , 17,000 servicemen were involved - directly or indirectly - in the invasion , and there is considerable resentment today that they have never been recognised as " war veterans " .
indeed enquires today about suez at the french veterans ' affairs ministry elicit a frosty " on ne sait rien " -lrb- trans : we know nothing about it -rrb- .
" the government says we were only 60 days in the war zone so we do n't qualify because the law says you have to be there for 90 days to get social and pension rights as veterans , " says association president andre painsecq .
" but that is rubbish .
some of us were out there for much longer .
the british got far better treatment . "
new direction to mark the anniversary , the defence ministry in paris is in fact hosting a three-day seminar in the conflict which vial hopes will challenge some long-held preconceptions .
one of the problems of french neglect of suez , he says , is that historical interpretation has been almost entirely carried out by " les anglo-saxons " .
" when you read the literature , you get the impression that this was - to quote the bbc series - a very british crisis .
" but that is not accurate .
it was a very french affair too . "

mytravel said uk winter bookings were down 9.5 % after it had reduced its uk winter holiday capacity by up to 10 % and raised prices .
the company said it was reducing costs and aiming for a profit margin of 3.5 % in the uk , but was relying on a return to normal levels of summer holiday bookings in order to meet its margin targets .

mice have taken over the commons press gallery i am currently sitting in the press gallery office writing this diary while a small , brown rodent gazes up at me with a look of total disdain on its whiskers .
this mouse has become such a regular visitor i am tempted to give it a name .
others in the press gallery are less enamoured of their new " pets " which , since the summer 's building work , have been running riot throughout the area .
the pest controllers have been called in but , i am told , there may be little they can do .
the traps which have been a permanent feature in the palace for years appear to do no good - the mice avoid them like the , er , plague .
and there is a suspicion they have developed an immunity to poison .
so these super jerrys can probably only be tackled by a squad of equally super toms - and idea previously ruled out as impractical .
still , it gives the lie to the old myth that mice and rats -lrb- never mind reptiles -rrb- ca n't live in the same area .
and there he goes again - across the carpet .
1030 gmt , monday 30 october it is a dilemma movie moguls have presumably had to face many times - what to do with expensive merchandising when your latest film fails to bust any blocks ?
the latest dilemma for john prescott but it may come as a surprise to discover that john prescott is facing the same problem .
in order to promote the office of the deputy prime minister at exhibitions and events , mr prescott spent £ 5,095 over the last four years on branded pens , carrier bags and note pads .
unfortunately for prezza , of course , his department was abolished by tony blair in his last reshuffle .
so , not unreasonably , tory spokesman caroline spelman has asked exactly what the pens are now being used for .
she received the following answer from minister angela smith .
" the odpm branded pens are being used to write with " .
ask a silly question .
but what some tories now want to know is , what is john prescott being used for ? 1030 gmt , wednesday 25 october it seems an attempt by liberal democrat mp bob russell to tick off downing street for failing to be politically correct has backfired on him .
mr russell has stirred up the grey lobby mr russell hit out after he read that the prime minister 's official spokesman had referred to the " black economy " during a briefing with journalists .
he immediately fired off a complaint , telling parliamentary news service , gallery news , the phrase was racist .
" i am shocked that downing street uses the reference ' black economy ' - this term was dropped years ago , certainly by state organisations like customs and excise , to the more sensitively acceptable term ' grey economy ' or ' shadow economy ' . "
the term ' black economy ' has racial overtones .
downing street is thus politically incorrect to use this term . "
this may well be the case , but did 60-year-old , silver -haired mr russell know what he was going to stir up .
with politicians falling over themselves to appeal to the pensioner vote and outlawing ageism , he may want to think again .
i am told there have already been complaints about his remarks and that the term " grey " also now falls foul of the pc police .
i have no idea what the shadow lobby thinks about it all .
1030 gmt , tuesday 24 october bonfire night is approaching so enjoy it - if some mps get their way it may be the last of its kind .
some mps want to ban fireworks a number of backbenchers , led by labour 's lindsay hoyle , believe the time has come to ban fireworks .
there are already restrictions on their sale , but mr hoyle has tabled a commons motion demanding an all-out ban .
he is worried about the distress caused to both residents and pets - which often have to be sedated to help them cope with bonfire night - and the continuing " use and abuse " of them by young people .
and he is urging parliament to impose a complete ban on the private sale of fireworks except for organised displays where a licence should be granted by local authorities .
all well and good , perhaps , but why not go the whole hog and ban bonfire night altogether ?
after all , it does involve a ritualistic burning of effigies of would-be bomber guy fawkes - still a controversial act in some eyes .
but that might take all the fun out of 5 november .
1530 gmt , monday 23 october someone in the parliamentary works department -lrb- perhaps -rrb- clearly has a sense of humour .
rachel whiteread 's sculpture resembles the mysterious box staff and journalists in the press gallery have been bemused by the sudden appearance of a small wooden box in the centre of the canteen - currently being refurbished in preparation for it becoming the bar next year .
is it perhaps a work of art or sculpture similar to " white box " by rachel whiteread recently auctioned at sotheby 's .
now an faq notice has been attached to the thing and reads as follows .
q : what is it ?
a : it is a box .
q : why ?
a : why not ?
q : why is it here ?
a : it has to be somewhere .
q : why ca n't it be somewhere else ?
a : that is a boxist question which we will not dignify with an answer .
q : why does it exist ?
a : 42 .
q : what is underneath it ?
a : service pipes for next year 's bar counter .
-lrb- at last we get to it -rrb- we are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause .
signed by the parliamentary works ?
all very witty .
but has no one noticed something else - something a bit bigger , quite a lot bigger actually , that also appeared overnight right in the middle of the empty canteen area .
something like a large windowless office , or perhaps shed ?
i hate to ask for an explanation of that one .
1500 gmt , thursday 19 october wrekin 's tory mp mark pritchard has not had this best week in parliament .
he has been lobbying party bosses to get him out of the windowless office he is currently occupying into one that allows him to see daylight and blue sky .
in a desperate last bid for a hearing he has now gone so far as to pen an " ode to a window " and fired it off to his party 's deputy chief whip , baroness seccombe -lrb- and , no , i do n't have the words -rrb- .
" i think she liked it .
i will be waiting to see what she says , " he enthused .
he was still waiting in the dark , as it were , when , during questions to commons leader jack straw , he pursued another of the bees in his bonnet .
" can we have an urgent debate on why thousands of car drivers in the borough of telford and wrekin are having their journeys disrupted every single day as a result of the labour leadership 's decision , on that council , to introduce new traffic signals at the ketley brook roundabout and the trench roundabout .
" if the leader of the house does n't believe me , can i invite him to come and see it for himself , " he pleaded .
mr straw 's withering reply : " of course i believe the hon gentleman but i do n't think much of his powers of advocacy if he ca n't get the traffic lights turned round . "
i fear mr straw may soon be receiving an " ode to a traffic light " .
1500 gmt , wednesday 18 october political leaders may be falling over themselves to prove which is the greenest and most concerned about global warming - so it is a change to discover at least one politician who is less than bothered .
global warming threatens a hotter britain former labour frontbencher lord sheldon asked environment minister lord rooker during a peers ' debate what assessment the government had made of the future of climate change .
he received the now-traditional , gloomy reply .
latest reports showed that , by 2100 , global temperatures would have risen by up to 5.8 degrees higher than 1990 , resulting in higher sea levels and more extreme weather .
" for the uk ... scenarios project warmer and wetter winters and hotter and drier summers with more extreme heatwaves , " he declared .
lord sheldon appeared to take heart from this , suggesting that , as global warming could mean a warmer britain it might even be welcomed : " as we have seen this summer " .
so , bring it on , and here 's looking forward to the costa del cambridge in a few years ' time perhaps .
1100 gmt , tuesday 17 october culture secretary tessa jowell 's offices may look impressive from the outside - but they have been hit by a number of problems that have helped land taxpayers with a redecoration bill of more than £ 20,000 over the past five years .
culture secretary 's offices have suffered some problems first , while contractors were cleaning the exterior stone work of the building , normally done with powerful jets of water , the office suffered " an ingress " - that 's a flood to you and me .
-lrb- perhaps someone left a window open -rrb- .
that little incident led to a £ 1,200 redecorating bill in 2002 .
just three years later , however , the same office was repainted again , at a cost of another £ 1,300 .
but that was part of a planned schedule of works .
mind you , only another year later , the entire building was refurbished at a cost of another £ 18,164 .
that too was planned .
but part of that cost was down to replacing furniture " damaged by faulty air conditioning " -lrb- another flood ? -rrb- .
so , that 's a bill for £ 20,664 over the past five years - excluding vat , of course .
perhaps they should n't do so much planning in future and just let events take their course , it might be cheaper .
1330 gmt , thursday 12 october it has come as a bit of a surprise to learn that just five labour mps - notably including clare short - have so far declared their intention of standing down at the next general election .
labour mps have missed resignation deadline that poll may be a good way off yet , but if local constituency parties are to follow labour 's selection procedures they need plenty of time to find a new candidate .
so mps were asked by party hq to inform them by 15 september if they intended to stand down or not .
even allowing a few weeks ' grace , there still appear to have been few takers - there are normally some 30 or 40 who go at each election .
that does not , of course , prevent mps changing their minds over the following months and years .
but , if they leave it too close to the next general election , the selection procedure can be short circuited by party bosses with candidates , in effect , parachuted in to the seat at the last moment .
it has been suggested that mps have previously been leaned on to hold fire on their resignation intentions so the party could put one of their favourites , such as a tory defector , into safe seats .
peerages have , perhaps unsurprisingly , been offered to those mps who carry out this duty for the party .
perhaps also unsurprisingly , there is at least one former mp who still feels aggrieved that the peerage promise he believed he was given was never actually kept .
0930 gmt , wenesday 11 october when nigel farage was recently elected as the new leader of the uk independence party , few of his supporters probably knew how a life-forming event more than two decades ago may have deprived them of their champion .
farage 's career may have taken a different path the young farage 's first love was not politics but golf .
and he was pretty good .
so good , in fact , that at the age of 18 he came within a shot of winning the english schoolboys ' national golf championship played at foxhills .
unfortunately for the budding nick faldo , he dropped a shot on the 18th hole and so failed to win the contest .
had he won , i am told , he would almost certainly have gone professional .
since then , however , politics has become his life and he has n't swung a club in anger for the best part of a decade .
so , golf 's loss was , eventually , ukip 's gain .
1130 gmt , tuesday 10 october so john reid and gordon brown are daggers drawn and squaring up to each other for a fight to the death over the labour leadership are they ?
mr reid : will he challenge mr brown ?
after mr reid 's confident party conference performance - in which he managed to talk up his leadership credentials without actually saying he was interested in the job - that was a reasonable conclusion to draw .
but the latest gossip in westminster is that , after throwing a genuine scare into the brown camp with his speech , mr reid has now reassured the chancellor he has no intention of running against him - that 's code for no chance of beating him .
in return , the chancellor will keep him on the front bench in a senior role - possibly remaining as home secretary - not as his tea boy , as mr reid previously quipped .
so , that speech can be counted a major success as , before he made it , mr reid was expected to be exiled to the backbenches by mr brown once he got into downing street .
but , if true , what could all this mean for tony blair and his little band of supporters ?
they would have to start looking for another champion to " stop gordon " , perhaps with mr blair attempting to hang on as long as possible to allow another contender to emerge .
but after looking at one time or another to david blunkett , alan milburn , alan johnson and uncle tom cobley -lrb- so long as he 's a blairite -rrb- , candidates are thin on the ground .
step forward work and pensions secretary john hutton , your time may be at hand .
that is , after all , how john major ended up tory leader - because he was n't michael heseltine .
then again .

mice have taken over the commons press gallery i am currently sitting in the press gallery office writing this diary while a small , brown rodent gazes up at me with a look of total disdain on its whiskers .
this mouse has become such a regular visitor i am tempted to give it a name .
others in the press gallery are less enamoured of their new " pets " which , since the summer 's building work , have been running riot throughout the area .
the pest controllers have been called in but , i am told , there may be little they can do .
the traps which have been a permanent feature in the palace for years appear to do no good - the mice avoid them like the , er , plague .
and there is a suspicion they have developed an immunity to poison .
so these super jerrys can probably only be tackled by a squad of equally super toms - and idea previously ruled out as impractical .
still , it gives the lie to the old myth that mice and rats -lrb- never mind reptiles -rrb- ca n't live in the same area .
and there he goes again - across the carpet .
1030 gmt , monday 30 october it is a dilemma movie moguls have presumably had to face many times - what to do with expensive merchandising when your latest film fails to bust any blocks ?
the latest dilemma for john prescott but it may come as a surprise to discover that john prescott is facing the same problem .
in order to promote the office of the deputy prime minister at exhibitions and events , mr prescott spent £ 5,095 over the last four years on branded pens , carrier bags and note pads .
unfortunately for prezza , of course , his department was abolished by tony blair in his last reshuffle .
so , not unreasonably , tory spokesman caroline spelman has asked exactly what the pens are now being used for .
she received the following answer from minister angela smith .
" the odpm branded pens are being used to write with " .
ask a silly question .
but what some tories now want to know is , what is john prescott being used for ? 1030 gmt , wednesday 25 october it seems an attempt by liberal democrat mp bob russell to tick off downing street for failing to be politically correct has backfired on him .
mr russell has stirred up the grey lobby mr russell hit out after he read that the prime minister 's official spokesman had referred to the " black economy " during a briefing with journalists .
he immediately fired off a complaint , telling parliamentary news service , gallery news , the phrase was racist .
" i am shocked that downing street uses the reference ' black economy ' - this term was dropped years ago , certainly by state organisations like customs and excise , to the more sensitively acceptable term ' grey economy ' or ' shadow economy ' . "
the term ' black economy ' has racial overtones .
downing street is thus politically incorrect to use this term . "
this may well be the case , but did 60-year-old , silver -haired mr russell know what he was going to stir up .
with politicians falling over themselves to appeal to the pensioner vote and outlawing ageism , he may want to think again .
i am told there have already been complaints about his remarks and that the term " grey " also now falls foul of the pc police .
i have no idea what the shadow lobby thinks about it all .
1030 gmt , tuesday 24 october bonfire night is approaching so enjoy it - if some mps get their way it may be the last of its kind .
some mps want to ban fireworks a number of backbenchers , led by labour 's lindsay hoyle , believe the time has come to ban fireworks .
there are already restrictions on their sale , but mr hoyle has tabled a commons motion demanding an all-out ban .
he is worried about the distress caused to both residents and pets - which often have to be sedated to help them cope with bonfire night - and the continuing " use and abuse " of them by young people .
and he is urging parliament to impose a complete ban on the private sale of fireworks except for organised displays where a licence should be granted by local authorities .
all well and good , perhaps , but why not go the whole hog and ban bonfire night altogether ?
after all , it does involve a ritualistic burning of effigies of would-be bomber guy fawkes - still a controversial act in some eyes .
but that might take all the fun out of 5 november .
1530 gmt , monday 23 october someone in the parliamentary works department -lrb- perhaps -rrb- clearly has a sense of humour .
rachel whiteread 's sculpture resembles the mysterious box staff and journalists in the press gallery have been bemused by the sudden appearance of a small wooden box in the centre of the canteen - currently being refurbished in preparation for it becoming the bar next year .
is it perhaps a work of art or sculpture similar to " white box " by rachel whiteread recently auctioned at sotheby 's .
now an faq notice has been attached to the thing and reads as follows .
q : what is it ?
a : it is a box .
q : why ?
a : why not ?
q : why is it here ?
a : it has to be somewhere .
q : why ca n't it be somewhere else ?
a : that is a boxist question which we will not dignify with an answer .
q : why does it exist ?
a : 42 .
q : what is underneath it ?
a : service pipes for next year 's bar counter .
-lrb- at last we get to it -rrb- we are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause .
signed by the parliamentary works ?
all very witty .
but has no one noticed something else - something a bit bigger , quite a lot bigger actually , that also appeared overnight right in the middle of the empty canteen area .
something like a large windowless office , or perhaps shed ?
i hate to ask for an explanation of that one .
1500 gmt , thursday 19 october wrekin 's tory mp mark pritchard has not had this best week in parliament .
he has been lobbying party bosses to get him out of the windowless office he is currently occupying into one that allows him to see daylight and blue sky .
in a desperate last bid for a hearing he has now gone so far as to pen an " ode to a window " and fired it off to his party 's deputy chief whip , baroness seccombe -lrb- and , no , i do n't have the words -rrb- .
" i think she liked it .
i will be waiting to see what she says , " he enthused .
he was still waiting in the dark , as it were , when , during questions to commons leader jack straw , he pursued another of the bees in his bonnet .
" can we have an urgent debate on why thousands of car drivers in the borough of telford and wrekin are having their journeys disrupted every single day as a result of the labour leadership 's decision , on that council , to introduce new traffic signals at the ketley brook roundabout and the trench roundabout .
" if the leader of the house does n't believe me , can i invite him to come and see it for himself , " he pleaded .
mr straw 's withering reply : " of course i believe the hon gentleman but i do n't think much of his powers of advocacy if he ca n't get the traffic lights turned round . "
i fear mr straw may soon be receiving an " ode to a traffic light " .
1500 gmt , wednesday 18 october political leaders may be falling over themselves to prove which is the greenest and most concerned about global warming - so it is a change to discover at least one politician who is less than bothered .
global warming threatens a hotter britain former labour frontbencher lord sheldon asked environment minister lord rooker during a peers ' debate what assessment the government had made of the future of climate change .
he received the now-traditional , gloomy reply .
latest reports showed that , by 2100 , global temperatures would have risen by up to 5.8 degrees higher than 1990 , resulting in higher sea levels and more extreme weather .
" for the uk ... scenarios project warmer and wetter winters and hotter and drier summers with more extreme heatwaves , " he declared .
lord sheldon appeared to take heart from this , suggesting that , as global warming could mean a warmer britain it might even be welcomed : " as we have seen this summer " .
so , bring it on , and here 's looking forward to the costa del cambridge in a few years ' time perhaps .
1100 gmt , tuesday 17 october culture secretary tessa jowell 's offices may look impressive from the outside - but they have been hit by a number of problems that have helped land taxpayers with a redecoration bill of more than £ 20,000 over the past five years .
culture secretary 's offices have suffered some problems first , while contractors were cleaning the exterior stone work of the building , normally done with powerful jets of water , the office suffered " an ingress " - that 's a flood to you and me .
-lrb- perhaps someone left a window open -rrb- .
that little incident led to a £ 1,200 redecorating bill in 2002 .
just three years later , however , the same office was repainted again , at a cost of another £ 1,300 .
but that was part of a planned schedule of works .
mind you , only another year later , the entire building was refurbished at a cost of another £ 18,164 .
that too was planned .
but part of that cost was down to replacing furniture " damaged by faulty air conditioning " -lrb- another flood ? -rrb- .
so , that 's a bill for £ 20,664 over the past five years - excluding vat , of course .
perhaps they should n't do so much planning in future and just let events take their course , it might be cheaper .
1330 gmt , thursday 12 october it has come as a bit of a surprise to learn that just five labour mps - notably including clare short - have so far declared their intention of standing down at the next general election .
labour mps have missed resignation deadline that poll may be a good way off yet , but if local constituency parties are to follow labour 's selection procedures they need plenty of time to find a new candidate .
so mps were asked by party hq to inform them by 15 september if they intended to stand down or not .
even allowing a few weeks ' grace , there still appear to have been few takers - there are normally some 30 or 40 who go at each election .
that does not , of course , prevent mps changing their minds over the following months and years .
but , if they leave it too close to the next general election , the selection procedure can be short circuited by party bosses with candidates , in effect , parachuted in to the seat at the last moment .
it has been suggested that mps have previously been leaned on to hold fire on their resignation intentions so the party could put one of their favourites , such as a tory defector , into safe seats .
peerages have , perhaps unsurprisingly , been offered to those mps who carry out this duty for the party .
perhaps also unsurprisingly , there is at least one former mp who still feels aggrieved that the peerage promise he believed he was given was never actually kept .
0930 gmt , wenesday 11 october when nigel farage was recently elected as the new leader of the uk independence party , few of his supporters probably knew how a life-forming event more than two decades ago may have deprived them of their champion .
farage 's career may have taken a different path the young farage 's first love was not politics but golf .
and he was pretty good .
so good , in fact , that at the age of 18 he came within a shot of winning the english schoolboys ' national golf championship played at foxhills .
unfortunately for the budding nick faldo , he dropped a shot on the 18th hole and so failed to win the contest .
had he won , i am told , he would almost certainly have gone professional .
since then , however , politics has become his life and he has n't swung a club in anger for the best part of a decade .
so , golf 's loss was , eventually , ukip 's gain .
1130 gmt , tuesday 10 october so john reid and gordon brown are daggers drawn and squaring up to each other for a fight to the death over the labour leadership are they ?
mr reid : will he challenge mr brown ?
after mr reid 's confident party conference performance - in which he managed to talk up his leadership credentials without actually saying he was interested in the job - that was a reasonable conclusion to draw .
but the latest gossip in westminster is that , after throwing a genuine scare into the brown camp with his speech , mr reid has now reassured the chancellor he has no intention of running against him - that 's code for no chance of beating him .
in return , the chancellor will keep him on the front bench in a senior role - possibly remaining as home secretary - not as his tea boy , as mr reid previously quipped .
so , that speech can be counted a major success as , before he made it , mr reid was expected to be exiled to the backbenches by mr brown once he got into downing street .
but , if true , what could all this mean for tony blair and his little band of supporters ?
they would have to start looking for another champion to " stop gordon " , perhaps with mr blair attempting to hang on as long as possible to allow another contender to emerge .
but after looking at one time or another to david blunkett , alan milburn , alan johnson and uncle tom cobley -lrb- so long as he 's a blairite -rrb- , candidates are thin on the ground .
step forward work and pensions secretary john hutton , your time may be at hand .
that is , after all , how john major ended up tory leader - because he was n't michael heseltine .
then again .

1030 gmt , monday 30 october it is a dilemma movie moguls have presumably had to face many times - what to do with expensive merchandising when your latest film fails to bust any blocks ?
the latest dilemma for john prescott but it may come as a surprise to discover that john prescott is facing the same problem .
in order to promote the office of the deputy prime minister at exhibitions and events , mr prescott spent £ 5,095 over the last four years on branded pens , carrier bags and note pads .
unfortunately for prezza , of course , his department was abolished by tony blair in his last reshuffle .
so , not unreasonably , tory spokesman caroline spelman has asked exactly what the pens are now being used for .
she received the following answer from minister angela smith .
" the odpm branded pens are being used to write with " .
ask a silly question .
but what some tories now want to know is , what is john prescott being used for ? 1030 gmt , wednesday 25 october it seems an attempt by liberal democrat mp bob russell to tick off downing street for failing to be politically correct has backfired on him .
mr russell has stirred up the grey lobby mr russell hit out after he read that the prime minister 's official spokesman had referred to the " black economy " during a briefing with journalists .
he immediately fired off a complaint , telling parliamentary news service , gallery news , the phrase was racist .
" i am shocked that downing street uses the reference ' black economy ' - this term was dropped years ago , certainly by state organisations like customs and excise , to the more sensitively acceptable term ' grey economy ' or ' shadow economy ' . "
the term ' black economy ' has racial overtones .
downing street is thus politically incorrect to use this term . "
this may well be the case , but did 60-year-old , silver -haired mr russell know what he was going to stir up .
with politicians falling over themselves to appeal to the pensioner vote and outlawing ageism , he may want to think again .
i am told there have already been complaints about his remarks and that the term " grey " also now falls foul of the pc police .
i have no idea what the shadow lobby thinks about it all .
1030 gmt , tuesday 24 october bonfire night is approaching so enjoy it - if some mps get their way it may be the last of its kind .
some mps want to ban fireworks a number of backbenchers , led by labour 's lindsay hoyle , believe the time has come to ban fireworks .
there are already restrictions on their sale , but mr hoyle has tabled a commons motion demanding an all-out ban .
he is worried about the distress caused to both residents and pets - which often have to be sedated to help them cope with bonfire night - and the continuing " use and abuse " of them by young people .
and he is urging parliament to impose a complete ban on the private sale of fireworks except for organised displays where a licence should be granted by local authorities .
all well and good , perhaps , but why not go the whole hog and ban bonfire night altogether ?
after all , it does involve a ritualistic burning of effigies of would-be bomber guy fawkes - still a controversial act in some eyes .
but that might take all the fun out of 5 november .
1530 gmt , monday 23 october someone in the parliamentary works department -lrb- perhaps -rrb- clearly has a sense of humour .
rachel whiteread 's sculpture resembles the mysterious box staff and journalists in the press gallery have been bemused by the sudden appearance of a small wooden box in the centre of the canteen - currently being refurbished in preparation for it becoming the bar next year .
is it perhaps a work of art or sculpture similar to " white box " by rachel whiteread recently auctioned at sotheby 's .
now an faq notice has been attached to the thing and reads as follows .
q : what is it ?
a : it is a box .
q : why ?
a : why not ?
q : why is it here ?
a : it has to be somewhere .
q : why ca n't it be somewhere else ?
a : that is a boxist question which we will not dignify with an answer .
q : why does it exist ?
a : 42 .
q : what is underneath it ?
a : service pipes for next year 's bar counter .
-lrb- at last we get to it -rrb- we are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause .
signed by the parliamentary works ?
all very witty .
but has no one noticed something else - something a bit bigger , quite a lot bigger actually , that also appeared overnight right in the middle of the empty canteen area .
something like a large windowless office , or perhaps shed ?
i hate to ask for an explanation of that one .
1500 gmt , thursday 19 october wrekin 's tory mp mark pritchard has not had this best week in parliament .
he has been lobbying party bosses to get him out of the windowless office he is currently occupying into one that allows him to see daylight and blue sky .
in a desperate last bid for a hearing he has now gone so far as to pen an " ode to a window " and fired it off to his party 's deputy chief whip , baroness seccombe -lrb- and , no , i do n't have the words -rrb- .
" i think she liked it .
i will be waiting to see what she says , " he enthused .
he was still waiting in the dark , as it were , when , during questions to commons leader jack straw , he pursued another of the bees in his bonnet .
" can we have an urgent debate on why thousands of car drivers in the borough of telford and wrekin are having their journeys disrupted every single day as a result of the labour leadership 's decision , on that council , to introduce new traffic signals at the ketley brook roundabout and the trench roundabout .
" if the leader of the house does n't believe me , can i invite him to come and see it for himself , " he pleaded .
mr straw 's withering reply : " of course i believe the hon gentleman but i do n't think much of his powers of advocacy if he ca n't get the traffic lights turned round . "
i fear mr straw may soon be receiving an " ode to a traffic light " .
1500 gmt , wednesday 18 october political leaders may be falling over themselves to prove which is the greenest and most concerned about global warming - so it is a change to discover at least one politician who is less than bothered .
global warming threatens a hotter britain former labour frontbencher lord sheldon asked environment minister lord rooker during a peers ' debate what assessment the government had made of the future of climate change .
he received the now-traditional , gloomy reply .
latest reports showed that , by 2100 , global temperatures would have risen by up to 5.8 degrees higher than 1990 , resulting in higher sea levels and more extreme weather .
" for the uk ... scenarios project warmer and wetter winters and hotter and drier summers with more extreme heatwaves , " he declared .
lord sheldon appeared to take heart from this , suggesting that , as global warming could mean a warmer britain it might even be welcomed : " as we have seen this summer " .
so , bring it on , and here 's looking forward to the costa del cambridge in a few years ' time perhaps .
1100 gmt , tuesday 17 october culture secretary tessa jowell 's offices may look impressive from the outside - but they have been hit by a number of problems that have helped land taxpayers with a redecoration bill of more than £ 20,000 over the past five years .
culture secretary 's offices have suffered some problems first , while contractors were cleaning the exterior stone work of the building , normally done with powerful jets of water , the office suffered " an ingress " - that 's a flood to you and me .
-lrb- perhaps someone left a window open -rrb- .
that little incident led to a £ 1,200 redecorating bill in 2002 .
just three years later , however , the same office was repainted again , at a cost of another £ 1,300 .
but that was part of a planned schedule of works .
mind you , only another year later , the entire building was refurbished at a cost of another £ 18,164 .
that too was planned .
but part of that cost was down to replacing furniture " damaged by faulty air conditioning " -lrb- another flood ? -rrb- .
so , that 's a bill for £ 20,664 over the past five years - excluding vat , of course .
perhaps they should n't do so much planning in future and just let events take their course , it might be cheaper .
1330 gmt , thursday 12 october it has come as a bit of a surprise to learn that just five labour mps - notably including clare short - have so far declared their intention of standing down at the next general election .
labour mps have missed resignation deadline that poll may be a good way off yet , but if local constituency parties are to follow labour 's selection procedures they need plenty of time to find a new candidate .
so mps were asked by party hq to inform them by 15 september if they intended to stand down or not .
even allowing a few weeks ' grace , there still appear to have been few takers - there are normally some 30 or 40 who go at each election .
that does not , of course , prevent mps changing their minds over the following months and years .
but , if they leave it too close to the next general election , the selection procedure can be short circuited by party bosses with candidates , in effect , parachuted in to the seat at the last moment .
it has been suggested that mps have previously been leaned on to hold fire on their resignation intentions so the party could put one of their favourites , such as a tory defector , into safe seats .
peerages have , perhaps unsurprisingly , been offered to those mps who carry out this duty for the party .
perhaps also unsurprisingly , there is at least one former mp who still feels aggrieved that the peerage promise he believed he was given was never actually kept .
0930 gmt , wenesday 11 october when nigel farage was recently elected as the new leader of the uk independence party , few of his supporters probably knew how a life-forming event more than two decades ago may have deprived them of their champion .
farage 's career may have taken a different path the young farage 's first love was not politics but golf .
and he was pretty good .
so good , in fact , that at the age of 18 he came within a shot of winning the english schoolboys ' national golf championship played at foxhills .
unfortunately for the budding nick faldo , he dropped a shot on the 18th hole and so failed to win the contest .
had he won , i am told , he would almost certainly have gone professional .
since then , however , politics has become his life and he has n't swung a club in anger for the best part of a decade .
so , golf 's loss was , eventually , ukip 's gain .
1130 gmt , tuesday 10 october so john reid and gordon brown are daggers drawn and squaring up to each other for a fight to the death over the labour leadership are they ?
mr reid : will he challenge mr brown ?
after mr reid 's confident party conference performance - in which he managed to talk up his leadership credentials without actually saying he was interested in the job - that was a reasonable conclusion to draw .
but the latest gossip in westminster is that , after throwing a genuine scare into the brown camp with his speech , mr reid has now reassured the chancellor he has no intention of running against him - that 's code for no chance of beating him .
in return , the chancellor will keep him on the front bench in a senior role - possibly remaining as home secretary - not as his tea boy , as mr reid previously quipped .
so , that speech can be counted a major success as , before he made it , mr reid was expected to be exiled to the backbenches by mr brown once he got into downing street .
but , if true , what could all this mean for tony blair and his little band of supporters ?
they would have to start looking for another champion to " stop gordon " , perhaps with mr blair attempting to hang on as long as possible to allow another contender to emerge .
but after looking at one time or another to david blunkett , alan milburn , alan johnson and uncle tom cobley -lrb- so long as he 's a blairite -rrb- , candidates are thin on the ground .
step forward work and pensions secretary john hutton , your time may be at hand .
that is , after all , how john major ended up tory leader - because he was n't michael heseltine .
then again .

1030 gmt , tuesday 24 october bonfire night is approaching so enjoy it - if some mps get their way it may be the last of its kind .
some mps want to ban fireworks a number of backbenchers , led by labour 's lindsay hoyle , believe the time has come to ban fireworks .
there are already restrictions on their sale , but mr hoyle has tabled a commons motion demanding an all-out ban .
he is worried about the distress caused to both residents and pets - which often have to be sedated to help them cope with bonfire night - and the continuing " use and abuse " of them by young people .
and he is urging parliament to impose a complete ban on the private sale of fireworks except for organised displays where a licence should be granted by local authorities .
all well and good , perhaps , but why not go the whole hog and ban bonfire night altogether ?
after all , it does involve a ritualistic burning of effigies of would-be bomber guy fawkes - still a controversial act in some eyes .
but that might take all the fun out of 5 november .
1530 gmt , monday 23 october someone in the parliamentary works department -lrb- perhaps -rrb- clearly has a sense of humour .
rachel whiteread 's sculpture resembles the mysterious box staff and journalists in the press gallery have been bemused by the sudden appearance of a small wooden box in the centre of the canteen - currently being refurbished in preparation for it becoming the bar next year .
is it perhaps a work of art or sculpture similar to " white box " by rachel whiteread recently auctioned at sotheby 's .
now an faq notice has been attached to the thing and reads as follows .
q : what is it ?
a : it is a box .
q : why ?
a : why not ?
q : why is it here ?
a : it has to be somewhere .
q : why ca n't it be somewhere else ?
a : that is a boxist question which we will not dignify with an answer .
q : why does it exist ?
a : 42 .
q : what is underneath it ?
a : service pipes for next year 's bar counter .
-lrb- at last we get to it -rrb- we are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause .
signed by the parliamentary works ?
all very witty .
but has no one noticed something else - something a bit bigger , quite a lot bigger actually , that also appeared overnight right in the middle of the empty canteen area .
something like a large windowless office , or perhaps shed ?
i hate to ask for an explanation of that one .
1500 gmt , thursday 19 october wrekin 's tory mp mark pritchard has not had this best week in parliament .
he has been lobbying party bosses to get him out of the windowless office he is currently occupying into one that allows him to see daylight and blue sky .
in a desperate last bid for a hearing he has now gone so far as to pen an " ode to a window " and fired it off to his party 's deputy chief whip , baroness seccombe -lrb- and , no , i do n't have the words -rrb- .
" i think she liked it .
i will be waiting to see what she says , " he enthused .
he was still waiting in the dark , as it were , when , during questions to commons leader jack straw , he pursued another of the bees in his bonnet .
" can we have an urgent debate on why thousands of car drivers in the borough of telford and wrekin are having their journeys disrupted every single day as a result of the labour leadership 's decision , on that council , to introduce new traffic signals at the ketley brook roundabout and the trench roundabout .
" if the leader of the house does n't believe me , can i invite him to come and see it for himself , " he pleaded .
mr straw 's withering reply : " of course i believe the hon gentleman but i do n't think much of his powers of advocacy if he ca n't get the traffic lights turned round . "
i fear mr straw may soon be receiving an " ode to a traffic light " .
1500 gmt , wednesday 18 october political leaders may be falling over themselves to prove which is the greenest and most concerned about global warming - so it is a change to discover at least one politician who is less than bothered .
global warming threatens a hotter britain former labour frontbencher lord sheldon asked environment minister lord rooker during a peers ' debate what assessment the government had made of the future of climate change .
he received the now-traditional , gloomy reply .
latest reports showed that , by 2100 , global temperatures would have risen by up to 5.8 degrees higher than 1990 , resulting in higher sea levels and more extreme weather .
" for the uk ... scenarios project warmer and wetter winters and hotter and drier summers with more extreme heatwaves , " he declared .
lord sheldon appeared to take heart from this , suggesting that , as global warming could mean a warmer britain it might even be welcomed : " as we have seen this summer " .
so , bring it on , and here 's looking forward to the costa del cambridge in a few years ' time perhaps .
1100 gmt , tuesday 17 october culture secretary tessa jowell 's offices may look impressive from the outside - but they have been hit by a number of problems that have helped land taxpayers with a redecoration bill of more than £ 20,000 over the past five years .
culture secretary 's offices have suffered some problems first , while contractors were cleaning the exterior stone work of the building , normally done with powerful jets of water , the office suffered " an ingress " - that 's a flood to you and me .
-lrb- perhaps someone left a window open -rrb- .
that little incident led to a £ 1,200 redecorating bill in 2002 .
just three years later , however , the same office was repainted again , at a cost of another £ 1,300 .
but that was part of a planned schedule of works .
mind you , only another year later , the entire building was refurbished at a cost of another £ 18,164 .
that too was planned .
but part of that cost was down to replacing furniture " damaged by faulty air conditioning " -lrb- another flood ? -rrb- .
so , that 's a bill for £ 20,664 over the past five years - excluding vat , of course .
perhaps they should n't do so much planning in future and just let events take their course , it might be cheaper .
1330 gmt , thursday 12 october it has come as a bit of a surprise to learn that just five labour mps - notably including clare short - have so far declared their intention of standing down at the next general election .
labour mps have missed resignation deadline that poll may be a good way off yet , but if local constituency parties are to follow labour 's selection procedures they need plenty of time to find a new candidate .
so mps were asked by party hq to inform them by 15 september if they intended to stand down or not .
even allowing a few weeks ' grace , there still appear to have been few takers - there are normally some 30 or 40 who go at each election .
that does not , of course , prevent mps changing their minds over the following months and years .
but , if they leave it too close to the next general election , the selection procedure can be short circuited by party bosses with candidates , in effect , parachuted in to the seat at the last moment .
it has been suggested that mps have previously been leaned on to hold fire on their resignation intentions so the party could put one of their favourites , such as a tory defector , into safe seats .
peerages have , perhaps unsurprisingly , been offered to those mps who carry out this duty for the party .
perhaps also unsurprisingly , there is at least one former mp who still feels aggrieved that the peerage promise he believed he was given was never actually kept .
0930 gmt , wenesday 11 october when nigel farage was recently elected as the new leader of the uk independence party , few of his supporters probably knew how a life-forming event more than two decades ago may have deprived them of their champion .
farage 's career may have taken a different path the young farage 's first love was not politics but golf .
and he was pretty good .
so good , in fact , that at the age of 18 he came within a shot of winning the english schoolboys ' national golf championship played at foxhills .
unfortunately for the budding nick faldo , he dropped a shot on the 18th hole and so failed to win the contest .
had he won , i am told , he would almost certainly have gone professional .
since then , however , politics has become his life and he has n't swung a club in anger for the best part of a decade .
so , golf 's loss was , eventually , ukip 's gain .
1130 gmt , tuesday 10 october so john reid and gordon brown are daggers drawn and squaring up to each other for a fight to the death over the labour leadership are they ?
mr reid : will he challenge mr brown ?
after mr reid 's confident party conference performance - in which he managed to talk up his leadership credentials without actually saying he was interested in the job - that was a reasonable conclusion to draw .
but the latest gossip in westminster is that , after throwing a genuine scare into the brown camp with his speech , mr reid has now reassured the chancellor he has no intention of running against him - that 's code for no chance of beating him .
in return , the chancellor will keep him on the front bench in a senior role - possibly remaining as home secretary - not as his tea boy , as mr reid previously quipped .
so , that speech can be counted a major success as , before he made it , mr reid was expected to be exiled to the backbenches by mr brown once he got into downing street .
but , if true , what could all this mean for tony blair and his little band of supporters ?
they would have to start looking for another champion to " stop gordon " , perhaps with mr blair attempting to hang on as long as possible to allow another contender to emerge .
but after looking at one time or another to david blunkett , alan milburn , alan johnson and uncle tom cobley -lrb- so long as he 's a blairite -rrb- , candidates are thin on the ground .
step forward work and pensions secretary john hutton , your time may be at hand .
that is , after all , how john major ended up tory leader - because he was n't michael heseltine .
then again .

mice have taken over the commons press gallery i am currently sitting in the press gallery office writing this diary while a small , brown rodent gazes up at me with a look of total disdain on its whiskers .
this mouse has become such a regular visitor i am tempted to give it a name .
others in the press gallery are less enamoured of their new " pets " which , since the summer 's building work , have been running riot throughout the area .
the pest controllers have been called in but , i am told , there may be little they can do .
the traps which have been a permanent feature in the palace for years appear to do no good - the mice avoid them like the , er , plague .
and there is a suspicion they have developed an immunity to poison .
so these super jerrys can probably only be tackled by a squad of equally super toms - and idea previously ruled out as impractical .
still , it gives the lie to the old myth that mice and rats -lrb- never mind reptiles -rrb- ca n't live in the same area .
and there he goes again - across the carpet .
1030 gmt , monday 30 october it is a dilemma movie moguls have presumably had to face many times - what to do with expensive merchandising when your latest film fails to bust any blocks ?
the latest dilemma for john prescott but it may come as a surprise to discover that john prescott is facing the same problem .
in order to promote the office of the deputy prime minister at exhibitions and events , mr prescott spent £ 5,095 over the last four years on branded pens , carrier bags and note pads .
unfortunately for prezza , of course , his department was abolished by tony blair in his last reshuffle .
so , not unreasonably , tory spokesman caroline spelman has asked exactly what the pens are now being used for .
she received the following answer from minister angela smith .
" the odpm branded pens are being used to write with " .
ask a silly question .
but what some tories now want to know is , what is john prescott being used for ? 1030 gmt , wednesday 25 october it seems an attempt by liberal democrat mp bob russell to tick off downing street for failing to be politically correct has backfired on him .
mr russell has stirred up the grey lobby mr russell hit out after he read that the prime minister 's official spokesman had referred to the " black economy " during a briefing with journalists .
he immediately fired off a complaint , telling parliamentary news service , gallery news , the phrase was racist .
" i am shocked that downing street uses the reference ' black economy ' - this term was dropped years ago , certainly by state organisations like customs and excise , to the more sensitively acceptable term ' grey economy ' or ' shadow economy ' . "
the term ' black economy ' has racial overtones .
downing street is thus politically incorrect to use this term . "
this may well be the case , but did 60-year-old , silver -haired mr russell know what he was going to stir up .
with politicians falling over themselves to appeal to the pensioner vote and outlawing ageism , he may want to think again .
i am told there have already been complaints about his remarks and that the term " grey " also now falls foul of the pc police .
i have no idea what the shadow lobby thinks about it all .

signed by the parliamentary works ?
all very witty .
but has no one noticed something else - something a bit bigger , quite a lot bigger actually , that also appeared overnight right in the middle of the empty canteen area .
something like a large windowless office , or perhaps shed ?
i hate to ask for an explanation of that one .
1500 gmt , thursday 19 october wrekin 's tory mp mark pritchard has not had this best week in parliament .
he has been lobbying party bosses to get him out of the windowless office he is currently occupying into one that allows him to see daylight and blue sky .
in a desperate last bid for a hearing he has now gone so far as to pen an " ode to a window " and fired it off to his party 's deputy chief whip , baroness seccombe -lrb- and , no , i do n't have the words -rrb- .
" i think she liked it .
i will be waiting to see what she says , " he enthused .
he was still waiting in the dark , as it were , when , during questions to commons leader jack straw , he pursued another of the bees in his bonnet .
" can we have an urgent debate on why thousands of car drivers in the borough of telford and wrekin are having their journeys disrupted every single day as a result of the labour leadership 's decision , on that council , to introduce new traffic signals at the ketley brook roundabout and the trench roundabout .
" if the leader of the house does n't believe me , can i invite him to come and see it for himself , " he pleaded .
mr straw 's withering reply : " of course i believe the hon gentleman but i do n't think much of his powers of advocacy if he ca n't get the traffic lights turned round . "
i fear mr straw may soon be receiving an " ode to a traffic light " .
1500 gmt , wednesday 18 october political leaders may be falling over themselves to prove which is the greenest and most concerned about global warming - so it is a change to discover at least one politician who is less than bothered .
former labour frontbencher lord sheldon asked environment minister lord rooker during a peers ' debate what assessment the government had made of the future of climate change .
he received the now-traditional , gloomy reply .
latest reports showed that , by 2100 , global temperatures would have risen by up to 5.8 degrees higher than 1990 , resulting in higher sea levels and more extreme weather .
" for the uk ... scenarios project warmer and wetter winters and hotter and drier summers with more extreme heatwaves , " he declared .
lord sheldon appeared to take heart from this , suggesting that , as global warming could mean a warmer britain it might even be welcomed : " as we have seen this summer " .
so , bring it on , and here 's looking forward to the costa del cambridge in a few years ' time perhaps .
1100 gmt , tuesday 17 october culture secretary tessa jowell 's offices may look impressive from the outside - but they have been hit by a number of problems that have helped land taxpayers with a redecoration bill of more than £ 20,000 over the past five years .
first , while contractors were cleaning the exterior stone work of the building , normally done with powerful jets of water , the office suffered " an ingress " - that 's a flood to you and me .
-lrb- perhaps someone left a window open -rrb- .
that little incident led to a £ 1,200 redecorating bill in 2002 .
just three years later , however , the same office was repainted again , at a cost of another £ 1,300 .
but that was part of a planned schedule of works .
mind you , only another year later , the entire building was refurbished at a cost of another £ 18,164 .
that too was planned .
but part of that cost was down to replacing furniture " damaged by faulty air conditioning " -lrb- another flood ? -rrb- .
so , that 's a bill for £ 20,664 over the past five years - excluding vat , of course .
perhaps they should n't do so much planning in future and just let events take their course , it might be cheaper .
1330 gmt , thursday 12 october it has come as a bit of a surprise to learn that just five labour mps - notably including clare short - have so far declared their intention of standing down at the next general election .
that poll may be a good way off yet , but if local constituency parties are to follow labour 's selection procedures they need plenty of time to find a new candidate .
so mps were asked by party hq to inform them by 15 september if they intended to stand down or not .
even allowing a few weeks ' grace , there still appear to have been few takers - there are normally some 30 or 40 who go at each election .
that does not , of course , prevent mps changing their minds over the following months and years .
but , if they leave it too close to the next general election , the selection procedure can be short circuited by party bosses with candidates , in effect , parachuted in to the seat at the last moment .
it has been suggested that mps have previously been leaned on to hold fire on their resignation intentions so the party could put one of their favourites , such as a tory defector , into safe seats .
peerages have , perhaps unsurprisingly , been offered to those mps who carry out this duty for the party .
perhaps also unsurprisingly , there is at least one former mp who still feels aggrieved that the peerage promise he believed he was given was never actually kept .
0930 gmt , wenesday 11 october when nigel farage was recently elected as the new leader of the uk independence party , few of his supporters probably knew how a life-forming event more than two decades ago may have deprived them of their champion .
the young farage 's first love was not politics but golf .
and he was pretty good .
so good , in fact , that at the age of 18 he came within a shot of winning the english schoolboys ' national golf championship played at foxhills .
unfortunately for the budding nick faldo , he dropped a shot on the 18th hole and so failed to win the contest .
had he won , i am told , he would almost certainly have gone professional .
since then , however , politics has become his life and he has n't swung a club in anger for the best part of a decade .
so , golf 's loss was , eventually , ukip 's gain .
1130 gmt , tuesday 10 october so john reid and gordon brown are daggers drawn and squaring up to each other for a fight to the death over the labour leadership are they ?
after mr reid 's confident party conference performance - in which he managed to talk up his leadership credentials without actually saying he was interested in the job - that was a reasonable conclusion to draw .
but the latest gossip in westminster is that , after throwing a genuine scare into the brown camp with his speech , mr reid has now reassured the chancellor he has no intention of running against him - that 's code for no chance of beating him .
in return , the chancellor will keep him on the front bench in a senior role - possibly remaining as home secretary - not as his tea boy , as mr reid previously quipped .
so , that speech can be counted a major success as , before he made it , mr reid was expected to be exiled to the backbenches by mr brown once he got into downing street .
but , if true , what could all this mean for tony blair and his little band of supporters ?
they would have to start looking for another champion to " stop gordon " , perhaps with mr blair attempting to hang on as long as possible to allow another contender to emerge .
but after looking at one time or another to david blunkett , alan milburn , alan johnson and uncle tom cobley -lrb- so long as he 's a blairite -rrb- , candidates are thin on the ground .
step forward work and pensions secretary john hutton , your time may be at hand .
that is , after all , how john major ended up tory leader - because he was n't michael heseltine .
then again .

we read and value all your e-mails but we can not promise a reply .
we would also like to know about your encounters with numbers , whether mystifying , strange or even beautiful .
and we hope you will join us in keeping a watchful eye on the way numbers are used and reported .
read e-mails responding to topics in the summer 2006 series comments from this series school league tables odometers cherry capital airport nhs waiting targets unintended consequences the views expressed on these pages are not necessarily the views of the bbc .
the comments published will reflect the balance of views we receive .
school league tables the measure which is being proposed for cva is deeply flawed .
for example , analysis reveals that students in larger cohorts are more successful than those in smaller ones .
this has been built into the model as an environmental factor , so that larger institutions will have to perform better than smaller ones in order to achieve the same value-added result .
to put it another way , a student with a particular set of gcse grades who achieves a particular set of a level results will be judged to have gained a higher value-added score simply by attending a school sixth form instead of a sixth form college or fe college .
how can this possibly assist in making a fair comparison between institutions ?
this is not the only flaw in the methodology , but it is the easiest to illustrate .
the whole thing needs to be taken back to the drawing board , but the government seems determined to press on and simply wo n't listen to the arguments .
alan pucill , uk at last the issue of education league tables and the ' judgements ' that people are invited to make from those has been challenged by this programme .
it is a shame that other , more high-profile programmes and presenters have not addressed this issue earlier as it is -lrb- imho -rrb- the most important one in education .
why ?
because education has now become largely a matter of passing through hoops rather than children being properly educated , and the uk will pay an enormously heavy price for this in the next few decades .
as a former headteacher , i opposed their ever-expanding role in schools .
when they collapse , as they surely will once their detrimental effect has finally been accepted , then do n't expect the government of the day to turn to professionals such as me for advice .
oh no ... they 'll still be relying on those who got them in this mess ... and carried on digging once they saw themselves in a hole !
john , france odometers one point is to remember tyre wear : eg take a 65 cm diameter tyre .
this has a circumference of 204.20cm.
assuming a tread depth of 8mm when new and 3mm when worn , the diameter of a worn tyre is only 201.06 cm , about 1.5 % less .
that means that the odometer will read about 1.5 % more with worn tyres -lrb- more revolutions for the same distance -rrb- than with new ones .
david hewitt as a car tester for the aa over the last 35 years , i must have corrected the indicated speeds and distance recorders of over 1,500 new cars .
the inaccuracy of odometers varies from -1.5 % to + 2.5 % on most tested , with less than 10 % proving to be spot-on - and another 10 % of cars with odometer error greater than the above , mostly on the plus side .
speedometers are invariably optimistic , nowadays by anything up to 10 % - which is particularly galling , when you think about it ; it means that the law-abiding motorist who sticks faithfully to the speed limit is actually driving slower than the law requires .
in the majority of new cars , this error is built-in to comply with eu rules that permit no speedometer to under-read the true speed , but allows the instrument to over-read by a generous margin .
in fairness to the car-makers , the fact that the same model usually is available with a range of wheels and tyres of varying dimensions , means that the car 's overall gearing and therefore its speedometer accuracy will be affected by up to 2 % ; this still does not justify any greater optimism , however and today 's electronically driven instruments could be tweaked for greater accuracy on the production line , in a way that would have been impractical in the past , when both instruments were cable-driven from the gearbox .
it is salutary to remember that a car with a set of over-reading -lrb- ie optimistic -rrb- instruments will seem to be giving more miles to the gallon - and it will also be taken in for servicing sooner than is strictly necessary !
however , there is something we can do to correct both distance and speed indicated by our cars .
the uk motorways have reliable distance posts on the hard-shoulder at intervals of one-tenth of a kilometre - and they are conveniently numbered as well .
listeners to the programme will be quick to realise that when traffic is quiet , the responsible driver armed with a stop-watch and a willing passenger will cover a true 10 miles between 161 posts .
in addition , if one times the car at a steady , unvarying speed over 1km / 10 posts , then divides the time -lrb- in seconds -rrb- into 2237 , the answer will be one 's true speed over the measured distance .
peter de nayer the reason why the new car showed a different distance for travelling to work is simply because the new tyres with the deeper tread have a slightly increased diameter , and hence a slightly increased circumference and so they rotate fewer times for the same distance - i do n't expect that the enquirer traded in his old car with brand new tyres !
i have checked this with calculations based on the difference in tread depth and practically by finding that every time i drove down to london to my parents with new front tyres the distance of 210 miles would always be reduced to 208 .
dr trevor r. griffiths being in the gps business i happen to have an extremely accurate professional gps receiver which measures speed to an accuracy of 0.1 mph .
i 've used it in many different cars and have never found one with a speedometer more accurate than 2 % between 30 and 70 mph .
mainly , they 're in the 3-6 % range , and they always over-read .
the odometer , being driven from the same source , has the same accuracy .
i 'm told by friends in the car trade that this is quite deliberate .
it helps to convince drivers they 're getting better fuel consumption than they really are and the police like it because drivers think they 're going faster than they actually are .
the downside is that those pernickety drivers who like to drive at exactly the speed limit are only doing 65 , 47 , 28 mph etc .
this assumes the car has the correct tyres fitted , they 're new and they 're properly inflated .
a well-worn set of tyres rolls faster -lrb- smaller diameter -rrb- and makes the difference much bigger - over 10 % .
walter blanchard i predict that if your correspondent were to carpool with colleagues on his drive to work , he would seem to travel a longer distance than when he travelled alone !
the reason is that the odometer counts the number of wheel revolutions .
with a greater weight the tyres are compressed and their effective radius is smaller - more rotations per actual mile , and a greater reading on the odometer !
the same would be true in a different car - depending on the tyres installed , their degree of inflation and their wear .
chris cherry capital airport some thoughts on the cherry capital airport problem : 1 .
it 's a hotbed for hitch-hikers .
that is people hitch-hike in , but fly out .
as you do n't buy a ticket to hitch-hike there is no easy way to count people arriving .
2 .
there 's a perceived benefit to being born there .
hence pregnant women arrive as one but leave as two .
3 .
people are leaving the area but the effect is masked by a high birth rate .
4 .
they ca n't count !
or rather there is some defect in the way in which the data is gathered .
are people arriving as operational air-crew but leaving off-duty and are then counted as passengers ?
well alright if this were true there should be lots of ' planes being left there as there 's nobody to fly them out .
maybe they need less crew when they leave than they do when they arrive .
5 .
are people arriving by bus or boat and then flying out ? 6 .
is there a problem buying new cars locally ?
do you have to fly out and then drive back in your newly bought car ?
philip i 'anson , united kingdom the reason why the people leaving any american town by air are less than those arriving could be so many that it is hard to run out of ideas .
there could be cases when there are more arrivals that departures , but in many instances : - some will leave to buy a vehicle that for one reason or another they can buy much cheaper elsewhere , or is not stocked locally .
they will return in it .
some will leave by air to arrive urgently where required at short notice , not knowing when the may return , and come back by train .
others will leave to get medical treatment and die away .
some will leave to live elsewhere .
some will be criminals born locally leaving the state to escape the law .
some will be emigrating .
people moving in from elsewhere will come with a car if they have one , not by air the list is endless .
examine birth and death and population figures , not just airport movements .
there is no reason why these should match .
james baring , uk annually around 3,000-4,000 more passengers fly out than fly in .
the annual passenger total is 200,000 .
we have been told that the local population is not shrinking .
however , we do not know the local birth or death figures .
this would be a good place to look .
if the population remains constant then either there must be more births than deaths or the extra passengers must be travelling in .
wikipedia provides a possible clue .
the local economy majors on cherries , grapes and tourism .
typical workers in these industries are young and short of money .
the industries are seasonal and workers often stay for short periods of time .
my suggestion is that the additional air travellers have drifted in by train , greyhound bus or by hitching a lift and after earning some money they can afford to fly out .
david parkinson , uk nhs waiting targets interesting programme about the corrosive effects of targets .
but it does n't just affect the nhs - it 's corrupting the whole of the public sector .
i have personal experience of the effect in hmrc -lsb- hm revenue and customs -rsb- and a former colleague now in the police confirms that it applies there as well .
there 's a temptation to take the easy option , making it look as though performance is good / improving whilst actual performance is declining .
senior managers tend to move on before the real effects are recognised .
it 's outcomes that count , not outputs , but outcomes are harder to measure objectively and subjective measures of course are out of the question .
you should extend your examination of the subject to the rest of the public sector .
crude performance targets are so corrupting , but the government can hardly complain - they are the experts in spin .
phil jones , wales return to top unintended consequences this week you asked for examples of unintended consequences , i can offer you two , both resulting from the same policy .
many years ago i worked for a major multinational company and they had introduced a performance rating system where all employees were graded by their managers on a scale of 1 to 5 - 1 being excellent , 5 being a very sad case indeed .
the company also issued an edict that the performance ratings were to conform to the standard bell curve / normal distribution .
however , it was quite genuinely the case that performance ratings were skewed towards the top end -lrb- this almost always happens -rrb- .
so , there was a shortage of poor performers ; and managers competed with one another to obtain a poor performer or two in order to make their numbers fit .
in short , there was an internal market for poor performers .
the other unintended consequence became apparent when someone in head office noticed that in one country nobody was graded more than a 3 .
the country manager 's explanation for this was that as he himself was graded a 3 , he could n't possibly have anybody working for him whose performance grade exceeded his own .
he managed to present this case as if it were a perfectly logical outcome .
dr valerie stewart , uk i always remember a story my dad showed me -lrb- unfortunately i do n't remember the origins -rrb- .
bus drivers were told that they had to do their utmost to stick to their timetables .
management were soon inundated with complaints about buses whizzing past stops full of people .
when confronted a representative of the drivers said , " well we ca n't stick to the timetable if we have to stop and pick up passengers ! "
thanks for an interesting programme .

apple has lodged a planning application to open a store at 147 buchanan street , a grade a building .
if given the go-ahead by glasgow city council , work could start on the £ 1m store in the spring of 2007 and could be completed by mid-summer .
the local authority received the planning application in mid-october .
apple has seven stores in the uk the site of their proposed glasgow store is currently occupied by home-furnishing retailer the pier .

we read and value all your e-mails but we can not promise a reply .
we would also like to know about your encounters with numbers , whether mystifying , strange or even beautiful .
and we hope you will join us in keeping a watchful eye on the way numbers are used and reported .
read e-mails responding to topics in the summer 2006 series comments from this series school league tables odometers cherry capital airport nhs waiting targets unintended consequences the views expressed on these pages are not necessarily the views of the bbc .
the comments published will reflect the balance of views we receive .
school league tables the measure which is being proposed for cva is deeply flawed .
for example , analysis reveals that students in larger cohorts are more successful than those in smaller ones .
this has been built into the model as an environmental factor , so that larger institutions will have to perform better than smaller ones in order to achieve the same value-added result .
to put it another way , a student with a particular set of gcse grades who achieves a particular set of a level results will be judged to have gained a higher value-added score simply by attending a school sixth form instead of a sixth form college or fe college .
how can this possibly assist in making a fair comparison between institutions ?
this is not the only flaw in the methodology , but it is the easiest to illustrate .
the whole thing needs to be taken back to the drawing board , but the government seems determined to press on and simply wo n't listen to the arguments .
alan pucill , uk at last the issue of education league tables and the ' judgements ' that people are invited to make from those has been challenged by this programme .
it is a shame that other , more high-profile programmes and presenters have not addressed this issue earlier as it is -lrb- imho -rrb- the most important one in education .
why ?
because education has now become largely a matter of passing through hoops rather than children being properly educated , and the uk will pay an enormously heavy price for this in the next few decades .
as a former headteacher , i opposed their ever-expanding role in schools .
when they collapse , as they surely will once their detrimental effect has finally been accepted , then do n't expect the government of the day to turn to professionals such as me for advice .
oh no ... they 'll still be relying on those who got them in this mess ... and carried on digging once they saw themselves in a hole !
john , france odometers one point is to remember tyre wear : eg take a 65 cm diameter tyre .
this has a circumference of 204.20cm.
assuming a tread depth of 8mm when new and 3mm when worn , the diameter of a worn tyre is only 201.06 cm , about 1.5 % less .
that means that the odometer will read about 1.5 % more with worn tyres -lrb- more revolutions for the same distance -rrb- than with new ones .
david hewitt as a car tester for the aa over the last 35 years , i must have corrected the indicated speeds and distance recorders of over 1,500 new cars .
the inaccuracy of odometers varies from -1.5 % to + 2.5 % on most tested , with less than 10 % proving to be spot-on - and another 10 % of cars with odometer error greater than the above , mostly on the plus side .
speedometers are invariably optimistic , nowadays by anything up to 10 % - which is particularly galling , when you think about it ; it means that the law-abiding motorist who sticks faithfully to the speed limit is actually driving slower than the law requires .
in the majority of new cars , this error is built-in to comply with eu rules that permit no speedometer to under-read the true speed , but allows the instrument to over-read by a generous margin .
in fairness to the car-makers , the fact that the same model usually is available with a range of wheels and tyres of varying dimensions , means that the car 's overall gearing and therefore its speedometer accuracy will be affected by up to 2 % ; this still does not justify any greater optimism , however and today 's electronically driven instruments could be tweaked for greater accuracy on the production line , in a way that would have been impractical in the past , when both instruments were cable-driven from the gearbox .
it is salutary to remember that a car with a set of over-reading -lrb- ie optimistic -rrb- instruments will seem to be giving more miles to the gallon - and it will also be taken in for servicing sooner than is strictly necessary !
however , there is something we can do to correct both distance and speed indicated by our cars .
the uk motorways have reliable distance posts on the hard-shoulder at intervals of one-tenth of a kilometre - and they are conveniently numbered as well .
listeners to the programme will be quick to realise that when traffic is quiet , the responsible driver armed with a stop-watch and a willing passenger will cover a true 10 miles between 161 posts .
in addition , if one times the car at a steady , unvarying speed over 1km / 10 posts , then divides the time -lrb- in seconds -rrb- into 2237 , the answer will be one 's true speed over the measured distance .
peter de nayer the reason why the new car showed a different distance for travelling to work is simply because the new tyres with the deeper tread have a slightly increased diameter , and hence a slightly increased circumference and so they rotate fewer times for the same distance - i do n't expect that the enquirer traded in his old car with brand new tyres !
i have checked this with calculations based on the difference in tread depth and practically by finding that every time i drove down to london to my parents with new front tyres the distance of 210 miles would always be reduced to 208 .
dr trevor r. griffiths being in the gps business i happen to have an extremely accurate professional gps receiver which measures speed to an accuracy of 0.1 mph .
i 've used it in many different cars and have never found one with a speedometer more accurate than 2 % between 30 and 70 mph .
mainly , they 're in the 3-6 % range , and they always over-read .
the odometer , being driven from the same source , has the same accuracy .
i 'm told by friends in the car trade that this is quite deliberate .
it helps to convince drivers they 're getting better fuel consumption than they really are and the police like it because drivers think they 're going faster than they actually are .
the downside is that those pernickety drivers who like to drive at exactly the speed limit are only doing 65 , 47 , 28 mph etc .
this assumes the car has the correct tyres fitted , they 're new and they 're properly inflated .
a well-worn set of tyres rolls faster -lrb- smaller diameter -rrb- and makes the difference much bigger - over 10 % .
walter blanchard i predict that if your correspondent were to carpool with colleagues on his drive to work , he would seem to travel a longer distance than when he travelled alone !
the reason is that the odometer counts the number of wheel revolutions .
with a greater weight the tyres are compressed and their effective radius is smaller - more rotations per actual mile , and a greater reading on the odometer !
the same would be true in a different car - depending on the tyres installed , their degree of inflation and their wear .
chris cherry capital airport some thoughts on the cherry capital airport problem : 1 .
it 's a hotbed for hitch-hikers .
that is people hitch-hike in , but fly out .
as you do n't buy a ticket to hitch-hike there is no easy way to count people arriving .
2 .
there 's a perceived benefit to being born there .
hence pregnant women arrive as one but leave as two .
3 .
people are leaving the area but the effect is masked by a high birth rate .
4 .
they ca n't count !
or rather there is some defect in the way in which the data is gathered .
are people arriving as operational air-crew but leaving off-duty and are then counted as passengers ?
well alright if this were true there should be lots of ' planes being left there as there 's nobody to fly them out .
maybe they need less crew when they leave than they do when they arrive .
5 .
are people arriving by bus or boat and then flying out ? 6 .
is there a problem buying new cars locally ?
do you have to fly out and then drive back in your newly bought car ?
philip i 'anson , united kingdom the reason why the people leaving any american town by air are less than those arriving could be so many that it is hard to run out of ideas .
there could be cases when there are more arrivals that departures , but in many instances : - some will leave to buy a vehicle that for one reason or another they can buy much cheaper elsewhere , or is not stocked locally .
they will return in it .
some will leave by air to arrive urgently where required at short notice , not knowing when the may return , and come back by train .
others will leave to get medical treatment and die away .
some will leave to live elsewhere .
some will be criminals born locally leaving the state to escape the law .
some will be emigrating .
people moving in from elsewhere will come with a car if they have one , not by air the list is endless .
examine birth and death and population figures , not just airport movements .
there is no reason why these should match .
james baring , uk annually around 3,000-4,000 more passengers fly out than fly in .
the annual passenger total is 200,000 .
we have been told that the local population is not shrinking .
however , we do not know the local birth or death figures .
this would be a good place to look .
if the population remains constant then either there must be more births than deaths or the extra passengers must be travelling in .
wikipedia provides a possible clue .
the local economy majors on cherries , grapes and tourism .
typical workers in these industries are young and short of money .
the industries are seasonal and workers often stay for short periods of time .
my suggestion is that the additional air travellers have drifted in by train , greyhound bus or by hitching a lift and after earning some money they can afford to fly out .
david parkinson , uk nhs waiting targets interesting programme about the corrosive effects of targets .
but it does n't just affect the nhs - it 's corrupting the whole of the public sector .
i have personal experience of the effect in hmrc -lsb- hm revenue and customs -rsb- and a former colleague now in the police confirms that it applies there as well .
there 's a temptation to take the easy option , making it look as though performance is good / improving whilst actual performance is declining .
senior managers tend to move on before the real effects are recognised .
it 's outcomes that count , not outputs , but outcomes are harder to measure objectively and subjective measures of course are out of the question .
you should extend your examination of the subject to the rest of the public sector .
crude performance targets are so corrupting , but the government can hardly complain - they are the experts in spin .
phil jones , wales return to top unintended consequences this week you asked for examples of unintended consequences , i can offer you two , both resulting from the same policy .
many years ago i worked for a major multinational company and they had introduced a performance rating system where all employees were graded by their managers on a scale of 1 to 5 - 1 being excellent , 5 being a very sad case indeed .
the company also issued an edict that the performance ratings were to conform to the standard bell curve / normal distribution .
however , it was quite genuinely the case that performance ratings were skewed towards the top end -lrb- this almost always happens -rrb- .
so , there was a shortage of poor performers ; and managers competed with one another to obtain a poor performer or two in order to make their numbers fit .
in short , there was an internal market for poor performers .
the other unintended consequence became apparent when someone in head office noticed that in one country nobody was graded more than a 3 .
the country manager 's explanation for this was that as he himself was graded a 3 , he could n't possibly have anybody working for him whose performance grade exceeded his own .
he managed to present this case as if it were a perfectly logical outcome .
dr valerie stewart , uk i always remember a story my dad showed me -lrb- unfortunately i do n't remember the origins -rrb- .
bus drivers were told that they had to do their utmost to stick to their timetables .
management were soon inundated with complaints about buses whizzing past stops full of people .
when confronted a representative of the drivers said , " well we ca n't stick to the timetable if we have to stop and pick up passengers ! "
thanks for an interesting programme .
