as part of the middle east quartet , germany and the eu have a vested interest in the israeli elections .
german middle east expert günter meyer , however , says that the influence on israel 's policies is waning . from the european perspective , which election outcome would most benefit the peace process ? the only party which has clearly set itself the goal of pushing forward with the peace process is the yachad party -lrb- " togetherness " -rrb- .
it calls for the israeli withdrawal from territory occupied in 1967 and a return to the oslo peace process .
if that were to take place , it would make peace with the palestinians a real possibility .
but this political goal is not representative of the majority in the election .
at the most five representatives from yachad will be elected . if he wins , ehud olmert has promised to establish the permanent boundaries of israel by the year 2010 .
is that a strategy germany and europe could accept or do you foresee difficulties with his plans ? the eu and germany could support the basic goal of establishing permanent borders , but only if the national boundaries respect international law .
however , that has not been the case up to now : the partially erected security fence – or apartheid wall as the palestinians call it – cuts out large chunks of occupied territory and attributes them to israel .
also the intended israeli annexation of east jerusalem , the large jewish settlements and the occupation of the eastern jordan valley are all clear breaches of international law .
finally , the one-sided definition of national borders – that is without incorporating palestinians in the negotiations – is completely unacceptable .
the result would be a forced , non-sustainable palestinian state and there would be no chance of peace in the middle east . how much political influence do germany and the eu have at the moment as part of the middle east quartet ? german and european influence on israel 's politics is close to nothing .
on the palestinian side , however , europe 's economic and humanitarian support is absolutely essential if we want to avoid further chaos and destabilization in the territories . how has germany 's role in the middle east changed since the government under chancellor angela merkel came into power ? the new government has shifted its political priorities unequivocally in favor of israel .
by doing so it has lost in the eyes of the palestinians and the rest of the arab world its trustworthiness as an impartial negotiator in the conflict . is there a danger that the conflict between israel and the palestinians will be neglected because other countries such as iran and iraq have moved to the forefront of the international focus ? this is no longer a potential risk .
it already reflects the current reality .
the fact that the construction of the security fence and the expansion of israeli enclaves in the occupied territories continue to be ignored by international politics and the public is the best proof of this new shift in focus . german middle east expert günter meyer is a professor at the university of mainz 's geographical institute , and the head of the center for research on the arab world .

as part of the middle east quartet , germany and the eu have a vested interest in the israeli elections .
german middle east expert günter meyer , however , says that the influence on israel 's policies is waning . from the european perspective , which election outcome would most benefit the peace process ? the only party which has clearly set itself the goal of pushing forward with the peace process is the yachad party -lrb- " togetherness " -rrb- .
it calls for the israeli withdrawal from territory occupied in 1967 and a return to the oslo peace process .
if that were to take place , it would make peace with the palestinians a real possibility .
but this political goal is not representative of the majority in the election .
at the most five representatives from yachad will be elected . if he wins , ehud olmert has promised to establish the permanent boundaries of israel by the year 2010 .
is that a strategy germany and europe could accept or do you foresee difficulties with his plans ? the eu and germany could support the basic goal of establishing permanent borders , but only if the national boundaries respect international law .
however , that has not been the case up to now : the partially erected security fence – or apartheid wall as the palestinians call it – cuts out large chunks of occupied territory and attributes them to israel .
also the intended israeli annexation of east jerusalem , the large jewish settlements and the occupation of the eastern jordan valley are all clear breaches of international law .
finally , the one-sided definition of national borders – that is without incorporating palestinians in the negotiations – is completely unacceptable .
the result would be a forced , non-sustainable palestinian state and there would be no chance of peace in the middle east . how much political influence do germany and the eu have at the moment as part of the middle east quartet ? german and european influence on israel 's politics is close to nothing .
on the palestinian side , however , europe 's economic and humanitarian support is absolutely essential if we want to avoid further chaos and destabilization in the territories . how has germany 's role in the middle east changed since the government under chancellor angela merkel came into power ? the new government has shifted its political priorities unequivocally in favor of israel .
by doing so it has lost in the eyes of the palestinians and the rest of the arab world its trustworthiness as an impartial negotiator in the conflict . is there a danger that the conflict between israel and the palestinians will be neglected because other countries such as iran and iraq have moved to the forefront of the international focus ? this is no longer a potential risk .
it already reflects the current reality .
the fact that the construction of the security fence and the expansion of israeli enclaves in the occupied territories continue to be ignored by international politics and the public is the best proof of this new shift in focus . german middle east expert günter meyer is a professor at the university of mainz 's geographical institute , and the head of the center for research on the arab world .
additionally , he is a director of the german middle east studies association for contemporary research and documentation -lrb- davo -rrb- . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamas must reform itself , eu warns the eu has reiterated its stance that hamas - the palestinian militant group whose members now take up prominent seats in the new palestinian cabinet - must reform itself if it is to expect european aid in the future .
-lrb- april 20 , 2006 -rrb- europe gets in step with us policies in the middle east in 2003 , most european nations were at odds with the us over its invasion plans for iraq .
now , with a new set of challenges in the middle east , europe is increasingly aligned with washington on the hamas and iran issues .

the decision was a blow to gambling operators and the german football federation , who had hoped the court would finally break up the oddset monopoly , freeing up the 3 billion euro german gambling market for new competitors .
the market 's beneficiaries , local sports officials , breathed a sigh of relief . 500 million euros secure , for now " it 's a great decision for sports , " said manfred von richthofen , chief of the german sports association -lrb- dsb -rrb- to the broadcaster mdr .
von richthofen sees the monopoly as the only lifeline for local sports association , who receive most of the tax revenue pulled in by oddset and licensed sub-partners . " the fact that the state monopoly is admissible is a clear advantage for sports , " he said .
the oddset monopoly offers betters the opportunity to bet on sports with fixed rates on winnings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local sports receive up to 500 million euros annually from oddset the judges did ask lawmakers to restructure the monopoly so that it does more to contain gambling addiction .
they set the end of 2007 as a deadline .
the decision indicated the court preferred a state-controlled monopoly - in its current form - which is n't nearly as profit-driven as an open gambling market and can better protect consumers . protecting consumers ? private companies , arguing before the court , disputed the claim .
they said that oddset , which enters into sponsoring partnerships and advertises across the country , could not at the same time be expected to warn consumers of the dangers of the product they 're advertising .
the court took the complaint into account in its decision , as the call for a restructuring to do more against gambling addiction proves . but companies , including germany 's national soccer association , had hoped the court would do more , opening up the competition in time for the world cup . monopoly coming to an end while they wo n't get access to the market in the near future , experts doubt the monopoly can last much longer .
according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung , most of the betting done by germans is done through companies that continue to operate with a licensed issued in the old gdr - the only exception to the monopoly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : end of the monopoly ? with its limitless win potential , the increasing popularity of online gambling - a more than $ 300 billion industry worldwide - could also hasten oddset 's end . " the entire system is coming to an end , " dieter frey , a cologne lawyer and gambling expert told the berliner zeitung .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.03.2006 eu awaits results of israeli poll großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few went to vote on tuesday as members of the " quartet " of mediators in the middle east conflict , germany and the eu have a keen interest in the outcome of israel 's parliamentary elections .
but will they provide new impetus for the peace process ? acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert appears to be on course for victory on tuesday , despite having seen his kadima party 's lead slip in the run-up to the elections . olmert has called the poll a referendum on his plan to redefine israel 's borders - a plan which involves evacuating dozens of small jewish settlements in the west bank , while strengthening larger jewish enclaves on land palestinians want for an independent state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert plans to redefine israel 's borders if victorious for his strategy to work , kadima , the party founded by ailing prime minister ariel sharon , and its desired coalition partner - most likely the center-left labor party - will need enough support to form a majority . experts say that 's unlikely to happen . " no party is going to get an absolute majority , so it has to be a coalition government , and the optimal solution would be a coalition between kadima and the labor party , " said middle east expert udo steinbach , head of the german orient institute in hamburg .
" what must be avoided is that -lrb- benjamin -rrb- netanyahu and the likud party have any major influence , because they do n't provide any perspective as far as the peace process is concerned . " but olmert 's plans regarding israel 's borders are not without controversy .
olmert has argued that the need to separate from the palestinians is greater than ever since the militant islamic movement hamas won palestinian elections in january .
although there is broad support among israelis for his strategy , the eu , the united states and other players in the peace process are wary of giving israel the green light to annex contested land . indeed , israel 's problems with hamas could be worsened should olmert win electoral support for his plan , steinbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas ' victory has muddied the waters of eu involvement " the way that hamas is going to behave to an overwhelming extent depends on what the israelis offer them , " he said .
" if olmert goes ahead in a unilateral way , that will likely radicalize hamas , but if he makes them an offer to find a joint solution , hamas could turn out to be a fairly pragmatic partner . " he added , however , that the problem of the settlements aside , olmert is generally the favored candidate among europeans . " i would consider him to be reasonably pragmatic in terms of going along with the peace process , and going along with the international community , " steinbach said . eu 's israel policy should olmert be confirmed in office , there will likely be no great change in the eu 's policy on israel . the eu backs the peace plan now known as the road map , which foresees a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
in advancing this goal , brussels performs a balancing act , striving never to appear too partial to either side . just as the eu deplores palestinian acts of terror and demands that hamas renounce violence , it also rejects certain aspects of current israeli policy , such as the erection of the so-called security wall to isolate palestinian communities , and the expansion of settlements in the west bank . in the past , the eu 's involvement in the conflict was limited to providing financial backing and reconstruction aid .
the bloc 's evolution from mere financier to active political participant has been recognized by shimon peres , a former israeli prime minister and current candidate for kadima . " there were times in israel when people viewed the role of europe skeptically , " he said .
" this is no longer the case .
europe is no longer just a payer but a player .
the eu has fulfilled some tasks which nobody else could have done . " for his part though , steinbach thinks europe 's mediation efforts have stagnated recently , in large part because of a lack of support from the united states . " i think we were in better shape two years ago when the road map came into being , " said steinbach .
" at that time , the europeans were much more active , they were trying to push things into one direction or another and the problem was that the us was not going along with them . " german influence waning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer made the middle east a main priority steinbach is concerned that , with the us focusing on other countries in the middle east , namely iraq and iran , the israeli-palestinian conflict is being neglected .
germany 's involvement , too , has leveled off of late , he added .
under the previous social democrat-led coalition , foreign minister joschka fischer took an unprecedented interest in the region , making numerous visits there for talks with leaders on both sides of the conflict .
under the new government , that 's changed , said steinbach . " whatever they 're doing , they are doing within the eu context , " steinbach said . " talking with arabs , i have found there is a certain disillusionment about the german approach as far as the new government is concerned , " he said . " other countries in the middle east are watching very closely , and the new government is seen critically because it is viewed as doing more fence-mending with the americans than having its own approach as far as the middle east is concerned .

the bloc 's evolution from mere financier to active political participant has been recognized by shimon peres , a former israeli prime minister and current candidate for kadima . " there were times in israel when people viewed the role of europe skeptically , " he said .
" this is no longer the case .
europe is no longer just a payer but a player .
the eu has fulfilled some tasks which nobody else could have done . " for his part though , steinbach thinks europe 's mediation efforts have stagnated recently , in large part because of a lack of support from the united states . " i think we were in better shape two years ago when the road map came into being , " said steinbach .
" at that time , the europeans were much more active , they were trying to push things into one direction or another and the problem was that the us was not going along with them . " german influence waning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer made the middle east a main priority steinbach is concerned that , with the us focusing on other countries in the middle east , namely iraq and iran , the israeli-palestinian conflict is being neglected .
germany 's involvement , too , has leveled off of late , he added .
under the previous social democrat-led coalition , foreign minister joschka fischer took an unprecedented interest in the region , making numerous visits there for talks with leaders on both sides of the conflict .
under the new government , that 's changed , said steinbach . " whatever they 're doing , they are doing within the eu context , " steinbach said . " talking with arabs , i have found there is a certain disillusionment about the german approach as far as the new government is concerned , " he said . " other countries in the middle east are watching very closely , and the new government is seen critically because it is viewed as doing more fence-mending with the americans than having its own approach as far as the middle east is concerned .

the unexpected surge in the ifo business climate index on tuesday points to a solid recovery in europe 's biggest economy , analysts said . the ifo index soared to 105.4 points in march - the highest reading since april 1991 , the year after german unification , and up from 103.4 points in february .
the february reading was revised from 103.3 points . " the economic recovery is continuing to stabilize , " said the head of munich-based ifo institute , hans-werner sinn .
he added that optimism had spread through most sectors of the economy and that the most marked improvement had been registered in the poorer former communist eastern states . analysts cheered the news as ushering in a robust economic turnaround . " after five very lean years , germany seems to be heading for a serious economic upswing , " said holger schmieding , an economist with bank of america .
" taken at face value , the ifo projects a cyclical boom and not just a tame upturn . " important for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank headquarters in frankfurt edward teather of ubs investment research in london said the ifo index had broader positive implications for the euro zone as a whole . " the strength of german business confidence implied by the ifo in recent months has clearly outstripped that of the other large euro-area economies , " he said .
" however , while the acceleration in german growth may not be repeated in full elsewhere , it should provide a lift to activity growth in germany 's trading partners . " david brown of investment bank bear stearns said german business confidence is booming . " strong ifo business sentiment numbers underline a very positive case for much more solid german recovery ahead , " he said , adding that domestic demand , the achilles ' heel of the german economy , is now improving . " it is not just robust export growth that is doing the donkey work , but stronger investment intentions are adding to the positive climate for recovery , " he said .
" german businesses are becoming much more upbeat about the recovery in domestic demand conditions as unemployment continues to trend lower . " the widely watched business climate index , based on a poll of some 7,000 companies , is considered a reliable barometer of the prospects of the german economy . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new german government has nation in buoyant mood while the concrete achievements of germany 's " grand coalition " government in its first 100 days might be debatable , they 've left the country in a better mood .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.03.2006 eu awaits results of israeli poll großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few went to vote on tuesday as members of the " quartet " of mediators in the middle east conflict , germany and the eu have a keen interest in the outcome of israel 's parliamentary elections .
but will they provide new impetus for the peace process ? acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert appears to be on course for victory on tuesday , despite having seen his kadima party 's lead slip in the run-up to the elections . olmert has called the poll a referendum on his plan to redefine israel 's borders - a plan which involves evacuating dozens of small jewish settlements in the west bank , while strengthening larger jewish enclaves on land palestinians want for an independent state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert plans to redefine israel 's borders if victorious for his strategy to work , kadima , the party founded by ailing prime minister ariel sharon , and its desired coalition partner - most likely the center-left labor party - will need enough support to form a majority . experts say that 's unlikely to happen . " no party is going to get an absolute majority , so it has to be a coalition government , and the optimal solution would be a coalition between kadima and the labor party , " said middle east expert udo steinbach , head of the german orient institute in hamburg .
" what must be avoided is that -lrb- benjamin -rrb- netanyahu and the likud party have any major influence , because they do n't provide any perspective as far as the peace process is concerned . " but olmert 's plans regarding israel 's borders are not without controversy .
olmert has argued that the need to separate from the palestinians is greater than ever since the militant islamic movement hamas won palestinian elections in january .
although there is broad support among israelis for his strategy , the eu , the united states and other players in the peace process are wary of giving israel the green light to annex contested land . indeed , israel 's problems with hamas could be worsened should olmert win electoral support for his plan , steinbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas ' victory has muddied the waters of eu involvement " the way that hamas is going to behave to an overwhelming extent depends on what the israelis offer them , " he said .
" if olmert goes ahead in a unilateral way , that will likely radicalize hamas , but if he makes them an offer to find a joint solution , hamas could turn out to be a fairly pragmatic partner . " he added , however , that the problem of the settlements aside , olmert is generally the favored candidate among europeans . " i would consider him to be reasonably pragmatic in terms of going along with the peace process , and going along with the international community , " steinbach said . eu 's israel policy should olmert be confirmed in office , there will likely be no great change in the eu 's policy on israel . the eu backs the peace plan now known as the road map , which foresees a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
in advancing this goal , brussels performs a balancing act , striving never to appear too partial to either side . just as the eu deplores palestinian acts of terror and demands that hamas renounce violence , it also rejects certain aspects of current israeli policy , such as the erection of the so-called security wall to isolate palestinian communities , and the expansion of settlements in the west bank . in the past , the eu 's involvement in the conflict was limited to providing financial backing and reconstruction aid .
the bloc 's evolution from mere financier to active political participant has been recognized by shimon peres , a former israeli prime minister and current candidate for kadima . " there were times in israel when people viewed the role of europe skeptically , " he said .
" this is no longer the case .
europe is no longer just a payer but a player .
the eu has fulfilled some tasks which nobody else could have done . " for his part though , steinbach thinks europe 's mediation efforts have stagnated recently , in large part because of a lack of support from the united states . " i think we were in better shape two years ago when the road map came into being , " said steinbach .
" at that time , the europeans were much more active , they were trying to push things into one direction or another and the problem was that the us was not going along with them . " german influence waning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer made the middle east a main priority steinbach is concerned that , with the us focusing on other countries in the middle east , namely iraq and iran , the israeli-palestinian conflict is being neglected .
germany 's involvement , too , has leveled off of late , he added .
under the previous social democrat-led coalition , foreign minister joschka fischer took an unprecedented interest in the region , making numerous visits there for talks with leaders on both sides of the conflict .
under the new government , that 's changed , said steinbach . " whatever they 're doing , they are doing within the eu context , " steinbach said . " talking with arabs , i have found there is a certain disillusionment about the german approach as far as the new government is concerned , " he said . " other countries in the middle east are watching very closely , and the new government is seen critically because it is viewed as doing more fence-mending with the americans than having its own approach as far as the middle east is concerned .

the finance minister told parliament on tuesday that the measure was needed to boost the economy and gain financial room to maneuver for greater consolidation in 2007 . " the 2006 budget is intended to create stronger economic growth and so provide the necessary tailwind to achieve our ambitious goals in 2007 , " he said .

" staggering national debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's debt clock keeps climbing by the second the fresh borrowing , however , will increase germany 's national debt to a staggering 900 billion euros .
this mountain of debt alone requires servicing by the state to the tune of 40 billion euros in the current year .
meanwhile these interest payments coupled with staff expenditures , state contributions to the pensions system and huge spending on social welfare make up two-thirds of the entire budget . but steinbrück warned against populist calls from the opposition demanding sweeping cuts to these costs . " abrupt cuts and sudden changes in welfare policy will only lead to social upheaval and a disintegration of our complex society , " he said .
" forces would be strengthened that could undo social cohesion in germany .
but i 'm afraid that those calling for sweeping changes will only come to realize that when we are facing conditions like those in paris and other french cities . "
opposition laments extra spending but the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who are the strongest opposition force , did n't hold back with stinging criticism of the government 's budget policy .
their finance expert jürgen koppelin accused chancellor merkel of lying in public with her repeated declaration that she did n't want to repeat the mistakes of the previous government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel 's government manage to reduce germany 's financial problems ?
" i can not see a change of political course in this budget , " he said .
" mrs. merkel is even increasing the amount of new debts by 7 billion euros compared with the previous government .
there is more expenditure , less savings and a continuation of the ongoing violation of our constitution . " other opposition speakers claimed that , contrary to what the government says , there was room for consolidation as additional revenue from rising company profits was already accumulating this year .
they accused merkel of using the dire state of the budget as an excuse for her plans to raise value-added tax by 3 percent next year . steinbrück replied that 2007 would be a fateful year and that it would n't hurt to save for a rainy day when growth and consumption are expected to drop as a result of the consolidation effort . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business confidence soars to 15-year high business confidence in germany has reached a 15-year high .

the finance minister told parliament on tuesday that the measure was needed to boost the economy and gain financial room to maneuver for greater consolidation in 2007 . " the 2006 budget is intended to create stronger economic growth and so provide the necessary tailwind to achieve our ambitious goals in 2007 , " he said .

meanwhile these interest payments coupled with staff expenditures , state contributions to the pensions system and huge spending on social welfare make up two-thirds of the entire budget . but steinbrück warned against populist calls from the opposition demanding sweeping cuts to these costs . " abrupt cuts and sudden changes in welfare policy will only lead to social upheaval and a disintegration of our complex society , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.03.2006 europe 's role in middle east waning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what do the elections mean for the future of the middle east ?
as part of the middle east quartet , germany and the eu have a vested interest in the israeli elections .
german middle east expert günter meyer , however , says that the influence on israel 's policies is waning . from the european perspective , which election outcome would most benefit the peace process ? the only party which has clearly set itself the goal of pushing forward with the peace process is the yachad party -lrb- " togetherness " -rrb- .
it calls for the israeli withdrawal from territory occupied in 1967 and a return to the oslo peace process .
if that were to take place , it would make peace with the palestinians a real possibility .
but this political goal is not representative of the majority in the election .
at the most five representatives from yachad will be elected . if he wins , ehud olmert has promised to establish the permanent boundaries of israel by the year 2010 .
is that a strategy germany and europe could accept or do you foresee difficulties with his plans ? the eu and germany could support the basic goal of establishing permanent borders , but only if the national boundaries respect international law .
however , that has not been the case up to now : the partially erected security fence – or apartheid wall as the palestinians call it – cuts out large chunks of occupied territory and attributes them to israel .
also the intended israeli annexation of east jerusalem , the large jewish settlements and the occupation of the eastern jordan valley are all clear breaches of international law .
finally , the one-sided definition of national borders – that is without incorporating palestinians in the negotiations – is completely unacceptable .
the result would be a forced , non-sustainable palestinian state and there would be no chance of peace in the middle east . how much political influence do germany and the eu have at the moment as part of the middle east quartet ? german and european influence on israel 's politics is close to nothing .
on the palestinian side , however , europe 's economic and humanitarian support is absolutely essential if we want to avoid further chaos and destabilization in the territories . how has germany 's role in the middle east changed since the government under chancellor angela merkel came into power ? the new government has shifted its political priorities unequivocally in favor of israel .
by doing so it has lost in the eyes of the palestinians and the rest of the arab world its trustworthiness as an impartial negotiator in the conflict . is there a danger that the conflict between israel and the palestinians will be neglected because other countries such as iran and iraq have moved to the forefront of the international focus ? this is no longer a potential risk .

german middle east expert günter meyer , however , says that the influence on israel 's policies is waning . from the european perspective , which election outcome would most benefit the peace process ? the only party which has clearly set itself the goal of pushing forward with the peace process is the yachad party -lrb- " togetherness " -rrb- .
it calls for the israeli withdrawal from territory occupied in 1967 and a return to the oslo peace process .
if that were to take place , it would make peace with the palestinians a real possibility .
but this political goal is not representative of the majority in the election .
at the most five representatives from yachad will be elected . if he wins , ehud olmert has promised to establish the permanent boundaries of israel by the year 2010 .
is that a strategy germany and europe could accept or do you foresee difficulties with his plans ? the eu and germany could support the basic goal of establishing permanent borders , but only if the national boundaries respect international law .
however , that has not been the case up to now : the partially erected security fence – or apartheid wall as the palestinians call it – cuts out large chunks of occupied territory and attributes them to israel .
also the intended israeli annexation of east jerusalem , the large jewish settlements and the occupation of the eastern jordan valley are all clear breaches of international law .
finally , the one-sided definition of national borders – that is without incorporating palestinians in the negotiations – is completely unacceptable .
the result would be a forced , non-sustainable palestinian state and there would be no chance of peace in the middle east . how much political influence do germany and the eu have at the moment as part of the middle east quartet ? german and european influence on israel 's politics is close to nothing .
on the palestinian side , however , europe 's economic and humanitarian support is absolutely essential if we want to avoid further chaos and destabilization in the territories . how has germany 's role in the middle east changed since the government under chancellor angela merkel came into power ? the new government has shifted its political priorities unequivocally in favor of israel .
by doing so it has lost in the eyes of the palestinians and the rest of the arab world its trustworthiness as an impartial negotiator in the conflict . is there a danger that the conflict between israel and the palestinians will be neglected because other countries such as iran and iraq have moved to the forefront of the international focus ? this is no longer a potential risk .
it already reflects the current reality .
the fact that the construction of the security fence and the expansion of israeli enclaves in the occupied territories continue to be ignored by international politics and the public is the best proof of this new shift in focus . german middle east expert günter meyer is a professor at the university of mainz 's geographical institute , and the head of the center for research on the arab world .
additionally , he is a director of the german middle east studies association for contemporary research and documentation -lrb- davo -rrb- . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamas must reform itself , eu warns the eu has reiterated its stance that hamas - the palestinian militant group whose members now take up prominent seats in the new palestinian cabinet - must reform itself if it is to expect european aid in the future .
-lrb- april 20 , 2006 -rrb- europe gets in step with us policies in the middle east in 2003 , most european nations were at odds with the us over its invasion plans for iraq .
now , with a new set of challenges in the middle east , europe is increasingly aligned with washington on the hamas and iran issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on religion german muslim group elects islam convert for top post intelligent design debate arrives in germany germany 's jewish community begins search for new president " germany should lead fight against anti-semitism " germany -pipe- 28.03.2006 germany 's not-quite-so-secular democracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom of religion is guaranteed under germany 's constitution religion still plays a significant role in german politics , despite an official separation of church and state .
up to now , christian groups had the greatest say , but this is slowly changing . for people in germany , the arrest and near-execution of an afghan convert to christianity in kabul is hard to understand .
in contrast to many islamic countries such as afghanistan , germany has a clear separation of church and state , at least in principle . but this separation is not as strict as one might expect .
while churches in germany do not dictate politics , they are still one of the many political players within the framework of the country 's democracy . german religious leaders make public statements on many political issues - for example on moral issues such as abortion , or social questions such as the integration of foreigners .
these statements do not , however , have the same impact as they used to .
one reason for this is the decline in the number of faithful who officially belong to a particular church . germa n churches losi n g members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full churches have become a rare sight in germany both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have been complaining for years about declining membership .
around 60 percent of people in germany belong to one of these two christian denominations ; more than 30 percent do not belong to any religious community at all . the right to practice or to leave a religion is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed under germany 's basic law .
but the state still has control over how this happens - a german citizen can only officially renounce membership in a church through a civil registry office or at a municipal court . michael basse , a church historian , said that protests by church groups after the end of world war i prevented a complete separation of church and state in germany . " there was already an attempt to introduce a radical separation of church and state during the november revolution -lrb- overthrow of the monarchy in 1918-1919 -rrb- , " basse said .
" but the protestant and catholic churches mobilized their members to hold massive demonstrations to prevent this .
during that time the main point of contention was the issue of religion classes in schools . " li n ks betwee n the church a n d state remai n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crosses hang in many german classrooms unlike schools in other secular countries , german public schools still offer religion courses , and public universities in germany continue to train future theologians .
in addition to education , there are other institutional links between the church and state . for example , the state tax authority is responsible for collecting the so-called church tax .
this goes towards financing staff , houses of worship , and social welfare institutions such as hospitals and kindergartens , which are often run by church groups . the limits of church power in germany are still defined by a clause in the legal code of the weimar republic , which dates back to the year 1919 .
it gives the two christian denominations special privileges such as tax breaks - which do not apply to other religious groups in germany . michael basse said he wonders if this is going to change .
" an interesting political question would be to what extent there is a readiness to apply these benefits to other religions , " he said . teachi n g islamic religio n i n germa n schools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few schools offer religious education for muslim students this question is of particular interest to germany 's muslim community .
the country 's three million muslims are also guaranteed freedom of worship under german law . but there are still some difficulties when it comes to religious education for muslims .
only a few federal states in germany currently have pilot projects for islamic religion classes in schools .
this is partially due to a lack of initiative on the part of the german school system . but another challenge is the high number of muslim umbrella groups and different islamic religious denominations in germany .
government officials say it is difficult to find a consistent representative for the entire muslim community who can decide on a fixed curriculum for islamic religion classes . but this will likely be resolved in the near future .
at the same time , the influence of churches on german society continues to decline .
while churches were an especially strong political force in the early days of the federal republic , their role is fading increasingly into the background , said church historian michael basse . " the times in which politicians had to fear the power of the churches are long gone , " he said . dw staff -lrb- my -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row erupts over ethics and religion ruling conservative politicians in germany are up in arms over the decision made by the ruling spd-green government to make lessons in ethics and religion compulsory in berlin .

the finance minister told parliament on tuesday that the measure was needed to boost the economy and gain financial room to maneuver for greater consolidation in 2007 . " the 2006 budget is intended to create stronger economic growth and so provide the necessary tailwind to achieve our ambitious goals in 2007 , " he said .

this mountain of debt alone requires servicing by the state to the tune of 40 billion euros in the current year .
meanwhile these interest payments coupled with staff expenditures , state contributions to the pensions system and huge spending on social welfare make up two-thirds of the entire budget . but steinbrück warned against populist calls from the opposition demanding sweeping cuts to these costs . " abrupt cuts and sudden changes in welfare policy will only lead to social upheaval and a disintegration of our complex society , " he said .
" forces would be strengthened that could undo social cohesion in germany .
but i 'm afraid that those calling for sweeping changes will only come to realize that when we are facing conditions like those in paris and other french cities . "

the finance minister told parliament on tuesday that the measure was needed to boost the economy and gain financial room to maneuver for greater consolidation in 2007 . " the 2006 budget is intended to create stronger economic growth and so provide the necessary tailwind to achieve our ambitious goals in 2007 , " he said .

this mountain of debt alone requires servicing by the state to the tune of 40 billion euros in the current year .
meanwhile these interest payments coupled with staff expenditures , state contributions to the pensions system and huge spending on social welfare make up two-thirds of the entire budget . but steinbrück warned against populist calls from the opposition demanding sweeping cuts to these costs . " abrupt cuts and sudden changes in welfare policy will only lead to social upheaval and a disintegration of our complex society , " he said .
" forces would be strengthened that could undo social cohesion in germany .
but i 'm afraid that those calling for sweeping changes will only come to realize that when we are facing conditions like those in paris and other french cities . "

the decision was a blow to gambling operators and the german football federation , who had hoped the court would finally break up the oddset monopoly , freeing up the 3 billion euro german gambling market for new competitors .
the market 's beneficiaries , local sports officials , breathed a sigh of relief . 500 million euros secure , for now " it 's a great decision for sports , " said manfred von richthofen , chief of the german sports association -lrb- dsb -rrb- to the broadcaster mdr .
von richthofen sees the monopoly as the only lifeline for local sports association , who receive most of the tax revenue pulled in by oddset and licensed sub-partners . " the fact that the state monopoly is admissible is a clear advantage for sports , " he said .

they said that oddset , which enters into sponsoring partnerships and advertises across the country , could not at the same time be expected to warn consumers of the dangers of the product they 're advertising .
the court took the complaint into account in its decision , as the call for a restructuring to do more against gambling addiction proves . but companies , including germany 's national soccer association , had hoped the court would do more , opening up the competition in time for the world cup . monopoly coming to an end while they wo n't get access to the market in the near future , experts doubt the monopoly can last much longer .
according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung , most of the betting done by germans is done through companies that continue to operate with a licensed issued in the old gdr - the only exception to the monopoly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : end of the monopoly ? with its limitless win potential , the increasing popularity of online gambling - a more than $ 300 billion industry worldwide - could also hasten oddset 's end .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.03.2006 europe 's role in middle east waning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what do the elections mean for the future of the middle east ?
as part of the middle east quartet , germany and the eu have a vested interest in the israeli elections .
german middle east expert günter meyer , however , says that the influence on israel 's policies is waning . from the european perspective , which election outcome would most benefit the peace process ? the only party which has clearly set itself the goal of pushing forward with the peace process is the yachad party -lrb- " togetherness " -rrb- .
it calls for the israeli withdrawal from territory occupied in 1967 and a return to the oslo peace process .
if that were to take place , it would make peace with the palestinians a real possibility .
but this political goal is not representative of the majority in the election .
at the most five representatives from yachad will be elected . if he wins , ehud olmert has promised to establish the permanent boundaries of israel by the year 2010 .
is that a strategy germany and europe could accept or do you foresee difficulties with his plans ? the eu and germany could support the basic goal of establishing permanent borders , but only if the national boundaries respect international law .
however , that has not been the case up to now : the partially erected security fence – or apartheid wall as the palestinians call it – cuts out large chunks of occupied territory and attributes them to israel .
also the intended israeli annexation of east jerusalem , the large jewish settlements and the occupation of the eastern jordan valley are all clear breaches of international law .
finally , the one-sided definition of national borders – that is without incorporating palestinians in the negotiations – is completely unacceptable .
the result would be a forced , non-sustainable palestinian state and there would be no chance of peace in the middle east . how much political influence do germany and the eu have at the moment as part of the middle east quartet ? german and european influence on israel 's politics is close to nothing .
on the palestinian side , however , europe 's economic and humanitarian support is absolutely essential if we want to avoid further chaos and destabilization in the territories . how has germany 's role in the middle east changed since the government under chancellor angela merkel came into power ? the new government has shifted its political priorities unequivocally in favor of israel .
by doing so it has lost in the eyes of the palestinians and the rest of the arab world its trustworthiness as an impartial negotiator in the conflict . is there a danger that the conflict between israel and the palestinians will be neglected because other countries such as iran and iraq have moved to the forefront of the international focus ? this is no longer a potential risk .
it already reflects the current reality .
the fact that the construction of the security fence and the expansion of israeli enclaves in the occupied territories continue to be ignored by international politics and the public is the best proof of this new shift in focus . german middle east expert günter meyer is a professor at the university of mainz 's geographical institute , and the head of the center for research on the arab world .
additionally , he is a director of the german middle east studies association for contemporary research and documentation -lrb- davo -rrb- . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamas must reform itself , eu warns the eu has reiterated its stance that hamas - the palestinian militant group whose members now take up prominent seats in the new palestinian cabinet - must reform itself if it is to expect european aid in the future .
-lrb- april 20 , 2006 -rrb- europe gets in step with us policies in the middle east in 2003 , most european nations were at odds with the us over its invasion plans for iraq .
now , with a new set of challenges in the middle east , europe is increasingly aligned with washington on the hamas and iran issues .

" it is unthinkable for the prime minister to stay fixed in his position .
for us there is just one outcome and that is withdrawal of this reform . " francois chereque of the cfdt union was a bit more skeptical . " i do not know if today 's mobilization will make the prime minister give way , " he said .
" but what i do know is that each week we will be out in greater numbers . " joining the demonstrating students were transport workers , teachers and other government workers closed schools , slowed mass transit and disrupted public services . police had deployed in large numbers to avoid a repeat of last thursday 's violence , when youths , mainly from high-immigration city suburbs , set fire to cars and mugged demonstrators . villepin stands firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villepin -lrb- right -rrb- met with students and unemployed people on march 10 meanwhile unions turned down an invitation from french premier dominique de villepin to attend new talks on the contested contract , which was voted through parliament two weeks ago and is awaiting approval by constitutional experts before passing into law . opponents are demanding withdrawal of the cpe , but the prime minister is offering only " adjustments " on its two most contentious aspects : a two-year trial period , and the free hand given to employers during that period to sack under 26-year-olds without explanation . villepin told the national assembly that he regretted the union 's refusal to enter talks . " as i have said , i am ready to engage in dialogue and adjust the contract on these two points , " he said .
" i said that in writing to the unions , but they refused my extended hand . " the government insists the contract is vital to fighting youth unemployment , which can reach more than 50 percent in the poor suburbs hit by last year 's riots , but opponents say it is a breach of hard-won labor rights . sarkozy urges compromise president jacques chirac , who has so far given his backing to villepin , cancelled a visit this week to the northern port of le havre in order to stay close to the events in paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy but there were signs of dissension within the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- , whose president , interior minister nicolas sarkozy , was quoted by deputies as urging villepin to give ground . an ipsos poll for le monde newspaper gave some comfort to villepin , who has staked his political career - and presidential ambitions - on getting the cpe into law . while 63 percent of the population disapproved of his decision to stand by the cpe , views were heavily influenced by political allegiance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.03.2006 eu awaits results of israeli poll großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few went to vote on tuesday as members of the " quartet " of mediators in the middle east conflict , germany and the eu have a keen interest in the outcome of israel 's parliamentary elections .
but will they provide new impetus for the peace process ? acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert appears to be on course for victory on tuesday , despite having seen his kadima party 's lead slip in the run-up to the elections . olmert has called the poll a referendum on his plan to redefine israel 's borders - a plan which involves evacuating dozens of small jewish settlements in the west bank , while strengthening larger jewish enclaves on land palestinians want for an independent state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert plans to redefine israel 's borders if victorious for his strategy to work , kadima , the party founded by ailing prime minister ariel sharon , and its desired coalition partner - most likely the center-left labor party - will need enough support to form a majority . experts say that 's unlikely to happen . " no party is going to get an absolute majority , so it has to be a coalition government , and the optimal solution would be a coalition between kadima and the labor party , " said middle east expert udo steinbach , head of the german orient institute in hamburg .
" what must be avoided is that -lrb- benjamin -rrb- netanyahu and the likud party have any major influence , because they do n't provide any perspective as far as the peace process is concerned . " but olmert 's plans regarding israel 's borders are not without controversy .
olmert has argued that the need to separate from the palestinians is greater than ever since the militant islamic movement hamas won palestinian elections in january .
although there is broad support among israelis for his strategy , the eu , the united states and other players in the peace process are wary of giving israel the green light to annex contested land . indeed , israel 's problems with hamas could be worsened should olmert win electoral support for his plan , steinbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas ' victory has muddied the waters of eu involvement " the way that hamas is going to behave to an overwhelming extent depends on what the israelis offer them , " he said .
" if olmert goes ahead in a unilateral way , that will likely radicalize hamas , but if he makes them an offer to find a joint solution , hamas could turn out to be a fairly pragmatic partner . " he added , however , that the problem of the settlements aside , olmert is generally the favored candidate among europeans . " i would consider him to be reasonably pragmatic in terms of going along with the peace process , and going along with the international community , " steinbach said . eu 's israel policy should olmert be confirmed in office , there will likely be no great change in the eu 's policy on israel . the eu backs the peace plan now known as the road map , which foresees a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
in advancing this goal , brussels performs a balancing act , striving never to appear too partial to either side . just as the eu deplores palestinian acts of terror and demands that hamas renounce violence , it also rejects certain aspects of current israeli policy , such as the erection of the so-called security wall to isolate palestinian communities , and the expansion of settlements in the west bank . in the past , the eu 's involvement in the conflict was limited to providing financial backing and reconstruction aid .
the bloc 's evolution from mere financier to active political participant has been recognized by shimon peres , a former israeli prime minister and current candidate for kadima . " there were times in israel when people viewed the role of europe skeptically , " he said .
" this is no longer the case .
europe is no longer just a payer but a player .
the eu has fulfilled some tasks which nobody else could have done . " for his part though , steinbach thinks europe 's mediation efforts have stagnated recently , in large part because of a lack of support from the united states . " i think we were in better shape two years ago when the road map came into being , " said steinbach .
" at that time , the europeans were much more active , they were trying to push things into one direction or another and the problem was that the us was not going along with them . " german influence waning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer made the middle east a main priority steinbach is concerned that , with the us focusing on other countries in the middle east , namely iraq and iran , the israeli-palestinian conflict is being neglected .
germany 's involvement , too , has leveled off of late , he added .
under the previous social democrat-led coalition , foreign minister joschka fischer took an unprecedented interest in the region , making numerous visits there for talks with leaders on both sides of the conflict .
under the new government , that 's changed , said steinbach . " whatever they 're doing , they are doing within the eu context , " steinbach said . " talking with arabs , i have found there is a certain disillusionment about the german approach as far as the new government is concerned , " he said . " other countries in the middle east are watching very closely , and the new government is seen critically because it is viewed as doing more fence-mending with the americans than having its own approach as far as the middle east is concerned .

but will they provide new impetus for the peace process ? acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert appears to be on course for victory on tuesday , despite having seen his kadima party 's lead slip in the run-up to the elections . olmert has called the poll a referendum on his plan to redefine israel 's borders - a plan which involves evacuating dozens of small jewish settlements in the west bank , while strengthening larger jewish enclaves on land palestinians want for an independent state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert plans to redefine israel 's borders if victorious for his strategy to work , kadima , the party founded by ailing prime minister ariel sharon , and its desired coalition partner - most likely the center-left labor party - will need enough support to form a majority . experts say that 's unlikely to happen . " no party is going to get an absolute majority , so it has to be a coalition government , and the optimal solution would be a coalition between kadima and the labor party , " said middle east expert udo steinbach , head of the german orient institute in hamburg .
" what must be avoided is that -lrb- benjamin -rrb- netanyahu and the likud party have any major influence , because they do n't provide any perspective as far as the peace process is concerned . " but olmert 's plans regarding israel 's borders are not without controversy .
olmert has argued that the need to separate from the palestinians is greater than ever since the militant islamic movement hamas won palestinian elections in january .
although there is broad support among israelis for his strategy , the eu , the united states and other players in the peace process are wary of giving israel the green light to annex contested land . indeed , israel 's problems with hamas could be worsened should olmert win electoral support for his plan , steinbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas ' victory has muddied the waters of eu involvement " the way that hamas is going to behave to an overwhelming extent depends on what the israelis offer them , " he said .
" if olmert goes ahead in a unilateral way , that will likely radicalize hamas , but if he makes them an offer to find a joint solution , hamas could turn out to be a fairly pragmatic partner . " he added , however , that the problem of the settlements aside , olmert is generally the favored candidate among europeans . " i would consider him to be reasonably pragmatic in terms of going along with the peace process , and going along with the international community , " steinbach said . eu 's israel policy should olmert be confirmed in office , there will likely be no great change in the eu 's policy on israel . the eu backs the peace plan now known as the road map , which foresees a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
in advancing this goal , brussels performs a balancing act , striving never to appear too partial to either side . just as the eu deplores palestinian acts of terror and demands that hamas renounce violence , it also rejects certain aspects of current israeli policy , such as the erection of the so-called security wall to isolate palestinian communities , and the expansion of settlements in the west bank . in the past , the eu 's involvement in the conflict was limited to providing financial backing and reconstruction aid .
the bloc 's evolution from mere financier to active political participant has been recognized by shimon peres , a former israeli prime minister and current candidate for kadima . " there were times in israel when people viewed the role of europe skeptically , " he said .
" this is no longer the case .
europe is no longer just a payer but a player .
the eu has fulfilled some tasks which nobody else could have done . " for his part though , steinbach thinks europe 's mediation efforts have stagnated recently , in large part because of a lack of support from the united states . " i think we were in better shape two years ago when the road map came into being , " said steinbach .
" at that time , the europeans were much more active , they were trying to push things into one direction or another and the problem was that the us was not going along with them . " german influence waning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer made the middle east a main priority steinbach is concerned that , with the us focusing on other countries in the middle east , namely iraq and iran , the israeli-palestinian conflict is being neglected .
germany 's involvement , too , has leveled off of late , he added .
under the previous social democrat-led coalition , foreign minister joschka fischer took an unprecedented interest in the region , making numerous visits there for talks with leaders on both sides of the conflict .
under the new government , that 's changed , said steinbach . " whatever they 're doing , they are doing within the eu context , " steinbach said . " talking with arabs , i have found there is a certain disillusionment about the german approach as far as the new government is concerned , " he said . " other countries in the middle east are watching very closely , and the new government is seen critically because it is viewed as doing more fence-mending with the americans than having its own approach as far as the middle east is concerned .

up to now , christian groups had the greatest say , but this is slowly changing . for people in germany , the arrest and near-execution of an afghan convert to christianity in kabul is hard to understand .
in contrast to many islamic countries such as afghanistan , germany has a clear separation of church and state , at least in principle . but this separation is not as strict as one might expect .
while churches in germany do not dictate politics , they are still one of the many political players within the framework of the country 's democracy . german religious leaders make public statements on many political issues - for example on moral issues such as abortion , or social questions such as the integration of foreigners .
these statements do not , however , have the same impact as they used to .
one reason for this is the decline in the number of faithful who officially belong to a particular church . germa n churches losi n g members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full churches have become a rare sight in germany both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have been complaining for years about declining membership .
around 60 percent of people in germany belong to one of these two christian denominations ; more than 30 percent do not belong to any religious community at all . the right to practice or to leave a religion is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed under germany 's basic law .
but the state still has control over how this happens - a german citizen can only officially renounce membership in a church through a civil registry office or at a municipal court . michael basse , a church historian , said that protests by church groups after the end of world war i prevented a complete separation of church and state in germany . " there was already an attempt to introduce a radical separation of church and state during the november revolution -lrb- overthrow of the monarchy in 1918-1919 -rrb- , " basse said .
" but the protestant and catholic churches mobilized their members to hold massive demonstrations to prevent this .
during that time the main point of contention was the issue of religion classes in schools .

in addition to education , there are other institutional links between the church and state . for example , the state tax authority is responsible for collecting the so-called church tax .
this goes towards financing staff , houses of worship , and social welfare institutions such as hospitals and kindergartens , which are often run by church groups . the limits of church power in germany are still defined by a clause in the legal code of the weimar republic , which dates back to the year 1919 .
it gives the two christian denominations special privileges such as tax breaks - which do not apply to other religious groups in germany . michael basse said he wonders if this is going to change .
" an interesting political question would be to what extent there is a readiness to apply these benefits to other religions , " he said . teachi n g islamic religio n i n germa n schools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few schools offer religious education for muslim students this question is of particular interest to germany 's muslim community .
the country 's three million muslims are also guaranteed freedom of worship under german law . but there are still some difficulties when it comes to religious education for muslims .
only a few federal states in germany currently have pilot projects for islamic religion classes in schools .
this is partially due to a lack of initiative on the part of the german school system . but another challenge is the high number of muslim umbrella groups and different islamic religious denominations in germany .
government officials say it is difficult to find a consistent representative for the entire muslim community who can decide on a fixed curriculum for islamic religion classes . but this will likely be resolved in the near future .
at the same time , the influence of churches on german society continues to decline .

up to now , christian groups had the greatest say , but this is slowly changing . for people in germany , the arrest and near-execution of an afghan convert to christianity in kabul is hard to understand .
in contrast to many islamic countries such as afghanistan , germany has a clear separation of church and state , at least in principle . but this separation is not as strict as one might expect .
while churches in germany do not dictate politics , they are still one of the many political players within the framework of the country 's democracy . german religious leaders make public statements on many political issues - for example on moral issues such as abortion , or social questions such as the integration of foreigners .
these statements do not , however , have the same impact as they used to .
one reason for this is the decline in the number of faithful who officially belong to a particular church . germa n churches losi n g members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full churches have become a rare sight in germany both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have been complaining for years about declining membership .
around 60 percent of people in germany belong to one of these two christian denominations ; more than 30 percent do not belong to any religious community at all . the right to practice or to leave a religion is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed under germany 's basic law .
but the state still has control over how this happens - a german citizen can only officially renounce membership in a church through a civil registry office or at a municipal court . michael basse , a church historian , said that protests by church groups after the end of world war i prevented a complete separation of church and state in germany . " there was already an attempt to introduce a radical separation of church and state during the november revolution -lrb- overthrow of the monarchy in 1918-1919 -rrb- , " basse said .
" but the protestant and catholic churches mobilized their members to hold massive demonstrations to prevent this .
during that time the main point of contention was the issue of religion classes in schools . " li n ks betwee n the church a n d state remai n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crosses hang in many german classrooms unlike schools in other secular countries , german public schools still offer religion courses , and public universities in germany continue to train future theologians .
in addition to education , there are other institutional links between the church and state . for example , the state tax authority is responsible for collecting the so-called church tax .
this goes towards financing staff , houses of worship , and social welfare institutions such as hospitals and kindergartens , which are often run by church groups . the limits of church power in germany are still defined by a clause in the legal code of the weimar republic , which dates back to the year 1919 .
it gives the two christian denominations special privileges such as tax breaks - which do not apply to other religious groups in germany . michael basse said he wonders if this is going to change .
" an interesting political question would be to what extent there is a readiness to apply these benefits to other religions , " he said . teachi n g islamic religio n i n germa n schools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few schools offer religious education for muslim students this question is of particular interest to germany 's muslim community .
the country 's three million muslims are also guaranteed freedom of worship under german law . but there are still some difficulties when it comes to religious education for muslims .
only a few federal states in germany currently have pilot projects for islamic religion classes in schools .
this is partially due to a lack of initiative on the part of the german school system . but another challenge is the high number of muslim umbrella groups and different islamic religious denominations in germany .
government officials say it is difficult to find a consistent representative for the entire muslim community who can decide on a fixed curriculum for islamic religion classes . but this will likely be resolved in the near future .
at the same time , the influence of churches on german society continues to decline .
while churches were an especially strong political force in the early days of the federal republic , their role is fading increasingly into the background , said church historian michael basse .

i grew up watching the fa english football and grew up having english coaches , but to get a work permit you ca n't go there at a young age .
i had an opportunity to come to germany when i was 19 .
at that time the manager of hanover 96 saw me play and asked me to come back , and i did n't let the opportunity pass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting ahead in europe takes patience , said cherundolo , right your n atio n al team colleague la n do n do n ova n left bayer leverkuse n a n d has had a lot of success i n the us league .
is it difficult to break through i n germa n y ? the mentality here is difficult , and i think they try to beat you down and build you up in their own way , with their own set of rules .
i think it 's difficult for young kids to come over here and learn that .
the thing you need the most is patience and you have to be in a position to wait .
landon was n't .
landon is a good enough player to play over here , without a doubt at any club in germany , but he was able to progress and have a good thing going for him in the states .
i had to wait here , and if you do wait your turn it will come around if you 're patient .
if you allow yourself to adapt to certain things here , you do n't have to change , but you do have to adapt . you 're the deputy captai n at ha n over a n d gregg berhalter is captai n at e n ergie cottbus i n the seco n d divisio n .
are you , as america n s , accepted as team leaders ? first and foremost you have to bring performance week in and week out , that 's the most important criteria , and on top of that you need to be a leader in training , and you ca n't be involved in any stupid things off the field .
it does n't mean you ca n't have fun , but you have to be a little responsible and always try to be positive .
i think that fits our mentality as americans anyway - to always be positive and never give up .
i think that 's something that they -lrb- the germans -rrb- admire and respect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat the usa 1-0 in the 2002 world cup quarter-finals the us team reached the quarter-fi n als four years ago .
what do you expect of this world cup i n germa n y ? it 's going to be a great event .
it 's going to be better than the last world cup as far as organization and fan support go .
i expect three very tough games for us .
i 'm looking forward to getting all the preparation over with and just get on the field against the czech republic in the first game in gelsenkirchen .
we 're concentrating on the preparation for the first round and that 's going to be tough enough to get through as it is .
if we do get through , we 'll look to see who we play in the second round and go from there . you have italy a n d gha n a i n your group as well .
is that o n e of the hardest groups ? everybody says it 's one of the hardest .
i think one of the reasons why it 's a difficult group is because we 're there , too .
and ghana is no pushover either .
for most people there are two favorites in the group , for me there are four very strong teams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's bernd schneider , left , fought cherundolo for the ball during a friendly match in dortmund after your game agai n st pola n d i n kaiserslauter n , us fa n s at the n earby ramstei n air base said they wa n ted to make your match agai n st italy i n kaiserslauter n like a home game for the us .
how big do you thi n k the fa n s support will be a n d how importa n t is it for the team ? i think it 's very important .
a pro-us crowd is something that we rarely have , even in the united states .
if we could have that at the world 's biggest stage , at a world cup , at one of the most important games for us , that would mean all the world to us . i think against poland in the second half when we went ahead , you heard the fans and you saw a difference in our play .

i grew up watching the fa english football and grew up having english coaches , but to get a work permit you ca n't go there at a young age .
i had an opportunity to come to germany when i was 19 .
at that time the manager of hanover 96 saw me play and asked me to come back , and i did n't let the opportunity pass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting ahead in europe takes patience , said cherundolo , right your n atio n al team colleague la n do n do n ova n left bayer leverkuse n a n d has had a lot of success i n the us league .
is it difficult to break through i n germa n y ? the mentality here is difficult , and i think they try to beat you down and build you up in their own way , with their own set of rules .
i think it 's difficult for young kids to come over here and learn that .
the thing you need the most is patience and you have to be in a position to wait .
landon was n't .
landon is a good enough player to play over here , without a doubt at any club in germany , but he was able to progress and have a good thing going for him in the states .
i had to wait here , and if you do wait your turn it will come around if you 're patient .

it does n't mean you ca n't have fun , but you have to be a little responsible and always try to be positive .
i think that fits our mentality as americans anyway - to always be positive and never give up .

but will they provide new impetus for the peace process ? acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert appears to be on course for victory on tuesday , despite having seen his kadima party 's lead slip in the run-up to the elections . olmert has called the poll a referendum on his plan to redefine israel 's borders - a plan which involves evacuating dozens of small jewish settlements in the west bank , while strengthening larger jewish enclaves on land palestinians want for an independent state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert plans to redefine israel 's borders if victorious for his strategy to work , kadima , the party founded by ailing prime minister ariel sharon , and its desired coalition partner - most likely the center-left labor party - will need enough support to form a majority . experts say that 's unlikely to happen . " no party is going to get an absolute majority , so it has to be a coalition government , and the optimal solution would be a coalition between kadima and the labor party , " said middle east expert udo steinbach , head of the german orient institute in hamburg .
" what must be avoided is that -lrb- benjamin -rrb- netanyahu and the likud party have any major influence , because they do n't provide any perspective as far as the peace process is concerned . " but olmert 's plans regarding israel 's borders are not without controversy .
olmert has argued that the need to separate from the palestinians is greater than ever since the militant islamic movement hamas won palestinian elections in january .
although there is broad support among israelis for his strategy , the eu , the united states and other players in the peace process are wary of giving israel the green light to annex contested land . indeed , israel 's problems with hamas could be worsened should olmert win electoral support for his plan , steinbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas ' victory has muddied the waters of eu involvement " the way that hamas is going to behave to an overwhelming extent depends on what the israelis offer them , " he said .
" if olmert goes ahead in a unilateral way , that will likely radicalize hamas , but if he makes them an offer to find a joint solution , hamas could turn out to be a fairly pragmatic partner . " he added , however , that the problem of the settlements aside , olmert is generally the favored candidate among europeans . " i would consider him to be reasonably pragmatic in terms of going along with the peace process , and going along with the international community , " steinbach said . eu 's israel policy should olmert be confirmed in office , there will likely be no great change in the eu 's policy on israel . the eu backs the peace plan now known as the road map , which foresees a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
in advancing this goal , brussels performs a balancing act , striving never to appear too partial to either side . just as the eu deplores palestinian acts of terror and demands that hamas renounce violence , it also rejects certain aspects of current israeli policy , such as the erection of the so-called security wall to isolate palestinian communities , and the expansion of settlements in the west bank . in the past , the eu 's involvement in the conflict was limited to providing financial backing and reconstruction aid .
the bloc 's evolution from mere financier to active political participant has been recognized by shimon peres , a former israeli prime minister and current candidate for kadima . " there were times in israel when people viewed the role of europe skeptically , " he said .
" this is no longer the case .
europe is no longer just a payer but a player .
the eu has fulfilled some tasks which nobody else could have done . " for his part though , steinbach thinks europe 's mediation efforts have stagnated recently , in large part because of a lack of support from the united states . " i think we were in better shape two years ago when the road map came into being , " said steinbach .

but will they provide new impetus for the peace process ? acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert appears to be on course for victory on tuesday , despite having seen his kadima party 's lead slip in the run-up to the elections . olmert has called the poll a referendum on his plan to redefine israel 's borders - a plan which involves evacuating dozens of small jewish settlements in the west bank , while strengthening larger jewish enclaves on land palestinians want for an independent state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert plans to redefine israel 's borders if victorious for his strategy to work , kadima , the party founded by ailing prime minister ariel sharon , and its desired coalition partner - most likely the center-left labor party - will need enough support to form a majority . experts say that 's unlikely to happen . " no party is going to get an absolute majority , so it has to be a coalition government , and the optimal solution would be a coalition between kadima and the labor party , " said middle east expert udo steinbach , head of the german orient institute in hamburg .
" what must be avoided is that -lrb- benjamin -rrb- netanyahu and the likud party have any major influence , because they do n't provide any perspective as far as the peace process is concerned . " but olmert 's plans regarding israel 's borders are not without controversy .
olmert has argued that the need to separate from the palestinians is greater than ever since the militant islamic movement hamas won palestinian elections in january .
although there is broad support among israelis for his strategy , the eu , the united states and other players in the peace process are wary of giving israel the green light to annex contested land . indeed , israel 's problems with hamas could be worsened should olmert win electoral support for his plan , steinbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas ' victory has muddied the waters of eu involvement " the way that hamas is going to behave to an overwhelming extent depends on what the israelis offer them , " he said .
" if olmert goes ahead in a unilateral way , that will likely radicalize hamas , but if he makes them an offer to find a joint solution , hamas could turn out to be a fairly pragmatic partner . " he added , however , that the problem of the settlements aside , olmert is generally the favored candidate among europeans . " i would consider him to be reasonably pragmatic in terms of going along with the peace process , and going along with the international community , " steinbach said . eu 's israel policy should olmert be confirmed in office , there will likely be no great change in the eu 's policy on israel . the eu backs the peace plan now known as the road map , which foresees a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
in advancing this goal , brussels performs a balancing act , striving never to appear too partial to either side . just as the eu deplores palestinian acts of terror and demands that hamas renounce violence , it also rejects certain aspects of current israeli policy , such as the erection of the so-called security wall to isolate palestinian communities , and the expansion of settlements in the west bank . in the past , the eu 's involvement in the conflict was limited to providing financial backing and reconstruction aid .
the bloc 's evolution from mere financier to active political participant has been recognized by shimon peres , a former israeli prime minister and current candidate for kadima . " there were times in israel when people viewed the role of europe skeptically , " he said .
" this is no longer the case .
europe is no longer just a payer but a player .
the eu has fulfilled some tasks which nobody else could have done . " for his part though , steinbach thinks europe 's mediation efforts have stagnated recently , in large part because of a lack of support from the united states . " i think we were in better shape two years ago when the road map came into being , " said steinbach .
" at that time , the europeans were much more active , they were trying to push things into one direction or another and the problem was that the us was not going along with them . " german influence waning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer made the middle east a main priority steinbach is concerned that , with the us focusing on other countries in the middle east , namely iraq and iran , the israeli-palestinian conflict is being neglected .

under the previous social democrat-led coalition , foreign minister joschka fischer took an unprecedented interest in the region , making numerous visits there for talks with leaders on both sides of the conflict .

" talking with arabs , i have found there is a certain disillusionment about the german approach as far as the new government is concerned , " he said .

" our ambition is to form a stable coalition for the full four years so we can carry out our policies . " senior party strategist lior horev said it was a remarkable achievement for a party which was only formed in november by prime minister ariel sharon who now lies in a coma in a jerusalem hospital . labor happy with result " all in all we are very happy with the results , " horev said .
" it was unimaginable three months ago .
the likud were defeated because of netanyahu 's aggressiveness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the israeli labor party leader amir peretz labor hailed its better than expected showing in the exit polls . " we 've snatched a major victory , " danny yatom , a member of the outgoing parliament told afp at the party 's tel aviv headquarters . the election was being held on the day that palestinian mps approved a cabinet led by hamas , which advocates the destruction of the jewish state , strengthening israel 's determination to act unilaterally in the perceived absence of a partner in the peace process . with the legacy of sharon looming large , olmert had urged israel 's five million voters to turn out en masse in an election which shattered the traditional mould of israel 's two-party system . low voter turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few voted on tuesday but turnout was sharply down on the record low of 2003 at the nation 's 8,280 polling stations , where security was tight to prevent attacks by palestinian militants . in a newspaper opinion piece , olmert spelled out how he planned to dismantle all settlements which lie outside the massive separation barrier israel is building across the west bank in an echo of last year 's dramatic uprooting of jews from the gaza strip . " we must preserve the main settlement blocs in judaea and samaria -lrb- west bank -rrb- and we will fix the route of the security barrier beyond which we will no longer remain , " olmert wrote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ismail haniya as hamas won the overwhelming approval of palestinian mps for its 24-strong cabinet , its incoming premier ismail haniya made clear olmert 's redrawn map was unacceptable . " if the occupation wants to leave we will not stop them but we will not accept fait accomplis being imposed on us such as the annexation of the settlement blocs , " he said . some palestinians want to negotiate the palestinian authority meanwhile called on the next israeli government to resume stalled negotiations to find a solution to the middle east conflict . " we call on the next government , whatever it is , to immediately resume negotiations as advocated by -lrb- palestinian -rrb- president mahmud abbas , " chief palestinian negotiator saeb erakat told afp .

the finance minister told parliament on tuesday that the measure was needed to boost the economy and gain financial room to maneuver for greater consolidation in 2007 . " the 2006 budget is intended to create stronger economic growth and so provide the necessary tailwind to achieve our ambitious goals in 2007 , " he said .
" next year we are planning to invest considerably more and notably drive our deficit below the eu 's 3 percent limit .

this mountain of debt alone requires servicing by the state to the tune of 40 billion euros in the current year .
meanwhile these interest payments coupled with staff expenditures , state contributions to the pensions system and huge spending on social welfare make up two-thirds of the entire budget . but steinbrück warned against populist calls from the opposition demanding sweeping cuts to these costs . " abrupt cuts and sudden changes in welfare policy will only lead to social upheaval and a disintegration of our complex society , " he said .
" forces would be strengthened that could undo social cohesion in germany .

opposition laments extra spending but the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who are the strongest opposition force , did n't hold back with stinging criticism of the government 's budget policy .

" i can not see a change of political course in this budget , " he said .
" mrs. merkel is even increasing the amount of new debts by 7 billion euros compared with the previous government .
there is more expenditure , less savings and a continuation of the ongoing violation of our constitution . " other opposition speakers claimed that , contrary to what the government says , there was room for consolidation as additional revenue from rising company profits was already accumulating this year .
they accused merkel of using the dire state of the budget as an excuse for her plans to raise value-added tax by 3 percent next year . steinbrück replied that 2007 would be a fateful year and that it would n't hurt to save for a rainy day when growth and consumption are expected to drop as a result of the consolidation effort . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business confidence soars to 15-year high business confidence in germany has reached a 15-year high .

the finance minister told parliament on tuesday that the measure was needed to boost the economy and gain financial room to maneuver for greater consolidation in 2007 . " the 2006 budget is intended to create stronger economic growth and so provide the necessary tailwind to achieve our ambitious goals in 2007 , " he said .
" next year we are planning to invest considerably more and notably drive our deficit below the eu 's 3 percent limit . " staggering national debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's debt clock keeps climbing by the second the fresh borrowing , however , will increase germany 's national debt to a staggering 900 billion euros .
this mountain of debt alone requires servicing by the state to the tune of 40 billion euros in the current year .
meanwhile these interest payments coupled with staff expenditures , state contributions to the pensions system and huge spending on social welfare make up two-thirds of the entire budget . but steinbrück warned against populist calls from the opposition demanding sweeping cuts to these costs . " abrupt cuts and sudden changes in welfare policy will only lead to social upheaval and a disintegration of our complex society , " he said .
" forces would be strengthened that could undo social cohesion in germany .
but i 'm afraid that those calling for sweeping changes will only come to realize that when we are facing conditions like those in paris and other french cities . "
opposition laments extra spending but the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who are the strongest opposition force , did n't hold back with stinging criticism of the government 's budget policy .
their finance expert jürgen koppelin accused chancellor merkel of lying in public with her repeated declaration that she did n't want to repeat the mistakes of the previous government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel 's government manage to reduce germany 's financial problems ?
" i can not see a change of political course in this budget , " he said .
" mrs. merkel is even increasing the amount of new debts by 7 billion euros compared with the previous government .
there is more expenditure , less savings and a continuation of the ongoing violation of our constitution . " other opposition speakers claimed that , contrary to what the government says , there was room for consolidation as additional revenue from rising company profits was already accumulating this year .
they accused merkel of using the dire state of the budget as an excuse for her plans to raise value-added tax by 3 percent next year . steinbrück replied that 2007 would be a fateful year and that it would n't hurt to save for a rainy day when growth and consumption are expected to drop as a result of the consolidation effort . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business confidence soars to 15-year high business confidence in germany has reached a 15-year high .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.03.2006 europe 's role in middle east waning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what do the elections mean for the future of the middle east ?
as part of the middle east quartet , germany and the eu have a vested interest in the israeli elections .
german middle east expert günter meyer , however , says that the influence on israel 's policies is waning . from the european perspective , which election outcome would most benefit the peace process ? the only party which has clearly set itself the goal of pushing forward with the peace process is the yachad party -lrb- " togetherness " -rrb- .
it calls for the israeli withdrawal from territory occupied in 1967 and a return to the oslo peace process .
if that were to take place , it would make peace with the palestinians a real possibility .
but this political goal is not representative of the majority in the election .
at the most five representatives from yachad will be elected . if he wins , ehud olmert has promised to establish the permanent boundaries of israel by the year 2010 .
is that a strategy germany and europe could accept or do you foresee difficulties with his plans ? the eu and germany could support the basic goal of establishing permanent borders , but only if the national boundaries respect international law .
however , that has not been the case up to now : the partially erected security fence – or apartheid wall as the palestinians call it – cuts out large chunks of occupied territory and attributes them to israel .
also the intended israeli annexation of east jerusalem , the large jewish settlements and the occupation of the eastern jordan valley are all clear breaches of international law .
finally , the one-sided definition of national borders – that is without incorporating palestinians in the negotiations – is completely unacceptable .
the result would be a forced , non-sustainable palestinian state and there would be no chance of peace in the middle east . how much political influence do germany and the eu have at the moment as part of the middle east quartet ? german and european influence on israel 's politics is close to nothing .
on the palestinian side , however , europe 's economic and humanitarian support is absolutely essential if we want to avoid further chaos and destabilization in the territories . how has germany 's role in the middle east changed since the government under chancellor angela merkel came into power ? the new government has shifted its political priorities unequivocally in favor of israel .
by doing so it has lost in the eyes of the palestinians and the rest of the arab world its trustworthiness as an impartial negotiator in the conflict . is there a danger that the conflict between israel and the palestinians will be neglected because other countries such as iran and iraq have moved to the forefront of the international focus ? this is no longer a potential risk .
it already reflects the current reality .
the fact that the construction of the security fence and the expansion of israeli enclaves in the occupied territories continue to be ignored by international politics and the public is the best proof of this new shift in focus . german middle east expert günter meyer is a professor at the university of mainz 's geographical institute , and the head of the center for research on the arab world .
additionally , he is a director of the german middle east studies association for contemporary research and documentation -lrb- davo -rrb- . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamas must reform itself , eu warns the eu has reiterated its stance that hamas - the palestinian militant group whose members now take up prominent seats in the new palestinian cabinet - must reform itself if it is to expect european aid in the future .
-lrb- april 20 , 2006 -rrb- europe gets in step with us policies in the middle east in 2003 , most european nations were at odds with the us over its invasion plans for iraq .
now , with a new set of challenges in the middle east , europe is increasingly aligned with washington on the hamas and iran issues .

" it is unthinkable for the prime minister to stay fixed in his position .
for us there is just one outcome and that is withdrawal of this reform . " francois chereque of the cfdt union was a bit more skeptical . " i do not know if today 's mobilization will make the prime minister give way , " he said .
" but what i do know is that each week we will be out in greater numbers . " joining the demonstrating students were transport workers , teachers and other government workers closed schools , slowed mass transit and disrupted public services . police had deployed in large numbers to avoid a repeat of last thursday 's violence , when youths , mainly from high-immigration city suburbs , set fire to cars and mugged demonstrators . villepin stands firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villepin -lrb- right -rrb- met with students and unemployed people on march 10 meanwhile unions turned down an invitation from french premier dominique de villepin to attend new talks on the contested contract , which was voted through parliament two weeks ago and is awaiting approval by constitutional experts before passing into law . opponents are demanding withdrawal of the cpe , but the prime minister is offering only " adjustments " on its two most contentious aspects : a two-year trial period , and the free hand given to employers during that period to sack under 26-year-olds without explanation . villepin told the national assembly that he regretted the union 's refusal to enter talks . " as i have said , i am ready to engage in dialogue and adjust the contract on these two points , " he said .
" i said that in writing to the unions , but they refused my extended hand . " the government insists the contract is vital to fighting youth unemployment , which can reach more than 50 percent in the poor suburbs hit by last year 's riots , but opponents say it is a breach of hard-won labor rights . sarkozy urges compromise president jacques chirac , who has so far given his backing to villepin , cancelled a visit this week to the northern port of le havre in order to stay close to the events in paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy but there were signs of dissension within the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- , whose president , interior minister nicolas sarkozy , was quoted by deputies as urging villepin to give ground . an ipsos poll for le monde newspaper gave some comfort to villepin , who has staked his political career - and presidential ambitions - on getting the cpe into law . while 63 percent of the population disapproved of his decision to stand by the cpe , views were heavily influenced by political allegiance .
some 74 percent of voters for his union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- supported his position . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de striking german doctors shed light on system ills some 20,000 doctors at german state-run hospitals lay down their stethoscopes this week demanding better pay and work conditions .

is it difficult to break through i n germa n y ? the mentality here is difficult , and i think they try to beat you down and build you up in their own way , with their own set of rules .
i think it 's difficult for young kids to come over here and learn that .
the thing you need the most is patience and you have to be in a position to wait .

landon is a good enough player to play over here , without a doubt at any club in germany , but he was able to progress and have a good thing going for him in the states .

at that time the manager of hanover 96 saw me play and asked me to come back , and i did n't let the opportunity pass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting ahead in europe takes patience , said cherundolo , right your n atio n al team colleague la n do n do n ova n left bayer leverkuse n a n d has had a lot of success i n the us league .
is it difficult to break through i n germa n y ? the mentality here is difficult , and i think they try to beat you down and build you up in their own way , with their own set of rules .
i think it 's difficult for young kids to come over here and learn that .
the thing you need the most is patience and you have to be in a position to wait .
landon was n't .
landon is a good enough player to play over here , without a doubt at any club in germany , but he was able to progress and have a good thing going for him in the states .
i had to wait here , and if you do wait your turn it will come around if you 're patient .
if you allow yourself to adapt to certain things here , you do n't have to change , but you do have to adapt . you 're the deputy captai n at ha n over a n d gregg berhalter is captai n at e n ergie cottbus i n the seco n d divisio n .
are you , as america n s , accepted as team leaders ? first and foremost you have to bring performance week in and week out , that 's the most important criteria , and on top of that you need to be a leader in training , and you ca n't be involved in any stupid things off the field .
it does n't mean you ca n't have fun , but you have to be a little responsible and always try to be positive .
i think that fits our mentality as americans anyway - to always be positive and never give up .
i think that 's something that they -lrb- the germans -rrb- admire and respect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat the usa 1-0 in the 2002 world cup quarter-finals the us team reached the quarter-fi n als four years ago .
what do you expect of this world cup i n germa n y ? it 's going to be a great event .
it 's going to be better than the last world cup as far as organization and fan support go .
i expect three very tough games for us .
i 'm looking forward to getting all the preparation over with and just get on the field against the czech republic in the first game in gelsenkirchen .
we 're concentrating on the preparation for the first round and that 's going to be tough enough to get through as it is .
if we do get through , we 'll look to see who we play in the second round and go from there . you have italy a n d gha n a i n your group as well .
is that o n e of the hardest groups ? everybody says it 's one of the hardest .
i think one of the reasons why it 's a difficult group is because we 're there , too .
and ghana is no pushover either .
for most people there are two favorites in the group , for me there are four very strong teams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's bernd schneider , left , fought cherundolo for the ball during a friendly match in dortmund after your game agai n st pola n d i n kaiserslauter n , us fa n s at the n earby ramstei n air base said they wa n ted to make your match agai n st italy i n kaiserslauter n like a home game for the us .
how big do you thi n k the fa n s support will be a n d how importa n t is it for the team ? i think it 's very important .
a pro-us crowd is something that we rarely have , even in the united states .
if we could have that at the world 's biggest stage , at a world cup , at one of the most important games for us , that would mean all the world to us . i think against poland in the second half when we went ahead , you heard the fans and you saw a difference in our play .
the guys were more confident on the ball and we really , really played well in the second half against poland .
if we could have that kind of atmosphere against italy that would be fantastic . sean sinico interviewed steve cherundolo send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann relief as germany crushes usa in friendly world cup hosts germany crushed the united states 4-1 at home on wednesday for a much-needed morale boost ahead of this summer 's soccer extravaganza .

up to now , christian groups had the greatest say , but this is slowly changing . for people in germany , the arrest and near-execution of an afghan convert to christianity in kabul is hard to understand .
in contrast to many islamic countries such as afghanistan , germany has a clear separation of church and state , at least in principle . but this separation is not as strict as one might expect .
while churches in germany do not dictate politics , they are still one of the many political players within the framework of the country 's democracy . german religious leaders make public statements on many political issues - for example on moral issues such as abortion , or social questions such as the integration of foreigners .
these statements do not , however , have the same impact as they used to .
one reason for this is the decline in the number of faithful who officially belong to a particular church . germa n churches losi n g members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full churches have become a rare sight in germany both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have been complaining for years about declining membership .
around 60 percent of people in germany belong to one of these two christian denominations ; more than 30 percent do not belong to any religious community at all . the right to practice or to leave a religion is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed under germany 's basic law .
but the state still has control over how this happens - a german citizen can only officially renounce membership in a church through a civil registry office or at a municipal court . michael basse , a church historian , said that protests by church groups after the end of world war i prevented a complete separation of church and state in germany . " there was already an attempt to introduce a radical separation of church and state during the november revolution -lrb- overthrow of the monarchy in 1918-1919 -rrb- , " basse said .
" but the protestant and catholic churches mobilized their members to hold massive demonstrations to prevent this .
during that time the main point of contention was the issue of religion classes in schools . " li n ks betwee n the church a n d state remai n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crosses hang in many german classrooms unlike schools in other secular countries , german public schools still offer religion courses , and public universities in germany continue to train future theologians .
in addition to education , there are other institutional links between the church and state . for example , the state tax authority is responsible for collecting the so-called church tax .
this goes towards financing staff , houses of worship , and social welfare institutions such as hospitals and kindergartens , which are often run by church groups . the limits of church power in germany are still defined by a clause in the legal code of the weimar republic , which dates back to the year 1919 .
it gives the two christian denominations special privileges such as tax breaks - which do not apply to other religious groups in germany . michael basse said he wonders if this is going to change .
" an interesting political question would be to what extent there is a readiness to apply these benefits to other religions , " he said . teachi n g islamic religio n i n germa n schools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few schools offer religious education for muslim students this question is of particular interest to germany 's muslim community .
the country 's three million muslims are also guaranteed freedom of worship under german law . but there are still some difficulties when it comes to religious education for muslims .
only a few federal states in germany currently have pilot projects for islamic religion classes in schools .
this is partially due to a lack of initiative on the part of the german school system . but another challenge is the high number of muslim umbrella groups and different islamic religious denominations in germany .
government officials say it is difficult to find a consistent representative for the entire muslim community who can decide on a fixed curriculum for islamic religion classes . but this will likely be resolved in the near future .
at the same time , the influence of churches on german society continues to decline .
while churches were an especially strong political force in the early days of the federal republic , their role is fading increasingly into the background , said church historian michael basse .

up to now , christian groups had the greatest say , but this is slowly changing . for people in germany , the arrest and near-execution of an afghan convert to christianity in kabul is hard to understand .
in contrast to many islamic countries such as afghanistan , germany has a clear separation of church and state , at least in principle . but this separation is not as strict as one might expect .
while churches in germany do not dictate politics , they are still one of the many political players within the framework of the country 's democracy . german religious leaders make public statements on many political issues - for example on moral issues such as abortion , or social questions such as the integration of foreigners .
these statements do not , however , have the same impact as they used to .
one reason for this is the decline in the number of faithful who officially belong to a particular church . germa n churches losi n g members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full churches have become a rare sight in germany both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have been complaining for years about declining membership .
around 60 percent of people in germany belong to one of these two christian denominations ; more than 30 percent do not belong to any religious community at all . the right to practice or to leave a religion is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed under germany 's basic law .
but the state still has control over how this happens - a german citizen can only officially renounce membership in a church through a civil registry office or at a municipal court . michael basse , a church historian , said that protests by church groups after the end of world war i prevented a complete separation of church and state in germany . " there was already an attempt to introduce a radical separation of church and state during the november revolution -lrb- overthrow of the monarchy in 1918-1919 -rrb- , " basse said .
" but the protestant and catholic churches mobilized their members to hold massive demonstrations to prevent this .

a n accomplished right back a n d deputy captai n for the bu n desliga 's ha n over 96 , cheru n dolo joi n ed the us team i n 2001 a n d is n ow amo n g the you n g team 's i n ter n atio n ally experie n ced players . dw-world.de : why did you e n d up i n germa n y , as opposed to somewhere else i n europe ? steve cherundolo : it 's always been a dream of mine to play in europe .
i grew up watching the fa english football and grew up having english coaches , but to get a work permit you ca n't go there at a young age .
i had an opportunity to come to germany when i was 19 .
at that time the manager of hanover 96 saw me play and asked me to come back , and i did n't let the opportunity pass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting ahead in europe takes patience , said cherundolo , right your n atio n al team colleague la n do n do n ova n left bayer leverkuse n a n d has had a lot of success i n the us league .
is it difficult to break through i n germa n y ? the mentality here is difficult , and i think they try to beat you down and build you up in their own way , with their own set of rules .
i think it 's difficult for young kids to come over here and learn that .
the thing you need the most is patience and you have to be in a position to wait .
landon was n't .
landon is a good enough player to play over here , without a doubt at any club in germany , but he was able to progress and have a good thing going for him in the states .
i had to wait here , and if you do wait your turn it will come around if you 're patient .
if you allow yourself to adapt to certain things here , you do n't have to change , but you do have to adapt . you 're the deputy captai n at ha n over a n d gregg berhalter is captai n at e n ergie cottbus i n the seco n d divisio n .
are you , as america n s , accepted as team leaders ? first and foremost you have to bring performance week in and week out , that 's the most important criteria , and on top of that you need to be a leader in training , and you ca n't be involved in any stupid things off the field .
it does n't mean you ca n't have fun , but you have to be a little responsible and always try to be positive .
i think that fits our mentality as americans anyway - to always be positive and never give up .
i think that 's something that they -lrb- the germans -rrb- admire and respect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat the usa 1-0 in the 2002 world cup quarter-finals the us team reached the quarter-fi n als four years ago .
what do you expect of this world cup i n germa n y ? it 's going to be a great event .
it 's going to be better than the last world cup as far as organization and fan support go .
i expect three very tough games for us .
i 'm looking forward to getting all the preparation over with and just get on the field against the czech republic in the first game in gelsenkirchen .
we 're concentrating on the preparation for the first round and that 's going to be tough enough to get through as it is .
if we do get through , we 'll look to see who we play in the second round and go from there . you have italy a n d gha n a i n your group as well .
is that o n e of the hardest groups ? everybody says it 's one of the hardest .
i think one of the reasons why it 's a difficult group is because we 're there , too .
and ghana is no pushover either .
for most people there are two favorites in the group , for me there are four very strong teams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's bernd schneider , left , fought cherundolo for the ball during a friendly match in dortmund after your game agai n st pola n d i n kaiserslauter n , us fa n s at the n earby ramstei n air base said they wa n ted to make your match agai n st italy i n kaiserslauter n like a home game for the us .
how big do you thi n k the fa n s support will be a n d how importa n t is it for the team ? i think it 's very important .

i grew up watching the fa english football and grew up having english coaches , but to get a work permit you ca n't go there at a young age .
i had an opportunity to come to germany when i was 19 .
at that time the manager of hanover 96 saw me play and asked me to come back , and i did n't let the opportunity pass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting ahead in europe takes patience , said cherundolo , right your n atio n al team colleague la n do n do n ova n left bayer leverkuse n a n d has had a lot of success i n the us league .
is it difficult to break through i n germa n y ? the mentality here is difficult , and i think they try to beat you down and build you up in their own way , with their own set of rules .
i think it 's difficult for young kids to come over here and learn that .
the thing you need the most is patience and you have to be in a position to wait .
landon was n't .
landon is a good enough player to play over here , without a doubt at any club in germany , but he was able to progress and have a good thing going for him in the states .
i had to wait here , and if you do wait your turn it will come around if you 're patient .
if you allow yourself to adapt to certain things here , you do n't have to change , but you do have to adapt . you 're the deputy captai n at ha n over a n d gregg berhalter is captai n at e n ergie cottbus i n the seco n d divisio n .
are you , as america n s , accepted as team leaders ? first and foremost you have to bring performance week in and week out , that 's the most important criteria , and on top of that you need to be a leader in training , and you ca n't be involved in any stupid things off the field .
it does n't mean you ca n't have fun , but you have to be a little responsible and always try to be positive .
i think that fits our mentality as americans anyway - to always be positive and never give up .
i think that 's something that they -lrb- the germans -rrb- admire and respect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat the usa 1-0 in the 2002 world cup quarter-finals the us team reached the quarter-fi n als four years ago .
what do you expect of this world cup i n germa n y ? it 's going to be a great event .
it 's going to be better than the last world cup as far as organization and fan support go .
i expect three very tough games for us .
i 'm looking forward to getting all the preparation over with and just get on the field against the czech republic in the first game in gelsenkirchen .
we 're concentrating on the preparation for the first round and that 's going to be tough enough to get through as it is .
if we do get through , we 'll look to see who we play in the second round and go from there . you have italy a n d gha n a i n your group as well .
is that o n e of the hardest groups ? everybody says it 's one of the hardest .
i think one of the reasons why it 's a difficult group is because we 're there , too .

for most people there are two favorites in the group , for me there are four very strong teams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's bernd schneider , left , fought cherundolo for the ball during a friendly match in dortmund after your game agai n st pola n d i n kaiserslauter n , us fa n s at the n earby ramstei n air base said they wa n ted to make your match agai n st italy i n kaiserslauter n like a home game for the us .

i grew up watching the fa english football and grew up having english coaches , but to get a work permit you ca n't go there at a young age .
i had an opportunity to come to germany when i was 19 .
at that time the manager of hanover 96 saw me play and asked me to come back , and i did n't let the opportunity pass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting ahead in europe takes patience , said cherundolo , right your n atio n al team colleague la n do n do n ova n left bayer leverkuse n a n d has had a lot of success i n the us league .
is it difficult to break through i n germa n y ? the mentality here is difficult , and i think they try to beat you down and build you up in their own way , with their own set of rules .
i think it 's difficult for young kids to come over here and learn that .
the thing you need the most is patience and you have to be in a position to wait .

landon is a good enough player to play over here , without a doubt at any club in germany , but he was able to progress and have a good thing going for him in the states .
i had to wait here , and if you do wait your turn it will come around if you 're patient .

it does n't mean you ca n't have fun , but you have to be a little responsible and always try to be positive .

but will they provide new impetus for the peace process ? acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert appears to be on course for victory on tuesday , despite having seen his kadima party 's lead slip in the run-up to the elections . olmert has called the poll a referendum on his plan to redefine israel 's borders - a plan which involves evacuating dozens of small jewish settlements in the west bank , while strengthening larger jewish enclaves on land palestinians want for an independent state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert plans to redefine israel 's borders if victorious for his strategy to work , kadima , the party founded by ailing prime minister ariel sharon , and its desired coalition partner - most likely the center-left labor party - will need enough support to form a majority . experts say that 's unlikely to happen . " no party is going to get an absolute majority , so it has to be a coalition government , and the optimal solution would be a coalition between kadima and the labor party , " said middle east expert udo steinbach , head of the german orient institute in hamburg .
" what must be avoided is that -lrb- benjamin -rrb- netanyahu and the likud party have any major influence , because they do n't provide any perspective as far as the peace process is concerned . " but olmert 's plans regarding israel 's borders are not without controversy .
olmert has argued that the need to separate from the palestinians is greater than ever since the militant islamic movement hamas won palestinian elections in january .
although there is broad support among israelis for his strategy , the eu , the united states and other players in the peace process are wary of giving israel the green light to annex contested land . indeed , israel 's problems with hamas could be worsened should olmert win electoral support for his plan , steinbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas ' victory has muddied the waters of eu involvement " the way that hamas is going to behave to an overwhelming extent depends on what the israelis offer them , " he said .
" if olmert goes ahead in a unilateral way , that will likely radicalize hamas , but if he makes them an offer to find a joint solution , hamas could turn out to be a fairly pragmatic partner . " he added , however , that the problem of the settlements aside , olmert is generally the favored candidate among europeans . " i would consider him to be reasonably pragmatic in terms of going along with the peace process , and going along with the international community , " steinbach said . eu 's israel policy should olmert be confirmed in office , there will likely be no great change in the eu 's policy on israel . the eu backs the peace plan now known as the road map , which foresees a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
in advancing this goal , brussels performs a balancing act , striving never to appear too partial to either side . just as the eu deplores palestinian acts of terror and demands that hamas renounce violence , it also rejects certain aspects of current israeli policy , such as the erection of the so-called security wall to isolate palestinian communities , and the expansion of settlements in the west bank . in the past , the eu 's involvement in the conflict was limited to providing financial backing and reconstruction aid .
the bloc 's evolution from mere financier to active political participant has been recognized by shimon peres , a former israeli prime minister and current candidate for kadima . " there were times in israel when people viewed the role of europe skeptically , " he said .
" this is no longer the case .
europe is no longer just a payer but a player .
the eu has fulfilled some tasks which nobody else could have done . " for his part though , steinbach thinks europe 's mediation efforts have stagnated recently , in large part because of a lack of support from the united states . " i think we were in better shape two years ago when the road map came into being , " said steinbach .
" at that time , the europeans were much more active , they were trying to push things into one direction or another and the problem was that the us was not going along with them . " german influence waning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer made the middle east a main priority steinbach is concerned that , with the us focusing on other countries in the middle east , namely iraq and iran , the israeli-palestinian conflict is being neglected .
germany 's involvement , too , has leveled off of late , he added .
under the previous social democrat-led coalition , foreign minister joschka fischer took an unprecedented interest in the region , making numerous visits there for talks with leaders on both sides of the conflict .
under the new government , that 's changed , said steinbach . " whatever they 're doing , they are doing within the eu context , " steinbach said . " talking with arabs , i have found there is a certain disillusionment about the german approach as far as the new government is concerned , " he said . " other countries in the middle east are watching very closely , and the new government is seen critically because it is viewed as doing more fence-mending with the americans than having its own approach as far as the middle east is concerned .

but will they provide new impetus for the peace process ? acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert appears to be on course for victory on tuesday , despite having seen his kadima party 's lead slip in the run-up to the elections . olmert has called the poll a referendum on his plan to redefine israel 's borders - a plan which involves evacuating dozens of small jewish settlements in the west bank , while strengthening larger jewish enclaves on land palestinians want for an independent state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert plans to redefine israel 's borders if victorious for his strategy to work , kadima , the party founded by ailing prime minister ariel sharon , and its desired coalition partner - most likely the center-left labor party - will need enough support to form a majority . experts say that 's unlikely to happen . " no party is going to get an absolute majority , so it has to be a coalition government , and the optimal solution would be a coalition between kadima and the labor party , " said middle east expert udo steinbach , head of the german orient institute in hamburg .
" what must be avoided is that -lrb- benjamin -rrb- netanyahu and the likud party have any major influence , because they do n't provide any perspective as far as the peace process is concerned . " but olmert 's plans regarding israel 's borders are not without controversy .
olmert has argued that the need to separate from the palestinians is greater than ever since the militant islamic movement hamas won palestinian elections in january .
although there is broad support among israelis for his strategy , the eu , the united states and other players in the peace process are wary of giving israel the green light to annex contested land . indeed , israel 's problems with hamas could be worsened should olmert win electoral support for his plan , steinbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas ' victory has muddied the waters of eu involvement " the way that hamas is going to behave to an overwhelming extent depends on what the israelis offer them , " he said .
" if olmert goes ahead in a unilateral way , that will likely radicalize hamas , but if he makes them an offer to find a joint solution , hamas could turn out to be a fairly pragmatic partner . " he added , however , that the problem of the settlements aside , olmert is generally the favored candidate among europeans . " i would consider him to be reasonably pragmatic in terms of going along with the peace process , and going along with the international community , " steinbach said . eu 's israel policy should olmert be confirmed in office , there will likely be no great change in the eu 's policy on israel . the eu backs the peace plan now known as the road map , which foresees a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
in advancing this goal , brussels performs a balancing act , striving never to appear too partial to either side . just as the eu deplores palestinian acts of terror and demands that hamas renounce violence , it also rejects certain aspects of current israeli policy , such as the erection of the so-called security wall to isolate palestinian communities , and the expansion of settlements in the west bank . in the past , the eu 's involvement in the conflict was limited to providing financial backing and reconstruction aid .
the bloc 's evolution from mere financier to active political participant has been recognized by shimon peres , a former israeli prime minister and current candidate for kadima . " there were times in israel when people viewed the role of europe skeptically , " he said .
" this is no longer the case .
europe is no longer just a payer but a player .
the eu has fulfilled some tasks which nobody else could have done . " for his part though , steinbach thinks europe 's mediation efforts have stagnated recently , in large part because of a lack of support from the united states . " i think we were in better shape two years ago when the road map came into being , " said steinbach .
" at that time , the europeans were much more active , they were trying to push things into one direction or another and the problem was that the us was not going along with them . " german influence waning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer made the middle east a main priority steinbach is concerned that , with the us focusing on other countries in the middle east , namely iraq and iran , the israeli-palestinian conflict is being neglected .
germany 's involvement , too , has leveled off of late , he added .
under the previous social democrat-led coalition , foreign minister joschka fischer took an unprecedented interest in the region , making numerous visits there for talks with leaders on both sides of the conflict .

" i would consider him to be reasonably pragmatic in terms of going along with the peace process , and going along with the international community , " steinbach said . eu 's israel policy should olmert be confirmed in office , there will likely be no great change in the eu 's policy on israel . the eu backs the peace plan now known as the road map , which foresees a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
in advancing this goal , brussels performs a balancing act , striving never to appear too partial to either side . just as the eu deplores palestinian acts of terror and demands that hamas renounce violence , it also rejects certain aspects of current israeli policy , such as the erection of the so-called security wall to isolate palestinian communities , and the expansion of settlements in the west bank . in the past , the eu 's involvement in the conflict was limited to providing financial backing and reconstruction aid .
the bloc 's evolution from mere financier to active political participant has been recognized by shimon peres , a former israeli prime minister and current candidate for kadima . " there were times in israel when people viewed the role of europe skeptically , " he said .
" this is no longer the case .
europe is no longer just a payer but a player .
the eu has fulfilled some tasks which nobody else could have done . " for his part though , steinbach thinks europe 's mediation efforts have stagnated recently , in large part because of a lack of support from the united states . " i think we were in better shape two years ago when the road map came into being , " said steinbach .
" at that time , the europeans were much more active , they were trying to push things into one direction or another and the problem was that the us was not going along with them . " german influence waning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer made the middle east a main priority steinbach is concerned that , with the us focusing on other countries in the middle east , namely iraq and iran , the israeli-palestinian conflict is being neglected .
germany 's involvement , too , has leveled off of late , he added .
under the previous social democrat-led coalition , foreign minister joschka fischer took an unprecedented interest in the region , making numerous visits there for talks with leaders on both sides of the conflict .
under the new government , that 's changed , said steinbach . " whatever they 're doing , they are doing within the eu context , " steinbach said . " talking with arabs , i have found there is a certain disillusionment about the german approach as far as the new government is concerned , " he said . " other countries in the middle east are watching very closely , and the new government is seen critically because it is viewed as doing more fence-mending with the americans than having its own approach as far as the middle east is concerned .

up to now , christian groups had the greatest say , but this is slowly changing . for people in germany , the arrest and near-execution of an afghan convert to christianity in kabul is hard to understand .
in contrast to many islamic countries such as afghanistan , germany has a clear separation of church and state , at least in principle . but this separation is not as strict as one might expect .
while churches in germany do not dictate politics , they are still one of the many political players within the framework of the country 's democracy . german religious leaders make public statements on many political issues - for example on moral issues such as abortion , or social questions such as the integration of foreigners .
these statements do not , however , have the same impact as they used to .
one reason for this is the decline in the number of faithful who officially belong to a particular church . germa n churches losi n g members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full churches have become a rare sight in germany both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have been complaining for years about declining membership .
around 60 percent of people in germany belong to one of these two christian denominations ; more than 30 percent do not belong to any religious community at all . the right to practice or to leave a religion is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed under germany 's basic law .
but the state still has control over how this happens - a german citizen can only officially renounce membership in a church through a civil registry office or at a municipal court . michael basse , a church historian , said that protests by church groups after the end of world war i prevented a complete separation of church and state in germany . " there was already an attempt to introduce a radical separation of church and state during the november revolution -lrb- overthrow of the monarchy in 1918-1919 -rrb- , " basse said .
" but the protestant and catholic churches mobilized their members to hold massive demonstrations to prevent this .

in addition to education , there are other institutional links between the church and state . for example , the state tax authority is responsible for collecting the so-called church tax .
this goes towards financing staff , houses of worship , and social welfare institutions such as hospitals and kindergartens , which are often run by church groups . the limits of church power in germany are still defined by a clause in the legal code of the weimar republic , which dates back to the year 1919 .
it gives the two christian denominations special privileges such as tax breaks - which do not apply to other religious groups in germany . michael basse said he wonders if this is going to change .

the country 's three million muslims are also guaranteed freedom of worship under german law . but there are still some difficulties when it comes to religious education for muslims .
only a few federal states in germany currently have pilot projects for islamic religion classes in schools .
this is partially due to a lack of initiative on the part of the german school system . but another challenge is the high number of muslim umbrella groups and different islamic religious denominations in germany .
government officials say it is difficult to find a consistent representative for the entire muslim community who can decide on a fixed curriculum for islamic religion classes . but this will likely be resolved in the near future .
at the same time , the influence of churches on german society continues to decline .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on religion german muslim group elects islam convert for top post intelligent design debate arrives in germany germany 's jewish community begins search for new president " germany should lead fight against anti-semitism " germany -pipe- 28.03.2006 germany 's not-quite-so-secular democracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom of religion is guaranteed under germany 's constitution religion still plays a significant role in german politics , despite an official separation of church and state .
up to now , christian groups had the greatest say , but this is slowly changing . for people in germany , the arrest and near-execution of an afghan convert to christianity in kabul is hard to understand .
in contrast to many islamic countries such as afghanistan , germany has a clear separation of church and state , at least in principle . but this separation is not as strict as one might expect .
while churches in germany do not dictate politics , they are still one of the many political players within the framework of the country 's democracy . german religious leaders make public statements on many political issues - for example on moral issues such as abortion , or social questions such as the integration of foreigners .
these statements do not , however , have the same impact as they used to .
one reason for this is the decline in the number of faithful who officially belong to a particular church . germa n churches losi n g members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full churches have become a rare sight in germany both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have been complaining for years about declining membership .
around 60 percent of people in germany belong to one of these two christian denominations ; more than 30 percent do not belong to any religious community at all . the right to practice or to leave a religion is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed under germany 's basic law .
but the state still has control over how this happens - a german citizen can only officially renounce membership in a church through a civil registry office or at a municipal court . michael basse , a church historian , said that protests by church groups after the end of world war i prevented a complete separation of church and state in germany . " there was already an attempt to introduce a radical separation of church and state during the november revolution -lrb- overthrow of the monarchy in 1918-1919 -rrb- , " basse said .
" but the protestant and catholic churches mobilized their members to hold massive demonstrations to prevent this .
during that time the main point of contention was the issue of religion classes in schools . " li n ks betwee n the church a n d state remai n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crosses hang in many german classrooms unlike schools in other secular countries , german public schools still offer religion courses , and public universities in germany continue to train future theologians .
in addition to education , there are other institutional links between the church and state . for example , the state tax authority is responsible for collecting the so-called church tax .
this goes towards financing staff , houses of worship , and social welfare institutions such as hospitals and kindergartens , which are often run by church groups . the limits of church power in germany are still defined by a clause in the legal code of the weimar republic , which dates back to the year 1919 .
it gives the two christian denominations special privileges such as tax breaks - which do not apply to other religious groups in germany . michael basse said he wonders if this is going to change .
" an interesting political question would be to what extent there is a readiness to apply these benefits to other religions , " he said . teachi n g islamic religio n i n germa n schools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few schools offer religious education for muslim students this question is of particular interest to germany 's muslim community .
the country 's three million muslims are also guaranteed freedom of worship under german law . but there are still some difficulties when it comes to religious education for muslims .
only a few federal states in germany currently have pilot projects for islamic religion classes in schools .
this is partially due to a lack of initiative on the part of the german school system . but another challenge is the high number of muslim umbrella groups and different islamic religious denominations in germany .
government officials say it is difficult to find a consistent representative for the entire muslim community who can decide on a fixed curriculum for islamic religion classes . but this will likely be resolved in the near future .
at the same time , the influence of churches on german society continues to decline .
while churches were an especially strong political force in the early days of the federal republic , their role is fading increasingly into the background , said church historian michael basse . " the times in which politicians had to fear the power of the churches are long gone , " he said . dw staff -lrb- my -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row erupts over ethics and religion ruling conservative politicians in germany are up in arms over the decision made by the ruling spd-green government to make lessons in ethics and religion compulsory in berlin .

the finance minister told parliament on tuesday that the measure was needed to boost the economy and gain financial room to maneuver for greater consolidation in 2007 . " the 2006 budget is intended to create stronger economic growth and so provide the necessary tailwind to achieve our ambitious goals in 2007 , " he said .
" next year we are planning to invest considerably more and notably drive our deficit below the eu 's 3 percent limit . " staggering national debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's debt clock keeps climbing by the second the fresh borrowing , however , will increase germany 's national debt to a staggering 900 billion euros .
this mountain of debt alone requires servicing by the state to the tune of 40 billion euros in the current year .
meanwhile these interest payments coupled with staff expenditures , state contributions to the pensions system and huge spending on social welfare make up two-thirds of the entire budget . but steinbrück warned against populist calls from the opposition demanding sweeping cuts to these costs . " abrupt cuts and sudden changes in welfare policy will only lead to social upheaval and a disintegration of our complex society , " he said .
" forces would be strengthened that could undo social cohesion in germany .
but i 'm afraid that those calling for sweeping changes will only come to realize that when we are facing conditions like those in paris and other french cities . "
opposition laments extra spending but the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who are the strongest opposition force , did n't hold back with stinging criticism of the government 's budget policy .
their finance expert jürgen koppelin accused chancellor merkel of lying in public with her repeated declaration that she did n't want to repeat the mistakes of the previous government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel 's government manage to reduce germany 's financial problems ?
" i can not see a change of political course in this budget , " he said .
" mrs. merkel is even increasing the amount of new debts by 7 billion euros compared with the previous government .
there is more expenditure , less savings and a continuation of the ongoing violation of our constitution . " other opposition speakers claimed that , contrary to what the government says , there was room for consolidation as additional revenue from rising company profits was already accumulating this year .
they accused merkel of using the dire state of the budget as an excuse for her plans to raise value-added tax by 3 percent next year . steinbrück replied that 2007 would be a fateful year and that it would n't hurt to save for a rainy day when growth and consumption are expected to drop as a result of the consolidation effort . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business confidence soars to 15-year high business confidence in germany has reached a 15-year high .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.03.2006 europe 's role in middle east waning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what do the elections mean for the future of the middle east ?
as part of the middle east quartet , germany and the eu have a vested interest in the israeli elections .
german middle east expert günter meyer , however , says that the influence on israel 's policies is waning . from the european perspective , which election outcome would most benefit the peace process ? the only party which has clearly set itself the goal of pushing forward with the peace process is the yachad party -lrb- " togetherness " -rrb- .
it calls for the israeli withdrawal from territory occupied in 1967 and a return to the oslo peace process .
if that were to take place , it would make peace with the palestinians a real possibility .
but this political goal is not representative of the majority in the election .
at the most five representatives from yachad will be elected . if he wins , ehud olmert has promised to establish the permanent boundaries of israel by the year 2010 .
is that a strategy germany and europe could accept or do you foresee difficulties with his plans ? the eu and germany could support the basic goal of establishing permanent borders , but only if the national boundaries respect international law .
however , that has not been the case up to now : the partially erected security fence – or apartheid wall as the palestinians call it – cuts out large chunks of occupied territory and attributes them to israel .
also the intended israeli annexation of east jerusalem , the large jewish settlements and the occupation of the eastern jordan valley are all clear breaches of international law .
finally , the one-sided definition of national borders – that is without incorporating palestinians in the negotiations – is completely unacceptable .
the result would be a forced , non-sustainable palestinian state and there would be no chance of peace in the middle east . how much political influence do germany and the eu have at the moment as part of the middle east quartet ? german and european influence on israel 's politics is close to nothing .
on the palestinian side , however , europe 's economic and humanitarian support is absolutely essential if we want to avoid further chaos and destabilization in the territories . how has germany 's role in the middle east changed since the government under chancellor angela merkel came into power ? the new government has shifted its political priorities unequivocally in favor of israel .
by doing so it has lost in the eyes of the palestinians and the rest of the arab world its trustworthiness as an impartial negotiator in the conflict . is there a danger that the conflict between israel and the palestinians will be neglected because other countries such as iran and iraq have moved to the forefront of the international focus ? this is no longer a potential risk .
it already reflects the current reality .

as part of the middle east quartet , germany and the eu have a vested interest in the israeli elections .
german middle east expert günter meyer , however , says that the influence on israel 's policies is waning . from the european perspective , which election outcome would most benefit the peace process ? the only party which has clearly set itself the goal of pushing forward with the peace process is the yachad party -lrb- " togetherness " -rrb- .
it calls for the israeli withdrawal from territory occupied in 1967 and a return to the oslo peace process .
if that were to take place , it would make peace with the palestinians a real possibility .
but this political goal is not representative of the majority in the election .
at the most five representatives from yachad will be elected . if he wins , ehud olmert has promised to establish the permanent boundaries of israel by the year 2010 .
is that a strategy germany and europe could accept or do you foresee difficulties with his plans ? the eu and germany could support the basic goal of establishing permanent borders , but only if the national boundaries respect international law .
however , that has not been the case up to now : the partially erected security fence – or apartheid wall as the palestinians call it – cuts out large chunks of occupied territory and attributes them to israel .
also the intended israeli annexation of east jerusalem , the large jewish settlements and the occupation of the eastern jordan valley are all clear breaches of international law .
finally , the one-sided definition of national borders – that is without incorporating palestinians in the negotiations – is completely unacceptable .
the result would be a forced , non-sustainable palestinian state and there would be no chance of peace in the middle east . how much political influence do germany and the eu have at the moment as part of the middle east quartet ? german and european influence on israel 's politics is close to nothing .
on the palestinian side , however , europe 's economic and humanitarian support is absolutely essential if we want to avoid further chaos and destabilization in the territories . how has germany 's role in the middle east changed since the government under chancellor angela merkel came into power ? the new government has shifted its political priorities unequivocally in favor of israel .
by doing so it has lost in the eyes of the palestinians and the rest of the arab world its trustworthiness as an impartial negotiator in the conflict . is there a danger that the conflict between israel and the palestinians will be neglected because other countries such as iran and iraq have moved to the forefront of the international focus ? this is no longer a potential risk .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.03.2006 europe 's role in middle east waning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what do the elections mean for the future of the middle east ?
as part of the middle east quartet , germany and the eu have a vested interest in the israeli elections .
german middle east expert günter meyer , however , says that the influence on israel 's policies is waning . from the european perspective , which election outcome would most benefit the peace process ? the only party which has clearly set itself the goal of pushing forward with the peace process is the yachad party -lrb- " togetherness " -rrb- .
it calls for the israeli withdrawal from territory occupied in 1967 and a return to the oslo peace process .
if that were to take place , it would make peace with the palestinians a real possibility .
but this political goal is not representative of the majority in the election .
at the most five representatives from yachad will be elected . if he wins , ehud olmert has promised to establish the permanent boundaries of israel by the year 2010 .
is that a strategy germany and europe could accept or do you foresee difficulties with his plans ? the eu and germany could support the basic goal of establishing permanent borders , but only if the national boundaries respect international law .
however , that has not been the case up to now : the partially erected security fence – or apartheid wall as the palestinians call it – cuts out large chunks of occupied territory and attributes them to israel .
also the intended israeli annexation of east jerusalem , the large jewish settlements and the occupation of the eastern jordan valley are all clear breaches of international law .
finally , the one-sided definition of national borders – that is without incorporating palestinians in the negotiations – is completely unacceptable .
the result would be a forced , non-sustainable palestinian state and there would be no chance of peace in the middle east . how much political influence do germany and the eu have at the moment as part of the middle east quartet ? german and european influence on israel 's politics is close to nothing .
on the palestinian side , however , europe 's economic and humanitarian support is absolutely essential if we want to avoid further chaos and destabilization in the territories . how has germany 's role in the middle east changed since the government under chancellor angela merkel came into power ? the new government has shifted its political priorities unequivocally in favor of israel .
by doing so it has lost in the eyes of the palestinians and the rest of the arab world its trustworthiness as an impartial negotiator in the conflict . is there a danger that the conflict between israel and the palestinians will be neglected because other countries such as iran and iraq have moved to the forefront of the international focus ? this is no longer a potential risk .
it already reflects the current reality .
the fact that the construction of the security fence and the expansion of israeli enclaves in the occupied territories continue to be ignored by international politics and the public is the best proof of this new shift in focus . german middle east expert günter meyer is a professor at the university of mainz 's geographical institute , and the head of the center for research on the arab world .
additionally , he is a director of the german middle east studies association for contemporary research and documentation -lrb- davo -rrb- . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamas must reform itself , eu warns the eu has reiterated its stance that hamas - the palestinian militant group whose members now take up prominent seats in the new palestinian cabinet - must reform itself if it is to expect european aid in the future .
-lrb- april 20 , 2006 -rrb- europe gets in step with us policies in the middle east in 2003 , most european nations were at odds with the us over its invasion plans for iraq .
now , with a new set of challenges in the middle east , europe is increasingly aligned with washington on the hamas and iran issues .

up to now , christian groups had the greatest say , but this is slowly changing . for people in germany , the arrest and near-execution of an afghan convert to christianity in kabul is hard to understand .
in contrast to many islamic countries such as afghanistan , germany has a clear separation of church and state , at least in principle . but this separation is not as strict as one might expect .
while churches in germany do not dictate politics , they are still one of the many political players within the framework of the country 's democracy . german religious leaders make public statements on many political issues - for example on moral issues such as abortion , or social questions such as the integration of foreigners .
these statements do not , however , have the same impact as they used to .
one reason for this is the decline in the number of faithful who officially belong to a particular church . germa n churches losi n g members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full churches have become a rare sight in germany both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have been complaining for years about declining membership .
around 60 percent of people in germany belong to one of these two christian denominations ; more than 30 percent do not belong to any religious community at all . the right to practice or to leave a religion is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed under germany 's basic law .
but the state still has control over how this happens - a german citizen can only officially renounce membership in a church through a civil registry office or at a municipal court . michael basse , a church historian , said that protests by church groups after the end of world war i prevented a complete separation of church and state in germany . " there was already an attempt to introduce a radical separation of church and state during the november revolution -lrb- overthrow of the monarchy in 1918-1919 -rrb- , " basse said .
" but the protestant and catholic churches mobilized their members to hold massive demonstrations to prevent this .
during that time the main point of contention was the issue of religion classes in schools . " li n ks betwee n the church a n d state remai n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crosses hang in many german classrooms unlike schools in other secular countries , german public schools still offer religion courses , and public universities in germany continue to train future theologians .
in addition to education , there are other institutional links between the church and state . for example , the state tax authority is responsible for collecting the so-called church tax .
this goes towards financing staff , houses of worship , and social welfare institutions such as hospitals and kindergartens , which are often run by church groups . the limits of church power in germany are still defined by a clause in the legal code of the weimar republic , which dates back to the year 1919 .
it gives the two christian denominations special privileges such as tax breaks - which do not apply to other religious groups in germany . michael basse said he wonders if this is going to change .
" an interesting political question would be to what extent there is a readiness to apply these benefits to other religions , " he said . teachi n g islamic religio n i n germa n schools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few schools offer religious education for muslim students this question is of particular interest to germany 's muslim community .
the country 's three million muslims are also guaranteed freedom of worship under german law . but there are still some difficulties when it comes to religious education for muslims .
only a few federal states in germany currently have pilot projects for islamic religion classes in schools .
this is partially due to a lack of initiative on the part of the german school system . but another challenge is the high number of muslim umbrella groups and different islamic religious denominations in germany .
government officials say it is difficult to find a consistent representative for the entire muslim community who can decide on a fixed curriculum for islamic religion classes . but this will likely be resolved in the near future .
at the same time , the influence of churches on german society continues to decline .
while churches were an especially strong political force in the early days of the federal republic , their role is fading increasingly into the background , said church historian michael basse . " the times in which politicians had to fear the power of the churches are long gone , " he said . dw staff -lrb- my -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row erupts over ethics and religion ruling conservative politicians in germany are up in arms over the decision made by the ruling spd-green government to make lessons in ethics and religion compulsory in berlin .

" it is unthinkable for the prime minister to stay fixed in his position .
for us there is just one outcome and that is withdrawal of this reform . " francois chereque of the cfdt union was a bit more skeptical . " i do not know if today 's mobilization will make the prime minister give way , " he said .
" but what i do know is that each week we will be out in greater numbers . " joining the demonstrating students were transport workers , teachers and other government workers closed schools , slowed mass transit and disrupted public services . police had deployed in large numbers to avoid a repeat of last thursday 's violence , when youths , mainly from high-immigration city suburbs , set fire to cars and mugged demonstrators . villepin stands firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villepin -lrb- right -rrb- met with students and unemployed people on march 10 meanwhile unions turned down an invitation from french premier dominique de villepin to attend new talks on the contested contract , which was voted through parliament two weeks ago and is awaiting approval by constitutional experts before passing into law . opponents are demanding withdrawal of the cpe , but the prime minister is offering only " adjustments " on its two most contentious aspects : a two-year trial period , and the free hand given to employers during that period to sack under 26-year-olds without explanation . villepin told the national assembly that he regretted the union 's refusal to enter talks . " as i have said , i am ready to engage in dialogue and adjust the contract on these two points , " he said .
" i said that in writing to the unions , but they refused my extended hand . " the government insists the contract is vital to fighting youth unemployment , which can reach more than 50 percent in the poor suburbs hit by last year 's riots , but opponents say it is a breach of hard-won labor rights . sarkozy urges compromise president jacques chirac , who has so far given his backing to villepin , cancelled a visit this week to the northern port of le havre in order to stay close to the events in paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy but there were signs of dissension within the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- , whose president , interior minister nicolas sarkozy , was quoted by deputies as urging villepin to give ground . an ipsos poll for le monde newspaper gave some comfort to villepin , who has staked his political career - and presidential ambitions - on getting the cpe into law . while 63 percent of the population disapproved of his decision to stand by the cpe , views were heavily influenced by political allegiance .
some 74 percent of voters for his union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- supported his position . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de striking german doctors shed light on system ills some 20,000 doctors at german state-run hospitals lay down their stethoscopes this week demanding better pay and work conditions .

a n accomplished right back a n d deputy captai n for the bu n desliga 's ha n over 96 , cheru n dolo joi n ed the us team i n 2001 a n d is n ow amo n g the you n g team 's i n ter n atio n ally experie n ced players . dw-world.de : why did you e n d up i n germa n y , as opposed to somewhere else i n europe ? steve cherundolo : it 's always been a dream of mine to play in europe .
i grew up watching the fa english football and grew up having english coaches , but to get a work permit you ca n't go there at a young age .
i had an opportunity to come to germany when i was 19 .
at that time the manager of hanover 96 saw me play and asked me to come back , and i did n't let the opportunity pass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting ahead in europe takes patience , said cherundolo , right your n atio n al team colleague la n do n do n ova n left bayer leverkuse n a n d has had a lot of success i n the us league .
is it difficult to break through i n germa n y ? the mentality here is difficult , and i think they try to beat you down and build you up in their own way , with their own set of rules .
i think it 's difficult for young kids to come over here and learn that .
the thing you need the most is patience and you have to be in a position to wait .
landon was n't .
landon is a good enough player to play over here , without a doubt at any club in germany , but he was able to progress and have a good thing going for him in the states .
i had to wait here , and if you do wait your turn it will come around if you 're patient .
if you allow yourself to adapt to certain things here , you do n't have to change , but you do have to adapt . you 're the deputy captai n at ha n over a n d gregg berhalter is captai n at e n ergie cottbus i n the seco n d divisio n .
are you , as america n s , accepted as team leaders ? first and foremost you have to bring performance week in and week out , that 's the most important criteria , and on top of that you need to be a leader in training , and you ca n't be involved in any stupid things off the field .
it does n't mean you ca n't have fun , but you have to be a little responsible and always try to be positive .
i think that fits our mentality as americans anyway - to always be positive and never give up .
i think that 's something that they -lrb- the germans -rrb- admire and respect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat the usa 1-0 in the 2002 world cup quarter-finals the us team reached the quarter-fi n als four years ago .
what do you expect of this world cup i n germa n y ? it 's going to be a great event .
it 's going to be better than the last world cup as far as organization and fan support go .
i expect three very tough games for us .
i 'm looking forward to getting all the preparation over with and just get on the field against the czech republic in the first game in gelsenkirchen .
we 're concentrating on the preparation for the first round and that 's going to be tough enough to get through as it is .
if we do get through , we 'll look to see who we play in the second round and go from there . you have italy a n d gha n a i n your group as well .
is that o n e of the hardest groups ? everybody says it 's one of the hardest .
i think one of the reasons why it 's a difficult group is because we 're there , too .
and ghana is no pushover either .
for most people there are two favorites in the group , for me there are four very strong teams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's bernd schneider , left , fought cherundolo for the ball during a friendly match in dortmund after your game agai n st pola n d i n kaiserslauter n , us fa n s at the n earby ramstei n air base said they wa n ted to make your match agai n st italy i n kaiserslauter n like a home game for the us .
how big do you thi n k the fa n s support will be a n d how importa n t is it for the team ? i think it 's very important .
a pro-us crowd is something that we rarely have , even in the united states .
if we could have that at the world 's biggest stage , at a world cup , at one of the most important games for us , that would mean all the world to us . i think against poland in the second half when we went ahead , you heard the fans and you saw a difference in our play .
the guys were more confident on the ball and we really , really played well in the second half against poland .
if we could have that kind of atmosphere against italy that would be fantastic . sean sinico interviewed steve cherundolo send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann relief as germany crushes usa in friendly world cup hosts germany crushed the united states 4-1 at home on wednesday for a much-needed morale boost ahead of this summer 's soccer extravaganza .

the finance minister told parliament on tuesday that the measure was needed to boost the economy and gain financial room to maneuver for greater consolidation in 2007 . " the 2006 budget is intended to create stronger economic growth and so provide the necessary tailwind to achieve our ambitious goals in 2007 , " he said .

this mountain of debt alone requires servicing by the state to the tune of 40 billion euros in the current year .
meanwhile these interest payments coupled with staff expenditures , state contributions to the pensions system and huge spending on social welfare make up two-thirds of the entire budget . but steinbrück warned against populist calls from the opposition demanding sweeping cuts to these costs . " abrupt cuts and sudden changes in welfare policy will only lead to social upheaval and a disintegration of our complex society , " he said .
" forces would be strengthened that could undo social cohesion in germany .
but i 'm afraid that those calling for sweeping changes will only come to realize that when we are facing conditions like those in paris and other french cities . "
opposition laments extra spending but the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who are the strongest opposition force , did n't hold back with stinging criticism of the government 's budget policy .

" i can not see a change of political course in this budget , " he said .

there is more expenditure , less savings and a continuation of the ongoing violation of our constitution . " other opposition speakers claimed that , contrary to what the government says , there was room for consolidation as additional revenue from rising company profits was already accumulating this year .
they accused merkel of using the dire state of the budget as an excuse for her plans to raise value-added tax by 3 percent next year . steinbrück replied that 2007 would be a fateful year and that it would n't hurt to save for a rainy day when growth and consumption are expected to drop as a result of the consolidation effort . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business confidence soars to 15-year high business confidence in germany has reached a 15-year high .

the decision was a blow to gambling operators and the german football federation , who had hoped the court would finally break up the oddset monopoly , freeing up the 3 billion euro german gambling market for new competitors .
the market 's beneficiaries , local sports officials , breathed a sigh of relief . 500 million euros secure , for now " it 's a great decision for sports , " said manfred von richthofen , chief of the german sports association -lrb- dsb -rrb- to the broadcaster mdr .
von richthofen sees the monopoly as the only lifeline for local sports association , who receive most of the tax revenue pulled in by oddset and licensed sub-partners . " the fact that the state monopoly is admissible is a clear advantage for sports , " he said .
the oddset monopoly offers betters the opportunity to bet on sports with fixed rates on winnings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local sports receive up to 500 million euros annually from oddset the judges did ask lawmakers to restructure the monopoly so that it does more to contain gambling addiction .
they set the end of 2007 as a deadline .
the decision indicated the court preferred a state-controlled monopoly - in its current form - which is n't nearly as profit-driven as an open gambling market and can better protect consumers . protecting consumers ? private companies , arguing before the court , disputed the claim .

as part of the middle east quartet , germany and the eu have a vested interest in the israeli elections .
german middle east expert günter meyer , however , says that the influence on israel 's policies is waning . from the european perspective , which election outcome would most benefit the peace process ? the only party which has clearly set itself the goal of pushing forward with the peace process is the yachad party -lrb- " togetherness " -rrb- .
it calls for the israeli withdrawal from territory occupied in 1967 and a return to the oslo peace process .
if that were to take place , it would make peace with the palestinians a real possibility .
but this political goal is not representative of the majority in the election .
at the most five representatives from yachad will be elected . if he wins , ehud olmert has promised to establish the permanent boundaries of israel by the year 2010 .
is that a strategy germany and europe could accept or do you foresee difficulties with his plans ? the eu and germany could support the basic goal of establishing permanent borders , but only if the national boundaries respect international law .
however , that has not been the case up to now : the partially erected security fence – or apartheid wall as the palestinians call it – cuts out large chunks of occupied territory and attributes them to israel .
also the intended israeli annexation of east jerusalem , the large jewish settlements and the occupation of the eastern jordan valley are all clear breaches of international law .
finally , the one-sided definition of national borders – that is without incorporating palestinians in the negotiations – is completely unacceptable .
the result would be a forced , non-sustainable palestinian state and there would be no chance of peace in the middle east . how much political influence do germany and the eu have at the moment as part of the middle east quartet ? german and european influence on israel 's politics is close to nothing .
on the palestinian side , however , europe 's economic and humanitarian support is absolutely essential if we want to avoid further chaos and destabilization in the territories . how has germany 's role in the middle east changed since the government under chancellor angela merkel came into power ? the new government has shifted its political priorities unequivocally in favor of israel .
by doing so it has lost in the eyes of the palestinians and the rest of the arab world its trustworthiness as an impartial negotiator in the conflict . is there a danger that the conflict between israel and the palestinians will be neglected because other countries such as iran and iraq have moved to the forefront of the international focus ? this is no longer a potential risk .
it already reflects the current reality .
the fact that the construction of the security fence and the expansion of israeli enclaves in the occupied territories continue to be ignored by international politics and the public is the best proof of this new shift in focus . german middle east expert günter meyer is a professor at the university of mainz 's geographical institute , and the head of the center for research on the arab world .
additionally , he is a director of the german middle east studies association for contemporary research and documentation -lrb- davo -rrb- . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamas must reform itself , eu warns the eu has reiterated its stance that hamas - the palestinian militant group whose members now take up prominent seats in the new palestinian cabinet - must reform itself if it is to expect european aid in the future .
-lrb- april 20 , 2006 -rrb- europe gets in step with us policies in the middle east in 2003 , most european nations were at odds with the us over its invasion plans for iraq .

as part of the middle east quartet , germany and the eu have a vested interest in the israeli elections .
german middle east expert günter meyer , however , says that the influence on israel 's policies is waning . from the european perspective , which election outcome would most benefit the peace process ? the only party which has clearly set itself the goal of pushing forward with the peace process is the yachad party -lrb- " togetherness " -rrb- .
it calls for the israeli withdrawal from territory occupied in 1967 and a return to the oslo peace process .
if that were to take place , it would make peace with the palestinians a real possibility .
but this political goal is not representative of the majority in the election .
at the most five representatives from yachad will be elected . if he wins , ehud olmert has promised to establish the permanent boundaries of israel by the year 2010 .
is that a strategy germany and europe could accept or do you foresee difficulties with his plans ? the eu and germany could support the basic goal of establishing permanent borders , but only if the national boundaries respect international law .
however , that has not been the case up to now : the partially erected security fence – or apartheid wall as the palestinians call it – cuts out large chunks of occupied territory and attributes them to israel .
also the intended israeli annexation of east jerusalem , the large jewish settlements and the occupation of the eastern jordan valley are all clear breaches of international law .
finally , the one-sided definition of national borders – that is without incorporating palestinians in the negotiations – is completely unacceptable .
the result would be a forced , non-sustainable palestinian state and there would be no chance of peace in the middle east . how much political influence do germany and the eu have at the moment as part of the middle east quartet ? german and european influence on israel 's politics is close to nothing .
on the palestinian side , however , europe 's economic and humanitarian support is absolutely essential if we want to avoid further chaos and destabilization in the territories . how has germany 's role in the middle east changed since the government under chancellor angela merkel came into power ? the new government has shifted its political priorities unequivocally in favor of israel .
by doing so it has lost in the eyes of the palestinians and the rest of the arab world its trustworthiness as an impartial negotiator in the conflict . is there a danger that the conflict between israel and the palestinians will be neglected because other countries such as iran and iraq have moved to the forefront of the international focus ? this is no longer a potential risk .
it already reflects the current reality .
the fact that the construction of the security fence and the expansion of israeli enclaves in the occupied territories continue to be ignored by international politics and the public is the best proof of this new shift in focus . german middle east expert günter meyer is a professor at the university of mainz 's geographical institute , and the head of the center for research on the arab world .
additionally , he is a director of the german middle east studies association for contemporary research and documentation -lrb- davo -rrb- . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamas must reform itself , eu warns the eu has reiterated its stance that hamas - the palestinian militant group whose members now take up prominent seats in the new palestinian cabinet - must reform itself if it is to expect european aid in the future .
-lrb- april 20 , 2006 -rrb- europe gets in step with us policies in the middle east in 2003 , most european nations were at odds with the us over its invasion plans for iraq .
now , with a new set of challenges in the middle east , europe is increasingly aligned with washington on the hamas and iran issues .

i grew up watching the fa english football and grew up having english coaches , but to get a work permit you ca n't go there at a young age .
i had an opportunity to come to germany when i was 19 .
at that time the manager of hanover 96 saw me play and asked me to come back , and i did n't let the opportunity pass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting ahead in europe takes patience , said cherundolo , right your n atio n al team colleague la n do n do n ova n left bayer leverkuse n a n d has had a lot of success i n the us league .
is it difficult to break through i n germa n y ? the mentality here is difficult , and i think they try to beat you down and build you up in their own way , with their own set of rules .
i think it 's difficult for young kids to come over here and learn that .
the thing you need the most is patience and you have to be in a position to wait .
landon was n't .
landon is a good enough player to play over here , without a doubt at any club in germany , but he was able to progress and have a good thing going for him in the states .
i had to wait here , and if you do wait your turn it will come around if you 're patient .
if you allow yourself to adapt to certain things here , you do n't have to change , but you do have to adapt . you 're the deputy captai n at ha n over a n d gregg berhalter is captai n at e n ergie cottbus i n the seco n d divisio n .
are you , as america n s , accepted as team leaders ? first and foremost you have to bring performance week in and week out , that 's the most important criteria , and on top of that you need to be a leader in training , and you ca n't be involved in any stupid things off the field .
it does n't mean you ca n't have fun , but you have to be a little responsible and always try to be positive .
i think that fits our mentality as americans anyway - to always be positive and never give up .
i think that 's something that they -lrb- the germans -rrb- admire and respect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat the usa 1-0 in the 2002 world cup quarter-finals the us team reached the quarter-fi n als four years ago .
what do you expect of this world cup i n germa n y ? it 's going to be a great event .
it 's going to be better than the last world cup as far as organization and fan support go .
i expect three very tough games for us .
i 'm looking forward to getting all the preparation over with and just get on the field against the czech republic in the first game in gelsenkirchen .
we 're concentrating on the preparation for the first round and that 's going to be tough enough to get through as it is .
if we do get through , we 'll look to see who we play in the second round and go from there . you have italy a n d gha n a i n your group as well .
is that o n e of the hardest groups ? everybody says it 's one of the hardest .
i think one of the reasons why it 's a difficult group is because we 're there , too .
and ghana is no pushover either .
for most people there are two favorites in the group , for me there are four very strong teams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's bernd schneider , left , fought cherundolo for the ball during a friendly match in dortmund after your game agai n st pola n d i n kaiserslauter n , us fa n s at the n earby ramstei n air base said they wa n ted to make your match agai n st italy i n kaiserslauter n like a home game for the us .
how big do you thi n k the fa n s support will be a n d how importa n t is it for the team ? i think it 's very important .
a pro-us crowd is something that we rarely have , even in the united states .
if we could have that at the world 's biggest stage , at a world cup , at one of the most important games for us , that would mean all the world to us . i think against poland in the second half when we went ahead , you heard the fans and you saw a difference in our play .
the guys were more confident on the ball and we really , really played well in the second half against poland .

i grew up watching the fa english football and grew up having english coaches , but to get a work permit you ca n't go there at a young age .
i had an opportunity to come to germany when i was 19 .
at that time the manager of hanover 96 saw me play and asked me to come back , and i did n't let the opportunity pass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting ahead in europe takes patience , said cherundolo , right your n atio n al team colleague la n do n do n ova n left bayer leverkuse n a n d has had a lot of success i n the us league .
is it difficult to break through i n germa n y ? the mentality here is difficult , and i think they try to beat you down and build you up in their own way , with their own set of rules .
i think it 's difficult for young kids to come over here and learn that .
the thing you need the most is patience and you have to be in a position to wait .
landon was n't .
landon is a good enough player to play over here , without a doubt at any club in germany , but he was able to progress and have a good thing going for him in the states .
i had to wait here , and if you do wait your turn it will come around if you 're patient .
if you allow yourself to adapt to certain things here , you do n't have to change , but you do have to adapt . you 're the deputy captai n at ha n over a n d gregg berhalter is captai n at e n ergie cottbus i n the seco n d divisio n .
are you , as america n s , accepted as team leaders ? first and foremost you have to bring performance week in and week out , that 's the most important criteria , and on top of that you need to be a leader in training , and you ca n't be involved in any stupid things off the field .
it does n't mean you ca n't have fun , but you have to be a little responsible and always try to be positive .
i think that fits our mentality as americans anyway - to always be positive and never give up .
i think that 's something that they -lrb- the germans -rrb- admire and respect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat the usa 1-0 in the 2002 world cup quarter-finals the us team reached the quarter-fi n als four years ago .
what do you expect of this world cup i n germa n y ? it 's going to be a great event .
it 's going to be better than the last world cup as far as organization and fan support go .
i expect three very tough games for us .
i 'm looking forward to getting all the preparation over with and just get on the field against the czech republic in the first game in gelsenkirchen .
we 're concentrating on the preparation for the first round and that 's going to be tough enough to get through as it is .
if we do get through , we 'll look to see who we play in the second round and go from there . you have italy a n d gha n a i n your group as well .
is that o n e of the hardest groups ? everybody says it 's one of the hardest .
i think one of the reasons why it 's a difficult group is because we 're there , too .
and ghana is no pushover either .
for most people there are two favorites in the group , for me there are four very strong teams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's bernd schneider , left , fought cherundolo for the ball during a friendly match in dortmund after your game agai n st pola n d i n kaiserslauter n , us fa n s at the n earby ramstei n air base said they wa n ted to make your match agai n st italy i n kaiserslauter n like a home game for the us .
how big do you thi n k the fa n s support will be a n d how importa n t is it for the team ? i think it 's very important .
a pro-us crowd is something that we rarely have , even in the united states .
if we could have that at the world 's biggest stage , at a world cup , at one of the most important games for us , that would mean all the world to us . i think against poland in the second half when we went ahead , you heard the fans and you saw a difference in our play .

as part of the middle east quartet , germany and the eu have a vested interest in the israeli elections .
german middle east expert günter meyer , however , says that the influence on israel 's policies is waning . from the european perspective , which election outcome would most benefit the peace process ? the only party which has clearly set itself the goal of pushing forward with the peace process is the yachad party -lrb- " togetherness " -rrb- .
it calls for the israeli withdrawal from territory occupied in 1967 and a return to the oslo peace process .
if that were to take place , it would make peace with the palestinians a real possibility .
but this political goal is not representative of the majority in the election .
at the most five representatives from yachad will be elected . if he wins , ehud olmert has promised to establish the permanent boundaries of israel by the year 2010 .
is that a strategy germany and europe could accept or do you foresee difficulties with his plans ? the eu and germany could support the basic goal of establishing permanent borders , but only if the national boundaries respect international law .
however , that has not been the case up to now : the partially erected security fence – or apartheid wall as the palestinians call it – cuts out large chunks of occupied territory and attributes them to israel .
also the intended israeli annexation of east jerusalem , the large jewish settlements and the occupation of the eastern jordan valley are all clear breaches of international law .
finally , the one-sided definition of national borders – that is without incorporating palestinians in the negotiations – is completely unacceptable .
the result would be a forced , non-sustainable palestinian state and there would be no chance of peace in the middle east . how much political influence do germany and the eu have at the moment as part of the middle east quartet ? german and european influence on israel 's politics is close to nothing .
on the palestinian side , however , europe 's economic and humanitarian support is absolutely essential if we want to avoid further chaos and destabilization in the territories . how has germany 's role in the middle east changed since the government under chancellor angela merkel came into power ? the new government has shifted its political priorities unequivocally in favor of israel .
by doing so it has lost in the eyes of the palestinians and the rest of the arab world its trustworthiness as an impartial negotiator in the conflict . is there a danger that the conflict between israel and the palestinians will be neglected because other countries such as iran and iraq have moved to the forefront of the international focus ? this is no longer a potential risk .
it already reflects the current reality .
the fact that the construction of the security fence and the expansion of israeli enclaves in the occupied territories continue to be ignored by international politics and the public is the best proof of this new shift in focus . german middle east expert günter meyer is a professor at the university of mainz 's geographical institute , and the head of the center for research on the arab world .
additionally , he is a director of the german middle east studies association for contemporary research and documentation -lrb- davo -rrb- . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamas must reform itself , eu warns the eu has reiterated its stance that hamas - the palestinian militant group whose members now take up prominent seats in the new palestinian cabinet - must reform itself if it is to expect european aid in the future .
-lrb- april 20 , 2006 -rrb- europe gets in step with us policies in the middle east in 2003 , most european nations were at odds with the us over its invasion plans for iraq .
now , with a new set of challenges in the middle east , europe is increasingly aligned with washington on the hamas and iran issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.03.2006 eu awaits results of israeli poll großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few went to vote on tuesday as members of the " quartet " of mediators in the middle east conflict , germany and the eu have a keen interest in the outcome of israel 's parliamentary elections .
but will they provide new impetus for the peace process ? acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert appears to be on course for victory on tuesday , despite having seen his kadima party 's lead slip in the run-up to the elections . olmert has called the poll a referendum on his plan to redefine israel 's borders - a plan which involves evacuating dozens of small jewish settlements in the west bank , while strengthening larger jewish enclaves on land palestinians want for an independent state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert plans to redefine israel 's borders if victorious for his strategy to work , kadima , the party founded by ailing prime minister ariel sharon , and its desired coalition partner - most likely the center-left labor party - will need enough support to form a majority . experts say that 's unlikely to happen . " no party is going to get an absolute majority , so it has to be a coalition government , and the optimal solution would be a coalition between kadima and the labor party , " said middle east expert udo steinbach , head of the german orient institute in hamburg .
" what must be avoided is that -lrb- benjamin -rrb- netanyahu and the likud party have any major influence , because they do n't provide any perspective as far as the peace process is concerned . " but olmert 's plans regarding israel 's borders are not without controversy .
olmert has argued that the need to separate from the palestinians is greater than ever since the militant islamic movement hamas won palestinian elections in january .
although there is broad support among israelis for his strategy , the eu , the united states and other players in the peace process are wary of giving israel the green light to annex contested land . indeed , israel 's problems with hamas could be worsened should olmert win electoral support for his plan , steinbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas ' victory has muddied the waters of eu involvement " the way that hamas is going to behave to an overwhelming extent depends on what the israelis offer them , " he said .
" if olmert goes ahead in a unilateral way , that will likely radicalize hamas , but if he makes them an offer to find a joint solution , hamas could turn out to be a fairly pragmatic partner . " he added , however , that the problem of the settlements aside , olmert is generally the favored candidate among europeans . " i would consider him to be reasonably pragmatic in terms of going along with the peace process , and going along with the international community , " steinbach said . eu 's israel policy should olmert be confirmed in office , there will likely be no great change in the eu 's policy on israel . the eu backs the peace plan now known as the road map , which foresees a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
in advancing this goal , brussels performs a balancing act , striving never to appear too partial to either side . just as the eu deplores palestinian acts of terror and demands that hamas renounce violence , it also rejects certain aspects of current israeli policy , such as the erection of the so-called security wall to isolate palestinian communities , and the expansion of settlements in the west bank . in the past , the eu 's involvement in the conflict was limited to providing financial backing and reconstruction aid .
the bloc 's evolution from mere financier to active political participant has been recognized by shimon peres , a former israeli prime minister and current candidate for kadima . " there were times in israel when people viewed the role of europe skeptically , " he said .
" this is no longer the case .
europe is no longer just a payer but a player .
the eu has fulfilled some tasks which nobody else could have done . " for his part though , steinbach thinks europe 's mediation efforts have stagnated recently , in large part because of a lack of support from the united states . " i think we were in better shape two years ago when the road map came into being , " said steinbach .
" at that time , the europeans were much more active , they were trying to push things into one direction or another and the problem was that the us was not going along with them . " german influence waning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer made the middle east a main priority steinbach is concerned that , with the us focusing on other countries in the middle east , namely iraq and iran , the israeli-palestinian conflict is being neglected .
germany 's involvement , too , has leveled off of late , he added .
under the previous social democrat-led coalition , foreign minister joschka fischer took an unprecedented interest in the region , making numerous visits there for talks with leaders on both sides of the conflict .
under the new government , that 's changed , said steinbach . " whatever they 're doing , they are doing within the eu context , " steinbach said . " talking with arabs , i have found there is a certain disillusionment about the german approach as far as the new government is concerned , " he said . " other countries in the middle east are watching very closely , and the new government is seen critically because it is viewed as doing more fence-mending with the americans than having its own approach as far as the middle east is concerned .

the finance minister told parliament on tuesday that the measure was needed to boost the economy and gain financial room to maneuver for greater consolidation in 2007 .

but will they provide new impetus for the peace process ? acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert appears to be on course for victory on tuesday , despite having seen his kadima party 's lead slip in the run-up to the elections . olmert has called the poll a referendum on his plan to redefine israel 's borders - a plan which involves evacuating dozens of small jewish settlements in the west bank , while strengthening larger jewish enclaves on land palestinians want for an independent state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert plans to redefine israel 's borders if victorious for his strategy to work , kadima , the party founded by ailing prime minister ariel sharon , and its desired coalition partner - most likely the center-left labor party - will need enough support to form a majority . experts say that 's unlikely to happen . " no party is going to get an absolute majority , so it has to be a coalition government , and the optimal solution would be a coalition between kadima and the labor party , " said middle east expert udo steinbach , head of the german orient institute in hamburg .
" what must be avoided is that -lrb- benjamin -rrb- netanyahu and the likud party have any major influence , because they do n't provide any perspective as far as the peace process is concerned . " but olmert 's plans regarding israel 's borders are not without controversy .
olmert has argued that the need to separate from the palestinians is greater than ever since the militant islamic movement hamas won palestinian elections in january .
although there is broad support among israelis for his strategy , the eu , the united states and other players in the peace process are wary of giving israel the green light to annex contested land . indeed , israel 's problems with hamas could be worsened should olmert win electoral support for his plan , steinbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas ' victory has muddied the waters of eu involvement " the way that hamas is going to behave to an overwhelming extent depends on what the israelis offer them , " he said .
" if olmert goes ahead in a unilateral way , that will likely radicalize hamas , but if he makes them an offer to find a joint solution , hamas could turn out to be a fairly pragmatic partner . " he added , however , that the problem of the settlements aside , olmert is generally the favored candidate among europeans . " i would consider him to be reasonably pragmatic in terms of going along with the peace process , and going along with the international community , " steinbach said . eu 's israel policy should olmert be confirmed in office , there will likely be no great change in the eu 's policy on israel . the eu backs the peace plan now known as the road map , which foresees a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
in advancing this goal , brussels performs a balancing act , striving never to appear too partial to either side . just as the eu deplores palestinian acts of terror and demands that hamas renounce violence , it also rejects certain aspects of current israeli policy , such as the erection of the so-called security wall to isolate palestinian communities , and the expansion of settlements in the west bank . in the past , the eu 's involvement in the conflict was limited to providing financial backing and reconstruction aid .
the bloc 's evolution from mere financier to active political participant has been recognized by shimon peres , a former israeli prime minister and current candidate for kadima . " there were times in israel when people viewed the role of europe skeptically , " he said .
" this is no longer the case .
europe is no longer just a payer but a player .
the eu has fulfilled some tasks which nobody else could have done . " for his part though , steinbach thinks europe 's mediation efforts have stagnated recently , in large part because of a lack of support from the united states . " i think we were in better shape two years ago when the road map came into being , " said steinbach .
" at that time , the europeans were much more active , they were trying to push things into one direction or another and the problem was that the us was not going along with them . " german influence waning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer made the middle east a main priority steinbach is concerned that , with the us focusing on other countries in the middle east , namely iraq and iran , the israeli-palestinian conflict is being neglected .
germany 's involvement , too , has leveled off of late , he added .
under the previous social democrat-led coalition , foreign minister joschka fischer took an unprecedented interest in the region , making numerous visits there for talks with leaders on both sides of the conflict .
under the new government , that 's changed , said steinbach . " whatever they 're doing , they are doing within the eu context , " steinbach said . " talking with arabs , i have found there is a certain disillusionment about the german approach as far as the new government is concerned , " he said . " other countries in the middle east are watching very closely , and the new government is seen critically because it is viewed as doing more fence-mending with the americans than having its own approach as far as the middle east is concerned .

but will they provide new impetus for the peace process ? acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert appears to be on course for victory on tuesday , despite having seen his kadima party 's lead slip in the run-up to the elections . olmert has called the poll a referendum on his plan to redefine israel 's borders - a plan which involves evacuating dozens of small jewish settlements in the west bank , while strengthening larger jewish enclaves on land palestinians want for an independent state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert plans to redefine israel 's borders if victorious for his strategy to work , kadima , the party founded by ailing prime minister ariel sharon , and its desired coalition partner - most likely the center-left labor party - will need enough support to form a majority . experts say that 's unlikely to happen . " no party is going to get an absolute majority , so it has to be a coalition government , and the optimal solution would be a coalition between kadima and the labor party , " said middle east expert udo steinbach , head of the german orient institute in hamburg .
" what must be avoided is that -lrb- benjamin -rrb- netanyahu and the likud party have any major influence , because they do n't provide any perspective as far as the peace process is concerned . " but olmert 's plans regarding israel 's borders are not without controversy .
olmert has argued that the need to separate from the palestinians is greater than ever since the militant islamic movement hamas won palestinian elections in january .
although there is broad support among israelis for his strategy , the eu , the united states and other players in the peace process are wary of giving israel the green light to annex contested land . indeed , israel 's problems with hamas could be worsened should olmert win electoral support for his plan , steinbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas ' victory has muddied the waters of eu involvement " the way that hamas is going to behave to an overwhelming extent depends on what the israelis offer them , " he said .
" if olmert goes ahead in a unilateral way , that will likely radicalize hamas , but if he makes them an offer to find a joint solution , hamas could turn out to be a fairly pragmatic partner . " he added , however , that the problem of the settlements aside , olmert is generally the favored candidate among europeans . " i would consider him to be reasonably pragmatic in terms of going along with the peace process , and going along with the international community , " steinbach said . eu 's israel policy should olmert be confirmed in office , there will likely be no great change in the eu 's policy on israel . the eu backs the peace plan now known as the road map , which foresees a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
in advancing this goal , brussels performs a balancing act , striving never to appear too partial to either side . just as the eu deplores palestinian acts of terror and demands that hamas renounce violence , it also rejects certain aspects of current israeli policy , such as the erection of the so-called security wall to isolate palestinian communities , and the expansion of settlements in the west bank . in the past , the eu 's involvement in the conflict was limited to providing financial backing and reconstruction aid .
the bloc 's evolution from mere financier to active political participant has been recognized by shimon peres , a former israeli prime minister and current candidate for kadima . " there were times in israel when people viewed the role of europe skeptically , " he said .
" this is no longer the case .
europe is no longer just a payer but a player .
the eu has fulfilled some tasks which nobody else could have done . " for his part though , steinbach thinks europe 's mediation efforts have stagnated recently , in large part because of a lack of support from the united states . " i think we were in better shape two years ago when the road map came into being , " said steinbach .
" at that time , the europeans were much more active , they were trying to push things into one direction or another and the problem was that the us was not going along with them . " german influence waning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer made the middle east a main priority steinbach is concerned that , with the us focusing on other countries in the middle east , namely iraq and iran , the israeli-palestinian conflict is being neglected .
germany 's involvement , too , has leveled off of late , he added .
under the previous social democrat-led coalition , foreign minister joschka fischer took an unprecedented interest in the region , making numerous visits there for talks with leaders on both sides of the conflict .
under the new government , that 's changed , said steinbach . " whatever they 're doing , they are doing within the eu context , " steinbach said . " talking with arabs , i have found there is a certain disillusionment about the german approach as far as the new government is concerned , " he said . " other countries in the middle east are watching very closely , and the new government is seen critically because it is viewed as doing more fence-mending with the americans than having its own approach as far as the middle east is concerned .

while churches in germany do not dictate politics , they are still one of the many political players within the framework of the country 's democracy . german religious leaders make public statements on many political issues - for example on moral issues such as abortion , or social questions such as the integration of foreigners .
these statements do not , however , have the same impact as they used to .

but the state still has control over how this happens - a german citizen can only officially renounce membership in a church through a civil registry office or at a municipal court . michael basse , a church historian , said that protests by church groups after the end of world war i prevented a complete separation of church and state in germany . " there was already an attempt to introduce a radical separation of church and state during the november revolution -lrb- overthrow of the monarchy in 1918-1919 -rrb- , " basse said .

this goes towards financing staff , houses of worship , and social welfare institutions such as hospitals and kindergartens , which are often run by church groups . the limits of church power in germany are still defined by a clause in the legal code of the weimar republic , which dates back to the year 1919 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.03.2006 europe 's role in middle east waning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what do the elections mean for the future of the middle east ?
as part of the middle east quartet , germany and the eu have a vested interest in the israeli elections .
german middle east expert günter meyer , however , says that the influence on israel 's policies is waning . from the european perspective , which election outcome would most benefit the peace process ? the only party which has clearly set itself the goal of pushing forward with the peace process is the yachad party -lrb- " togetherness " -rrb- .
it calls for the israeli withdrawal from territory occupied in 1967 and a return to the oslo peace process .
if that were to take place , it would make peace with the palestinians a real possibility .
but this political goal is not representative of the majority in the election .
at the most five representatives from yachad will be elected . if he wins , ehud olmert has promised to establish the permanent boundaries of israel by the year 2010 .
is that a strategy germany and europe could accept or do you foresee difficulties with his plans ? the eu and germany could support the basic goal of establishing permanent borders , but only if the national boundaries respect international law .
however , that has not been the case up to now : the partially erected security fence – or apartheid wall as the palestinians call it – cuts out large chunks of occupied territory and attributes them to israel .
also the intended israeli annexation of east jerusalem , the large jewish settlements and the occupation of the eastern jordan valley are all clear breaches of international law .
finally , the one-sided definition of national borders – that is without incorporating palestinians in the negotiations – is completely unacceptable .
the result would be a forced , non-sustainable palestinian state and there would be no chance of peace in the middle east . how much political influence do germany and the eu have at the moment as part of the middle east quartet ? german and european influence on israel 's politics is close to nothing .
on the palestinian side , however , europe 's economic and humanitarian support is absolutely essential if we want to avoid further chaos and destabilization in the territories . how has germany 's role in the middle east changed since the government under chancellor angela merkel came into power ? the new government has shifted its political priorities unequivocally in favor of israel .
by doing so it has lost in the eyes of the palestinians and the rest of the arab world its trustworthiness as an impartial negotiator in the conflict . is there a danger that the conflict between israel and the palestinians will be neglected because other countries such as iran and iraq have moved to the forefront of the international focus ? this is no longer a potential risk .
it already reflects the current reality .
the fact that the construction of the security fence and the expansion of israeli enclaves in the occupied territories continue to be ignored by international politics and the public is the best proof of this new shift in focus . german middle east expert günter meyer is a professor at the university of mainz 's geographical institute , and the head of the center for research on the arab world .
additionally , he is a director of the german middle east studies association for contemporary research and documentation -lrb- davo -rrb- . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamas must reform itself , eu warns the eu has reiterated its stance that hamas - the palestinian militant group whose members now take up prominent seats in the new palestinian cabinet - must reform itself if it is to expect european aid in the future .
-lrb- april 20 , 2006 -rrb- europe gets in step with us policies in the middle east in 2003 , most european nations were at odds with the us over its invasion plans for iraq .
now , with a new set of challenges in the middle east , europe is increasingly aligned with washington on the hamas and iran issues .

" but what i do know is that each week we will be out in greater numbers . " joining the demonstrating students were transport workers , teachers and other government workers closed schools , slowed mass transit and disrupted public services . police had deployed in large numbers to avoid a repeat of last thursday 's violence , when youths , mainly from high-immigration city suburbs , set fire to cars and mugged demonstrators . villepin stands firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villepin -lrb- right -rrb- met with students and unemployed people on march 10 meanwhile unions turned down an invitation from french premier dominique de villepin to attend new talks on the contested contract , which was voted through parliament two weeks ago and is awaiting approval by constitutional experts before passing into law . opponents are demanding withdrawal of the cpe , but the prime minister is offering only " adjustments " on its two most contentious aspects : a two-year trial period , and the free hand given to employers during that period to sack under 26-year-olds without explanation . villepin told the national assembly that he regretted the union 's refusal to enter talks .

" it is unthinkable for the prime minister to stay fixed in his position .
for us there is just one outcome and that is withdrawal of this reform . " francois chereque of the cfdt union was a bit more skeptical . " i do not know if today 's mobilization will make the prime minister give way , " he said .
" but what i do know is that each week we will be out in greater numbers . " joining the demonstrating students were transport workers , teachers and other government workers closed schools , slowed mass transit and disrupted public services . police had deployed in large numbers to avoid a repeat of last thursday 's violence , when youths , mainly from high-immigration city suburbs , set fire to cars and mugged demonstrators . villepin stands firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villepin -lrb- right -rrb- met with students and unemployed people on march 10 meanwhile unions turned down an invitation from french premier dominique de villepin to attend new talks on the contested contract , which was voted through parliament two weeks ago and is awaiting approval by constitutional experts before passing into law . opponents are demanding withdrawal of the cpe , but the prime minister is offering only " adjustments " on its two most contentious aspects : a two-year trial period , and the free hand given to employers during that period to sack under 26-year-olds without explanation . villepin told the national assembly that he regretted the union 's refusal to enter talks . " as i have said , i am ready to engage in dialogue and adjust the contract on these two points , " he said .
" i said that in writing to the unions , but they refused my extended hand . " the government insists the contract is vital to fighting youth unemployment , which can reach more than 50 percent in the poor suburbs hit by last year 's riots , but opponents say it is a breach of hard-won labor rights . sarkozy urges compromise president jacques chirac , who has so far given his backing to villepin , cancelled a visit this week to the northern port of le havre in order to stay close to the events in paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy but there were signs of dissension within the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- , whose president , interior minister nicolas sarkozy , was quoted by deputies as urging villepin to give ground . an ipsos poll for le monde newspaper gave some comfort to villepin , who has staked his political career - and presidential ambitions - on getting the cpe into law . while 63 percent of the population disapproved of his decision to stand by the cpe , views were heavily influenced by political allegiance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.03.2006 eu awaits results of israeli poll großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few went to vote on tuesday as members of the " quartet " of mediators in the middle east conflict , germany and the eu have a keen interest in the outcome of israel 's parliamentary elections .
but will they provide new impetus for the peace process ? acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert appears to be on course for victory on tuesday , despite having seen his kadima party 's lead slip in the run-up to the elections . olmert has called the poll a referendum on his plan to redefine israel 's borders - a plan which involves evacuating dozens of small jewish settlements in the west bank , while strengthening larger jewish enclaves on land palestinians want for an independent state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert plans to redefine israel 's borders if victorious for his strategy to work , kadima , the party founded by ailing prime minister ariel sharon , and its desired coalition partner - most likely the center-left labor party - will need enough support to form a majority . experts say that 's unlikely to happen . " no party is going to get an absolute majority , so it has to be a coalition government , and the optimal solution would be a coalition between kadima and the labor party , " said middle east expert udo steinbach , head of the german orient institute in hamburg .
" what must be avoided is that -lrb- benjamin -rrb- netanyahu and the likud party have any major influence , because they do n't provide any perspective as far as the peace process is concerned . " but olmert 's plans regarding israel 's borders are not without controversy .
olmert has argued that the need to separate from the palestinians is greater than ever since the militant islamic movement hamas won palestinian elections in january .
although there is broad support among israelis for his strategy , the eu , the united states and other players in the peace process are wary of giving israel the green light to annex contested land . indeed , israel 's problems with hamas could be worsened should olmert win electoral support for his plan , steinbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas ' victory has muddied the waters of eu involvement " the way that hamas is going to behave to an overwhelming extent depends on what the israelis offer them , " he said .
" if olmert goes ahead in a unilateral way , that will likely radicalize hamas , but if he makes them an offer to find a joint solution , hamas could turn out to be a fairly pragmatic partner . " he added , however , that the problem of the settlements aside , olmert is generally the favored candidate among europeans . " i would consider him to be reasonably pragmatic in terms of going along with the peace process , and going along with the international community , " steinbach said . eu 's israel policy should olmert be confirmed in office , there will likely be no great change in the eu 's policy on israel . the eu backs the peace plan now known as the road map , which foresees a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
in advancing this goal , brussels performs a balancing act , striving never to appear too partial to either side . just as the eu deplores palestinian acts of terror and demands that hamas renounce violence , it also rejects certain aspects of current israeli policy , such as the erection of the so-called security wall to isolate palestinian communities , and the expansion of settlements in the west bank . in the past , the eu 's involvement in the conflict was limited to providing financial backing and reconstruction aid .
the bloc 's evolution from mere financier to active political participant has been recognized by shimon peres , a former israeli prime minister and current candidate for kadima . " there were times in israel when people viewed the role of europe skeptically , " he said .
" this is no longer the case .
europe is no longer just a payer but a player .
the eu has fulfilled some tasks which nobody else could have done . " for his part though , steinbach thinks europe 's mediation efforts have stagnated recently , in large part because of a lack of support from the united states . " i think we were in better shape two years ago when the road map came into being , " said steinbach .
" at that time , the europeans were much more active , they were trying to push things into one direction or another and the problem was that the us was not going along with them . " german influence waning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer made the middle east a main priority steinbach is concerned that , with the us focusing on other countries in the middle east , namely iraq and iran , the israeli-palestinian conflict is being neglected .
germany 's involvement , too , has leveled off of late , he added .
under the previous social democrat-led coalition , foreign minister joschka fischer took an unprecedented interest in the region , making numerous visits there for talks with leaders on both sides of the conflict .
under the new government , that 's changed , said steinbach . " whatever they 're doing , they are doing within the eu context , " steinbach said . " talking with arabs , i have found there is a certain disillusionment about the german approach as far as the new government is concerned , " he said . " other countries in the middle east are watching very closely , and the new government is seen critically because it is viewed as doing more fence-mending with the americans than having its own approach as far as the middle east is concerned .

the unexpected surge in the ifo business climate index on tuesday points to a solid recovery in europe 's biggest economy , analysts said . the ifo index soared to 105.4 points in march - the highest reading since april 1991 , the year after german unification , and up from 103.4 points in february .
the february reading was revised from 103.3 points . " the economic recovery is continuing to stabilize , " said the head of munich-based ifo institute , hans-werner sinn .
he added that optimism had spread through most sectors of the economy and that the most marked improvement had been registered in the poorer former communist eastern states . analysts cheered the news as ushering in a robust economic turnaround .

" our ambition is to form a stable coalition for the full four years so we can carry out our policies . " senior party strategist lior horev said it was a remarkable achievement for a party which was only formed in november by prime minister ariel sharon who now lies in a coma in a jerusalem hospital . labor happy with result " all in all we are very happy with the results , " horev said .
" it was unimaginable three months ago .
the likud were defeated because of netanyahu 's aggressiveness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the israeli labor party leader amir peretz labor hailed its better than expected showing in the exit polls . " we 've snatched a major victory , " danny yatom , a member of the outgoing parliament told afp at the party 's tel aviv headquarters . the election was being held on the day that palestinian mps approved a cabinet led by hamas , which advocates the destruction of the jewish state , strengthening israel 's determination to act unilaterally in the perceived absence of a partner in the peace process . with the legacy of sharon looming large , olmert had urged israel 's five million voters to turn out en masse in an election which shattered the traditional mould of israel 's two-party system . low voter turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few voted on tuesday but turnout was sharply down on the record low of 2003 at the nation 's 8,280 polling stations , where security was tight to prevent attacks by palestinian militants . in a newspaper opinion piece , olmert spelled out how he planned to dismantle all settlements which lie outside the massive separation barrier israel is building across the west bank in an echo of last year 's dramatic uprooting of jews from the gaza strip . " we must preserve the main settlement blocs in judaea and samaria -lrb- west bank -rrb- and we will fix the route of the security barrier beyond which we will no longer remain , " olmert wrote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ismail haniya as hamas won the overwhelming approval of palestinian mps for its 24-strong cabinet , its incoming premier ismail haniya made clear olmert 's redrawn map was unacceptable . " if the occupation wants to leave we will not stop them but we will not accept fait accomplis being imposed on us such as the annexation of the settlement blocs , " he said . some palestinians want to negotiate the palestinian authority meanwhile called on the next israeli government to resume stalled negotiations to find a solution to the middle east conflict . " we call on the next government , whatever it is , to immediately resume negotiations as advocated by -lrb- palestinian -rrb- president mahmud abbas , " chief palestinian negotiator saeb erakat told afp .
" we respect the democratic choice of the israeli people .

up to now , christian groups had the greatest say , but this is slowly changing . for people in germany , the arrest and near-execution of an afghan convert to christianity in kabul is hard to understand .
in contrast to many islamic countries such as afghanistan , germany has a clear separation of church and state , at least in principle . but this separation is not as strict as one might expect .
while churches in germany do not dictate politics , they are still one of the many political players within the framework of the country 's democracy . german religious leaders make public statements on many political issues - for example on moral issues such as abortion , or social questions such as the integration of foreigners .
these statements do not , however , have the same impact as they used to .
one reason for this is the decline in the number of faithful who officially belong to a particular church . germa n churches losi n g members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full churches have become a rare sight in germany both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have been complaining for years about declining membership .
around 60 percent of people in germany belong to one of these two christian denominations ; more than 30 percent do not belong to any religious community at all . the right to practice or to leave a religion is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed under germany 's basic law .
but the state still has control over how this happens - a german citizen can only officially renounce membership in a church through a civil registry office or at a municipal court . michael basse , a church historian , said that protests by church groups after the end of world war i prevented a complete separation of church and state in germany . " there was already an attempt to introduce a radical separation of church and state during the november revolution -lrb- overthrow of the monarchy in 1918-1919 -rrb- , " basse said .
" but the protestant and catholic churches mobilized their members to hold massive demonstrations to prevent this .

in addition to education , there are other institutional links between the church and state . for example , the state tax authority is responsible for collecting the so-called church tax .
this goes towards financing staff , houses of worship , and social welfare institutions such as hospitals and kindergartens , which are often run by church groups . the limits of church power in germany are still defined by a clause in the legal code of the weimar republic , which dates back to the year 1919 .
it gives the two christian denominations special privileges such as tax breaks - which do not apply to other religious groups in germany . michael basse said he wonders if this is going to change .

the country 's three million muslims are also guaranteed freedom of worship under german law . but there are still some difficulties when it comes to religious education for muslims .
only a few federal states in germany currently have pilot projects for islamic religion classes in schools .
this is partially due to a lack of initiative on the part of the german school system . but another challenge is the high number of muslim umbrella groups and different islamic religious denominations in germany .
government officials say it is difficult to find a consistent representative for the entire muslim community who can decide on a fixed curriculum for islamic religion classes . but this will likely be resolved in the near future .
at the same time , the influence of churches on german society continues to decline .

" li n ks betwee n the church a n d state remai n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crosses hang in many german classrooms unlike schools in other secular countries , german public schools still offer religion courses , and public universities in germany continue to train future theologians .
in addition to education , there are other institutional links between the church and state . for example , the state tax authority is responsible for collecting the so-called church tax .
this goes towards financing staff , houses of worship , and social welfare institutions such as hospitals and kindergartens , which are often run by church groups . the limits of church power in germany are still defined by a clause in the legal code of the weimar republic , which dates back to the year 1919 .
it gives the two christian denominations special privileges such as tax breaks - which do not apply to other religious groups in germany . michael basse said he wonders if this is going to change .
" an interesting political question would be to what extent there is a readiness to apply these benefits to other religions , " he said . teachi n g islamic religio n i n germa n schools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few schools offer religious education for muslim students this question is of particular interest to germany 's muslim community .
the country 's three million muslims are also guaranteed freedom of worship under german law . but there are still some difficulties when it comes to religious education for muslims .
only a few federal states in germany currently have pilot projects for islamic religion classes in schools .
this is partially due to a lack of initiative on the part of the german school system . but another challenge is the high number of muslim umbrella groups and different islamic religious denominations in germany .
government officials say it is difficult to find a consistent representative for the entire muslim community who can decide on a fixed curriculum for islamic religion classes . but this will likely be resolved in the near future .
at the same time , the influence of churches on german society continues to decline .
while churches were an especially strong political force in the early days of the federal republic , their role is fading increasingly into the background , said church historian michael basse . " the times in which politicians had to fear the power of the churches are long gone , " he said . dw staff -lrb- my -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row erupts over ethics and religion ruling conservative politicians in germany are up in arms over the decision made by the ruling spd-green government to make lessons in ethics and religion compulsory in berlin .

the finance minister told parliament on tuesday that the measure was needed to boost the economy and gain financial room to maneuver for greater consolidation in 2007 . " the 2006 budget is intended to create stronger economic growth and so provide the necessary tailwind to achieve our ambitious goals in 2007 , " he said .
" next year we are planning to invest considerably more and notably drive our deficit below the eu 's 3 percent limit . " staggering national debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's debt clock keeps climbing by the second the fresh borrowing , however , will increase germany 's national debt to a staggering 900 billion euros .
this mountain of debt alone requires servicing by the state to the tune of 40 billion euros in the current year .
meanwhile these interest payments coupled with staff expenditures , state contributions to the pensions system and huge spending on social welfare make up two-thirds of the entire budget . but steinbrück warned against populist calls from the opposition demanding sweeping cuts to these costs . " abrupt cuts and sudden changes in welfare policy will only lead to social upheaval and a disintegration of our complex society , " he said .
" forces would be strengthened that could undo social cohesion in germany .
but i 'm afraid that those calling for sweeping changes will only come to realize that when we are facing conditions like those in paris and other french cities . "
opposition laments extra spending but the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who are the strongest opposition force , did n't hold back with stinging criticism of the government 's budget policy .
their finance expert jürgen koppelin accused chancellor merkel of lying in public with her repeated declaration that she did n't want to repeat the mistakes of the previous government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel 's government manage to reduce germany 's financial problems ?
" i can not see a change of political course in this budget , " he said .
" mrs. merkel is even increasing the amount of new debts by 7 billion euros compared with the previous government .
there is more expenditure , less savings and a continuation of the ongoing violation of our constitution . " other opposition speakers claimed that , contrary to what the government says , there was room for consolidation as additional revenue from rising company profits was already accumulating this year .
they accused merkel of using the dire state of the budget as an excuse for her plans to raise value-added tax by 3 percent next year . steinbrück replied that 2007 would be a fateful year and that it would n't hurt to save for a rainy day when growth and consumption are expected to drop as a result of the consolidation effort . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business confidence soars to 15-year high business confidence in germany has reached a 15-year high .

up to now , christian groups had the greatest say , but this is slowly changing . for people in germany , the arrest and near-execution of an afghan convert to christianity in kabul is hard to understand .
in contrast to many islamic countries such as afghanistan , germany has a clear separation of church and state , at least in principle . but this separation is not as strict as one might expect .
while churches in germany do not dictate politics , they are still one of the many political players within the framework of the country 's democracy . german religious leaders make public statements on many political issues - for example on moral issues such as abortion , or social questions such as the integration of foreigners .
these statements do not , however , have the same impact as they used to .
one reason for this is the decline in the number of faithful who officially belong to a particular church . germa n churches losi n g members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full churches have become a rare sight in germany both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have been complaining for years about declining membership .
around 60 percent of people in germany belong to one of these two christian denominations ; more than 30 percent do not belong to any religious community at all . the right to practice or to leave a religion is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed under germany 's basic law .
but the state still has control over how this happens - a german citizen can only officially renounce membership in a church through a civil registry office or at a municipal court . michael basse , a church historian , said that protests by church groups after the end of world war i prevented a complete separation of church and state in germany . " there was already an attempt to introduce a radical separation of church and state during the november revolution -lrb- overthrow of the monarchy in 1918-1919 -rrb- , " basse said .
" but the protestant and catholic churches mobilized their members to hold massive demonstrations to prevent this .
during that time the main point of contention was the issue of religion classes in schools . " li n ks betwee n the church a n d state remai n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crosses hang in many german classrooms unlike schools in other secular countries , german public schools still offer religion courses , and public universities in germany continue to train future theologians .
in addition to education , there are other institutional links between the church and state . for example , the state tax authority is responsible for collecting the so-called church tax .
this goes towards financing staff , houses of worship , and social welfare institutions such as hospitals and kindergartens , which are often run by church groups . the limits of church power in germany are still defined by a clause in the legal code of the weimar republic , which dates back to the year 1919 .
it gives the two christian denominations special privileges such as tax breaks - which do not apply to other religious groups in germany . michael basse said he wonders if this is going to change .
" an interesting political question would be to what extent there is a readiness to apply these benefits to other religions , " he said . teachi n g islamic religio n i n germa n schools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few schools offer religious education for muslim students this question is of particular interest to germany 's muslim community .
the country 's three million muslims are also guaranteed freedom of worship under german law . but there are still some difficulties when it comes to religious education for muslims .
only a few federal states in germany currently have pilot projects for islamic religion classes in schools .
this is partially due to a lack of initiative on the part of the german school system . but another challenge is the high number of muslim umbrella groups and different islamic religious denominations in germany .
government officials say it is difficult to find a consistent representative for the entire muslim community who can decide on a fixed curriculum for islamic religion classes . but this will likely be resolved in the near future .
at the same time , the influence of churches on german society continues to decline .
while churches were an especially strong political force in the early days of the federal republic , their role is fading increasingly into the background , said church historian michael basse . " the times in which politicians had to fear the power of the churches are long gone , " he said . dw staff -lrb- my -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row erupts over ethics and religion ruling conservative politicians in germany are up in arms over the decision made by the ruling spd-green government to make lessons in ethics and religion compulsory in berlin .

in contrast to many islamic countries such as afghanistan , germany has a clear separation of church and state , at least in principle . but this separation is not as strict as one might expect .
while churches in germany do not dictate politics , they are still one of the many political players within the framework of the country 's democracy . german religious leaders make public statements on many political issues - for example on moral issues such as abortion , or social questions such as the integration of foreigners .
these statements do not , however , have the same impact as they used to .
one reason for this is the decline in the number of faithful who officially belong to a particular church . germa n churches losi n g members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full churches have become a rare sight in germany both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have been complaining for years about declining membership .
around 60 percent of people in germany belong to one of these two christian denominations ; more than 30 percent do not belong to any religious community at all . the right to practice or to leave a religion is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed under germany 's basic law .
but the state still has control over how this happens - a german citizen can only officially renounce membership in a church through a civil registry office or at a municipal court . michael basse , a church historian , said that protests by church groups after the end of world war i prevented a complete separation of church and state in germany . " there was already an attempt to introduce a radical separation of church and state during the november revolution -lrb- overthrow of the monarchy in 1918-1919 -rrb- , " basse said .
" but the protestant and catholic churches mobilized their members to hold massive demonstrations to prevent this .
during that time the main point of contention was the issue of religion classes in schools . " li n ks betwee n the church a n d state remai n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crosses hang in many german classrooms unlike schools in other secular countries , german public schools still offer religion courses , and public universities in germany continue to train future theologians .
in addition to education , there are other institutional links between the church and state . for example , the state tax authority is responsible for collecting the so-called church tax .
this goes towards financing staff , houses of worship , and social welfare institutions such as hospitals and kindergartens , which are often run by church groups . the limits of church power in germany are still defined by a clause in the legal code of the weimar republic , which dates back to the year 1919 .
it gives the two christian denominations special privileges such as tax breaks - which do not apply to other religious groups in germany . michael basse said he wonders if this is going to change .
" an interesting political question would be to what extent there is a readiness to apply these benefits to other religions , " he said . teachi n g islamic religio n i n germa n schools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few schools offer religious education for muslim students this question is of particular interest to germany 's muslim community .
the country 's three million muslims are also guaranteed freedom of worship under german law . but there are still some difficulties when it comes to religious education for muslims .
only a few federal states in germany currently have pilot projects for islamic religion classes in schools .
this is partially due to a lack of initiative on the part of the german school system . but another challenge is the high number of muslim umbrella groups and different islamic religious denominations in germany .
government officials say it is difficult to find a consistent representative for the entire muslim community who can decide on a fixed curriculum for islamic religion classes . but this will likely be resolved in the near future .
at the same time , the influence of churches on german society continues to decline .
while churches were an especially strong political force in the early days of the federal republic , their role is fading increasingly into the background , said church historian michael basse . " the times in which politicians had to fear the power of the churches are long gone , " he said . dw staff -lrb- my -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row erupts over ethics and religion ruling conservative politicians in germany are up in arms over the decision made by the ruling spd-green government to make lessons in ethics and religion compulsory in berlin .

the finance minister told parliament on tuesday that the measure was needed to boost the economy and gain financial room to maneuver for greater consolidation in 2007 . " the 2006 budget is intended to create stronger economic growth and so provide the necessary tailwind to achieve our ambitious goals in 2007 , " he said .
" next year we are planning to invest considerably more and notably drive our deficit below the eu 's 3 percent limit . " staggering national debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's debt clock keeps climbing by the second the fresh borrowing , however , will increase germany 's national debt to a staggering 900 billion euros .
this mountain of debt alone requires servicing by the state to the tune of 40 billion euros in the current year .
meanwhile these interest payments coupled with staff expenditures , state contributions to the pensions system and huge spending on social welfare make up two-thirds of the entire budget . but steinbrück warned against populist calls from the opposition demanding sweeping cuts to these costs . " abrupt cuts and sudden changes in welfare policy will only lead to social upheaval and a disintegration of our complex society , " he said .
" forces would be strengthened that could undo social cohesion in germany .
but i 'm afraid that those calling for sweeping changes will only come to realize that when we are facing conditions like those in paris and other french cities . "
opposition laments extra spending but the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who are the strongest opposition force , did n't hold back with stinging criticism of the government 's budget policy .
their finance expert jürgen koppelin accused chancellor merkel of lying in public with her repeated declaration that she did n't want to repeat the mistakes of the previous government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel 's government manage to reduce germany 's financial problems ?
" i can not see a change of political course in this budget , " he said .
" mrs. merkel is even increasing the amount of new debts by 7 billion euros compared with the previous government .
there is more expenditure , less savings and a continuation of the ongoing violation of our constitution . " other opposition speakers claimed that , contrary to what the government says , there was room for consolidation as additional revenue from rising company profits was already accumulating this year .
they accused merkel of using the dire state of the budget as an excuse for her plans to raise value-added tax by 3 percent next year . steinbrück replied that 2007 would be a fateful year and that it would n't hurt to save for a rainy day when growth and consumption are expected to drop as a result of the consolidation effort . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business confidence soars to 15-year high business confidence in germany has reached a 15-year high .

as part of the middle east quartet , germany and the eu have a vested interest in the israeli elections .
german middle east expert günter meyer , however , says that the influence on israel 's policies is waning . from the european perspective , which election outcome would most benefit the peace process ? the only party which has clearly set itself the goal of pushing forward with the peace process is the yachad party -lrb- " togetherness " -rrb- .
it calls for the israeli withdrawal from territory occupied in 1967 and a return to the oslo peace process .
if that were to take place , it would make peace with the palestinians a real possibility .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.03.2006 eu awaits results of israeli poll großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few went to vote on tuesday as members of the " quartet " of mediators in the middle east conflict , germany and the eu have a keen interest in the outcome of israel 's parliamentary elections .
but will they provide new impetus for the peace process ? acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert appears to be on course for victory on tuesday , despite having seen his kadima party 's lead slip in the run-up to the elections . olmert has called the poll a referendum on his plan to redefine israel 's borders - a plan which involves evacuating dozens of small jewish settlements in the west bank , while strengthening larger jewish enclaves on land palestinians want for an independent state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert plans to redefine israel 's borders if victorious for his strategy to work , kadima , the party founded by ailing prime minister ariel sharon , and its desired coalition partner - most likely the center-left labor party - will need enough support to form a majority . experts say that 's unlikely to happen . " no party is going to get an absolute majority , so it has to be a coalition government , and the optimal solution would be a coalition between kadima and the labor party , " said middle east expert udo steinbach , head of the german orient institute in hamburg .
" what must be avoided is that -lrb- benjamin -rrb- netanyahu and the likud party have any major influence , because they do n't provide any perspective as far as the peace process is concerned . " but olmert 's plans regarding israel 's borders are not without controversy .
olmert has argued that the need to separate from the palestinians is greater than ever since the militant islamic movement hamas won palestinian elections in january .
although there is broad support among israelis for his strategy , the eu , the united states and other players in the peace process are wary of giving israel the green light to annex contested land . indeed , israel 's problems with hamas could be worsened should olmert win electoral support for his plan , steinbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas ' victory has muddied the waters of eu involvement " the way that hamas is going to behave to an overwhelming extent depends on what the israelis offer them , " he said .
" if olmert goes ahead in a unilateral way , that will likely radicalize hamas , but if he makes them an offer to find a joint solution , hamas could turn out to be a fairly pragmatic partner . " he added , however , that the problem of the settlements aside , olmert is generally the favored candidate among europeans . " i would consider him to be reasonably pragmatic in terms of going along with the peace process , and going along with the international community , " steinbach said . eu 's israel policy should olmert be confirmed in office , there will likely be no great change in the eu 's policy on israel . the eu backs the peace plan now known as the road map , which foresees a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
in advancing this goal , brussels performs a balancing act , striving never to appear too partial to either side . just as the eu deplores palestinian acts of terror and demands that hamas renounce violence , it also rejects certain aspects of current israeli policy , such as the erection of the so-called security wall to isolate palestinian communities , and the expansion of settlements in the west bank . in the past , the eu 's involvement in the conflict was limited to providing financial backing and reconstruction aid .
the bloc 's evolution from mere financier to active political participant has been recognized by shimon peres , a former israeli prime minister and current candidate for kadima . " there were times in israel when people viewed the role of europe skeptically , " he said .
" this is no longer the case .
europe is no longer just a payer but a player .
the eu has fulfilled some tasks which nobody else could have done . " for his part though , steinbach thinks europe 's mediation efforts have stagnated recently , in large part because of a lack of support from the united states . " i think we were in better shape two years ago when the road map came into being , " said steinbach .
" at that time , the europeans were much more active , they were trying to push things into one direction or another and the problem was that the us was not going along with them . " german influence waning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer made the middle east a main priority steinbach is concerned that , with the us focusing on other countries in the middle east , namely iraq and iran , the israeli-palestinian conflict is being neglected .
germany 's involvement , too , has leveled off of late , he added .
under the previous social democrat-led coalition , foreign minister joschka fischer took an unprecedented interest in the region , making numerous visits there for talks with leaders on both sides of the conflict .
under the new government , that 's changed , said steinbach . " whatever they 're doing , they are doing within the eu context , " steinbach said . " talking with arabs , i have found there is a certain disillusionment about the german approach as far as the new government is concerned , " he said . " other countries in the middle east are watching very closely , and the new government is seen critically because it is viewed as doing more fence-mending with the americans than having its own approach as far as the middle east is concerned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.03.2006 eu awaits results of israeli poll großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few went to vote on tuesday as members of the " quartet " of mediators in the middle east conflict , germany and the eu have a keen interest in the outcome of israel 's parliamentary elections .
but will they provide new impetus for the peace process ? acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert appears to be on course for victory on tuesday , despite having seen his kadima party 's lead slip in the run-up to the elections . olmert has called the poll a referendum on his plan to redefine israel 's borders - a plan which involves evacuating dozens of small jewish settlements in the west bank , while strengthening larger jewish enclaves on land palestinians want for an independent state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert plans to redefine israel 's borders if victorious for his strategy to work , kadima , the party founded by ailing prime minister ariel sharon , and its desired coalition partner - most likely the center-left labor party - will need enough support to form a majority . experts say that 's unlikely to happen . " no party is going to get an absolute majority , so it has to be a coalition government , and the optimal solution would be a coalition between kadima and the labor party , " said middle east expert udo steinbach , head of the german orient institute in hamburg .
" what must be avoided is that -lrb- benjamin -rrb- netanyahu and the likud party have any major influence , because they do n't provide any perspective as far as the peace process is concerned . " but olmert 's plans regarding israel 's borders are not without controversy .
olmert has argued that the need to separate from the palestinians is greater than ever since the militant islamic movement hamas won palestinian elections in january .
although there is broad support among israelis for his strategy , the eu , the united states and other players in the peace process are wary of giving israel the green light to annex contested land . indeed , israel 's problems with hamas could be worsened should olmert win electoral support for his plan , steinbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas ' victory has muddied the waters of eu involvement " the way that hamas is going to behave to an overwhelming extent depends on what the israelis offer them , " he said .
" if olmert goes ahead in a unilateral way , that will likely radicalize hamas , but if he makes them an offer to find a joint solution , hamas could turn out to be a fairly pragmatic partner . " he added , however , that the problem of the settlements aside , olmert is generally the favored candidate among europeans . " i would consider him to be reasonably pragmatic in terms of going along with the peace process , and going along with the international community , " steinbach said . eu 's israel policy should olmert be confirmed in office , there will likely be no great change in the eu 's policy on israel . the eu backs the peace plan now known as the road map , which foresees a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
in advancing this goal , brussels performs a balancing act , striving never to appear too partial to either side . just as the eu deplores palestinian acts of terror and demands that hamas renounce violence , it also rejects certain aspects of current israeli policy , such as the erection of the so-called security wall to isolate palestinian communities , and the expansion of settlements in the west bank . in the past , the eu 's involvement in the conflict was limited to providing financial backing and reconstruction aid .
the bloc 's evolution from mere financier to active political participant has been recognized by shimon peres , a former israeli prime minister and current candidate for kadima . " there were times in israel when people viewed the role of europe skeptically , " he said .
" this is no longer the case .
europe is no longer just a payer but a player .
the eu has fulfilled some tasks which nobody else could have done . " for his part though , steinbach thinks europe 's mediation efforts have stagnated recently , in large part because of a lack of support from the united states . " i think we were in better shape two years ago when the road map came into being , " said steinbach .
" at that time , the europeans were much more active , they were trying to push things into one direction or another and the problem was that the us was not going along with them . " german influence waning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer made the middle east a main priority steinbach is concerned that , with the us focusing on other countries in the middle east , namely iraq and iran , the israeli-palestinian conflict is being neglected .
germany 's involvement , too , has leveled off of late , he added .
under the previous social democrat-led coalition , foreign minister joschka fischer took an unprecedented interest in the region , making numerous visits there for talks with leaders on both sides of the conflict .
under the new government , that 's changed , said steinbach . " whatever they 're doing , they are doing within the eu context , " steinbach said . " talking with arabs , i have found there is a certain disillusionment about the german approach as far as the new government is concerned , " he said . " other countries in the middle east are watching very closely , and the new government is seen critically because it is viewed as doing more fence-mending with the americans than having its own approach as far as the middle east is concerned .

" as i have said , i am ready to engage in dialogue and adjust the contract on these two points , " he said .
" i said that in writing to the unions , but they refused my extended hand . " the government insists the contract is vital to fighting youth unemployment , which can reach more than 50 percent in the poor suburbs hit by last year 's riots , but opponents say it is a breach of hard-won labor rights . sarkozy urges compromise president jacques chirac , who has so far given his backing to villepin , cancelled a visit this week to the northern port of le havre in order to stay close to the events in paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy but there were signs of dissension within the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- , whose president , interior minister nicolas sarkozy , was quoted by deputies as urging villepin to give ground . an ipsos poll for le monde newspaper gave some comfort to villepin , who has staked his political career - and presidential ambitions - on getting the cpe into law . while 63 percent of the population disapproved of his decision to stand by the cpe , views were heavily influenced by political allegiance .

the decision was a blow to gambling operators and the german football federation , who had hoped the court would finally break up the oddset monopoly , freeing up the 3 billion euro german gambling market for new competitors .
the market 's beneficiaries , local sports officials , breathed a sigh of relief . 500 million euros secure , for now " it 's a great decision for sports , " said manfred von richthofen , chief of the german sports association -lrb- dsb -rrb- to the broadcaster mdr .
von richthofen sees the monopoly as the only lifeline for local sports association , who receive most of the tax revenue pulled in by oddset and licensed sub-partners . " the fact that the state monopoly is admissible is a clear advantage for sports , " he said .
the oddset monopoly offers betters the opportunity to bet on sports with fixed rates on winnings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local sports receive up to 500 million euros annually from oddset the judges did ask lawmakers to restructure the monopoly so that it does more to contain gambling addiction .
they set the end of 2007 as a deadline .
the decision indicated the court preferred a state-controlled monopoly - in its current form - which is n't nearly as profit-driven as an open gambling market and can better protect consumers . protecting consumers ? private companies , arguing before the court , disputed the claim .
they said that oddset , which enters into sponsoring partnerships and advertises across the country , could not at the same time be expected to warn consumers of the dangers of the product they 're advertising .
the court took the complaint into account in its decision , as the call for a restructuring to do more against gambling addiction proves . but companies , including germany 's national soccer association , had hoped the court would do more , opening up the competition in time for the world cup . monopoly coming to an end while they wo n't get access to the market in the near future , experts doubt the monopoly can last much longer .
according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung , most of the betting done by germans is done through companies that continue to operate with a licensed issued in the old gdr - the only exception to the monopoly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : end of the monopoly ? with its limitless win potential , the increasing popularity of online gambling - a more than $ 300 billion industry worldwide - could also hasten oddset 's end . " the entire system is coming to an end , " dieter frey , a cologne lawyer and gambling expert told the berliner zeitung .

" our ambition is to form a stable coalition for the full four years so we can carry out our policies .

" we 've snatched a major victory , " danny yatom , a member of the outgoing parliament told afp at the party 's tel aviv headquarters . the election was being held on the day that palestinian mps approved a cabinet led by hamas , which advocates the destruction of the jewish state , strengthening israel 's determination to act unilaterally in the perceived absence of a partner in the peace process . with the legacy of sharon looming large , olmert had urged israel 's five million voters to turn out en masse in an election which shattered the traditional mould of israel 's two-party system . low voter turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few voted on tuesday but turnout was sharply down on the record low of 2003 at the nation 's 8,280 polling stations , where security was tight to prevent attacks by palestinian militants . in a newspaper opinion piece , olmert spelled out how he planned to dismantle all settlements which lie outside the massive separation barrier israel is building across the west bank in an echo of last year 's dramatic uprooting of jews from the gaza strip . " we must preserve the main settlement blocs in judaea and samaria -lrb- west bank -rrb- and we will fix the route of the security barrier beyond which we will no longer remain , " olmert wrote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ismail haniya as hamas won the overwhelming approval of palestinian mps for its 24-strong cabinet , its incoming premier ismail haniya made clear olmert 's redrawn map was unacceptable . " if the occupation wants to leave we will not stop them but we will not accept fait accomplis being imposed on us such as the annexation of the settlement blocs , " he said . some palestinians want to negotiate the palestinian authority meanwhile called on the next israeli government to resume stalled negotiations to find a solution to the middle east conflict . " we call on the next government , whatever it is , to immediately resume negotiations as advocated by -lrb- palestinian -rrb- president mahmud abbas , " chief palestinian negotiator saeb erakat told afp .

the unexpected surge in the ifo business climate index on tuesday points to a solid recovery in europe 's biggest economy , analysts said . the ifo index soared to 105.4 points in march - the highest reading since april 1991 , the year after german unification , and up from 103.4 points in february .

i grew up watching the fa english football and grew up having english coaches , but to get a work permit you ca n't go there at a young age .
i had an opportunity to come to germany when i was 19 .
at that time the manager of hanover 96 saw me play and asked me to come back , and i did n't let the opportunity pass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting ahead in europe takes patience , said cherundolo , right your n atio n al team colleague la n do n do n ova n left bayer leverkuse n a n d has had a lot of success i n the us league .
is it difficult to break through i n germa n y ? the mentality here is difficult , and i think they try to beat you down and build you up in their own way , with their own set of rules .
i think it 's difficult for young kids to come over here and learn that .
the thing you need the most is patience and you have to be in a position to wait .
landon was n't .
landon is a good enough player to play over here , without a doubt at any club in germany , but he was able to progress and have a good thing going for him in the states .
i had to wait here , and if you do wait your turn it will come around if you 're patient .
if you allow yourself to adapt to certain things here , you do n't have to change , but you do have to adapt . you 're the deputy captai n at ha n over a n d gregg berhalter is captai n at e n ergie cottbus i n the seco n d divisio n .
are you , as america n s , accepted as team leaders ? first and foremost you have to bring performance week in and week out , that 's the most important criteria , and on top of that you need to be a leader in training , and you ca n't be involved in any stupid things off the field .
it does n't mean you ca n't have fun , but you have to be a little responsible and always try to be positive .
i think that fits our mentality as americans anyway - to always be positive and never give up .
i think that 's something that they -lrb- the germans -rrb- admire and respect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat the usa 1-0 in the 2002 world cup quarter-finals the us team reached the quarter-fi n als four years ago .
what do you expect of this world cup i n germa n y ? it 's going to be a great event .
it 's going to be better than the last world cup as far as organization and fan support go .
i expect three very tough games for us .
i 'm looking forward to getting all the preparation over with and just get on the field against the czech republic in the first game in gelsenkirchen .
we 're concentrating on the preparation for the first round and that 's going to be tough enough to get through as it is .
if we do get through , we 'll look to see who we play in the second round and go from there . you have italy a n d gha n a i n your group as well .
is that o n e of the hardest groups ? everybody says it 's one of the hardest .
i think one of the reasons why it 's a difficult group is because we 're there , too .
and ghana is no pushover either .
for most people there are two favorites in the group , for me there are four very strong teams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's bernd schneider , left , fought cherundolo for the ball during a friendly match in dortmund after your game agai n st pola n d i n kaiserslauter n , us fa n s at the n earby ramstei n air base said they wa n ted to make your match agai n st italy i n kaiserslauter n like a home game for the us .
how big do you thi n k the fa n s support will be a n d how importa n t is it for the team ? i think it 's very important .
a pro-us crowd is something that we rarely have , even in the united states .
if we could have that at the world 's biggest stage , at a world cup , at one of the most important games for us , that would mean all the world to us . i think against poland in the second half when we went ahead , you heard the fans and you saw a difference in our play .

the finance minister told parliament on tuesday that the measure was needed to boost the economy and gain financial room to maneuver for greater consolidation in 2007 . " the 2006 budget is intended to create stronger economic growth and so provide the necessary tailwind to achieve our ambitious goals in 2007 , " he said .
" next year we are planning to invest considerably more and notably drive our deficit below the eu 's 3 percent limit . " staggering national debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's debt clock keeps climbing by the second the fresh borrowing , however , will increase germany 's national debt to a staggering 900 billion euros .
this mountain of debt alone requires servicing by the state to the tune of 40 billion euros in the current year .
meanwhile these interest payments coupled with staff expenditures , state contributions to the pensions system and huge spending on social welfare make up two-thirds of the entire budget . but steinbrück warned against populist calls from the opposition demanding sweeping cuts to these costs . " abrupt cuts and sudden changes in welfare policy will only lead to social upheaval and a disintegration of our complex society , " he said .
" forces would be strengthened that could undo social cohesion in germany .
but i 'm afraid that those calling for sweeping changes will only come to realize that when we are facing conditions like those in paris and other french cities . "
opposition laments extra spending but the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who are the strongest opposition force , did n't hold back with stinging criticism of the government 's budget policy .
their finance expert jürgen koppelin accused chancellor merkel of lying in public with her repeated declaration that she did n't want to repeat the mistakes of the previous government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel 's government manage to reduce germany 's financial problems ?
" i can not see a change of political course in this budget , " he said .
" mrs. merkel is even increasing the amount of new debts by 7 billion euros compared with the previous government .
there is more expenditure , less savings and a continuation of the ongoing violation of our constitution . " other opposition speakers claimed that , contrary to what the government says , there was room for consolidation as additional revenue from rising company profits was already accumulating this year .
they accused merkel of using the dire state of the budget as an excuse for her plans to raise value-added tax by 3 percent next year . steinbrück replied that 2007 would be a fateful year and that it would n't hurt to save for a rainy day when growth and consumption are expected to drop as a result of the consolidation effort . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business confidence soars to 15-year high business confidence in germany has reached a 15-year high .

the unexpected surge in the ifo business climate index on tuesday points to a solid recovery in europe 's biggest economy , analysts said . the ifo index soared to 105.4 points in march - the highest reading since april 1991 , the year after german unification , and up from 103.4 points in february .
the february reading was revised from 103.3 points . " the economic recovery is continuing to stabilize , " said the head of munich-based ifo institute , hans-werner sinn .
he added that optimism had spread through most sectors of the economy and that the most marked improvement had been registered in the poorer former communist eastern states . analysts cheered the news as ushering in a robust economic turnaround . " after five very lean years , germany seems to be heading for a serious economic upswing , " said holger schmieding , an economist with bank of america .
" taken at face value , the ifo projects a cyclical boom and not just a tame upturn . " important for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank headquarters in frankfurt edward teather of ubs investment research in london said the ifo index had broader positive implications for the euro zone as a whole . " the strength of german business confidence implied by the ifo in recent months has clearly outstripped that of the other large euro-area economies , " he said .
" however , while the acceleration in german growth may not be repeated in full elsewhere , it should provide a lift to activity growth in germany 's trading partners . " david brown of investment bank bear stearns said german business confidence is booming . " strong ifo business sentiment numbers underline a very positive case for much more solid german recovery ahead , " he said , adding that domestic demand , the achilles ' heel of the german economy , is now improving . " it is not just robust export growth that is doing the donkey work , but stronger investment intentions are adding to the positive climate for recovery , " he said .
" german businesses are becoming much more upbeat about the recovery in domestic demand conditions as unemployment continues to trend lower . " the widely watched business climate index , based on a poll of some 7,000 companies , is considered a reliable barometer of the prospects of the german economy . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new german government has nation in buoyant mood while the concrete achievements of germany 's " grand coalition " government in its first 100 days might be debatable , they 've left the country in a better mood .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.03.2006 europe 's role in middle east waning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what do the elections mean for the future of the middle east ?
as part of the middle east quartet , germany and the eu have a vested interest in the israeli elections .
german middle east expert günter meyer , however , says that the influence on israel 's policies is waning . from the european perspective , which election outcome would most benefit the peace process ? the only party which has clearly set itself the goal of pushing forward with the peace process is the yachad party -lrb- " togetherness " -rrb- .
it calls for the israeli withdrawal from territory occupied in 1967 and a return to the oslo peace process .
if that were to take place , it would make peace with the palestinians a real possibility .
but this political goal is not representative of the majority in the election .
at the most five representatives from yachad will be elected . if he wins , ehud olmert has promised to establish the permanent boundaries of israel by the year 2010 .
is that a strategy germany and europe could accept or do you foresee difficulties with his plans ? the eu and germany could support the basic goal of establishing permanent borders , but only if the national boundaries respect international law .
however , that has not been the case up to now : the partially erected security fence – or apartheid wall as the palestinians call it – cuts out large chunks of occupied territory and attributes them to israel .
also the intended israeli annexation of east jerusalem , the large jewish settlements and the occupation of the eastern jordan valley are all clear breaches of international law .
finally , the one-sided definition of national borders – that is without incorporating palestinians in the negotiations – is completely unacceptable .
the result would be a forced , non-sustainable palestinian state and there would be no chance of peace in the middle east . how much political influence do germany and the eu have at the moment as part of the middle east quartet ? german and european influence on israel 's politics is close to nothing .
on the palestinian side , however , europe 's economic and humanitarian support is absolutely essential if we want to avoid further chaos and destabilization in the territories . how has germany 's role in the middle east changed since the government under chancellor angela merkel came into power ? the new government has shifted its political priorities unequivocally in favor of israel .
by doing so it has lost in the eyes of the palestinians and the rest of the arab world its trustworthiness as an impartial negotiator in the conflict . is there a danger that the conflict between israel and the palestinians will be neglected because other countries such as iran and iraq have moved to the forefront of the international focus ? this is no longer a potential risk .
it already reflects the current reality .
the fact that the construction of the security fence and the expansion of israeli enclaves in the occupied territories continue to be ignored by international politics and the public is the best proof of this new shift in focus . german middle east expert günter meyer is a professor at the university of mainz 's geographical institute , and the head of the center for research on the arab world .
additionally , he is a director of the german middle east studies association for contemporary research and documentation -lrb- davo -rrb- . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamas must reform itself , eu warns the eu has reiterated its stance that hamas - the palestinian militant group whose members now take up prominent seats in the new palestinian cabinet - must reform itself if it is to expect european aid in the future .
-lrb- april 20 , 2006 -rrb- europe gets in step with us policies in the middle east in 2003 , most european nations were at odds with the us over its invasion plans for iraq .
now , with a new set of challenges in the middle east , europe is increasingly aligned with washington on the hamas and iran issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on religion german muslim group elects islam convert for top post intelligent design debate arrives in germany germany 's jewish community begins search for new president " germany should lead fight against anti-semitism " germany -pipe- 28.03.2006 germany 's not-quite-so-secular democracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom of religion is guaranteed under germany 's constitution religion still plays a significant role in german politics , despite an official separation of church and state .
up to now , christian groups had the greatest say , but this is slowly changing . for people in germany , the arrest and near-execution of an afghan convert to christianity in kabul is hard to understand .
in contrast to many islamic countries such as afghanistan , germany has a clear separation of church and state , at least in principle . but this separation is not as strict as one might expect .
while churches in germany do not dictate politics , they are still one of the many political players within the framework of the country 's democracy . german religious leaders make public statements on many political issues - for example on moral issues such as abortion , or social questions such as the integration of foreigners .
these statements do not , however , have the same impact as they used to .
one reason for this is the decline in the number of faithful who officially belong to a particular church . germa n churches losi n g members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full churches have become a rare sight in germany both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have been complaining for years about declining membership .
around 60 percent of people in germany belong to one of these two christian denominations ; more than 30 percent do not belong to any religious community at all . the right to practice or to leave a religion is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed under germany 's basic law .
but the state still has control over how this happens - a german citizen can only officially renounce membership in a church through a civil registry office or at a municipal court . michael basse , a church historian , said that protests by church groups after the end of world war i prevented a complete separation of church and state in germany . " there was already an attempt to introduce a radical separation of church and state during the november revolution -lrb- overthrow of the monarchy in 1918-1919 -rrb- , " basse said .
" but the protestant and catholic churches mobilized their members to hold massive demonstrations to prevent this .
during that time the main point of contention was the issue of religion classes in schools . " li n ks betwee n the church a n d state remai n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crosses hang in many german classrooms unlike schools in other secular countries , german public schools still offer religion courses , and public universities in germany continue to train future theologians .
in addition to education , there are other institutional links between the church and state . for example , the state tax authority is responsible for collecting the so-called church tax .
this goes towards financing staff , houses of worship , and social welfare institutions such as hospitals and kindergartens , which are often run by church groups . the limits of church power in germany are still defined by a clause in the legal code of the weimar republic , which dates back to the year 1919 .
it gives the two christian denominations special privileges such as tax breaks - which do not apply to other religious groups in germany . michael basse said he wonders if this is going to change .
" an interesting political question would be to what extent there is a readiness to apply these benefits to other religions , " he said . teachi n g islamic religio n i n germa n schools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few schools offer religious education for muslim students this question is of particular interest to germany 's muslim community .
the country 's three million muslims are also guaranteed freedom of worship under german law . but there are still some difficulties when it comes to religious education for muslims .
only a few federal states in germany currently have pilot projects for islamic religion classes in schools .
this is partially due to a lack of initiative on the part of the german school system . but another challenge is the high number of muslim umbrella groups and different islamic religious denominations in germany .
government officials say it is difficult to find a consistent representative for the entire muslim community who can decide on a fixed curriculum for islamic religion classes . but this will likely be resolved in the near future .
at the same time , the influence of churches on german society continues to decline .
while churches were an especially strong political force in the early days of the federal republic , their role is fading increasingly into the background , said church historian michael basse . " the times in which politicians had to fear the power of the churches are long gone , " he said . dw staff -lrb- my -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row erupts over ethics and religion ruling conservative politicians in germany are up in arms over the decision made by the ruling spd-green government to make lessons in ethics and religion compulsory in berlin .

a n accomplished right back a n d deputy captai n for the bu n desliga 's ha n over 96 , cheru n dolo joi n ed the us team i n 2001 a n d is n ow amo n g the you n g team 's i n ter n atio n ally experie n ced players . dw-world.de : why did you e n d up i n germa n y , as opposed to somewhere else i n europe ? steve cherundolo : it 's always been a dream of mine to play in europe .
i grew up watching the fa english football and grew up having english coaches , but to get a work permit you ca n't go there at a young age .
i had an opportunity to come to germany when i was 19 .
at that time the manager of hanover 96 saw me play and asked me to come back , and i did n't let the opportunity pass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting ahead in europe takes patience , said cherundolo , right your n atio n al team colleague la n do n do n ova n left bayer leverkuse n a n d has had a lot of success i n the us league .
is it difficult to break through i n germa n y ? the mentality here is difficult , and i think they try to beat you down and build you up in their own way , with their own set of rules .
i think it 's difficult for young kids to come over here and learn that .
the thing you need the most is patience and you have to be in a position to wait .
landon was n't .
landon is a good enough player to play over here , without a doubt at any club in germany , but he was able to progress and have a good thing going for him in the states .
i had to wait here , and if you do wait your turn it will come around if you 're patient .
if you allow yourself to adapt to certain things here , you do n't have to change , but you do have to adapt . you 're the deputy captai n at ha n over a n d gregg berhalter is captai n at e n ergie cottbus i n the seco n d divisio n .
are you , as america n s , accepted as team leaders ? first and foremost you have to bring performance week in and week out , that 's the most important criteria , and on top of that you need to be a leader in training , and you ca n't be involved in any stupid things off the field .
it does n't mean you ca n't have fun , but you have to be a little responsible and always try to be positive .
i think that fits our mentality as americans anyway - to always be positive and never give up .
i think that 's something that they -lrb- the germans -rrb- admire and respect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat the usa 1-0 in the 2002 world cup quarter-finals the us team reached the quarter-fi n als four years ago .
what do you expect of this world cup i n germa n y ? it 's going to be a great event .
it 's going to be better than the last world cup as far as organization and fan support go .
i expect three very tough games for us .
i 'm looking forward to getting all the preparation over with and just get on the field against the czech republic in the first game in gelsenkirchen .
we 're concentrating on the preparation for the first round and that 's going to be tough enough to get through as it is .
if we do get through , we 'll look to see who we play in the second round and go from there . you have italy a n d gha n a i n your group as well .
is that o n e of the hardest groups ? everybody says it 's one of the hardest .
i think one of the reasons why it 's a difficult group is because we 're there , too .
and ghana is no pushover either .
for most people there are two favorites in the group , for me there are four very strong teams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's bernd schneider , left , fought cherundolo for the ball during a friendly match in dortmund after your game agai n st pola n d i n kaiserslauter n , us fa n s at the n earby ramstei n air base said they wa n ted to make your match agai n st italy i n kaiserslauter n like a home game for the us .
how big do you thi n k the fa n s support will be a n d how importa n t is it for the team ? i think it 's very important .
a pro-us crowd is something that we rarely have , even in the united states .
if we could have that at the world 's biggest stage , at a world cup , at one of the most important games for us , that would mean all the world to us . i think against poland in the second half when we went ahead , you heard the fans and you saw a difference in our play .
the guys were more confident on the ball and we really , really played well in the second half against poland .
if we could have that kind of atmosphere against italy that would be fantastic . sean sinico interviewed steve cherundolo send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann relief as germany crushes usa in friendly world cup hosts germany crushed the united states 4-1 at home on wednesday for a much-needed morale boost ahead of this summer 's soccer extravaganza .

i grew up watching the fa english football and grew up having english coaches , but to get a work permit you ca n't go there at a young age .
i had an opportunity to come to germany when i was 19 .
at that time the manager of hanover 96 saw me play and asked me to come back , and i did n't let the opportunity pass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting ahead in europe takes patience , said cherundolo , right your n atio n al team colleague la n do n do n ova n left bayer leverkuse n a n d has had a lot of success i n the us league .
is it difficult to break through i n germa n y ? the mentality here is difficult , and i think they try to beat you down and build you up in their own way , with their own set of rules .
i think it 's difficult for young kids to come over here and learn that .
the thing you need the most is patience and you have to be in a position to wait .
landon was n't .
landon is a good enough player to play over here , without a doubt at any club in germany , but he was able to progress and have a good thing going for him in the states .
i had to wait here , and if you do wait your turn it will come around if you 're patient .
if you allow yourself to adapt to certain things here , you do n't have to change , but you do have to adapt . you 're the deputy captai n at ha n over a n d gregg berhalter is captai n at e n ergie cottbus i n the seco n d divisio n .
are you , as america n s , accepted as team leaders ? first and foremost you have to bring performance week in and week out , that 's the most important criteria , and on top of that you need to be a leader in training , and you ca n't be involved in any stupid things off the field .
it does n't mean you ca n't have fun , but you have to be a little responsible and always try to be positive .
i think that fits our mentality as americans anyway - to always be positive and never give up .
i think that 's something that they -lrb- the germans -rrb- admire and respect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat the usa 1-0 in the 2002 world cup quarter-finals the us team reached the quarter-fi n als four years ago .
what do you expect of this world cup i n germa n y ? it 's going to be a great event .
it 's going to be better than the last world cup as far as organization and fan support go .
i expect three very tough games for us .
i 'm looking forward to getting all the preparation over with and just get on the field against the czech republic in the first game in gelsenkirchen .
we 're concentrating on the preparation for the first round and that 's going to be tough enough to get through as it is .
if we do get through , we 'll look to see who we play in the second round and go from there . you have italy a n d gha n a i n your group as well .
is that o n e of the hardest groups ? everybody says it 's one of the hardest .
i think one of the reasons why it 's a difficult group is because we 're there , too .
and ghana is no pushover either .
for most people there are two favorites in the group , for me there are four very strong teams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's bernd schneider , left , fought cherundolo for the ball during a friendly match in dortmund after your game agai n st pola n d i n kaiserslauter n , us fa n s at the n earby ramstei n air base said they wa n ted to make your match agai n st italy i n kaiserslauter n like a home game for the us .
how big do you thi n k the fa n s support will be a n d how importa n t is it for the team ? i think it 's very important .
a pro-us crowd is something that we rarely have , even in the united states .
if we could have that at the world 's biggest stage , at a world cup , at one of the most important games for us , that would mean all the world to us . i think against poland in the second half when we went ahead , you heard the fans and you saw a difference in our play .

i grew up watching the fa english football and grew up having english coaches , but to get a work permit you ca n't go there at a young age .
i had an opportunity to come to germany when i was 19 .
at that time the manager of hanover 96 saw me play and asked me to come back , and i did n't let the opportunity pass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting ahead in europe takes patience , said cherundolo , right your n atio n al team colleague la n do n do n ova n left bayer leverkuse n a n d has had a lot of success i n the us league .
is it difficult to break through i n germa n y ? the mentality here is difficult , and i think they try to beat you down and build you up in their own way , with their own set of rules .
i think it 's difficult for young kids to come over here and learn that .
the thing you need the most is patience and you have to be in a position to wait .
landon was n't .
landon is a good enough player to play over here , without a doubt at any club in germany , but he was able to progress and have a good thing going for him in the states .
i had to wait here , and if you do wait your turn it will come around if you 're patient .
if you allow yourself to adapt to certain things here , you do n't have to change , but you do have to adapt . you 're the deputy captai n at ha n over a n d gregg berhalter is captai n at e n ergie cottbus i n the seco n d divisio n .
are you , as america n s , accepted as team leaders ? first and foremost you have to bring performance week in and week out , that 's the most important criteria , and on top of that you need to be a leader in training , and you ca n't be involved in any stupid things off the field .
it does n't mean you ca n't have fun , but you have to be a little responsible and always try to be positive .
i think that fits our mentality as americans anyway - to always be positive and never give up .
i think that 's something that they -lrb- the germans -rrb- admire and respect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat the usa 1-0 in the 2002 world cup quarter-finals the us team reached the quarter-fi n als four years ago .
what do you expect of this world cup i n germa n y ? it 's going to be a great event .
it 's going to be better than the last world cup as far as organization and fan support go .
i expect three very tough games for us .
i 'm looking forward to getting all the preparation over with and just get on the field against the czech republic in the first game in gelsenkirchen .
we 're concentrating on the preparation for the first round and that 's going to be tough enough to get through as it is .
if we do get through , we 'll look to see who we play in the second round and go from there . you have italy a n d gha n a i n your group as well .
is that o n e of the hardest groups ? everybody says it 's one of the hardest .
i think one of the reasons why it 's a difficult group is because we 're there , too .
and ghana is no pushover either .
for most people there are two favorites in the group , for me there are four very strong teams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's bernd schneider , left , fought cherundolo for the ball during a friendly match in dortmund after your game agai n st pola n d i n kaiserslauter n , us fa n s at the n earby ramstei n air base said they wa n ted to make your match agai n st italy i n kaiserslauter n like a home game for the us .

up to now , christian groups had the greatest say , but this is slowly changing . for people in germany , the arrest and near-execution of an afghan convert to christianity in kabul is hard to understand .
in contrast to many islamic countries such as afghanistan , germany has a clear separation of church and state , at least in principle . but this separation is not as strict as one might expect .
while churches in germany do not dictate politics , they are still one of the many political players within the framework of the country 's democracy . german religious leaders make public statements on many political issues - for example on moral issues such as abortion , or social questions such as the integration of foreigners .
these statements do not , however , have the same impact as they used to .
one reason for this is the decline in the number of faithful who officially belong to a particular church . germa n churches losi n g members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full churches have become a rare sight in germany both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have been complaining for years about declining membership .
around 60 percent of people in germany belong to one of these two christian denominations ; more than 30 percent do not belong to any religious community at all . the right to practice or to leave a religion is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed under germany 's basic law .
but the state still has control over how this happens - a german citizen can only officially renounce membership in a church through a civil registry office or at a municipal court . michael basse , a church historian , said that protests by church groups after the end of world war i prevented a complete separation of church and state in germany . " there was already an attempt to introduce a radical separation of church and state during the november revolution -lrb- overthrow of the monarchy in 1918-1919 -rrb- , " basse said .
" but the protestant and catholic churches mobilized their members to hold massive demonstrations to prevent this .
during that time the main point of contention was the issue of religion classes in schools . " li n ks betwee n the church a n d state remai n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crosses hang in many german classrooms unlike schools in other secular countries , german public schools still offer religion courses , and public universities in germany continue to train future theologians .
in addition to education , there are other institutional links between the church and state . for example , the state tax authority is responsible for collecting the so-called church tax .
this goes towards financing staff , houses of worship , and social welfare institutions such as hospitals and kindergartens , which are often run by church groups . the limits of church power in germany are still defined by a clause in the legal code of the weimar republic , which dates back to the year 1919 .
it gives the two christian denominations special privileges such as tax breaks - which do not apply to other religious groups in germany . michael basse said he wonders if this is going to change .
" an interesting political question would be to what extent there is a readiness to apply these benefits to other religions , " he said . teachi n g islamic religio n i n germa n schools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few schools offer religious education for muslim students this question is of particular interest to germany 's muslim community .
the country 's three million muslims are also guaranteed freedom of worship under german law . but there are still some difficulties when it comes to religious education for muslims .
only a few federal states in germany currently have pilot projects for islamic religion classes in schools .
this is partially due to a lack of initiative on the part of the german school system . but another challenge is the high number of muslim umbrella groups and different islamic religious denominations in germany .
government officials say it is difficult to find a consistent representative for the entire muslim community who can decide on a fixed curriculum for islamic religion classes . but this will likely be resolved in the near future .
at the same time , the influence of churches on german society continues to decline .

the decision was a blow to gambling operators and the german football federation , who had hoped the court would finally break up the oddset monopoly , freeing up the 3 billion euro german gambling market for new competitors .
the market 's beneficiaries , local sports officials , breathed a sigh of relief . 500 million euros secure , for now " it 's a great decision for sports , " said manfred von richthofen , chief of the german sports association -lrb- dsb -rrb- to the broadcaster mdr .
von richthofen sees the monopoly as the only lifeline for local sports association , who receive most of the tax revenue pulled in by oddset and licensed sub-partners . " the fact that the state monopoly is admissible is a clear advantage for sports , " he said .
the oddset monopoly offers betters the opportunity to bet on sports with fixed rates on winnings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local sports receive up to 500 million euros annually from oddset the judges did ask lawmakers to restructure the monopoly so that it does more to contain gambling addiction .
they set the end of 2007 as a deadline .
the decision indicated the court preferred a state-controlled monopoly - in its current form - which is n't nearly as profit-driven as an open gambling market and can better protect consumers . protecting consumers ? private companies , arguing before the court , disputed the claim .
they said that oddset , which enters into sponsoring partnerships and advertises across the country , could not at the same time be expected to warn consumers of the dangers of the product they 're advertising .
the court took the complaint into account in its decision , as the call for a restructuring to do more against gambling addiction proves . but companies , including germany 's national soccer association , had hoped the court would do more , opening up the competition in time for the world cup . monopoly coming to an end while they wo n't get access to the market in the near future , experts doubt the monopoly can last much longer .
according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung , most of the betting done by germans is done through companies that continue to operate with a licensed issued in the old gdr - the only exception to the monopoly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : end of the monopoly ? with its limitless win potential , the increasing popularity of online gambling - a more than $ 300 billion industry worldwide - could also hasten oddset 's end . " the entire system is coming to an end , " dieter frey , a cologne lawyer and gambling expert told the berliner zeitung .

up to now , christian groups had the greatest say , but this is slowly changing . for people in germany , the arrest and near-execution of an afghan convert to christianity in kabul is hard to understand .
in contrast to many islamic countries such as afghanistan , germany has a clear separation of church and state , at least in principle . but this separation is not as strict as one might expect .
while churches in germany do not dictate politics , they are still one of the many political players within the framework of the country 's democracy . german religious leaders make public statements on many political issues - for example on moral issues such as abortion , or social questions such as the integration of foreigners .
these statements do not , however , have the same impact as they used to .
one reason for this is the decline in the number of faithful who officially belong to a particular church . germa n churches losi n g members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full churches have become a rare sight in germany both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have been complaining for years about declining membership .
around 60 percent of people in germany belong to one of these two christian denominations ; more than 30 percent do not belong to any religious community at all . the right to practice or to leave a religion is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed under germany 's basic law .
but the state still has control over how this happens - a german citizen can only officially renounce membership in a church through a civil registry office or at a municipal court . michael basse , a church historian , said that protests by church groups after the end of world war i prevented a complete separation of church and state in germany . " there was already an attempt to introduce a radical separation of church and state during the november revolution -lrb- overthrow of the monarchy in 1918-1919 -rrb- , " basse said .
" but the protestant and catholic churches mobilized their members to hold massive demonstrations to prevent this .
during that time the main point of contention was the issue of religion classes in schools . " li n ks betwee n the church a n d state remai n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crosses hang in many german classrooms unlike schools in other secular countries , german public schools still offer religion courses , and public universities in germany continue to train future theologians .
in addition to education , there are other institutional links between the church and state . for example , the state tax authority is responsible for collecting the so-called church tax .
this goes towards financing staff , houses of worship , and social welfare institutions such as hospitals and kindergartens , which are often run by church groups . the limits of church power in germany are still defined by a clause in the legal code of the weimar republic , which dates back to the year 1919 .
it gives the two christian denominations special privileges such as tax breaks - which do not apply to other religious groups in germany . michael basse said he wonders if this is going to change .
" an interesting political question would be to what extent there is a readiness to apply these benefits to other religions , " he said . teachi n g islamic religio n i n germa n schools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few schools offer religious education for muslim students this question is of particular interest to germany 's muslim community .
the country 's three million muslims are also guaranteed freedom of worship under german law . but there are still some difficulties when it comes to religious education for muslims .
only a few federal states in germany currently have pilot projects for islamic religion classes in schools .
this is partially due to a lack of initiative on the part of the german school system . but another challenge is the high number of muslim umbrella groups and different islamic religious denominations in germany .
government officials say it is difficult to find a consistent representative for the entire muslim community who can decide on a fixed curriculum for islamic religion classes . but this will likely be resolved in the near future .
at the same time , the influence of churches on german society continues to decline .
while churches were an especially strong political force in the early days of the federal republic , their role is fading increasingly into the background , said church historian michael basse .

the decision was a blow to gambling operators and the german football federation , who had hoped the court would finally break up the oddset monopoly , freeing up the 3 billion euro german gambling market for new competitors .
the market 's beneficiaries , local sports officials , breathed a sigh of relief . 500 million euros secure , for now " it 's a great decision for sports , " said manfred von richthofen , chief of the german sports association -lrb- dsb -rrb- to the broadcaster mdr .
von richthofen sees the monopoly as the only lifeline for local sports association , who receive most of the tax revenue pulled in by oddset and licensed sub-partners . " the fact that the state monopoly is admissible is a clear advantage for sports , " he said .
the oddset monopoly offers betters the opportunity to bet on sports with fixed rates on winnings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local sports receive up to 500 million euros annually from oddset the judges did ask lawmakers to restructure the monopoly so that it does more to contain gambling addiction .
they set the end of 2007 as a deadline .
the decision indicated the court preferred a state-controlled monopoly - in its current form - which is n't nearly as profit-driven as an open gambling market and can better protect consumers . protecting consumers ? private companies , arguing before the court , disputed the claim .
they said that oddset , which enters into sponsoring partnerships and advertises across the country , could not at the same time be expected to warn consumers of the dangers of the product they 're advertising .
the court took the complaint into account in its decision , as the call for a restructuring to do more against gambling addiction proves . but companies , including germany 's national soccer association , had hoped the court would do more , opening up the competition in time for the world cup . monopoly coming to an end while they wo n't get access to the market in the near future , experts doubt the monopoly can last much longer .
according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung , most of the betting done by germans is done through companies that continue to operate with a licensed issued in the old gdr - the only exception to the monopoly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : end of the monopoly ? with its limitless win potential , the increasing popularity of online gambling - a more than $ 300 billion industry worldwide - could also hasten oddset 's end . " the entire system is coming to an end , " dieter frey , a cologne lawyer and gambling expert told the berliner zeitung .

a further half million households are already having difficulty paying bills and meeting debts , the report found .
the fsa identified a lack of consumer knowledge , particularly amongst the 18-40 age group , as key to low levels of saving in the uk .
the fsa pledged £ 10m this year to boost financial knowledge amongst consumers . "
we have to find new innovative , creative ways to grab the attention of young people " john tiner , fsa chief executive largest survey ever academics at bristol university , on behalf of the fsa , quizzed more than 5,000 consumers about their personal finance know-how , the largest survey of its type ever conducted .
the survey results revealed an alarming lack of knowledge amongst consumers .
some of the key findings included : half a million households are in serious financial difficulty , even in current benign economic conditions most britons are good at making ends meet but not so good at saving for the future seven out of 10 consumers have no savings in place to see them through a sudden drop in income 42 % of working age adults do not have a personal or workplace pension , yet 81 % recognise that the state pension will not be enough for them to enjoy a comfortable retirement four out of 10 consumers who have an equity individual savings account are unaware that its value can fluctuate with stock market performance .
part of the fsa 's remit is to promote financial education amongst consumers .
the survey suggests that it is amongst younger people that the fsa faces its biggest challenge .
" there is a real problem amongst the young , " john tiner , fsa chief executive , said .
" today 's 18-40 year olds are faced with greater challenges than were faced by their parents ... the cost of not having the necessary skills to make sound financial decisions is becoming increasingly significant .
" we have to find new innovative , creative ways to grab the attention of young people , " mr tiner added .
initiatives over the next five years , at an estimated cost of £ 10m a year , the fsa plans a series of initiatives to boost personal finance knowledge , particularly amongst the young .
pupils in 4,000 secondary schools will receive lessons in managing money and students in higher education will have access to debt and financial advice .
some large employers are to hand out financial information packs to their workers , while new and prospective parents are to receive a money box pack , containing details of the government 's child trust fund and subsidised nursery places .
in total , the fsa aims to help 10 million britons with managing their money .
as part of the initiative the fsa and the bbc news website joined forces last year to develop a financial healthcheck and a debt test .
they are currently available on the bbc news and fsa websites , but will soon be syndicated as widely as possible .
the fsa plans to conduct mass consumer surveys every four years to see if its measures are improving financial know-how .
" we do n't expect to see a dramatic jump in financial capability ... just a steady improvement , " mr tiner told bbc news .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- hospital car parks make millions bbc news / health graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- health contents : medical notes tuesday , 28 march 2006 , 05:04 gmt 06:04 uk hospital car parks make millions hospitals in england are each charging their patients up to £ 1.5m a year for car parking , the bbc has learned .
twelve hospital trusts each raised over £ 1m in charges , figures obtained under the freedom of information act show .
the department of health said it was up to nhs trusts to decide what to charge , and said charges deterred non-service users from using the car parks .
but macmillan cancer relief said it was " morally wrong " to raise revenue by forcing patients to pay for parking .
the hospitals earning the most from car parks tended to be the larger trusts treating more patients . "
we actually have one of the lowest charges for car parking in the country " university hospital birmingham spokeswoman ' parking added to my stress ' the department of health figures suggest that one trust , university hospital birmingham , raised £ 1.5 million from car parking charges in 2004-5 .
but the trust says this is the revenue from the car parks from three health trusts on four hospital sites ; the two sites of the university hospital birmingham , the birmingham and solihull mental health hospital and the women 's hospital .
a spokeswoman said : " we actually have one of the lowest charges for car parking in the country , this high revenue figure is due to the fact that a lot of people are using these spaces . "
have your say " charging parking fees is against the founding principles of the nhs " vincent murphy , uk send us your comments the two university hospital birmingham sites serve more than 553,000 people a year .
of the £ 1.5m revenue , £ 1m was pumped into the costs of running the car parks and a shuttle bus from the local train station , while the rest was invested back into patient care .
flat rate the cambridge university nhs foundation trust also raises more than £ 1m from its car parks .
the trust 's car parks serve two hospitals , the large 1,100-bed addenbrooke 's and the rosie hospital for women and charge a flat rate of £ 2.50 .
hospitals ' car park income most computers will open pdf documents automatically , but you may need to download adobe acrobat reader .
a spokeswoman said the income paid for improvements such as external lighting , walkways , cycle racks and ways , security and improved car park and travel facilities .
basildon and thurrock university hospitals nhs foundation trust raised just over £ 1m from its car parks over two hospital sites .
a spokeswoman said : " in direct response to local demand , we have considerably expanded the number of spaces available and also ensured a good standard of lighting , security , etc ... investing some £ 1.2m in car park expansion and improvements in the last six years . "
a spokeswoman for the oxford radcliffe hospitals nhs trust , which raised more than £ 1.2m from its car parks , pointed out it was one of the largest trusts in the country , with approximately 1,200 patient and visitor parking spaces , split across four separate sites .
" the hospital car parks are not run as a commercial operation and all money raised goes directly back into services for patients and visitors .
" the average cost of a three-hour stay at the john radcliffe hospital , the biggest of the four sites , is only £ 1.50 . "
' patient exploitation ' a department of health spokeswoman said parking charges helped hospitals because they discouraged people who were not using the hospital from taking up the car park spaces .
she added that most hospitals had exemptions from charges for patients , " and hospital staff are generally well trained in advising patients about these exemptions " . "
hospital car parking costs are often the final straw in a long line of extra costs faced by cancer patients " macmillan cancer relief " ultimately , it is a matter for individual nhs trusts to decide whether or not to charge for car parking , and the level of charges in the light of local circumstances .

twelve hospital trusts each raised over £ 1m in charges , figures obtained under the freedom of information act show .
the department of health said it was up to nhs trusts to decide what to charge , and said charges deterred non-service users from using the car parks .
but macmillan cancer relief said it was " morally wrong " to raise revenue by forcing patients to pay for parking .
the hospitals earning the most from car parks tended to be the larger trusts treating more patients .
we actually have one of the lowest charges for car parking in the country university hospital birmingham spokeswoman ' parking added to my stress ' the department of health figures suggest that one trust , university hospital birmingham , raised £ 1.5 million from car parking charges in 2004-5 .
but the trust says this is the revenue from the car parks from three health trusts on four hospital sites ; the two sites of the university hospital birmingham , the birmingham and solihull mental health hospital and the women 's hospital .
a spokeswoman said : " we actually have one of the lowest charges for car parking in the country , this high revenue figure is due to the fact that a lot of people are using these spaces . "
have your say charging parking fees is against the founding principles of the nhs vincent murphy , uk send us your comments the two university hospital birmingham sites serve more than 553,000 people a year .
of the £ 1.5m revenue , £ 1m was pumped into the costs of running the car parks and a shuttle bus from the local train station , while the rest was invested back into patient care .
flat rate the cambridge university nhs foundation trust also raises more than £ 1m from its car parks .
the trust 's car parks serve two hospitals , the large 1,100-bed addenbrooke 's and the rosie hospital for women and charge a flat rate of £ 2.50 .

basildon and thurrock university hospitals nhs foundation trust raised just over £ 1m from its car parks over two hospital sites .
a spokeswoman said : " in direct response to local demand , we have considerably expanded the number of spaces available and also ensured a good standard of lighting , security , etc ... investing some £ 1.2m in car park expansion and improvements in the last six years . "
a spokeswoman for the oxford radcliffe hospitals nhs trust , which raised more than £ 1.2m from its car parks , pointed out it was one of the largest trusts in the country , with approximately 1,200 patient and visitor parking spaces , split across four separate sites .
" the hospital car parks are not run as a commercial operation and all money raised goes directly back into services for patients and visitors .
" the average cost of a three-hour stay at the john radcliffe hospital , the biggest of the four sites , is only £ 1.50 . "
' patient exploitation ' a department of health spokeswoman said parking charges helped hospitals because they discouraged people who were not using the hospital from taking up the car park spaces .
she added that most hospitals had exemptions from charges for patients , " and hospital staff are generally well trained in advising patients about these exemptions " .
hospital car parking costs are often the final straw in a long line of extra costs faced by cancer patients macmillan cancer relief " ultimately , it is a matter for individual nhs trusts to decide whether or not to charge for car parking , and the level of charges in the light of local circumstances . "
macmillan cancer relief has been campaigning to end hospital parking charges , especially for cancer patients who make frequent hospital trips for treatment .
the charity 's chief executive peter cardy said : " raising revenue by forcing cancer patients to pay for hospital car parking is morally wrong .
" it is shameful that the sickest and most vulnerable people have to pay the most .
hospital car parking costs are often the final straw in a long line of extra costs faced by cancer patients . "
michael summers , chairman of the patients association , said : " we take the view that this is exploitation of patients who are very vulnerable .
" some of these patients are visiting hospital several times in a week for treatment and a lot of patients ' families are also visiting several times .
" those who are genuinely attending for treatment ought not to be charged . "

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- breakfast -pipe- hospital parking : who 's making a mint ?
bbc news / breakfast graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- tuesday , 28 march 2006 , 05:08 gmt 06:08 uk hospital parking : who 's making a mint ?
over the past couple of weeks here on breakfast , you 've been telling us about your experiences as an nhs patient .
one of the biggest causes of complaint has been the high charges some hospitals make for car-parking .
now , using the freedom of information act , the bbc has found out exactly how much hospitals in england are making from the charges .
the figures - obtained from the department of health - reveal that some hospitals generate more than £ 1m from parking fees , while others make only a few thousand pounds .
this morning on breakfast : our reporter julia botfield went to the queen elizabeth medical centre in birmingham .
with its sister hospital in selly oak , it generated £ 1.5m from car park charges last year .
you can see the full list of hospital income from car-parks via the link below .
you will need to have a pdf reader installed on your computer we took the decision to remove a handful of hospitals from the list , because they appeared to have given inaccurate figures -lrb- two appeared to suggest they had made £ 6 in a year -rrb- .
and , although the information was gathered by the department of health , not every hospital in england responded to its request for information .
hospital car park income most computers will open pdf documents automatically , but you may need to download adobe acrobat reader .
the data collected is for 2004 to 2005 , but the department of health told breakfast " this is a non-mandatory collection and therefore may not be complete . "
the figures represent the total gross income generated by parking fees - before costs such as staff and maintenance .
crunching the numbers the university hospital birmingham said it received £ 1.5m in car parking charges last year - and paid its contractor q-park £ 1m to operate the car parks .
that leaves half a million pounds , which has been ploughed back into patient care in its hospitals .
the hospital 's communications director fiona alexander told us that the car park has half a million users a year , paying on average a £ 3 charge for three hours .
she added that £ 800,000 has been spent on improving the car park , providing cctv , shuttle buses and free parking for kidney and cancer patients .
the birmingham trust is one of twelve hospital trusts in england which generated more than a million pounds in gross income from car-parking last year .
the other million-pound money spinners are : basildon and thurrock university foundation trust ; cambridgeshire university hospital trust ; north west london hospitals ; portsmouth hospitals ; southampton university hospitals ; barking , havering and redbridge hospitals ; barnet and chase farm hospitals ; east kent hospitals ; epsom and st helier ; pennine acute hospitals ; united lincolnshire hospitals .
there 's a wide difference between the amount of money generated by car park charges : for instance , tower hamlets primary care trust received £ 5,110 .
the department of health stressed that it was up to the individual hospital to decide whether to provide a car park and whether to charge .
it added : " what level any charge should be set , taking into account local circumstances including patients , visitors and staff needs and the cost of providing the service " .

julia botfield with the freedom of information list over the past couple of weeks here on breakfast , you 've been telling us about your experiences as an nhs patient .
one of the biggest causes of complaint has been the high charges some hospitals make for car-parking .
now , using the freedom of information act , the bbc has found out exactly how much hospitals in england are making from the charges .
the figures - obtained from the department of health - reveal that some hospitals generate more than £ 1m from parking fees , while others make only a few thousand pounds .
this morning on breakfast : our reporter julia botfield went to the queen elizabeth medical centre in birmingham .
with its sister hospital in selly oak , it generated £ 1.5m from car park charges last year .
you can see the full list of hospital income from car-parks via the link below .
you will need to have a pdf reader installed on your computer we took the decision to remove a handful of hospitals from the list , because they appeared to have given inaccurate figures -lrb- two appeared to suggest they had made £ 6 in a year -rrb- .
and , although the information was gathered by the department of health , not every hospital in england responded to its request for information .

download the reader here the data collected is for 2004 to 2005 , but the department of health told breakfast " this is a non-mandatory collection and therefore may not be complete . "
the figures represent the total gross income generated by parking fees - before costs such as staff and maintenance .
crunching the numbers the university hospital birmingham said it received £ 1.5m in car parking charges last year - and paid its contractor q-park £ 1m to operate the car parks .
the hospital says half a million pounds went back to patient care that leaves half a million pounds , which has been ploughed back into patient care in its hospitals .
the hospital 's communications director fiona alexander told us that the car park has half a million users a year , paying on average a £ 3 charge for three hours .

why is there an election now ?
israel holds elections for the 120-seat knesset or parliament every four years and the next poll had been due in november 2006 .
however , last november prime minister ariel sharon asked to dissolve parliament after splitting from his ruling likud party .
mr sharon had lost support in the right-wing likud , and from coalition allies , over his unilateral withdrawal of settlers and the troops who protected them from the gaza strip and a small part of the west bank during the summer of 2005 .
he considered the move essential for israel 's short-term security .
mr sharon also argued that israel had to give up control of areas containing large palestinian populations if , in the long term , it was to remain a state for the jewish people .
but israel 's religious and nationalist constituencies considered the move a betrayal of god 's covenant to the jews and of israel 's past military victories .
they also wanted to avoid probable further withdrawals from jewish settlements in the west bank .
however , mr sharon - mindful that a majority of secular israelis supported his plan - decided to pull the plug on likud , form a new centrist party , kadima , and go for new elections .
what condition is ariel sharon in ?
in the middle of this political earthquake , ariel sharon suffered first a minor blood clot on 18 december and then - after keeping up his punishing schedule - a massive stroke on 4 january .
he has been in a coma ever since .
although doctors initially said there was every chance mr sharon would recover , he has not regained consciousness and the leadership of the new kadima party has been taken over by his deputy ehud olmert .
since coming to power five years ago , mr sharon has become a very popular figure with israeli voters .
therefore the main selling point for kadima was that mr sharon was at the helm .
his political demise will doubtless have lost the party some voters - however , there is also a consensus for the main plank of kadima 's policy : separation from the palestinians and drawing israel 's borders with or without a permanent peace deal .
what is at stake in the election ?
the main question is how will kadima perform without mr sharon 's guiding hand .
if it realises its good position in the polls and mr olmert is put in the driving seat , he will follow mr sharon 's vision of dismantling more isolated settlements in the west bank and annexing larger settlement blocs where most settlers live .
the settlements are illegal under international law , but israel argues the law does not apply in the west bank , and us president george w bush has at least partly endorsed israel 's view , suggesting it could keep heavily populated areas of the occupied territory .
likud and other right-wing parties are opposed to any further unilateral withdrawals , which they see as encouraging palestinian militancy .
meanwhile the centre-left labour is fighting under a new leader , the first to come from israel 's traditionally downtrodden north african jewish sector , amir peretz , who has pushed poverty up the election agenda .
if kadima does succeed , this election could spell the end of the traditional likud-labour dominance of israeli politics , as well as the power of small sect-based parties who have often held the balance of power .
what does it mean for palestinians ?
palestinians have just emerged from the own election , which resulted in a sweeping win for the islamic resistance movement hamas .
therefore their attention is far more focused on their own situation - with pressure building on hamas to recognise israel , renounce violence and sign up to past peace agreements - than the outcome of israeli elections .
palestinians usually say it does not make much difference who is in power in israel - they have to live under the occupation of the israeli army which does not change very much from government to government .
however , if the unilateralist trend does emerge triumphant from israel 's polls , things could change for the palestinians in the not too distant future .
mr olmert says he wants to draw israel 's final borders by 2010 .
palestinians fear that this will leave them living in a series of unconnected bantustans in the west bank , separated from a besieged gaza strip .
what about the international community ?
international efforts are focused currently upon getting hamas to change its policies , meaning any diplomatic heat is off israel , whoever becomes the next prime minister .
although kadima 's plan is endorsed by the us , mr olmert is careful to couch his unilateral ambitions within the framework of international diplomacy , ie that his plan will not need to take effect if the international peace plan known as the roadmap succeeds .
however that is a distant prospect , given the growing atmosphere of unilateralism on both sides at the moment .

why is there an election now ?
israel holds elections for the 120-seat knesset or parliament every four years and the next poll had been due in november 2006 .
however , last november prime minister ariel sharon asked to dissolve parliament after splitting from his ruling likud party .
mr sharon had lost support in the right-wing likud , and from coalition allies , over his unilateral withdrawal of settlers and the troops who protected them from the gaza strip and a small part of the west bank during the summer of 2005 .
he considered the move essential for israel 's short-term security .
mr sharon also argued that israel had to give up control of areas containing large palestinian populations if , in the long term , it was to remain a state for the jewish people .
but israel 's religious and nationalist constituencies considered the move a betrayal of god 's covenant to the jews and of israel 's past military victories .
they also wanted to avoid probable further withdrawals from jewish settlements in the west bank .
however , mr sharon - mindful that a majority of secular israelis supported his plan - decided to pull the plug on likud , form a new centrist party , kadima , and go for new elections .
what condition is ariel sharon in ?
in the middle of this political earthquake , ariel sharon suffered first a minor blood clot on 18 december and then - after keeping up his punishing schedule - a massive stroke on 4 january .
he has been in a coma ever since .
although doctors initially said there was every chance mr sharon would recover , he has not regained consciousness and the leadership of the new kadima party has been taken over by his deputy ehud olmert .
since coming to power five years ago , mr sharon has become a very popular figure with israeli voters .
therefore the main selling point for kadima was that mr sharon was at the helm .
his political demise will doubtless have lost the party some voters - however , there is also a consensus for the main plank of kadima 's policy : separation from the palestinians and drawing israel 's borders with or without a permanent peace deal .
what is at stake in the election ?
the main question is how will kadima perform without mr sharon 's guiding hand .
if it realises its good position in the polls and mr olmert is put in the driving seat , he will follow mr sharon 's vision of dismantling more isolated settlements in the west bank and annexing larger settlement blocs where most settlers live .
the settlements are illegal under international law , but israel argues the law does not apply in the west bank , and us president george w bush has at least partly endorsed israel 's view , suggesting it could keep heavily populated areas of the occupied territory .
likud and other right-wing parties are opposed to any further unilateral withdrawals , which they see as encouraging palestinian militancy .
meanwhile the centre-left labour is fighting under a new leader , the first to come from israel 's traditionally downtrodden north african jewish sector , amir peretz , who has pushed poverty up the election agenda .
if kadima does succeed , this election could spell the end of the traditional likud-labour dominance of israeli politics , as well as the power of small sect-based parties who have often held the balance of power .
what does it mean for palestinians ?
palestinians have just emerged from the own election , which resulted in a sweeping win for the islamic resistance movement hamas .
therefore their attention is far more focused on their own situation - with pressure building on hamas to recognise israel , renounce violence and sign up to past peace agreements - than the outcome of israeli elections .
palestinians usually say it does not make much difference who is in power in israel - they have to live under the occupation of the israeli army which does not change very much from government to government .
however , if the unilateralist trend does emerge triumphant from israel 's polls , things could change for the palestinians in the not too distant future .
mr olmert says he wants to draw israel 's final borders by 2010 .
palestinians fear that this will leave them living in a series of unconnected bantustans in the west bank , separated from a besieged gaza strip .
what about the international community ?
international efforts are focused currently upon getting hamas to change its policies , meaning any diplomatic heat is off israel , whoever becomes the next prime minister .
although kadima 's plan is endorsed by the us , mr olmert is careful to couch his unilateral ambitions within the framework of international diplomacy , ie that his plan will not need to take effect if the international peace plan known as the roadmap succeeds .
however that is a distant prospect , given the growing atmosphere of unilateralism on both sides at the moment .

why is there an election now ?
israel holds elections for the 120-seat knesset or parliament every four years and the next poll had been due in november 2006 .
however , last november prime minister ariel sharon asked to dissolve parliament after splitting from his ruling likud party .
mr sharon had lost support in the right-wing likud , and from coalition allies , over his unilateral withdrawal of settlers and the troops who protected them from the gaza strip and a small part of the west bank during the summer of 2005 .

they also wanted to avoid probable further withdrawals from jewish settlements in the west bank .

meanwhile the centre-left labour is fighting under a new leader , the first to come from israel 's traditionally downtrodden north african jewish sector , amir peretz , who has pushed poverty up the election agenda .
if kadima does succeed , this election could spell the end of the traditional likud-labour dominance of israeli politics , as well as the power of small sect-based parties who have often held the balance of power .
what does it mean for palestinians ?
palestinians have just emerged from the own election , which resulted in a sweeping win for the islamic resistance movement hamas .
therefore their attention is far more focused on their own situation - with pressure building on hamas to recognise israel , renounce violence and sign up to past peace agreements - than the outcome of israeli elections .
palestinians usually say it does not make much difference who is in power in israel - they have to live under the occupation of the israeli army which does not change very much from government to government .
however , if the unilateralist trend does emerge triumphant from israel 's polls , things could change for the palestinians in the not too distant future .
mr olmert says he wants to draw israel 's final borders by 2010 .
palestinians fear that this will leave them living in a series of unconnected bantustans in the west bank , separated from a besieged gaza strip .
what about the international community ?
international efforts are focused currently upon getting hamas to change its policies , meaning any diplomatic heat is off israel , whoever becomes the next prime minister .
although kadima 's plan is endorsed by the us , mr olmert is careful to couch his unilateral ambitions within the framework of international diplomacy , ie that his plan will not need to take effect if the international peace plan known as the roadmap succeeds .
however that is a distant prospect , given the growing atmosphere of unilateralism on both sides at the moment .

community health councils -lrb- chcs -rrb- in carmarthenshire and pembrokeshire say the proposals lack " meaningful and significant detail . "
they said many patients would travel greater distances and predicted strong and vocal opposition from the public .
the chcs plans to canvas opinion about the proposal over the three month consultation period .
sian thomas , chair of the carmarthenshire chc , said the proposal represented the biggest upheaval in hospital care in west wales for many generations .
" i can see that we need new services and new hospitals - glangwili -lrb- west wales general -rrb- is the oldest general hospital in wales , " she said . "
the document at first glance appears to be grand and glorified sales brochure that worryingly lacks any meaningful and significant detail " ashley warlow , pembrokeshire chc " but all the other issues that are not answered in this report are our concerns .
" where is the report saying it is going to improve the service in the community for those minor things that are going to be treated in the community , like minor accidents ?
" it also does not address the logistics of travelling to this supposed new hospital .
" we have no dual carriageways west of st clears - the geography of the whole area does not lend itself to one central point of care . "
ashley warlow , chief officer to pembrokeshire chc , said it was too early to say if the report was something the council could support but said it appeared the county would lose its sole district general hospital .
" the document at first glance appears to be grand and glorified sales brochure that has been more than a year in making but worryingly lacks any meaningful and significant detail , " he said .
mr warlow said at best it represented the start of the debate on the future of acute services and predicted many people would be worried by the proposal .
" at this early stage it is difficult , if not impossible , for me to say today whether these plans will be acceptable and particularly if one new hospital is better for patients .
" thirty years ago there was a huge local campaign to save our hospital here in pembrokeshire and the core services it provides - it is quite likely that we will see a similar reaction within the public arena again this time . "

during a visit to australia , mr blair said the initiatives were " all tending in the same direction " .
the asia-pacific partnership , of china , india , the us , australia , japan and south korea , seeks technologies to cut emissions rather than setting targets .
the uk prime minister is on a tour of australia , new zealand and indonesia .
in january , australia hosted the first meeting of the asia-pacific partnership on clean development and climate .
' positive ' australia and the us have not signed up to the kyoto protocol , under which industrialised countries commit to cutting combined carbon emissions to 5 % below 1990 levels by 2008-12 .
they say kyoto threatens economic growth and is worthless without commitments from major developing countries like china and india .
in canberra on tuesday , mr blair said : " i think the fact that you 've got these initiatives at the moment , all tending in the same direction , is actually a positive sign , it 's not a negative one .
" britain is not going to be the country whose future determines the future of the planet and the climate .
" it 's going to be about china , india and america , as well as of course the europeans , and japan and other countries like australia .
" it is a completely unrealistic debate to say that you can have a climate-change agreement that does n't involve china , and then america obviously , and then india , which is also a country of a billion people growing at a fast rate . "
agreement ?
at a climate change conference in montreal , canada , in december , a broad group of countries including the us agreed to non-binding talks on long-term climate measures .
at a press conference alongside australian prime minister john howard , mr blair said : " we 're going to have to see what is the framework that is going to incentivise business and industry and countries to develop the science and technology to allow us to grow in a clean way . "
he added : " will it be possible to get an agreement on such a framework ?
i do n't think you can tell at the moment .
do we need one , in my view ?
ultimately , yes , we are going to need a framework . "
mr blair later travelled to auckland , new zealand .
the last official visit from a british prime minister was made by john major in 1995 for a commonwealth heads of government meeting .
mr blair is due to hold discussions on wednesday with prime minister helen clark , including looking at setting up annual talks on security issues .

the company reported a pre-tax loss of £ 4.6m -lrb- $ 8m -rrb- in 2005 after a profit of £ 6.9m in 2004 .
ottakar 's was the subject of a takeover bid from waterstone 's owner hmv last year , which valued the firm at £ 96.4m.
however , the bid is currently under investigation by the competition commission , after complaints to the office of fair trading about a merger .
' difficult year ' ottakar 's said " unprecedented price competition " from rivals had come at the same time as " intense corporate activity " , with a management buy-out plan trumped by the higher offer from hmv .
" the distraction of the corporate activity and the slowdown in second half sales have combined to make 2005 a difficult year for ottakar 's , " said chairman philip dunne .
the firm said the reaction to the hmv bid , which included concern from independent book shops , had " visibly demonstrated the high esteem " in which the company was held .
those against the move have argued that a merged hmv and ottakar 's would be too strong , something hmv denies .

they said there could be a public " furore " if a high-profile sex offender could have been caught earlier had police been able to keep samples .
the warning came from the association of chief police officers in scotland -lrb- acpos -rrb- to the justice committee .
the dna of people arrested and released is retained in england and wales .
at present , dna samples taken when people have been arrested in scotland are destroyed if the person is not charged or convicted .
the holyrood committee will scrutinise the public order and criminal justice bill on tuesday .
individuals who would commit crimes of a sexual nature rarely come into police custody william rae acpos secretary labour msp paul martin has tabled an amendment to the bill which would enable the police to retain the samples .
in a written submission to the committee , acpos secretary william rae supported the move .
" individuals who would commit crimes of a sexual nature rarely come into police custody and opportunities to record their fingerprints and dna are limited , " he said .
" given recent high profile cases on the investigation of sexual offences , this could present a potentially explosive reaction were it realised that a serial sex offender could have been identified at an earlier stage of an investigation , had the evidential samples been retained from previous contact with police on unrelated matters .
" the fact that such samples would have been retained were the offences to have occurred in england and wales would undoubtedly add to the considerable furore which would likely occur . "
human rights mr rae said the " ineffectiveness " of existing legislation was shown by a case in easter ross .
he said that swabs taken at the scene of two housebreakings matched records held by north yorkshire police .
" the individual from whom this sample had been taken had subsequently been acquitted and the dna record retained in error , " he said .
" consequently , there being no other evidence to link the suspect with the crimes , the investigation could not be progressed . "
the law in england and wales has been challenged on human rights grounds .
however , mr rae said the house of lords had upheld the practice on several grounds , one of which was that the public gain was " vastly more important than the marginal individual loss of rights " .
