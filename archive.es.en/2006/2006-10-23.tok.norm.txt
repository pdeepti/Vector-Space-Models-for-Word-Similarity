" we are not dealing with nato matters , we are dealing with european defense , " said conference chairman reimar scherz , a retired brigadier general .
" for us it is very important to have a status report on where we are and where we 're going . " " the decisions are taken in brussels as far as european defense and security policies are concerned … and we have installed a european armament agency . " the western alliance nato is the number one security force in europe , but the european union is building its own defense force to strengthen its own defense capabilities and deal in crisis situations where nato is not engaged . the ultimate goal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl von wogau wants an efficient eu army the eu 's ultimate aim , according to the 1999 helsinki agreement and the 2004 headline goal is to create by 2010 a european military force of 50 to 60 thousand soldiers who can be deployed within 60 days and sustained in the field for at least one year . " european member states spend annually 170 billion euros -lrb- 215 billion -rrb- on defense , " said congress president karl von wogau , who is also chairman of the subcommittee on security and defence of the european parliament . " that 's a small amount , some 40 percent of what the americans spend .
but the americans are saying : you give out 40 percent , but your efficiency is at 10 percent .
which means we lose efficiency by often doing the same thing 25 times , " he said . the eu currently has 6,000 troops stationed in bosnia herzegovina and 2,000 in the democratic republic of congo .
a mission in macedonia was also recently completed . getting battle groups ready bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is increasingly taking on military roles in the world one of the eu priorities in defense matters is to make sure that its planned mobile battle groups are properly equipped and ready to report for duty early next year . " we have made decisions as far eu battle groups are concerned , " scherz said .
" there will be 13 battle groups early next year ...
1,500 soldiers each , and germany is participating in four battle groups .
those decisions have been taken , but the question is how these decisions will be implemented . " the battle groups will be similar to nato 's rapid reaction force , but will be under eu command .
the battle groups will be created in response to a crisis and only stay for the duration of that crisis .
it will be up to the member states themselves to decide whether , when and how to contribute troops . eu member states are yet to settle command issues and agree on how the troops will be transported . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : north korean nuclear test is " unacceptable " the european union has strongly condemned north korea 's nuclear test as " unacceptable .

it must " remain in the german sphere " , the government spokesman ulrich wilhem said recently . german finance minister peer steinbrück defended the idea of a possible state stake in the european aerospace giant eads , in an interview to be published monday . " this is about stabilizing an enterprise , about keeping the jobs of qualified workers and especially about being up to the level of our french partners , " steinbrück said , referring to the delicate french-german balance within eads . his remarks came in response to a question by germany 's suddeutsche zeitung newspaper about whether eads ' problems would continue to grow without state intervention . the minister said no decision had been made about a german public stake in the company , a matter that has sparked speculation in recent days .
" there are possible solutions which are completely defensible from an interventionist point of view , " steinbrueck said . " nobody in the government wants to suddenly transform the federal state into a business , " steinbrück was quoted as saying in the suddeutsche zeitung .
" but we can not let airbus go into bankruptcy simply because society is undergoing an adaptation crisis or because a manufacturer wants to cede its share . " the current balance of power with eads is extremely delicate . germany 's interests are represented by daimlerchrysler 's 22.5-percent stake , while france is represented via a 30-percent interest shared by the state holding company sogeade and media group lagardere . spanish interests are represented by the holding group sepi , which owns 5.48 percent . lagardere has committed itself to halving its stake to put french interests back on a par with germany 's , but the balance of power would be upset if daimlerchrysler were to reduce its stake .

but eads warned it might go to the debt markets next year in order to raise additional financing . group finance director hans-peter ring said that eads " will manage pro-actively its financial requirements and might go to the capital markets in 2007 , " possibly by issuing hybrid bonds . but the company , which has announced delays of up to 24 months in deliveries of the ambitious super-jumbo jet a380 , " has neither the need nor the short-term intention " of making a capital increase , ring insisted . despite eads ' insistence that it finances are very solid , such comments raised the specter of potential financing bottlenecks further down the line .
and that could explain the government 's chronic prevarication as to how best safeguard german interests in the company . after all , if the german state does acquire a stake in the company , it will be compelled to put up a large chunk of the financing should a capital increase ever become necessary . what will daimler do ? the crunch of the matter lies with german-us auto maker daimlerchrysler , which holds a stake of 22.5 percent in eads but has signaled its intention to reduce that stake to 15 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an a380 superjumbo - the source of many problems berlin is adamant that the 7.5-percent stake being put for sale should remain in german hands and must not be allowed to fall into french or even russian hands .
it must " remain in the german sphere " , the government spokesman ulrich wilhem said recently . german finance minister peer steinbrück defended the idea of a possible state stake in the european aerospace giant eads , in an interview to be published monday . " this is about stabilizing an enterprise , about keeping the jobs of qualified workers and especially about being up to the level of our french partners , " steinbrück said , referring to the delicate french-german balance within eads . his remarks came in response to a question by germany 's suddeutsche zeitung newspaper about whether eads ' problems would continue to grow without state intervention . the minister said no decision had been made about a german public stake in the company , a matter that has sparked speculation in recent days .
" there are possible solutions which are completely defensible from an interventionist point of view , " steinbrueck said . " nobody in the government wants to suddenly transform the federal state into a business , " steinbrück was quoted as saying in the suddeutsche zeitung .
" but we can not let airbus go into bankruptcy simply because society is undergoing an adaptation crisis or because a manufacturer wants to cede its share . " the current balance of power with eads is extremely delicate . germany 's interests are represented by daimlerchrysler 's 22.5-percent stake , while france is represented via a 30-percent interest shared by the state holding company sogeade and media group lagardere . spanish interests are represented by the holding group sepi , which owns 5.48 percent . lagardere has committed itself to halving its stake to put french interests back on a par with germany 's , but the balance of power would be upset if daimlerchrysler were to reduce its stake .
in september , russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank bought 5.02 percent and moscow has signaled its intention of increasing its say in the company , a development that would be welcomed by eads german co-chief executive , thomas enders . enders said in a newspaper interview published on monday that he welcomed the acquisition of a stake in the european aerospace giant by the russian state .
" the entry of the russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank into eads share capital underlines the huge interest of russian investors " in the european aeronautic defence and space company , enders told the daily die welt .
" cooperation with the russian aerospace industry is of strategic importance for us .
russia is not only an important market , but it has a great deal of experience in the development and construction of aircraft , " enders said . calls for and against state involvement daimlerchrysler chief dieter zetsche is opposed to the idea of the german state acquiring the shares . " fundamentally , an increase in state influence is not desirable for the group , " he told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . there is also opposition within eads to the idea of state involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus plant in hamburg enders said in an interview published in the wall street journal that such a solution would mark a " return to the stone age . " but there are plenty of people in germany , not least a number of top-ranking politicians , who argue that is the government 's patriotic duty to get its hands on the shares . the group 's plane maker airbus employs 22,000 people at seven different sites around the country .
the northern port of hamburg is home to airbus ' biggest german site . the government " has a crucial political responsibility " in the matter , the chief whip of the social democrat spd party , peter struck , insisted . a number of politicians have said the government should acquire the stake via the state-owned redevelopment bank kfw . hamburg mayor ole von beust caused a stir last week when he said that a corresponding deal had been reached .
but chancellor angela merkel swiftly qualified that statement , insisting that no decision had been made yet . but she added : " i 'm not ruling anything out " . economy minister michael glos insists that a future investor in eads should come from the private sector .
newspapers have suggested that a group of suppliers to airbus or even a consortium of banks could take daimlerchrysler 's stake . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus parent company considers selling factories the european aerospace group eads would consider selling some airbus factories provided that new owners could reduce operating costs , eads co-chairman manfred bischoff said on friday .

" it is an alarm signal , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will these managers-in-training stick around ?
the country 's federal statistical office said there were 145,000 people who moved abroad in 2005 - about the number of people who live in a small city like potsdam near berlin .
it is the highest number since they began compiling that statistic , in 1954 , an fso spokesperson said . braun : structural problems to blame the most alarming aspect of the news is that more than half of the emigrants are younger than 35 . the main reason for the " brain drain " are the favorable conditions for wage earners in other countries , braun told die welt .
compared with other european countries , germany has high taxes and social security payments , a tight job market , and deficient education and training . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader kurt beck calls for calm in the debate " germany must absolutely deal with its structural problems .

" when german firms expand across the globe , they also send their workers overseas , " he told the press .
" in a free society , it is normal to move overseas . "
in the end , what is important is that approximately equal numbers of people leave the country and come into the country , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should open up to more qualified workers from abroad , some say for his part , spd education and training expert jörg tauss said businesses are to blame for the high numbers of germans who leave and never come back . " an economy that ca n't offer jobs to qualified people - which simply offers them unpaid internships month after month , and has no concept of how to lure people back to open positions in germany - has no right to complain over the consequences of its own policies , " he told afp . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german scientists go abroad to pursue stem cell research german laws regarding embryonic stem cells are among the most restrictive in the world .
that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited .

he went out in style . in 15 years of formula one , he had demonstrated over and again a fearsome competitive instinct and an unbeatable will to win .
the statistics that piled up to praise his work were colossal - seven world titles , five with ferrari , 68 pole positions and 91 victories . michael schumacher , however , was left struggling for words on sunday as his career came to a dramatic end at the brazilian grand prix . " today , my racing career comes to an end and , obviously it 's a special moment for me and i am proud to have lived my career with some fantastic people - namely everyone who is a part of the ferrari family , " said the german star . " there is so much to say - i ca n't find the right words .
the things i will miss are probably the fans and in every moment they have been behind me and always supported me . " " their support helped me perform , especially in moments when it was difficult .
over the years that was immensely important .

" his words referred to the fact that his first race and his last were hit by problems that wrecked his hopes of victory .
but his actions on the track in his ferrari spoke volumes for his talent , speed , courage and determination as he stormed from the back of the field , after a puncture , to finish fourth . a dramatic race " the race was chaotic , i think that 's the right word , " he said , as rival and second-time champion fernando alonso began his celebrations , having finished second behind his ferrari team-mate felipe massa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher , right , with renault 's fernando alonso , from spain " we really had a superb car today from the pure speed we could have lapped everybody .

" it 's great for him to be the first brazilian to win at interlagos since ayrton senna .

some were warm and loving , some were barbed and tinged with envy and some reflected a failure to understand that formula one was bringing down the curtain on the greatest and most complete driver ever to have raced in a grand prix . schumacher said his best memory was his title win in 2000 . " we had a lot of hard work and setbacks so when we finally won it , it was the most beautiful championship , " said schumacher . he added he did have regrets .

he went out in style . in 15 years of formula one , he had demonstrated over and again a fearsome competitive instinct and an unbeatable will to win .
the statistics that piled up to praise his work were colossal - seven world titles , five with ferrari , 68 pole positions and 91 victories . michael schumacher , however , was left struggling for words on sunday as his career came to a dramatic end at the brazilian grand prix . " today , my racing career comes to an end and , obviously it 's a special moment for me and i am proud to have lived my career with some fantastic people - namely everyone who is a part of the ferrari family , " said the german star . " there is so much to say - i ca n't find the right words .
the things i will miss are probably the fans and in every moment they have been behind me and always supported me . " " their support helped me perform , especially in moments when it was difficult .
over the years that was immensely important .
i can only say thank you to those people and those fans , " schumacher said . no last victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitiveness was schumacher 's default mode in motor racing the seven-time world champion finished his career with one of his most stirring drives to come home in fourth place , cruelly just off the podium .
but he still managed to find a metaphor that brought symmetry to his 15 years of sustained and extraordinary racing . " in a way , it 's a closed circle now for me , because my formula one career started and finished after 500 meters which was , maybe , a symbol of what happened yesterday . " his words referred to the fact that his first race and his last were hit by problems that wrecked his hopes of victory .

a truce seems unlikely with the cabinet set to approve parts of a highly controversial health bill this week . the mass demonstrations organized by germany 's powerful trade unions this weekend saw an estimated 200,000 people take to the streets in protest of the grand coalition 's social and economic policies . in big cities across the country , workers ' representatives vented their anger over what they felt was a lop-sided reform process that was hurting the poor and sparing the affluent .
the mass rallies provoked angry reactions especially by senior conservative members of the ruling coalition of social and christian democrats . they claimed the unions had no right to take to the streets , as they had not made a single reasonable alternative proposal for reforms .
markus söder from the conservative christian social union , the christian democratic union 's bavarian sister party , was one of those who didn ’ t mince his words . conservatives brand unions as obstructive " we 'd have expected the trade unions to be jubilant in the face of a considerable drop in unemployment in the first year of the grand coalition 's work , " he said .

" be it the siemens electronics giant , the allianz insurance group or similar companies - they 've all forgotten how to act in a socially responsible way , and we 're not willing to accept that .

a truce seems unlikely with the cabinet set to approve parts of a highly controversial health bill this week . the mass demonstrations organized by germany 's powerful trade unions this weekend saw an estimated 200,000 people take to the streets in protest of the grand coalition 's social and economic policies . in big cities across the country , workers ' representatives vented their anger over what they felt was a lop-sided reform process that was hurting the poor and sparing the affluent .
the mass rallies provoked angry reactions especially by senior conservative members of the ruling coalition of social and christian democrats . they claimed the unions had no right to take to the streets , as they had not made a single reasonable alternative proposal for reforms .
markus söder from the conservative christian social union , the christian democratic union 's bavarian sister party , was one of those who didn ’ t mince his words . conservatives brand unions as obstructive " we 'd have expected the trade unions to be jubilant in the face of a considerable drop in unemployment in the first year of the grand coalition 's work , " he said .
" but all we hear from them is a constant moaning and groaning .

but sommer rejects the accusations saying it 's not the trade unions that stand in the way of the country 's development . government not socially responsible , says union chief " a real risk for the country ’ s development are those companies which are doing well and are pocketing huge profits , but decide to lay off workers at the same time , " sommer said .
" be it the siemens electronics giant , the allianz insurance group or similar companies - they 've all forgotten how to act in a socially responsible way , and we 're not willing to accept that . " and as far as ex-chancellor gerhard schröder 's criticism is concerned - yes , we were against his agenda 2010 reform package because of the inherent social injustices .

" it is an alarm signal , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will these managers-in-training stick around ?
the country 's federal statistical office said there were 145,000 people who moved abroad in 2005 - about the number of people who live in a small city like potsdam near berlin .
it is the highest number since they began compiling that statistic , in 1954 , an fso spokesperson said . braun : structural problems to blame the most alarming aspect of the news is that more than half of the emigrants are younger than 35 . the main reason for the " brain drain " are the favorable conditions for wage earners in other countries , braun told die welt .
compared with other european countries , germany has high taxes and social security payments , a tight job market , and deficient education and training . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader kurt beck calls for calm in the debate " germany must absolutely deal with its structural problems .
it must become an attractive location for qualified and trained workers , " he said .
in addition , he added , the german job market needs to open up for well-trained foreign workers . beck calls for calm kurt beck , head of the social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the warning by the chamber of commerce was " rather excessive , " and called for calm in the debate . " when german firms expand across the globe , they also send their workers overseas , " he told the press .
" in a free society , it is normal to move overseas . "
in the end , what is important is that approximately equal numbers of people leave the country and come into the country , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should open up to more qualified workers from abroad , some say for his part , spd education and training expert jörg tauss said businesses are to blame for the high numbers of germans who leave and never come back . " an economy that ca n't offer jobs to qualified people - which simply offers them unpaid internships month after month , and has no concept of how to lure people back to open positions in germany - has no right to complain over the consequences of its own policies , " he told afp . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german scientists go abroad to pursue stem cell research german laws regarding embryonic stem cells are among the most restrictive in the world .
that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited .
-lrb- 11.07.2006 -rrb- german emigration hits highest level in 55 years germans are moving abroad in record numbers .
according to the latest migration statistics , around 145,000 germans left home for greener pastures last year , the highest tally since 1950 .
-lrb- 07.07.2006 -rrb- eu must change its immigration policy , experts warn rather than building the walls around " fortress europe " higher , as many eu politicians favor , migration experts say the eu needs a new progressive policy on immigration - for its own good .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 23.10.2006 bavarian conservatives inch towards acceptance of gays großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the csu appears a little more tolerant of gay bavarians these days the majority party of bavaria , the christian social union , has for the first time recognized that some gay relationships have value , although equating them with traditional marriage remains out of the question . the recognition , which is seen by some as a long-overdue wake-up to reality and by others as a danger to the traditional family , comes in the form of a draft policy statement released by the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- on monday . in the eight-page section on family policy , the party in power for decades in largely catholic , widely conservative bavaria rejects the idea of giving same-sex partnerships the same legal foundation as a marriage between a man and a women , or allowing gay and lesbian couples to adopt children .
but it does say the party " acknowledges -lrb- same-sex relationships -rrb- , when people in these partnerships can rely on each other to take responsibility and care for one another . " at a press conference on monday in munich , where the policy position was presented , the head of the policy committee , alois glück , said the csu wanted its new position regarding gay relationships to reflect today 's reality . " the message is , the csu has a realistic and contemporary view on the family , but one which is also values oriented , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's capital munich is pretty gay friendly - the hinterlands less so the position is a nuanced once , which attempts to acknowledge that gay relationships do exist , and that they can have worth , but still firmly putting itself on the side of a traditional view of the family : mother , father and children . " we want to show that we respect the values which are lived in these partnerships , " said deputy party chief beate merk in an interview on bavarian radio , referring to same-sex couples .
" but we want to be clear , that only extends to a certain point . " in the last such policy position statement by the csu , from 1993 , gays and lesbians were not mentioned . the csu and gays some might question the significance of these cautious , almost guarded statements on the issue in a country where same-sex partnerships can be legally recognized .
but it marks the first time the conservative csu has addressed the topic in anything but fairly negative terms . franz josef strauss , long-time , respected csu premier of the state of bavaria who was often referred to as the " strong man of europe , " famously told die zeit newspaper in 1971 that he 'd rather be a " cold warrior than a warm brother . "
-lrb- the latter expression is a pejorative expression for a gay man . -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber has always stressed tradition the csu 's current head , edmund stoiber , once refused to talk about " these partnerships , " saying if he did , he might as well start worshipping the devil . " he probably would n't talk like that that today , but the csu has traditionally had , shall we say , a problematic attitude , " said hellmuth pusch , head of the bavarian section of the lesbian and gay association of germany .
" now we see that some rethinking is taking place . " still , he and other gay groups do not feel like the party has gone as far as it should .
while the new positioning is a slight change , pusch says bavaria and csu are still far behind the rest of germany when it comes to accepting homosexuality .
bavaria was one of the german federal states that went to germany 's highest court to try to block the law allowing registered same-sex partnerships and it is still one of the only states not to allow those partnerships to be registered at the registry office like heterosexual marriages , but requires couples to go to a notary . " but this is a beginning , " he said .
" the csu is are on the right path and we welcome that . " voters on their minds ? while some in the csu might feel its time to jettison , or at least revisit , some traditionalist viewpoints , others see political motives behind the party 's decision .
the left-wing taz daily , known for its clever headlines , entitled its story on the new policy " csu hot for gay voters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a same-sex couple at a registry office in hannover while that might be an exaggeration , it is a fact that the csu is finding its decades-long dominance of bavarian politics slipping a little .
it still got 62 percent of the vote in the last election , but the larger cities in bavaria such as munich , nuremberg and augsburg , are all governed by the spd . " in general , a party which formulates policies that do n't reflect life 's realities will lose more and more voters , " said axel hochrein , head of the bavarian branch of the lsu , a group representing gays and lesbians in the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the csu . warning call the csu 's tentative warming up to gays and lesbians does not sit well with everyone in the party .
a group of eight csu parliamentarians has released a statement warning that the party should not " weaken " its position of privileging traditional marriage .
according to the statement , children need a " father and mother in their different gender roles . " four of the eight lawmakers expressing these conservative sentiments were born in or after 1970 . " in the csu , you ca n't judge by the age of politicians , but you have to look at what area they come from , rural or urban , " said hochrein .
while members from the big bavarian cities advocate for more acceptance , those from rural regions have much different ideas . " in the countryside , which is very catholic and where the church has an enormous influence , even a single mother is still sometimes seen as scandalous , " he said .
" that is the balancing act the party has to deal with . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german gay marriage law marks fifth anniversary five years ago , the bride-and-groom grouping lost its monopoly on the church aisle or the top of the wedding cake .

but it does say the party " acknowledges -lrb- same-sex relationships -rrb- , when people in these partnerships can rely on each other to take responsibility and care for one another . " at a press conference on monday in munich , where the policy position was presented , the head of the policy committee , alois glück , said the csu wanted its new position regarding gay relationships to reflect today 's reality . " the message is , the csu has a realistic and contemporary view on the family , but one which is also values oriented , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's capital munich is pretty gay friendly - the hinterlands less so the position is a nuanced once , which attempts to acknowledge that gay relationships do exist , and that they can have worth , but still firmly putting itself on the side of a traditional view of the family : mother , father and children .

" but we want to be clear , that only extends to a certain point .

while the new positioning is a slight change , pusch says bavaria and csu are still far behind the rest of germany when it comes to accepting homosexuality .
bavaria was one of the german federal states that went to germany 's highest court to try to block the law allowing registered same-sex partnerships and it is still one of the only states not to allow those partnerships to be registered at the registry office like heterosexual marriages , but requires couples to go to a notary . " but this is a beginning , " he said .

a group of eight csu parliamentarians has released a statement warning that the party should not " weaken " its position of privileging traditional marriage .
according to the statement , children need a " father and mother in their different gender roles . " four of the eight lawmakers expressing these conservative sentiments were born in or after 1970 . " in the csu , you ca n't judge by the age of politicians , but you have to look at what area they come from , rural or urban , " said hochrein .
while members from the big bavarian cities advocate for more acceptance , those from rural regions have much different ideas . " in the countryside , which is very catholic and where the church has an enormous influence , even a single mother is still sometimes seen as scandalous , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 23.10.2006 bavarian conservatives inch towards acceptance of gays großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the csu appears a little more tolerant of gay bavarians these days the majority party of bavaria , the christian social union , has for the first time recognized that some gay relationships have value , although equating them with traditional marriage remains out of the question . the recognition , which is seen by some as a long-overdue wake-up to reality and by others as a danger to the traditional family , comes in the form of a draft policy statement released by the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- on monday . in the eight-page section on family policy , the party in power for decades in largely catholic , widely conservative bavaria rejects the idea of giving same-sex partnerships the same legal foundation as a marriage between a man and a women , or allowing gay and lesbian couples to adopt children .
but it does say the party " acknowledges -lrb- same-sex relationships -rrb- , when people in these partnerships can rely on each other to take responsibility and care for one another . " at a press conference on monday in munich , where the policy position was presented , the head of the policy committee , alois glück , said the csu wanted its new position regarding gay relationships to reflect today 's reality . " the message is , the csu has a realistic and contemporary view on the family , but one which is also values oriented , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's capital munich is pretty gay friendly - the hinterlands less so the position is a nuanced once , which attempts to acknowledge that gay relationships do exist , and that they can have worth , but still firmly putting itself on the side of a traditional view of the family : mother , father and children . " we want to show that we respect the values which are lived in these partnerships , " said deputy party chief beate merk in an interview on bavarian radio , referring to same-sex couples .
" but we want to be clear , that only extends to a certain point . " in the last such policy position statement by the csu , from 1993 , gays and lesbians were not mentioned . the csu and gays some might question the significance of these cautious , almost guarded statements on the issue in a country where same-sex partnerships can be legally recognized .
but it marks the first time the conservative csu has addressed the topic in anything but fairly negative terms . franz josef strauss , long-time , respected csu premier of the state of bavaria who was often referred to as the " strong man of europe , " famously told die zeit newspaper in 1971 that he 'd rather be a " cold warrior than a warm brother . "
-lrb- the latter expression is a pejorative expression for a gay man . -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber has always stressed tradition the csu 's current head , edmund stoiber , once refused to talk about " these partnerships , " saying if he did , he might as well start worshipping the devil . " he probably would n't talk like that that today , but the csu has traditionally had , shall we say , a problematic attitude , " said hellmuth pusch , head of the bavarian section of the lesbian and gay association of germany .
" now we see that some rethinking is taking place . " still , he and other gay groups do not feel like the party has gone as far as it should .
while the new positioning is a slight change , pusch says bavaria and csu are still far behind the rest of germany when it comes to accepting homosexuality .

gps navigation systems are beginning to get a bad rep in germany .
that 's probably because germans are actually too good at following instructions .
even when they are told to crash into a toilet shack . if car navigation systems could have their rathers , they would probably all want to be working in germany .
not only because the german autobahn is a speed-racer dream come true , but because germans are very good at following instructions .
if the system tells them to turn right , they turn right .
if it tells them to turn left , they turn left . and although one or two germans will find themselves asking philosophical questions about what it means to turn right or left at any point in their life , most will happily oblige and surrender to that bizarrely infantilizing feeling we all know from looking at the assembling instructions for an ikea cupboard .
it 's called total dependency . it is nice , from time to time , to surrender one 's control .
to feel there is a gentle digitalized voice to guide you through the winding , curving , meandering roads of life .
to know that you can will a virtual pat on the shoulder every time you do something right .
navigation systems are low-maintenance life companions : they never get tired and they do n't need anything for christmas . taking things literally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no toilet booth is safe any more a 53-year-old german driver recently took the command " turn right now ! " from his navigation system all too literally .
30 meters before the crossing he was meant to take , the excessively obedient driver from freiburg drove his suv off the road into a nearby construction site , drove it up a stairway and crashed it into a poor , unsuspecting toilet shack that had never seen this type of action before . police in the eastern german town of rudolstadt said the incident had caused 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,500 -rrb- in damages to the stairway , 100 euros to the car and that the driver was also fined accordingly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 23.10.2006 " divine guidance has no place in western politics " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder writes he 's uneasy about the role of religion in bush 's political decisions gerhard schröder is publishing his memoirs this week and many dw readers agreed with the former german chancellor 's criticism of us president bush 's religious approach to politics . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i agree completely with mr. schröder 's comments .
mr. bush 's professed dependence on " divine guidance " has no place in western politics , let alone in the politics of a country whose constitution expressly denotes a separation between church and state . - mike cohen , new mexico , usa mr. schröder has finally put into words what many think but are afraid to say out loud .
bravo gert ! - liliane chaglassian i totally agree with schröder 's thoughts on bush and religion in the us .
it would be good if there were a serious discussion in this country about the separation - or rather , non-separation - of church and state ! - gabrielle callison if anyone believes that political decisions can be made devoid of personal beliefs they are delusional , or a liar .
if bush 's decisions are biased by overtly christian beliefs this is no worse than being overtly humanist , capitalist , rationalist or islamic . - simon i think schröder hit the nail right on the head with bush 's religiosity and managed to say it in a matter of fact way without being unkind . - detlef karthaus 1 -rrb- schröder is right on the money , 2 -rrb- i could not say it better about us politics and religion . - michael ruso it is not unusual for politicians to use their memoirs to rationalize their tenure .
it 's generally not expected to be a truthful account , given the hard knocks of normal politics .
but in the case of former german chancellor gerhardt schröder , it is just more of the same .
sad to say , mr. schröeder was far and away the most irresponsible and self-indulgent chancellor in recent german history .
today mr. schröder claims he was not anti-american , but during his tenure he used constant anti-american rhetoric to raise his poll numbers .
that is what made mr. schröeder such a disaster from abroad .
we can take criticism in stride , but this was political demagogy performed for the most cynical purposes .
for those germans who dislike america - and dislike is fine , this is not a matter of love - mr. schröder still lied to them about the economy .
and he failed utterly to deal with the universally understood weaknesses of the german economy , the rigidity of the labor market , high taxation , and all the rest .
mr. schröder has apparently not changed a single idea since he was an immature radical .
he is simply stuck in the past .
schröder 's gazprom job put the icing on the cake as far as international observers of germany are concerned .
it looked very bad after political concessions made to russia under mr. schröeder 's rule .
the former chancellor should have been far , far more sensitive to the appearance of a quid pro quo . - bernard baars compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in book , schröder describes worries about bush 's religiosity ahead of the release of his memoirs , gerhard schröder says george bush left a positive impression on him , but the us leader 's constant references to god troubled him .
schröder had few kind words for his own successor .
-lrb- 22.10.2006 -rrb- gerhard schröder takes a blow over gazprom germany 's opposition fdp party has threatened to demand a parliamentary inquiry into the so-called " pipeline affair " involving the former government of gerhard schröder and russian gas group gazprom .
-lrb- 03.04.2006 -rrb- bundestag debates ex-chancellor schröder 's ethics the german parliament pondered the ethical implications associated with former chancellor gerhard schröder 's decision to take a top position on a russian-german energy project so quickly after leaving office .

even the chief executive 's job could be on the line . out of a full time workforce of 167,000 employed worldwide by the bonn-based telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , 74,000 employees are superfluous , according to the sunday newspaper , frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , which cited an internal company report circulated by the management board . the internal memo made perfectly clear that the cost to consumers of subscribing to deutsche telekom 's telephone and internet services is significantly higher than that of its competitors . competitors charge much less its t-com fixed line and t-online internet subsidiaries charge 71 euros monthly for flatrate connections or double that of a low-cost , no-name competitor , called 2play net.fon , for example .
other better known competitors , such as aol and arcor , which also offer high-speed dsl connections well below telekom 's rates , charge 55 euros and 50 euros for the same package , respectively . one reason cited for higher prices that are passed on to consumers , are inefficient structures and duplication of services that reduce productivity and lead to bloated costs .
several german newspapers had reported over the weekend that in addition to 32,000 positions to be eliminated by 2008 , an additional 23,000 jobs would be cut by 2010 . additional job cuts can not be ruled out ulrich lissek , chief spokesman for telekom could not confirm the figures , but told reporters that the conglomerate " has always said that in the face of regulatory and technological changes , we can not rule out the elimination of additional jobs after 2008 . " meanwhile telekom has been losing domestic clients for its fixed line services , while its t-mobile cell phone unit is growing mainly because of its us activities .
the additional job cuts at deutsche telekom do not come as a surprise since the former state-owned monopoly , which was privatised in 1995 , has been cutting more than 10,000 jobs a year in the last decade in order to raise its profitability and competitiveness . furthermore , telekom chief kai-uwe ricke has repeatedly said that moves to cut more jobs would not necessarily cease in 2008 . telekom chief under heavy pressure even ricke 's own job could be on the line .
directors at telekom are apparently mulling the future of their boss , whose contract expires in 2007 .
the decision to renew ricke 's contract or replace him is expected to be made in december .
since a profits warning was issued this august , ricke has been under considerable pressure , as the number of fixed line subscribers has dropped and growth in the wireless sector has slowed down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom chief 's contract expires next year one name that has been bandied about to replace ricke , is ben verwaayen , the chief executive of british telecom , although the german government , which holds more than 30 percent of telekom directly and indirectly through the state-owned bank kfw , could favour an internal candidate according to the financial times . political fallout from job cuts the government 's key consideration is to minimise the political fallout from job cutbacks in the fixed line business .
ricke had deferred to such political concerns last year when he reduced his demand for job cuts by half from 60,000 down to 30,000 . the worker 's union verdi claims that new internet technologies will require fewer personnel , so that ricke 's talk of " streamlining operations " is irrelevant anyway . deutsche telekom is not the only major german company slashing jobs on a massive scale .

even the chief executive 's job could be on the line . out of a full time workforce of 167,000 employed worldwide by the bonn-based telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , 74,000 employees are superfluous , according to the sunday newspaper , frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , which cited an internal company report circulated by the management board . the internal memo made perfectly clear that the cost to consumers of subscribing to deutsche telekom 's telephone and internet services is significantly higher than that of its competitors . competitors charge much less its t-com fixed line and t-online internet subsidiaries charge 71 euros monthly for flatrate connections or double that of a low-cost , no-name competitor , called 2play net.fon , for example .
other better known competitors , such as aol and arcor , which also offer high-speed dsl connections well below telekom 's rates , charge 55 euros and 50 euros for the same package , respectively . one reason cited for higher prices that are passed on to consumers , are inefficient structures and duplication of services that reduce productivity and lead to bloated costs .
several german newspapers had reported over the weekend that in addition to 32,000 positions to be eliminated by 2008 , an additional 23,000 jobs would be cut by 2010 . additional job cuts can not be ruled out ulrich lissek , chief spokesman for telekom could not confirm the figures , but told reporters that the conglomerate " has always said that in the face of regulatory and technological changes , we can not rule out the elimination of additional jobs after 2008 . " meanwhile telekom has been losing domestic clients for its fixed line services , while its t-mobile cell phone unit is growing mainly because of its us activities .
the additional job cuts at deutsche telekom do not come as a surprise since the former state-owned monopoly , which was privatised in 1995 , has been cutting more than 10,000 jobs a year in the last decade in order to raise its profitability and competitiveness . furthermore , telekom chief kai-uwe ricke has repeatedly said that moves to cut more jobs would not necessarily cease in 2008 . telekom chief under heavy pressure even ricke 's own job could be on the line .
directors at telekom are apparently mulling the future of their boss , whose contract expires in 2007 .
the decision to renew ricke 's contract or replace him is expected to be made in december .
since a profits warning was issued this august , ricke has been under considerable pressure , as the number of fixed line subscribers has dropped and growth in the wireless sector has slowed down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom chief 's contract expires next year one name that has been bandied about to replace ricke , is ben verwaayen , the chief executive of british telecom , although the german government , which holds more than 30 percent of telekom directly and indirectly through the state-owned bank kfw , could favour an internal candidate according to the financial times . political fallout from job cuts the government 's key consideration is to minimise the political fallout from job cutbacks in the fixed line business .
ricke had deferred to such political concerns last year when he reduced his demand for job cuts by half from 60,000 down to 30,000 . the worker 's union verdi claims that new internet technologies will require fewer personnel , so that ricke 's talk of " streamlining operations " is irrelevant anyway . deutsche telekom is not the only major german company slashing jobs on a massive scale .
in the pharmaceutical sector , bayer 's recent takeover of schering will result in the elimination of 6,000 positions , the insolvency of benq mobile , the wireless manufacturer , has put 3,000 jobs on the line , while automobile giant volkswagen plans to cut 20,000 jobs by 2009 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's t-mobile wins licenses in the united states german telecommunications giant t-mobile is geared to expand its presence on the us market .

gps navigation systems are beginning to get a bad rep in germany .
that 's probably because germans are actually too good at following instructions .
even when they are told to crash into a toilet shack . if car navigation systems could have their rathers , they would probably all want to be working in germany .
not only because the german autobahn is a speed-racer dream come true , but because germans are very good at following instructions .
if the system tells them to turn right , they turn right .
if it tells them to turn left , they turn left . and although one or two germans will find themselves asking philosophical questions about what it means to turn right or left at any point in their life , most will happily oblige and surrender to that bizarrely infantilizing feeling we all know from looking at the assembling instructions for an ikea cupboard .
it 's called total dependency . it is nice , from time to time , to surrender one 's control .
to feel there is a gentle digitalized voice to guide you through the winding , curving , meandering roads of life .
to know that you can will a virtual pat on the shoulder every time you do something right .
navigation systems are low-maintenance life companions : they never get tired and they do n't need anything for christmas . taking things literally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no toilet booth is safe any more a 53-year-old german driver recently took the command " turn right now ! " from his navigation system all too literally .
30 meters before the crossing he was meant to take , the excessively obedient driver from freiburg drove his suv off the road into a nearby construction site , drove it up a stairway and crashed it into a poor , unsuspecting toilet shack that had never seen this type of action before . police in the eastern german town of rudolstadt said the incident had caused 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,500 -rrb- in damages to the stairway , 100 euros to the car and that the driver was also fined accordingly .
the ongoing fine for extreme obedience is 35 euros . earlier this month another german ignored the sign " closed for construction " on a hamburg highway and followed his navigation system into a pile of sand .
no injuries were reported . a navigation system is , it seems , the new dominatrix : virtual whip in hand , it tells you what to do .

" it is an alarm signal , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will these managers-in-training stick around ?
the country 's federal statistical office said there were 145,000 people who moved abroad in 2005 - about the number of people who live in a small city like potsdam near berlin .
it is the highest number since they began compiling that statistic , in 1954 , an fso spokesperson said . braun : structural problems to blame the most alarming aspect of the news is that more than half of the emigrants are younger than 35 . the main reason for the " brain drain " are the favorable conditions for wage earners in other countries , braun told die welt .

" when german firms expand across the globe , they also send their workers overseas , " he told the press .
" in a free society , it is normal to move overseas . "
in the end , what is important is that approximately equal numbers of people leave the country and come into the country , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should open up to more qualified workers from abroad , some say for his part , spd education and training expert jörg tauss said businesses are to blame for the high numbers of germans who leave and never come back . " an economy that ca n't offer jobs to qualified people - which simply offers them unpaid internships month after month , and has no concept of how to lure people back to open positions in germany - has no right to complain over the consequences of its own policies , " he told afp . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german scientists go abroad to pursue stem cell research german laws regarding embryonic stem cells are among the most restrictive in the world .

but eads warned it might go to the debt markets next year in order to raise additional financing . group finance director hans-peter ring said that eads " will manage pro-actively its financial requirements and might go to the capital markets in 2007 , " possibly by issuing hybrid bonds . but the company , which has announced delays of up to 24 months in deliveries of the ambitious super-jumbo jet a380 , " has neither the need nor the short-term intention " of making a capital increase , ring insisted . despite eads ' insistence that it finances are very solid , such comments raised the specter of potential financing bottlenecks further down the line .
and that could explain the government 's chronic prevarication as to how best safeguard german interests in the company . after all , if the german state does acquire a stake in the company , it will be compelled to put up a large chunk of the financing should a capital increase ever become necessary . what will daimler do ? the crunch of the matter lies with german-us auto maker daimlerchrysler , which holds a stake of 22.5 percent in eads but has signaled its intention to reduce that stake to 15 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an a380 superjumbo - the source of many problems berlin is adamant that the 7.5-percent stake being put for sale should remain in german hands and must not be allowed to fall into french or even russian hands .
it must " remain in the german sphere " , the government spokesman ulrich wilhem said recently . german finance minister peer steinbrück defended the idea of a possible state stake in the european aerospace giant eads , in an interview to be published monday . " this is about stabilizing an enterprise , about keeping the jobs of qualified workers and especially about being up to the level of our french partners , " steinbrück said , referring to the delicate french-german balance within eads . his remarks came in response to a question by germany 's suddeutsche zeitung newspaper about whether eads ' problems would continue to grow without state intervention . the minister said no decision had been made about a german public stake in the company , a matter that has sparked speculation in recent days .
" there are possible solutions which are completely defensible from an interventionist point of view , " steinbrueck said . " nobody in the government wants to suddenly transform the federal state into a business , " steinbrück was quoted as saying in the suddeutsche zeitung .
" but we can not let airbus go into bankruptcy simply because society is undergoing an adaptation crisis or because a manufacturer wants to cede its share . " the current balance of power with eads is extremely delicate . germany 's interests are represented by daimlerchrysler 's 22.5-percent stake , while france is represented via a 30-percent interest shared by the state holding company sogeade and media group lagardere . spanish interests are represented by the holding group sepi , which owns 5.48 percent . lagardere has committed itself to halving its stake to put french interests back on a par with germany 's , but the balance of power would be upset if daimlerchrysler were to reduce its stake .
in september , russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank bought 5.02 percent and moscow has signaled its intention of increasing its say in the company , a development that would be welcomed by eads german co-chief executive , thomas enders . enders said in a newspaper interview published on monday that he welcomed the acquisition of a stake in the european aerospace giant by the russian state .
" the entry of the russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank into eads share capital underlines the huge interest of russian investors " in the european aeronautic defence and space company , enders told the daily die welt .
" cooperation with the russian aerospace industry is of strategic importance for us .
russia is not only an important market , but it has a great deal of experience in the development and construction of aircraft , " enders said . calls for and against state involvement daimlerchrysler chief dieter zetsche is opposed to the idea of the german state acquiring the shares . " fundamentally , an increase in state influence is not desirable for the group , " he told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . there is also opposition within eads to the idea of state involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus plant in hamburg enders said in an interview published in the wall street journal that such a solution would mark a " return to the stone age . " but there are plenty of people in germany , not least a number of top-ranking politicians , who argue that is the government 's patriotic duty to get its hands on the shares . the group 's plane maker airbus employs 22,000 people at seven different sites around the country .
the northern port of hamburg is home to airbus ' biggest german site . the government " has a crucial political responsibility " in the matter , the chief whip of the social democrat spd party , peter struck , insisted . a number of politicians have said the government should acquire the stake via the state-owned redevelopment bank kfw . hamburg mayor ole von beust caused a stir last week when he said that a corresponding deal had been reached .
but chancellor angela merkel swiftly qualified that statement , insisting that no decision had been made yet . but she added : " i 'm not ruling anything out " . economy minister michael glos insists that a future investor in eads should come from the private sector .
newspapers have suggested that a group of suppliers to airbus or even a consortium of banks could take daimlerchrysler 's stake . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus parent company considers selling factories the european aerospace group eads would consider selling some airbus factories provided that new owners could reduce operating costs , eads co-chairman manfred bischoff said on friday .

but it does say the party " acknowledges -lrb- same-sex relationships -rrb- , when people in these partnerships can rely on each other to take responsibility and care for one another . " at a press conference on monday in munich , where the policy position was presented , the head of the policy committee , alois glück , said the csu wanted its new position regarding gay relationships to reflect today 's reality . " the message is , the csu has a realistic and contemporary view on the family , but one which is also values oriented , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's capital munich is pretty gay friendly - the hinterlands less so the position is a nuanced once , which attempts to acknowledge that gay relationships do exist , and that they can have worth , but still firmly putting itself on the side of a traditional view of the family : mother , father and children . " we want to show that we respect the values which are lived in these partnerships , " said deputy party chief beate merk in an interview on bavarian radio , referring to same-sex couples .
" but we want to be clear , that only extends to a certain point . " in the last such policy position statement by the csu , from 1993 , gays and lesbians were not mentioned . the csu and gays some might question the significance of these cautious , almost guarded statements on the issue in a country where same-sex partnerships can be legally recognized .
but it marks the first time the conservative csu has addressed the topic in anything but fairly negative terms . franz josef strauss , long-time , respected csu premier of the state of bavaria who was often referred to as the " strong man of europe , " famously told die zeit newspaper in 1971 that he 'd rather be a " cold warrior than a warm brother . "
-lrb- the latter expression is a pejorative expression for a gay man . -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber has always stressed tradition the csu 's current head , edmund stoiber , once refused to talk about " these partnerships , " saying if he did , he might as well start worshipping the devil . " he probably would n't talk like that that today , but the csu has traditionally had , shall we say , a problematic attitude , " said hellmuth pusch , head of the bavarian section of the lesbian and gay association of germany .
" now we see that some rethinking is taking place . " still , he and other gay groups do not feel like the party has gone as far as it should .
while the new positioning is a slight change , pusch says bavaria and csu are still far behind the rest of germany when it comes to accepting homosexuality .
bavaria was one of the german federal states that went to germany 's highest court to try to block the law allowing registered same-sex partnerships and it is still one of the only states not to allow those partnerships to be registered at the registry office like heterosexual marriages , but requires couples to go to a notary . " but this is a beginning , " he said .
" the csu is are on the right path and we welcome that . " voters on their minds ? while some in the csu might feel its time to jettison , or at least revisit , some traditionalist viewpoints , others see political motives behind the party 's decision .
the left-wing taz daily , known for its clever headlines , entitled its story on the new policy " csu hot for gay voters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a same-sex couple at a registry office in hannover while that might be an exaggeration , it is a fact that the csu is finding its decades-long dominance of bavarian politics slipping a little .
it still got 62 percent of the vote in the last election , but the larger cities in bavaria such as munich , nuremberg and augsburg , are all governed by the spd . " in general , a party which formulates policies that do n't reflect life 's realities will lose more and more voters , " said axel hochrein , head of the bavarian branch of the lsu , a group representing gays and lesbians in the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the csu . warning call the csu 's tentative warming up to gays and lesbians does not sit well with everyone in the party .
a group of eight csu parliamentarians has released a statement warning that the party should not " weaken " its position of privileging traditional marriage .
according to the statement , children need a " father and mother in their different gender roles . " four of the eight lawmakers expressing these conservative sentiments were born in or after 1970 . " in the csu , you ca n't judge by the age of politicians , but you have to look at what area they come from , rural or urban , " said hochrein .
while members from the big bavarian cities advocate for more acceptance , those from rural regions have much different ideas . " in the countryside , which is very catholic and where the church has an enormous influence , even a single mother is still sometimes seen as scandalous , " he said .
" that is the balancing act the party has to deal with .

he went out in style . in 15 years of formula one , he had demonstrated over and again a fearsome competitive instinct and an unbeatable will to win .
the statistics that piled up to praise his work were colossal - seven world titles , five with ferrari , 68 pole positions and 91 victories . michael schumacher , however , was left struggling for words on sunday as his career came to a dramatic end at the brazilian grand prix . " today , my racing career comes to an end and , obviously it 's a special moment for me and i am proud to have lived my career with some fantastic people - namely everyone who is a part of the ferrari family , " said the german star . " there is so much to say - i ca n't find the right words .
the things i will miss are probably the fans and in every moment they have been behind me and always supported me . " " their support helped me perform , especially in moments when it was difficult .
over the years that was immensely important .
i can only say thank you to those people and those fans , " schumacher said . no last victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitiveness was schumacher 's default mode in motor racing the seven-time world champion finished his career with one of his most stirring drives to come home in fourth place , cruelly just off the podium .
but he still managed to find a metaphor that brought symmetry to his 15 years of sustained and extraordinary racing . " in a way , it 's a closed circle now for me , because my formula one career started and finished after 500 meters which was , maybe , a symbol of what happened yesterday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.10.2006 deutsche telekom may axe more than 70,000 jobs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is one of germany 's largest employers in order to remain competitive , deutsche telekom needs to reduce costs and increase productivity by eliminating tens of thousands of jobs in the next few years .

even the chief executive 's job could be on the line . out of a full time workforce of 167,000 employed worldwide by the bonn-based telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , 74,000 employees are superfluous , according to the sunday newspaper , frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , which cited an internal company report circulated by the management board . the internal memo made perfectly clear that the cost to consumers of subscribing to deutsche telekom 's telephone and internet services is significantly higher than that of its competitors . competitors charge much less its t-com fixed line and t-online internet subsidiaries charge 71 euros monthly for flatrate connections or double that of a low-cost , no-name competitor , called 2play net.fon , for example .
other better known competitors , such as aol and arcor , which also offer high-speed dsl connections well below telekom 's rates , charge 55 euros and 50 euros for the same package , respectively . one reason cited for higher prices that are passed on to consumers , are inefficient structures and duplication of services that reduce productivity and lead to bloated costs .
several german newspapers had reported over the weekend that in addition to 32,000 positions to be eliminated by 2008 , an additional 23,000 jobs would be cut by 2010 . additional job cuts can not be ruled out ulrich lissek , chief spokesman for telekom could not confirm the figures , but told reporters that the conglomerate " has always said that in the face of regulatory and technological changes , we can not rule out the elimination of additional jobs after 2008 . " meanwhile telekom has been losing domestic clients for its fixed line services , while its t-mobile cell phone unit is growing mainly because of its us activities .
the additional job cuts at deutsche telekom do not come as a surprise since the former state-owned monopoly , which was privatised in 1995 , has been cutting more than 10,000 jobs a year in the last decade in order to raise its profitability and competitiveness . furthermore , telekom chief kai-uwe ricke has repeatedly said that moves to cut more jobs would not necessarily cease in 2008 . telekom chief under heavy pressure even ricke 's own job could be on the line .
directors at telekom are apparently mulling the future of their boss , whose contract expires in 2007 .
the decision to renew ricke 's contract or replace him is expected to be made in december .
since a profits warning was issued this august , ricke has been under considerable pressure , as the number of fixed line subscribers has dropped and growth in the wireless sector has slowed down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom chief 's contract expires next year one name that has been bandied about to replace ricke , is ben verwaayen , the chief executive of british telecom , although the german government , which holds more than 30 percent of telekom directly and indirectly through the state-owned bank kfw , could favour an internal candidate according to the financial times . political fallout from job cuts the government 's key consideration is to minimise the political fallout from job cutbacks in the fixed line business .
ricke had deferred to such political concerns last year when he reduced his demand for job cuts by half from 60,000 down to 30,000 . the worker 's union verdi claims that new internet technologies will require fewer personnel , so that ricke 's talk of " streamlining operations " is irrelevant anyway . deutsche telekom is not the only major german company slashing jobs on a massive scale .
in the pharmaceutical sector , bayer 's recent takeover of schering will result in the elimination of 6,000 positions , the insolvency of benq mobile , the wireless manufacturer , has put 3,000 jobs on the line , while automobile giant volkswagen plans to cut 20,000 jobs by 2009 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's t-mobile wins licenses in the united states german telecommunications giant t-mobile is geared to expand its presence on the us market .

gps navigation systems are beginning to get a bad rep in germany .
that 's probably because germans are actually too good at following instructions .
even when they are told to crash into a toilet shack . if car navigation systems could have their rathers , they would probably all want to be working in germany .
not only because the german autobahn is a speed-racer dream come true , but because germans are very good at following instructions .
if the system tells them to turn right , they turn right .
if it tells them to turn left , they turn left . and although one or two germans will find themselves asking philosophical questions about what it means to turn right or left at any point in their life , most will happily oblige and surrender to that bizarrely infantilizing feeling we all know from looking at the assembling instructions for an ikea cupboard .
it 's called total dependency . it is nice , from time to time , to surrender one 's control .
to feel there is a gentle digitalized voice to guide you through the winding , curving , meandering roads of life .
to know that you can will a virtual pat on the shoulder every time you do something right .
navigation systems are low-maintenance life companions : they never get tired and they do n't need anything for christmas . taking things literally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no toilet booth is safe any more a 53-year-old german driver recently took the command " turn right now ! " from his navigation system all too literally .
30 meters before the crossing he was meant to take , the excessively obedient driver from freiburg drove his suv off the road into a nearby construction site , drove it up a stairway and crashed it into a poor , unsuspecting toilet shack that had never seen this type of action before . police in the eastern german town of rudolstadt said the incident had caused 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,500 -rrb- in damages to the stairway , 100 euros to the car and that the driver was also fined accordingly .
the ongoing fine for extreme obedience is 35 euros . earlier this month another german ignored the sign " closed for construction " on a hamburg highway and followed his navigation system into a pile of sand .
no injuries were reported . a navigation system is , it seems , the new dominatrix : virtual whip in hand , it tells you what to do .
it is up to you to decide how much pain you 're willing to take on . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flushed with german pride when american gis in iraq get the call of nature , they politely ask to be excused and tiptoe off to the ladies ' room .

they are not always able to practice their religion freely , " he said , particularly noting the strict security measures necessary at religious gatherings .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i agree completely with mr. schröder 's comments .
mr. bush 's professed dependence on " divine guidance " has no place in western politics , let alone in the politics of a country whose constitution expressly denotes a separation between church and state . - mike cohen , new mexico , usa mr. schröder has finally put into words what many think but are afraid to say out loud .
bravo gert ! - liliane chaglassian i totally agree with schröder 's thoughts on bush and religion in the us .
it would be good if there were a serious discussion in this country about the separation - or rather , non-separation - of church and state ! - gabrielle callison if anyone believes that political decisions can be made devoid of personal beliefs they are delusional , or a liar .
if bush 's decisions are biased by overtly christian beliefs this is no worse than being overtly humanist , capitalist , rationalist or islamic . - simon i think schröder hit the nail right on the head with bush 's religiosity and managed to say it in a matter of fact way without being unkind . - detlef karthaus 1 -rrb- schröder is right on the money , 2 -rrb- i could not say it better about us politics and religion . - michael ruso it is not unusual for politicians to use their memoirs to rationalize their tenure .
it 's generally not expected to be a truthful account , given the hard knocks of normal politics .
but in the case of former german chancellor gerhardt schröder , it is just more of the same .
sad to say , mr. schröeder was far and away the most irresponsible and self-indulgent chancellor in recent german history .
today mr. schröder claims he was not anti-american , but during his tenure he used constant anti-american rhetoric to raise his poll numbers .
that is what made mr. schröeder such a disaster from abroad .
we can take criticism in stride , but this was political demagogy performed for the most cynical purposes .
for those germans who dislike america - and dislike is fine , this is not a matter of love - mr. schröder still lied to them about the economy .
and he failed utterly to deal with the universally understood weaknesses of the german economy , the rigidity of the labor market , high taxation , and all the rest .
mr. schröder has apparently not changed a single idea since he was an immature radical .
he is simply stuck in the past .
schröder 's gazprom job put the icing on the cake as far as international observers of germany are concerned .
it looked very bad after political concessions made to russia under mr. schröeder 's rule .
the former chancellor should have been far , far more sensitive to the appearance of a quid pro quo . - bernard baars compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in book , schröder describes worries about bush 's religiosity ahead of the release of his memoirs , gerhard schröder says george bush left a positive impression on him , but the us leader 's constant references to god troubled him .

sad to say , mr. schröeder was far and away the most irresponsible and self-indulgent chancellor in recent german history .
today mr. schröder claims he was not anti-american , but during his tenure he used constant anti-american rhetoric to raise his poll numbers .
that is what made mr. schröeder such a disaster from abroad .
we can take criticism in stride , but this was political demagogy performed for the most cynical purposes .
for those germans who dislike america - and dislike is fine , this is not a matter of love - mr. schröder still lied to them about the economy .
and he failed utterly to deal with the universally understood weaknesses of the german economy , the rigidity of the labor market , high taxation , and all the rest .
mr. schröder has apparently not changed a single idea since he was an immature radical .
he is simply stuck in the past .
schröder 's gazprom job put the icing on the cake as far as international observers of germany are concerned .
it looked very bad after political concessions made to russia under mr. schröeder 's rule .

gps navigation systems are beginning to get a bad rep in germany .
that 's probably because germans are actually too good at following instructions .
even when they are told to crash into a toilet shack . if car navigation systems could have their rathers , they would probably all want to be working in germany .
not only because the german autobahn is a speed-racer dream come true , but because germans are very good at following instructions .
if the system tells them to turn right , they turn right .
if it tells them to turn left , they turn left . and although one or two germans will find themselves asking philosophical questions about what it means to turn right or left at any point in their life , most will happily oblige and surrender to that bizarrely infantilizing feeling we all know from looking at the assembling instructions for an ikea cupboard .
it 's called total dependency . it is nice , from time to time , to surrender one 's control .
to feel there is a gentle digitalized voice to guide you through the winding , curving , meandering roads of life .
to know that you can will a virtual pat on the shoulder every time you do something right .
navigation systems are low-maintenance life companions : they never get tired and they do n't need anything for christmas . taking things literally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no toilet booth is safe any more a 53-year-old german driver recently took the command " turn right now ! " from his navigation system all too literally .
30 meters before the crossing he was meant to take , the excessively obedient driver from freiburg drove his suv off the road into a nearby construction site , drove it up a stairway and crashed it into a poor , unsuspecting toilet shack that had never seen this type of action before . police in the eastern german town of rudolstadt said the incident had caused 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,500 -rrb- in damages to the stairway , 100 euros to the car and that the driver was also fined accordingly .
the ongoing fine for extreme obedience is 35 euros . earlier this month another german ignored the sign " closed for construction " on a hamburg highway and followed his navigation system into a pile of sand .
no injuries were reported . a navigation system is , it seems , the new dominatrix : virtual whip in hand , it tells you what to do .
it is up to you to decide how much pain you 're willing to take on . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flushed with german pride when american gis in iraq get the call of nature , they politely ask to be excused and tiptoe off to the ladies ' room .

but eads warned it might go to the debt markets next year in order to raise additional financing . group finance director hans-peter ring said that eads " will manage pro-actively its financial requirements and might go to the capital markets in 2007 , " possibly by issuing hybrid bonds . but the company , which has announced delays of up to 24 months in deliveries of the ambitious super-jumbo jet a380 , " has neither the need nor the short-term intention " of making a capital increase , ring insisted . despite eads ' insistence that it finances are very solid , such comments raised the specter of potential financing bottlenecks further down the line .
and that could explain the government 's chronic prevarication as to how best safeguard german interests in the company . after all , if the german state does acquire a stake in the company , it will be compelled to put up a large chunk of the financing should a capital increase ever become necessary . what will daimler do ? the crunch of the matter lies with german-us auto maker daimlerchrysler , which holds a stake of 22.5 percent in eads but has signaled its intention to reduce that stake to 15 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an a380 superjumbo - the source of many problems berlin is adamant that the 7.5-percent stake being put for sale should remain in german hands and must not be allowed to fall into french or even russian hands .
it must " remain in the german sphere " , the government spokesman ulrich wilhem said recently . german finance minister peer steinbrück defended the idea of a possible state stake in the european aerospace giant eads , in an interview to be published monday . " this is about stabilizing an enterprise , about keeping the jobs of qualified workers and especially about being up to the level of our french partners , " steinbrück said , referring to the delicate french-german balance within eads . his remarks came in response to a question by germany 's suddeutsche zeitung newspaper about whether eads ' problems would continue to grow without state intervention . the minister said no decision had been made about a german public stake in the company , a matter that has sparked speculation in recent days .
" there are possible solutions which are completely defensible from an interventionist point of view , " steinbrueck said . " nobody in the government wants to suddenly transform the federal state into a business , " steinbrück was quoted as saying in the suddeutsche zeitung .
" but we can not let airbus go into bankruptcy simply because society is undergoing an adaptation crisis or because a manufacturer wants to cede its share . " the current balance of power with eads is extremely delicate . germany 's interests are represented by daimlerchrysler 's 22.5-percent stake , while france is represented via a 30-percent interest shared by the state holding company sogeade and media group lagardere . spanish interests are represented by the holding group sepi , which owns 5.48 percent . lagardere has committed itself to halving its stake to put french interests back on a par with germany 's , but the balance of power would be upset if daimlerchrysler were to reduce its stake .

a truce seems unlikely with the cabinet set to approve parts of a highly controversial health bill this week . the mass demonstrations organized by germany 's powerful trade unions this weekend saw an estimated 200,000 people take to the streets in protest of the grand coalition 's social and economic policies . in big cities across the country , workers ' representatives vented their anger over what they felt was a lop-sided reform process that was hurting the poor and sparing the affluent .
the mass rallies provoked angry reactions especially by senior conservative members of the ruling coalition of social and christian democrats . they claimed the unions had no right to take to the streets , as they had not made a single reasonable alternative proposal for reforms .
markus söder from the conservative christian social union , the christian democratic union 's bavarian sister party , was one of those who didn ’ t mince his words . conservatives brand unions as obstructive " we 'd have expected the trade unions to be jubilant in the face of a considerable drop in unemployment in the first year of the grand coalition 's work , " he said .
" but all we hear from them is a constant moaning and groaning .
i believe that the unions ' leadership is arch-conservative and that we can not move the country forward together with them .
in my view the unions for us are no longer a serious partner at the negotiating table . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sommer refuted claims that the unions were at fault michael sommer , head of the german confederation of trade unions , dismissed söder 's remarks as appalling and totally unfounded .
but even prominent members of the social democrat party , which traditionally has a working class electorate , said the trade unions are being obstructive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is accused of abandoning the people former chancellor gerhard schröder revealed in his autobiography this week that the trade unions had no small share in making him give up his post in 2005 .
but sommer rejects the accusations saying it 's not the trade unions that stand in the way of the country 's development . government not socially responsible , says union chief " a real risk for the country ’ s development are those companies which are doing well and are pocketing huge profits , but decide to lay off workers at the same time , " sommer said .
" be it the siemens electronics giant , the allianz insurance group or similar companies - they 've all forgotten how to act in a socially responsible way , and we 're not willing to accept that . " and as far as ex-chancellor gerhard schröder 's criticism is concerned - yes , we were against his agenda 2010 reform package because of the inherent social injustices .
but he can not really hold it against us that his party lost in elections . " slow reforms feeding brain drain meanwhile , the head of the german chambers of industry and commerce , ludwig georg braun , has warned that the slow reform process in the country was making more and more people turn their backs on germany and seek employment opportunities elsewhere . according to a recent survey , about 154,000 germans left the country in 2005 alone - the highest number recorded in over 50 years .
braun indicated that more than half of the emigrants were under 35 years of age , many of unable to find low-skill employment in germany and argued that germany needed an improved education policy and a drastic reduction in taxes and social fees to keep these people in the country . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de battling plummeting popularity , merkel vows reform drive german chancellor angela merkel plans to reverse her coalition government 's sinking popularity ratings with a renewed stab at controversial reforms .

a truce seems unlikely with the cabinet set to approve parts of a highly controversial health bill this week . the mass demonstrations organized by germany 's powerful trade unions this weekend saw an estimated 200,000 people take to the streets in protest of the grand coalition 's social and economic policies . in big cities across the country , workers ' representatives vented their anger over what they felt was a lop-sided reform process that was hurting the poor and sparing the affluent .
the mass rallies provoked angry reactions especially by senior conservative members of the ruling coalition of social and christian democrats . they claimed the unions had no right to take to the streets , as they had not made a single reasonable alternative proposal for reforms .
markus söder from the conservative christian social union , the christian democratic union 's bavarian sister party , was one of those who didn ’ t mince his words . conservatives brand unions as obstructive " we 'd have expected the trade unions to be jubilant in the face of a considerable drop in unemployment in the first year of the grand coalition 's work , " he said .
" but all we hear from them is a constant moaning and groaning .
i believe that the unions ' leadership is arch-conservative and that we can not move the country forward together with them .
in my view the unions for us are no longer a serious partner at the negotiating table . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sommer refuted claims that the unions were at fault michael sommer , head of the german confederation of trade unions , dismissed söder 's remarks as appalling and totally unfounded .
but even prominent members of the social democrat party , which traditionally has a working class electorate , said the trade unions are being obstructive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is accused of abandoning the people former chancellor gerhard schröder revealed in his autobiography this week that the trade unions had no small share in making him give up his post in 2005 .
but sommer rejects the accusations saying it 's not the trade unions that stand in the way of the country 's development . government not socially responsible , says union chief " a real risk for the country ’ s development are those companies which are doing well and are pocketing huge profits , but decide to lay off workers at the same time , " sommer said .
" be it the siemens electronics giant , the allianz insurance group or similar companies - they 've all forgotten how to act in a socially responsible way , and we 're not willing to accept that . " and as far as ex-chancellor gerhard schröder 's criticism is concerned - yes , we were against his agenda 2010 reform package because of the inherent social injustices .
but he can not really hold it against us that his party lost in elections . " slow reforms feeding brain drain meanwhile , the head of the german chambers of industry and commerce , ludwig georg braun , has warned that the slow reform process in the country was making more and more people turn their backs on germany and seek employment opportunities elsewhere . according to a recent survey , about 154,000 germans left the country in 2005 alone - the highest number recorded in over 50 years .
braun indicated that more than half of the emigrants were under 35 years of age , many of unable to find low-skill employment in germany and argued that germany needed an improved education policy and a drastic reduction in taxes and social fees to keep these people in the country . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de battling plummeting popularity , merkel vows reform drive german chancellor angela merkel plans to reverse her coalition government 's sinking popularity ratings with a renewed stab at controversial reforms .

but eads warned it might go to the debt markets next year in order to raise additional financing . group finance director hans-peter ring said that eads " will manage pro-actively its financial requirements and might go to the capital markets in 2007 , " possibly by issuing hybrid bonds . but the company , which has announced delays of up to 24 months in deliveries of the ambitious super-jumbo jet a380 , " has neither the need nor the short-term intention " of making a capital increase , ring insisted . despite eads ' insistence that it finances are very solid , such comments raised the specter of potential financing bottlenecks further down the line .
and that could explain the government 's chronic prevarication as to how best safeguard german interests in the company . after all , if the german state does acquire a stake in the company , it will be compelled to put up a large chunk of the financing should a capital increase ever become necessary . what will daimler do ? the crunch of the matter lies with german-us auto maker daimlerchrysler , which holds a stake of 22.5 percent in eads but has signaled its intention to reduce that stake to 15 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an a380 superjumbo - the source of many problems berlin is adamant that the 7.5-percent stake being put for sale should remain in german hands and must not be allowed to fall into french or even russian hands .
it must " remain in the german sphere " , the government spokesman ulrich wilhem said recently . german finance minister peer steinbrück defended the idea of a possible state stake in the european aerospace giant eads , in an interview to be published monday . " this is about stabilizing an enterprise , about keeping the jobs of qualified workers and especially about being up to the level of our french partners , " steinbrück said , referring to the delicate french-german balance within eads . his remarks came in response to a question by germany 's suddeutsche zeitung newspaper about whether eads ' problems would continue to grow without state intervention . the minister said no decision had been made about a german public stake in the company , a matter that has sparked speculation in recent days .
" there are possible solutions which are completely defensible from an interventionist point of view , " steinbrueck said . " nobody in the government wants to suddenly transform the federal state into a business , " steinbrück was quoted as saying in the suddeutsche zeitung .
" but we can not let airbus go into bankruptcy simply because society is undergoing an adaptation crisis or because a manufacturer wants to cede its share . " the current balance of power with eads is extremely delicate . germany 's interests are represented by daimlerchrysler 's 22.5-percent stake , while france is represented via a 30-percent interest shared by the state holding company sogeade and media group lagardere . spanish interests are represented by the holding group sepi , which owns 5.48 percent . lagardere has committed itself to halving its stake to put french interests back on a par with germany 's , but the balance of power would be upset if daimlerchrysler were to reduce its stake .
in september , russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank bought 5.02 percent and moscow has signaled its intention of increasing its say in the company , a development that would be welcomed by eads german co-chief executive , thomas enders . enders said in a newspaper interview published on monday that he welcomed the acquisition of a stake in the european aerospace giant by the russian state .
" the entry of the russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank into eads share capital underlines the huge interest of russian investors " in the european aeronautic defence and space company , enders told the daily die welt .
" cooperation with the russian aerospace industry is of strategic importance for us .
russia is not only an important market , but it has a great deal of experience in the development and construction of aircraft , " enders said . calls for and against state involvement daimlerchrysler chief dieter zetsche is opposed to the idea of the german state acquiring the shares . " fundamentally , an increase in state influence is not desirable for the group , " he told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . there is also opposition within eads to the idea of state involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus plant in hamburg enders said in an interview published in the wall street journal that such a solution would mark a " return to the stone age . " but there are plenty of people in germany , not least a number of top-ranking politicians , who argue that is the government 's patriotic duty to get its hands on the shares . the group 's plane maker airbus employs 22,000 people at seven different sites around the country .
the northern port of hamburg is home to airbus ' biggest german site . the government " has a crucial political responsibility " in the matter , the chief whip of the social democrat spd party , peter struck , insisted . a number of politicians have said the government should acquire the stake via the state-owned redevelopment bank kfw . hamburg mayor ole von beust caused a stir last week when he said that a corresponding deal had been reached .
but chancellor angela merkel swiftly qualified that statement , insisting that no decision had been made yet . but she added : " i 'm not ruling anything out " . economy minister michael glos insists that a future investor in eads should come from the private sector .
newspapers have suggested that a group of suppliers to airbus or even a consortium of banks could take daimlerchrysler 's stake . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus parent company considers selling factories the european aerospace group eads would consider selling some airbus factories provided that new owners could reduce operating costs , eads co-chairman manfred bischoff said on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the airbus saga : turbulence on the ground and in the air russia , eads cozy up with new airbus deals germans call for parity in airbus restructuring program mass strikes across europe hit airbus factories airbus decision on a350 looms amid us-eu trade dispute aerospace -pipe- 23.10.2006 germany undecided on role in eads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany mulls its next step in the airbus crisis as russian investors circle in the minefield of national egos at the heart of eads , the german government seems undecided about how best to shore up its interests without being left to foot the bill if the aerospace giant 's finances deteriorate . the european aeronautic defence and space company insisted friday that it currently had enough cash to cope with the huge problems facing its crisis-ridden airplane maker airbus .
but eads warned it might go to the debt markets next year in order to raise additional financing . group finance director hans-peter ring said that eads " will manage pro-actively its financial requirements and might go to the capital markets in 2007 , " possibly by issuing hybrid bonds . but the company , which has announced delays of up to 24 months in deliveries of the ambitious super-jumbo jet a380 , " has neither the need nor the short-term intention " of making a capital increase , ring insisted . despite eads ' insistence that it finances are very solid , such comments raised the specter of potential financing bottlenecks further down the line .
and that could explain the government 's chronic prevarication as to how best safeguard german interests in the company . after all , if the german state does acquire a stake in the company , it will be compelled to put up a large chunk of the financing should a capital increase ever become necessary . what will daimler do ? the crunch of the matter lies with german-us auto maker daimlerchrysler , which holds a stake of 22.5 percent in eads but has signaled its intention to reduce that stake to 15 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an a380 superjumbo - the source of many problems berlin is adamant that the 7.5-percent stake being put for sale should remain in german hands and must not be allowed to fall into french or even russian hands .
it must " remain in the german sphere " , the government spokesman ulrich wilhem said recently . german finance minister peer steinbrück defended the idea of a possible state stake in the european aerospace giant eads , in an interview to be published monday . " this is about stabilizing an enterprise , about keeping the jobs of qualified workers and especially about being up to the level of our french partners , " steinbrück said , referring to the delicate french-german balance within eads . his remarks came in response to a question by germany 's suddeutsche zeitung newspaper about whether eads ' problems would continue to grow without state intervention . the minister said no decision had been made about a german public stake in the company , a matter that has sparked speculation in recent days .
" there are possible solutions which are completely defensible from an interventionist point of view , " steinbrueck said . " nobody in the government wants to suddenly transform the federal state into a business , " steinbrück was quoted as saying in the suddeutsche zeitung .
" but we can not let airbus go into bankruptcy simply because society is undergoing an adaptation crisis or because a manufacturer wants to cede its share . " the current balance of power with eads is extremely delicate . germany 's interests are represented by daimlerchrysler 's 22.5-percent stake , while france is represented via a 30-percent interest shared by the state holding company sogeade and media group lagardere . spanish interests are represented by the holding group sepi , which owns 5.48 percent . lagardere has committed itself to halving its stake to put french interests back on a par with germany 's , but the balance of power would be upset if daimlerchrysler were to reduce its stake .
in september , russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank bought 5.02 percent and moscow has signaled its intention of increasing its say in the company , a development that would be welcomed by eads german co-chief executive , thomas enders . enders said in a newspaper interview published on monday that he welcomed the acquisition of a stake in the european aerospace giant by the russian state .
" the entry of the russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank into eads share capital underlines the huge interest of russian investors " in the european aeronautic defence and space company , enders told the daily die welt .
" cooperation with the russian aerospace industry is of strategic importance for us .
russia is not only an important market , but it has a great deal of experience in the development and construction of aircraft , " enders said . calls for and against state involvement daimlerchrysler chief dieter zetsche is opposed to the idea of the german state acquiring the shares . " fundamentally , an increase in state influence is not desirable for the group , " he told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . there is also opposition within eads to the idea of state involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus plant in hamburg enders said in an interview published in the wall street journal that such a solution would mark a " return to the stone age . " but there are plenty of people in germany , not least a number of top-ranking politicians , who argue that is the government 's patriotic duty to get its hands on the shares . the group 's plane maker airbus employs 22,000 people at seven different sites around the country .
the northern port of hamburg is home to airbus ' biggest german site . the government " has a crucial political responsibility " in the matter , the chief whip of the social democrat spd party , peter struck , insisted . a number of politicians have said the government should acquire the stake via the state-owned redevelopment bank kfw . hamburg mayor ole von beust caused a stir last week when he said that a corresponding deal had been reached .
but chancellor angela merkel swiftly qualified that statement , insisting that no decision had been made yet . but she added : " i 'm not ruling anything out " . economy minister michael glos insists that a future investor in eads should come from the private sector .
newspapers have suggested that a group of suppliers to airbus or even a consortium of banks could take daimlerchrysler 's stake . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus parent company considers selling factories the european aerospace group eads would consider selling some airbus factories provided that new owners could reduce operating costs , eads co-chairman manfred bischoff said on friday .

even the chief executive 's job could be on the line . out of a full time workforce of 167,000 employed worldwide by the bonn-based telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , 74,000 employees are superfluous , according to the sunday newspaper , frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , which cited an internal company report circulated by the management board . the internal memo made perfectly clear that the cost to consumers of subscribing to deutsche telekom 's telephone and internet services is significantly higher than that of its competitors . competitors charge much less its t-com fixed line and t-online internet subsidiaries charge 71 euros monthly for flatrate connections or double that of a low-cost , no-name competitor , called 2play net.fon , for example .
other better known competitors , such as aol and arcor , which also offer high-speed dsl connections well below telekom 's rates , charge 55 euros and 50 euros for the same package , respectively . one reason cited for higher prices that are passed on to consumers , are inefficient structures and duplication of services that reduce productivity and lead to bloated costs .
several german newspapers had reported over the weekend that in addition to 32,000 positions to be eliminated by 2008 , an additional 23,000 jobs would be cut by 2010 . additional job cuts can not be ruled out ulrich lissek , chief spokesman for telekom could not confirm the figures , but told reporters that the conglomerate " has always said that in the face of regulatory and technological changes , we can not rule out the elimination of additional jobs after 2008 . " meanwhile telekom has been losing domestic clients for its fixed line services , while its t-mobile cell phone unit is growing mainly because of its us activities .
the additional job cuts at deutsche telekom do not come as a surprise since the former state-owned monopoly , which was privatised in 1995 , has been cutting more than 10,000 jobs a year in the last decade in order to raise its profitability and competitiveness . furthermore , telekom chief kai-uwe ricke has repeatedly said that moves to cut more jobs would not necessarily cease in 2008 . telekom chief under heavy pressure even ricke 's own job could be on the line .
directors at telekom are apparently mulling the future of their boss , whose contract expires in 2007 .
the decision to renew ricke 's contract or replace him is expected to be made in december .
since a profits warning was issued this august , ricke has been under considerable pressure , as the number of fixed line subscribers has dropped and growth in the wireless sector has slowed down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom chief 's contract expires next year one name that has been bandied about to replace ricke , is ben verwaayen , the chief executive of british telecom , although the german government , which holds more than 30 percent of telekom directly and indirectly through the state-owned bank kfw , could favour an internal candidate according to the financial times . political fallout from job cuts the government 's key consideration is to minimise the political fallout from job cutbacks in the fixed line business .
ricke had deferred to such political concerns last year when he reduced his demand for job cuts by half from 60,000 down to 30,000 . the worker 's union verdi claims that new internet technologies will require fewer personnel , so that ricke 's talk of " streamlining operations " is irrelevant anyway . deutsche telekom is not the only major german company slashing jobs on a massive scale .
in the pharmaceutical sector , bayer 's recent takeover of schering will result in the elimination of 6,000 positions , the insolvency of benq mobile , the wireless manufacturer , has put 3,000 jobs on the line , while automobile giant volkswagen plans to cut 20,000 jobs by 2009 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's t-mobile wins licenses in the united states german telecommunications giant t-mobile is geared to expand its presence on the us market .

gps navigation systems are beginning to get a bad rep in germany .
that 's probably because germans are actually too good at following instructions .
even when they are told to crash into a toilet shack . if car navigation systems could have their rathers , they would probably all want to be working in germany .
not only because the german autobahn is a speed-racer dream come true , but because germans are very good at following instructions .
if the system tells them to turn right , they turn right .
if it tells them to turn left , they turn left . and although one or two germans will find themselves asking philosophical questions about what it means to turn right or left at any point in their life , most will happily oblige and surrender to that bizarrely infantilizing feeling we all know from looking at the assembling instructions for an ikea cupboard .

" from his navigation system all too literally .
30 meters before the crossing he was meant to take , the excessively obedient driver from freiburg drove his suv off the road into a nearby construction site , drove it up a stairway and crashed it into a poor , unsuspecting toilet shack that had never seen this type of action before . police in the eastern german town of rudolstadt said the incident had caused 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,500 -rrb- in damages to the stairway , 100 euros to the car and that the driver was also fined accordingly .
the ongoing fine for extreme obedience is 35 euros . earlier this month another german ignored the sign " closed for construction " on a hamburg highway and followed his navigation system into a pile of sand .
no injuries were reported . a navigation system is , it seems , the new dominatrix : virtual whip in hand , it tells you what to do .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.10.2006 deutsche telekom may axe more than 70,000 jobs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is one of germany 's largest employers in order to remain competitive , deutsche telekom needs to reduce costs and increase productivity by eliminating tens of thousands of jobs in the next few years .
even the chief executive 's job could be on the line . out of a full time workforce of 167,000 employed worldwide by the bonn-based telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , 74,000 employees are superfluous , according to the sunday newspaper , frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , which cited an internal company report circulated by the management board . the internal memo made perfectly clear that the cost to consumers of subscribing to deutsche telekom 's telephone and internet services is significantly higher than that of its competitors . competitors charge much less its t-com fixed line and t-online internet subsidiaries charge 71 euros monthly for flatrate connections or double that of a low-cost , no-name competitor , called 2play net.fon , for example .
other better known competitors , such as aol and arcor , which also offer high-speed dsl connections well below telekom 's rates , charge 55 euros and 50 euros for the same package , respectively . one reason cited for higher prices that are passed on to consumers , are inefficient structures and duplication of services that reduce productivity and lead to bloated costs .
several german newspapers had reported over the weekend that in addition to 32,000 positions to be eliminated by 2008 , an additional 23,000 jobs would be cut by 2010 . additional job cuts can not be ruled out ulrich lissek , chief spokesman for telekom could not confirm the figures , but told reporters that the conglomerate " has always said that in the face of regulatory and technological changes , we can not rule out the elimination of additional jobs after 2008 . " meanwhile telekom has been losing domestic clients for its fixed line services , while its t-mobile cell phone unit is growing mainly because of its us activities .
the additional job cuts at deutsche telekom do not come as a surprise since the former state-owned monopoly , which was privatised in 1995 , has been cutting more than 10,000 jobs a year in the last decade in order to raise its profitability and competitiveness . furthermore , telekom chief kai-uwe ricke has repeatedly said that moves to cut more jobs would not necessarily cease in 2008 . telekom chief under heavy pressure even ricke 's own job could be on the line .
directors at telekom are apparently mulling the future of their boss , whose contract expires in 2007 .
the decision to renew ricke 's contract or replace him is expected to be made in december .
since a profits warning was issued this august , ricke has been under considerable pressure , as the number of fixed line subscribers has dropped and growth in the wireless sector has slowed down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom chief 's contract expires next year one name that has been bandied about to replace ricke , is ben verwaayen , the chief executive of british telecom , although the german government , which holds more than 30 percent of telekom directly and indirectly through the state-owned bank kfw , could favour an internal candidate according to the financial times . political fallout from job cuts the government 's key consideration is to minimise the political fallout from job cutbacks in the fixed line business .
ricke had deferred to such political concerns last year when he reduced his demand for job cuts by half from 60,000 down to 30,000 . the worker 's union verdi claims that new internet technologies will require fewer personnel , so that ricke 's talk of " streamlining operations " is irrelevant anyway . deutsche telekom is not the only major german company slashing jobs on a massive scale .
in the pharmaceutical sector , bayer 's recent takeover of schering will result in the elimination of 6,000 positions , the insolvency of benq mobile , the wireless manufacturer , has put 3,000 jobs on the line , while automobile giant volkswagen plans to cut 20,000 jobs by 2009 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's t-mobile wins licenses in the united states german telecommunications giant t-mobile is geared to expand its presence on the us market .

even the chief executive 's job could be on the line . out of a full time workforce of 167,000 employed worldwide by the bonn-based telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , 74,000 employees are superfluous , according to the sunday newspaper , frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , which cited an internal company report circulated by the management board . the internal memo made perfectly clear that the cost to consumers of subscribing to deutsche telekom 's telephone and internet services is significantly higher than that of its competitors . competitors charge much less its t-com fixed line and t-online internet subsidiaries charge 71 euros monthly for flatrate connections or double that of a low-cost , no-name competitor , called 2play net.fon , for example .
other better known competitors , such as aol and arcor , which also offer high-speed dsl connections well below telekom 's rates , charge 55 euros and 50 euros for the same package , respectively . one reason cited for higher prices that are passed on to consumers , are inefficient structures and duplication of services that reduce productivity and lead to bloated costs .
several german newspapers had reported over the weekend that in addition to 32,000 positions to be eliminated by 2008 , an additional 23,000 jobs would be cut by 2010 . additional job cuts can not be ruled out ulrich lissek , chief spokesman for telekom could not confirm the figures , but told reporters that the conglomerate " has always said that in the face of regulatory and technological changes , we can not rule out the elimination of additional jobs after 2008 .

the additional job cuts at deutsche telekom do not come as a surprise since the former state-owned monopoly , which was privatised in 1995 , has been cutting more than 10,000 jobs a year in the last decade in order to raise its profitability and competitiveness . furthermore , telekom chief kai-uwe ricke has repeatedly said that moves to cut more jobs would not necessarily cease in 2008 . telekom chief under heavy pressure even ricke 's own job could be on the line .
directors at telekom are apparently mulling the future of their boss , whose contract expires in 2007 .
the decision to renew ricke 's contract or replace him is expected to be made in december .
since a profits warning was issued this august , ricke has been under considerable pressure , as the number of fixed line subscribers has dropped and growth in the wireless sector has slowed down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom chief 's contract expires next year one name that has been bandied about to replace ricke , is ben verwaayen , the chief executive of british telecom , although the german government , which holds more than 30 percent of telekom directly and indirectly through the state-owned bank kfw , could favour an internal candidate according to the financial times . political fallout from job cuts the government 's key consideration is to minimise the political fallout from job cutbacks in the fixed line business .
ricke had deferred to such political concerns last year when he reduced his demand for job cuts by half from 60,000 down to 30,000 . the worker 's union verdi claims that new internet technologies will require fewer personnel , so that ricke 's talk of " streamlining operations " is irrelevant anyway . deutsche telekom is not the only major german company slashing jobs on a massive scale .

he went out in style . in 15 years of formula one , he had demonstrated over and again a fearsome competitive instinct and an unbeatable will to win .
the statistics that piled up to praise his work were colossal - seven world titles , five with ferrari , 68 pole positions and 91 victories . michael schumacher , however , was left struggling for words on sunday as his career came to a dramatic end at the brazilian grand prix . " today , my racing career comes to an end and , obviously it 's a special moment for me and i am proud to have lived my career with some fantastic people - namely everyone who is a part of the ferrari family , " said the german star . " there is so much to say - i ca n't find the right words .
the things i will miss are probably the fans and in every moment they have been behind me and always supported me . " " their support helped me perform , especially in moments when it was difficult .
over the years that was immensely important .
i can only say thank you to those people and those fans , " schumacher said . no last victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitiveness was schumacher 's default mode in motor racing the seven-time world champion finished his career with one of his most stirring drives to come home in fourth place , cruelly just off the podium .
but he still managed to find a metaphor that brought symmetry to his 15 years of sustained and extraordinary racing . " in a way , it 's a closed circle now for me , because my formula one career started and finished after 500 meters which was , maybe , a symbol of what happened yesterday . " his words referred to the fact that his first race and his last were hit by problems that wrecked his hopes of victory .
but his actions on the track in his ferrari spoke volumes for his talent , speed , courage and determination as he stormed from the back of the field , after a puncture , to finish fourth . a dramatic race " the race was chaotic , i think that 's the right word , " he said , as rival and second-time champion fernando alonso began his celebrations , having finished second behind his ferrari team-mate felipe massa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher , right , with renault 's fernando alonso , from spain " we really had a superb car today from the pure speed we could have lapped everybody .
so i have to say it was the perfect end to the season in terms of car performance , but for me it did n't work out well . " schumacher offered warm congratulations to massa for his first triumph on brazilian soil . " i 'm very happy for felipe who drove an amazing race , " he said .
" it 's great for him to be the first brazilian to win at interlagos since ayrton senna .
it would have been nice if i could at least have made it to the podium alongside him .
i would also like to congratulate fernando . " a teutonic machine in his brilliant career , the man from the flatlands of kerpen in northern germany had become a teutonic machine , a human delivery system of speed and points and glory in a sport unused to such high standards of regularity , human reliability and sheer professionalism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher married corinna in 1995 tributes poured in from september onwards , after he had announced his intention to retire at the season 's end .
some were warm and loving , some were barbed and tinged with envy and some reflected a failure to understand that formula one was bringing down the curtain on the greatest and most complete driver ever to have raced in a grand prix . schumacher said his best memory was his title win in 2000 . " we had a lot of hard work and setbacks so when we finally won it , it was the most beautiful championship , " said schumacher . he added he did have regrets . " there were things i would do differently , but if i went into that it would get too intense and we do n't have time right now .
my dad was happy to see me after the race and he said : ' finally , it 's over . " ' " he was quite happy .
i feel more relaxed although i think his heart rate was higher in the race than mine , " schumacher said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schumi-town honors favorite son ’ s final fling michael schumacher brings the checkered flag down on his record-breaking career sunday .

" we are not dealing with nato matters , we are dealing with european defense , " said conference chairman reimar scherz , a retired brigadier general .
" for us it is very important to have a status report on where we are and where we 're going . " " the decisions are taken in brussels as far as european defense and security policies are concerned … and we have installed a european armament agency . " the western alliance nato is the number one security force in europe , but the european union is building its own defense force to strengthen its own defense capabilities and deal in crisis situations where nato is not engaged . the ultimate goal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl von wogau wants an efficient eu army the eu 's ultimate aim , according to the 1999 helsinki agreement and the 2004 headline goal is to create by 2010 a european military force of 50 to 60 thousand soldiers who can be deployed within 60 days and sustained in the field for at least one year . " european member states spend annually 170 billion euros -lrb- 215 billion -rrb- on defense , " said congress president karl von wogau , who is also chairman of the subcommittee on security and defence of the european parliament . " that 's a small amount , some 40 percent of what the americans spend .
but the americans are saying : you give out 40 percent , but your efficiency is at 10 percent .
which means we lose efficiency by often doing the same thing 25 times , " he said . the eu currently has 6,000 troops stationed in bosnia herzegovina and 2,000 in the democratic republic of congo .
a mission in macedonia was also recently completed . getting battle groups ready bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is increasingly taking on military roles in the world one of the eu priorities in defense matters is to make sure that its planned mobile battle groups are properly equipped and ready to report for duty early next year . " we have made decisions as far eu battle groups are concerned , " scherz said .
" there will be 13 battle groups early next year ...
1,500 soldiers each , and germany is participating in four battle groups .
those decisions have been taken , but the question is how these decisions will be implemented . " the battle groups will be similar to nato 's rapid reaction force , but will be under eu command .
the battle groups will be created in response to a crisis and only stay for the duration of that crisis .
it will be up to the member states themselves to decide whether , when and how to contribute troops . eu member states are yet to settle command issues and agree on how the troops will be transported . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : north korean nuclear test is " unacceptable " the european union has strongly condemned north korea 's nuclear test as " unacceptable .

the event took place amid concerns far-right extremists are becoming more active , and more violent .

the party , which is growing in popularity in the former east germany , also holds seats in saxony 's state parliament , where another extremist party is also represented . ' jews do not feel safe ' meanwhile , on saturday the israeli ambassador to germany called the rise of far-right organizations in germany " worrying " and said jews in the country " do not feel safe . " " antisemitism , the number of neo-nazis and the tendency towards violence have risen , " shimon stein told the neue osnabrucker zeitung , which published the interview in full on its website . " the current trend is worrying and calls for a mobilisation of the whole society , " he said .
the governing coalition in germany decided on friday to increase the budget for fighting right wing extremism by 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6.3 million -rrb- next year . ' beyond marginal ' commenting on the the entry of far-right deputies into three regional parliaments , the ambassador said " it is not a threat to democracy , but i think that it has gone beyond the stage of being a marginal phenomenon . " " i have the feeling that jews in germany do not feel safe .
they are not always able to practice their religion freely , " he said , particularly noting the strict security measures necessary at religious gatherings . " the desire for normality remains frustrated . " bernd wagner , a berlin-based expert on extremist movements and leader of the center for democratic culture in berlin , said right-extremist parallel societies are a phenomenon that exists " in many german states . "
it is just stronger in some and weaker in others , he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper over the weekend . ' not all brown ' however , he said it is not true that all of the former east germany " is colored brown , " referring to hitler 's brown-shirted army .
germany needs to deal in a differentiated way with the threat , depending on where it is coming from : sometimes with education and social work , sometimes with the police . wolfgang tiefensee , federal minister for urban affairs , told the saarbrücker zeitung newspaper over the weekend that he was worried about the " shockingly good " organization of the right-wing scene in some of germany 's states .
" there is right-wing extremism in the west and the east .

sad to say , mr. schröeder was far and away the most irresponsible and self-indulgent chancellor in recent german history .
today mr. schröder claims he was not anti-american , but during his tenure he used constant anti-american rhetoric to raise his poll numbers .

for those germans who dislike america - and dislike is fine , this is not a matter of love - mr. schröder still lied to them about the economy .

he is simply stuck in the past .
schröder 's gazprom job put the icing on the cake as far as international observers of germany are concerned .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i agree completely with mr. schröder 's comments .
mr. bush 's professed dependence on " divine guidance " has no place in western politics , let alone in the politics of a country whose constitution expressly denotes a separation between church and state . - mike cohen , new mexico , usa mr. schröder has finally put into words what many think but are afraid to say out loud .
bravo gert ! - liliane chaglassian i totally agree with schröder 's thoughts on bush and religion in the us .
it would be good if there were a serious discussion in this country about the separation - or rather , non-separation - of church and state ! - gabrielle callison if anyone believes that political decisions can be made devoid of personal beliefs they are delusional , or a liar .
if bush 's decisions are biased by overtly christian beliefs this is no worse than being overtly humanist , capitalist , rationalist or islamic . - simon i think schröder hit the nail right on the head with bush 's religiosity and managed to say it in a matter of fact way without being unkind . - detlef karthaus 1 -rrb- schröder is right on the money , 2 -rrb- i could not say it better about us politics and religion . - michael ruso it is not unusual for politicians to use their memoirs to rationalize their tenure .
it 's generally not expected to be a truthful account , given the hard knocks of normal politics .
but in the case of former german chancellor gerhardt schröder , it is just more of the same .
sad to say , mr. schröeder was far and away the most irresponsible and self-indulgent chancellor in recent german history .
today mr. schröder claims he was not anti-american , but during his tenure he used constant anti-american rhetoric to raise his poll numbers .
that is what made mr. schröeder such a disaster from abroad .
we can take criticism in stride , but this was political demagogy performed for the most cynical purposes .
for those germans who dislike america - and dislike is fine , this is not a matter of love - mr. schröder still lied to them about the economy .
and he failed utterly to deal with the universally understood weaknesses of the german economy , the rigidity of the labor market , high taxation , and all the rest .
mr. schröder has apparently not changed a single idea since he was an immature radical .
he is simply stuck in the past .
schröder 's gazprom job put the icing on the cake as far as international observers of germany are concerned .
it looked very bad after political concessions made to russia under mr. schröeder 's rule .
the former chancellor should have been far , far more sensitive to the appearance of a quid pro quo . - bernard baars compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in book , schröder describes worries about bush 's religiosity ahead of the release of his memoirs , gerhard schröder says george bush left a positive impression on him , but the us leader 's constant references to god troubled him .
schröder had few kind words for his own successor .
-lrb- 22.10.2006 -rrb- gerhard schröder takes a blow over gazprom germany 's opposition fdp party has threatened to demand a parliamentary inquiry into the so-called " pipeline affair " involving the former government of gerhard schröder and russian gas group gazprom .
-lrb- 03.04.2006 -rrb- bundestag debates ex-chancellor schröder 's ethics the german parliament pondered the ethical implications associated with former chancellor gerhard schröder 's decision to take a top position on a russian-german energy project so quickly after leaving office .

the things i will miss are probably the fans and in every moment they have been behind me and always supported me . " " their support helped me perform , especially in moments when it was difficult .
over the years that was immensely important .
i can only say thank you to those people and those fans , " schumacher said . no last victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitiveness was schumacher 's default mode in motor racing the seven-time world champion finished his career with one of his most stirring drives to come home in fourth place , cruelly just off the podium .
but he still managed to find a metaphor that brought symmetry to his 15 years of sustained and extraordinary racing . " in a way , it 's a closed circle now for me , because my formula one career started and finished after 500 meters which was , maybe , a symbol of what happened yesterday . " his words referred to the fact that his first race and his last were hit by problems that wrecked his hopes of victory .
but his actions on the track in his ferrari spoke volumes for his talent , speed , courage and determination as he stormed from the back of the field , after a puncture , to finish fourth . a dramatic race " the race was chaotic , i think that 's the right word , " he said , as rival and second-time champion fernando alonso began his celebrations , having finished second behind his ferrari team-mate felipe massa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher , right , with renault 's fernando alonso , from spain " we really had a superb car today from the pure speed we could have lapped everybody .
so i have to say it was the perfect end to the season in terms of car performance , but for me it did n't work out well . " schumacher offered warm congratulations to massa for his first triumph on brazilian soil . " i 'm very happy for felipe who drove an amazing race , " he said .
" it 's great for him to be the first brazilian to win at interlagos since ayrton senna .
it would have been nice if i could at least have made it to the podium alongside him .
i would also like to congratulate fernando . " a teutonic machine in his brilliant career , the man from the flatlands of kerpen in northern germany had become a teutonic machine , a human delivery system of speed and points and glory in a sport unused to such high standards of regularity , human reliability and sheer professionalism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher married corinna in 1995 tributes poured in from september onwards , after he had announced his intention to retire at the season 's end .
some were warm and loving , some were barbed and tinged with envy and some reflected a failure to understand that formula one was bringing down the curtain on the greatest and most complete driver ever to have raced in a grand prix . schumacher said his best memory was his title win in 2000 . " we had a lot of hard work and setbacks so when we finally won it , it was the most beautiful championship , " said schumacher . he added he did have regrets . " there were things i would do differently , but if i went into that it would get too intense and we do n't have time right now .
my dad was happy to see me after the race and he said : ' finally , it 's over . " ' " he was quite happy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 23.10.2006 bavarian conservatives inch towards acceptance of gays großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the csu appears a little more tolerant of gay bavarians these days the majority party of bavaria , the christian social union , has for the first time recognized that some gay relationships have value , although equating them with traditional marriage remains out of the question . the recognition , which is seen by some as a long-overdue wake-up to reality and by others as a danger to the traditional family , comes in the form of a draft policy statement released by the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- on monday . in the eight-page section on family policy , the party in power for decades in largely catholic , widely conservative bavaria rejects the idea of giving same-sex partnerships the same legal foundation as a marriage between a man and a women , or allowing gay and lesbian couples to adopt children .
but it does say the party " acknowledges -lrb- same-sex relationships -rrb- , when people in these partnerships can rely on each other to take responsibility and care for one another . " at a press conference on monday in munich , where the policy position was presented , the head of the policy committee , alois glück , said the csu wanted its new position regarding gay relationships to reflect today 's reality . " the message is , the csu has a realistic and contemporary view on the family , but one which is also values oriented , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's capital munich is pretty gay friendly - the hinterlands less so the position is a nuanced once , which attempts to acknowledge that gay relationships do exist , and that they can have worth , but still firmly putting itself on the side of a traditional view of the family : mother , father and children . " we want to show that we respect the values which are lived in these partnerships , " said deputy party chief beate merk in an interview on bavarian radio , referring to same-sex couples .
" but we want to be clear , that only extends to a certain point . " in the last such policy position statement by the csu , from 1993 , gays and lesbians were not mentioned . the csu and gays some might question the significance of these cautious , almost guarded statements on the issue in a country where same-sex partnerships can be legally recognized .
but it marks the first time the conservative csu has addressed the topic in anything but fairly negative terms . franz josef strauss , long-time , respected csu premier of the state of bavaria who was often referred to as the " strong man of europe , " famously told die zeit newspaper in 1971 that he 'd rather be a " cold warrior than a warm brother . "
-lrb- the latter expression is a pejorative expression for a gay man . -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber has always stressed tradition the csu 's current head , edmund stoiber , once refused to talk about " these partnerships , " saying if he did , he might as well start worshipping the devil . " he probably would n't talk like that that today , but the csu has traditionally had , shall we say , a problematic attitude , " said hellmuth pusch , head of the bavarian section of the lesbian and gay association of germany .
" now we see that some rethinking is taking place . " still , he and other gay groups do not feel like the party has gone as far as it should .
while the new positioning is a slight change , pusch says bavaria and csu are still far behind the rest of germany when it comes to accepting homosexuality .
bavaria was one of the german federal states that went to germany 's highest court to try to block the law allowing registered same-sex partnerships and it is still one of the only states not to allow those partnerships to be registered at the registry office like heterosexual marriages , but requires couples to go to a notary . " but this is a beginning , " he said .
" the csu is are on the right path and we welcome that . " voters on their minds ? while some in the csu might feel its time to jettison , or at least revisit , some traditionalist viewpoints , others see political motives behind the party 's decision .
the left-wing taz daily , known for its clever headlines , entitled its story on the new policy " csu hot for gay voters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a same-sex couple at a registry office in hannover while that might be an exaggeration , it is a fact that the csu is finding its decades-long dominance of bavarian politics slipping a little .
it still got 62 percent of the vote in the last election , but the larger cities in bavaria such as munich , nuremberg and augsburg , are all governed by the spd . " in general , a party which formulates policies that do n't reflect life 's realities will lose more and more voters , " said axel hochrein , head of the bavarian branch of the lsu , a group representing gays and lesbians in the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the csu . warning call the csu 's tentative warming up to gays and lesbians does not sit well with everyone in the party .
a group of eight csu parliamentarians has released a statement warning that the party should not " weaken " its position of privileging traditional marriage .
according to the statement , children need a " father and mother in their different gender roles . " four of the eight lawmakers expressing these conservative sentiments were born in or after 1970 . " in the csu , you ca n't judge by the age of politicians , but you have to look at what area they come from , rural or urban , " said hochrein .
while members from the big bavarian cities advocate for more acceptance , those from rural regions have much different ideas . " in the countryside , which is very catholic and where the church has an enormous influence , even a single mother is still sometimes seen as scandalous , " he said .
" that is the balancing act the party has to deal with .

" it is an alarm signal , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will these managers-in-training stick around ?
the country 's federal statistical office said there were 145,000 people who moved abroad in 2005 - about the number of people who live in a small city like potsdam near berlin .
it is the highest number since they began compiling that statistic , in 1954 , an fso spokesperson said . braun : structural problems to blame the most alarming aspect of the news is that more than half of the emigrants are younger than 35 . the main reason for the " brain drain " are the favorable conditions for wage earners in other countries , braun told die welt .
compared with other european countries , germany has high taxes and social security payments , a tight job market , and deficient education and training . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader kurt beck calls for calm in the debate " germany must absolutely deal with its structural problems .
it must become an attractive location for qualified and trained workers , " he said .
in addition , he added , the german job market needs to open up for well-trained foreign workers . beck calls for calm kurt beck , head of the social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the warning by the chamber of commerce was " rather excessive , " and called for calm in the debate . " when german firms expand across the globe , they also send their workers overseas , " he told the press .
" in a free society , it is normal to move overseas . "
in the end , what is important is that approximately equal numbers of people leave the country and come into the country , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should open up to more qualified workers from abroad , some say for his part , spd education and training expert jörg tauss said businesses are to blame for the high numbers of germans who leave and never come back . " an economy that ca n't offer jobs to qualified people - which simply offers them unpaid internships month after month , and has no concept of how to lure people back to open positions in germany - has no right to complain over the consequences of its own policies , " he told afp . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german scientists go abroad to pursue stem cell research german laws regarding embryonic stem cells are among the most restrictive in the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the airbus saga : turbulence on the ground and in the air russia , eads cozy up with new airbus deals germans call for parity in airbus restructuring program mass strikes across europe hit airbus factories airbus decision on a350 looms amid us-eu trade dispute aerospace -pipe- 23.10.2006 germany undecided on role in eads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany mulls its next step in the airbus crisis as russian investors circle in the minefield of national egos at the heart of eads , the german government seems undecided about how best to shore up its interests without being left to foot the bill if the aerospace giant 's finances deteriorate . the european aeronautic defence and space company insisted friday that it currently had enough cash to cope with the huge problems facing its crisis-ridden airplane maker airbus .
but eads warned it might go to the debt markets next year in order to raise additional financing . group finance director hans-peter ring said that eads " will manage pro-actively its financial requirements and might go to the capital markets in 2007 , " possibly by issuing hybrid bonds . but the company , which has announced delays of up to 24 months in deliveries of the ambitious super-jumbo jet a380 , " has neither the need nor the short-term intention " of making a capital increase , ring insisted . despite eads ' insistence that it finances are very solid , such comments raised the specter of potential financing bottlenecks further down the line .
and that could explain the government 's chronic prevarication as to how best safeguard german interests in the company . after all , if the german state does acquire a stake in the company , it will be compelled to put up a large chunk of the financing should a capital increase ever become necessary . what will daimler do ? the crunch of the matter lies with german-us auto maker daimlerchrysler , which holds a stake of 22.5 percent in eads but has signaled its intention to reduce that stake to 15 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an a380 superjumbo - the source of many problems berlin is adamant that the 7.5-percent stake being put for sale should remain in german hands and must not be allowed to fall into french or even russian hands .
it must " remain in the german sphere " , the government spokesman ulrich wilhem said recently . german finance minister peer steinbrück defended the idea of a possible state stake in the european aerospace giant eads , in an interview to be published monday . " this is about stabilizing an enterprise , about keeping the jobs of qualified workers and especially about being up to the level of our french partners , " steinbrück said , referring to the delicate french-german balance within eads . his remarks came in response to a question by germany 's suddeutsche zeitung newspaper about whether eads ' problems would continue to grow without state intervention . the minister said no decision had been made about a german public stake in the company , a matter that has sparked speculation in recent days .
" there are possible solutions which are completely defensible from an interventionist point of view , " steinbrueck said . " nobody in the government wants to suddenly transform the federal state into a business , " steinbrück was quoted as saying in the suddeutsche zeitung .
" but we can not let airbus go into bankruptcy simply because society is undergoing an adaptation crisis or because a manufacturer wants to cede its share . " the current balance of power with eads is extremely delicate . germany 's interests are represented by daimlerchrysler 's 22.5-percent stake , while france is represented via a 30-percent interest shared by the state holding company sogeade and media group lagardere . spanish interests are represented by the holding group sepi , which owns 5.48 percent . lagardere has committed itself to halving its stake to put french interests back on a par with germany 's , but the balance of power would be upset if daimlerchrysler were to reduce its stake .
in september , russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank bought 5.02 percent and moscow has signaled its intention of increasing its say in the company , a development that would be welcomed by eads german co-chief executive , thomas enders . enders said in a newspaper interview published on monday that he welcomed the acquisition of a stake in the european aerospace giant by the russian state .
" the entry of the russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank into eads share capital underlines the huge interest of russian investors " in the european aeronautic defence and space company , enders told the daily die welt .
" cooperation with the russian aerospace industry is of strategic importance for us .
russia is not only an important market , but it has a great deal of experience in the development and construction of aircraft , " enders said . calls for and against state involvement daimlerchrysler chief dieter zetsche is opposed to the idea of the german state acquiring the shares . " fundamentally , an increase in state influence is not desirable for the group , " he told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . there is also opposition within eads to the idea of state involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus plant in hamburg enders said in an interview published in the wall street journal that such a solution would mark a " return to the stone age . " but there are plenty of people in germany , not least a number of top-ranking politicians , who argue that is the government 's patriotic duty to get its hands on the shares . the group 's plane maker airbus employs 22,000 people at seven different sites around the country .
the northern port of hamburg is home to airbus ' biggest german site . the government " has a crucial political responsibility " in the matter , the chief whip of the social democrat spd party , peter struck , insisted . a number of politicians have said the government should acquire the stake via the state-owned redevelopment bank kfw . hamburg mayor ole von beust caused a stir last week when he said that a corresponding deal had been reached .
but chancellor angela merkel swiftly qualified that statement , insisting that no decision had been made yet . but she added : " i 'm not ruling anything out " . economy minister michael glos insists that a future investor in eads should come from the private sector .
newspapers have suggested that a group of suppliers to airbus or even a consortium of banks could take daimlerchrysler 's stake . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus parent company considers selling factories the european aerospace group eads would consider selling some airbus factories provided that new owners could reduce operating costs , eads co-chairman manfred bischoff said on friday .

but it does say the party " acknowledges -lrb- same-sex relationships -rrb- , when people in these partnerships can rely on each other to take responsibility and care for one another .

a truce seems unlikely with the cabinet set to approve parts of a highly controversial health bill this week . the mass demonstrations organized by germany 's powerful trade unions this weekend saw an estimated 200,000 people take to the streets in protest of the grand coalition 's social and economic policies . in big cities across the country , workers ' representatives vented their anger over what they felt was a lop-sided reform process that was hurting the poor and sparing the affluent .
the mass rallies provoked angry reactions especially by senior conservative members of the ruling coalition of social and christian democrats . they claimed the unions had no right to take to the streets , as they had not made a single reasonable alternative proposal for reforms .
markus söder from the conservative christian social union , the christian democratic union 's bavarian sister party , was one of those who didn ’ t mince his words . conservatives brand unions as obstructive " we 'd have expected the trade unions to be jubilant in the face of a considerable drop in unemployment in the first year of the grand coalition 's work , " he said .
" but all we hear from them is a constant moaning and groaning .
i believe that the unions ' leadership is arch-conservative and that we can not move the country forward together with them .
in my view the unions for us are no longer a serious partner at the negotiating table . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sommer refuted claims that the unions were at fault michael sommer , head of the german confederation of trade unions , dismissed söder 's remarks as appalling and totally unfounded .
but even prominent members of the social democrat party , which traditionally has a working class electorate , said the trade unions are being obstructive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is accused of abandoning the people former chancellor gerhard schröder revealed in his autobiography this week that the trade unions had no small share in making him give up his post in 2005 .
but sommer rejects the accusations saying it 's not the trade unions that stand in the way of the country 's development . government not socially responsible , says union chief " a real risk for the country ’ s development are those companies which are doing well and are pocketing huge profits , but decide to lay off workers at the same time , " sommer said .
" be it the siemens electronics giant , the allianz insurance group or similar companies - they 've all forgotten how to act in a socially responsible way , and we 're not willing to accept that . " and as far as ex-chancellor gerhard schröder 's criticism is concerned - yes , we were against his agenda 2010 reform package because of the inherent social injustices .
but he can not really hold it against us that his party lost in elections . " slow reforms feeding brain drain meanwhile , the head of the german chambers of industry and commerce , ludwig georg braun , has warned that the slow reform process in the country was making more and more people turn their backs on germany and seek employment opportunities elsewhere . according to a recent survey , about 154,000 germans left the country in 2005 alone - the highest number recorded in over 50 years .
braun indicated that more than half of the emigrants were under 35 years of age , many of unable to find low-skill employment in germany and argued that germany needed an improved education policy and a drastic reduction in taxes and social fees to keep these people in the country . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de battling plummeting popularity , merkel vows reform drive german chancellor angela merkel plans to reverse her coalition government 's sinking popularity ratings with a renewed stab at controversial reforms .

the mass rallies provoked angry reactions especially by senior conservative members of the ruling coalition of social and christian democrats . they claimed the unions had no right to take to the streets , as they had not made a single reasonable alternative proposal for reforms .
markus söder from the conservative christian social union , the christian democratic union 's bavarian sister party , was one of those who didn ’ t mince his words . conservatives brand unions as obstructive " we 'd have expected the trade unions to be jubilant in the face of a considerable drop in unemployment in the first year of the grand coalition 's work , " he said .
" but all we hear from them is a constant moaning and groaning .
i believe that the unions ' leadership is arch-conservative and that we can not move the country forward together with them .
in my view the unions for us are no longer a serious partner at the negotiating table . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sommer refuted claims that the unions were at fault michael sommer , head of the german confederation of trade unions , dismissed söder 's remarks as appalling and totally unfounded .
but even prominent members of the social democrat party , which traditionally has a working class electorate , said the trade unions are being obstructive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is accused of abandoning the people former chancellor gerhard schröder revealed in his autobiography this week that the trade unions had no small share in making him give up his post in 2005 .
but sommer rejects the accusations saying it 's not the trade unions that stand in the way of the country 's development . government not socially responsible , says union chief " a real risk for the country ’ s development are those companies which are doing well and are pocketing huge profits , but decide to lay off workers at the same time , " sommer said .
" be it the siemens electronics giant , the allianz insurance group or similar companies - they 've all forgotten how to act in a socially responsible way , and we 're not willing to accept that . " and as far as ex-chancellor gerhard schröder 's criticism is concerned - yes , we were against his agenda 2010 reform package because of the inherent social injustices .
but he can not really hold it against us that his party lost in elections . " slow reforms feeding brain drain meanwhile , the head of the german chambers of industry and commerce , ludwig georg braun , has warned that the slow reform process in the country was making more and more people turn their backs on germany and seek employment opportunities elsewhere . according to a recent survey , about 154,000 germans left the country in 2005 alone - the highest number recorded in over 50 years .

he went out in style . in 15 years of formula one , he had demonstrated over and again a fearsome competitive instinct and an unbeatable will to win .
the statistics that piled up to praise his work were colossal - seven world titles , five with ferrari , 68 pole positions and 91 victories . michael schumacher , however , was left struggling for words on sunday as his career came to a dramatic end at the brazilian grand prix . " today , my racing career comes to an end and , obviously it 's a special moment for me and i am proud to have lived my career with some fantastic people - namely everyone who is a part of the ferrari family , " said the german star . " there is so much to say - i ca n't find the right words .
the things i will miss are probably the fans and in every moment they have been behind me and always supported me . " " their support helped me perform , especially in moments when it was difficult .
over the years that was immensely important .
i can only say thank you to those people and those fans , " schumacher said . no last victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitiveness was schumacher 's default mode in motor racing the seven-time world champion finished his career with one of his most stirring drives to come home in fourth place , cruelly just off the podium .
but he still managed to find a metaphor that brought symmetry to his 15 years of sustained and extraordinary racing . " in a way , it 's a closed circle now for me , because my formula one career started and finished after 500 meters which was , maybe , a symbol of what happened yesterday . " his words referred to the fact that his first race and his last were hit by problems that wrecked his hopes of victory .
but his actions on the track in his ferrari spoke volumes for his talent , speed , courage and determination as he stormed from the back of the field , after a puncture , to finish fourth . a dramatic race " the race was chaotic , i think that 's the right word , " he said , as rival and second-time champion fernando alonso began his celebrations , having finished second behind his ferrari team-mate felipe massa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher , right , with renault 's fernando alonso , from spain " we really had a superb car today from the pure speed we could have lapped everybody .
so i have to say it was the perfect end to the season in terms of car performance , but for me it did n't work out well . " schumacher offered warm congratulations to massa for his first triumph on brazilian soil . " i 'm very happy for felipe who drove an amazing race , " he said .
" it 's great for him to be the first brazilian to win at interlagos since ayrton senna .
it would have been nice if i could at least have made it to the podium alongside him .
i would also like to congratulate fernando . " a teutonic machine in his brilliant career , the man from the flatlands of kerpen in northern germany had become a teutonic machine , a human delivery system of speed and points and glory in a sport unused to such high standards of regularity , human reliability and sheer professionalism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher married corinna in 1995 tributes poured in from september onwards , after he had announced his intention to retire at the season 's end .
some were warm and loving , some were barbed and tinged with envy and some reflected a failure to understand that formula one was bringing down the curtain on the greatest and most complete driver ever to have raced in a grand prix . schumacher said his best memory was his title win in 2000 . " we had a lot of hard work and setbacks so when we finally won it , it was the most beautiful championship , " said schumacher . he added he did have regrets . " there were things i would do differently , but if i went into that it would get too intense and we do n't have time right now .
my dad was happy to see me after the race and he said : ' finally , it 's over . " ' " he was quite happy .
i feel more relaxed although i think his heart rate was higher in the race than mine , " schumacher said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schumi-town honors favorite son ’ s final fling michael schumacher brings the checkered flag down on his record-breaking career sunday .

he went out in style . in 15 years of formula one , he had demonstrated over and again a fearsome competitive instinct and an unbeatable will to win .
the statistics that piled up to praise his work were colossal - seven world titles , five with ferrari , 68 pole positions and 91 victories . michael schumacher , however , was left struggling for words on sunday as his career came to a dramatic end at the brazilian grand prix . " today , my racing career comes to an end and , obviously it 's a special moment for me and i am proud to have lived my career with some fantastic people - namely everyone who is a part of the ferrari family , " said the german star . " there is so much to say - i ca n't find the right words .
the things i will miss are probably the fans and in every moment they have been behind me and always supported me . " " their support helped me perform , especially in moments when it was difficult .
over the years that was immensely important .
i can only say thank you to those people and those fans , " schumacher said . no last victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitiveness was schumacher 's default mode in motor racing the seven-time world champion finished his career with one of his most stirring drives to come home in fourth place , cruelly just off the podium .
but he still managed to find a metaphor that brought symmetry to his 15 years of sustained and extraordinary racing . " in a way , it 's a closed circle now for me , because my formula one career started and finished after 500 meters which was , maybe , a symbol of what happened yesterday . " his words referred to the fact that his first race and his last were hit by problems that wrecked his hopes of victory .
but his actions on the track in his ferrari spoke volumes for his talent , speed , courage and determination as he stormed from the back of the field , after a puncture , to finish fourth . a dramatic race " the race was chaotic , i think that 's the right word , " he said , as rival and second-time champion fernando alonso began his celebrations , having finished second behind his ferrari team-mate felipe massa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher , right , with renault 's fernando alonso , from spain " we really had a superb car today from the pure speed we could have lapped everybody .
so i have to say it was the perfect end to the season in terms of car performance , but for me it did n't work out well . " schumacher offered warm congratulations to massa for his first triumph on brazilian soil . " i 'm very happy for felipe who drove an amazing race , " he said .
" it 's great for him to be the first brazilian to win at interlagos since ayrton senna .
it would have been nice if i could at least have made it to the podium alongside him .
i would also like to congratulate fernando . " a teutonic machine in his brilliant career , the man from the flatlands of kerpen in northern germany had become a teutonic machine , a human delivery system of speed and points and glory in a sport unused to such high standards of regularity , human reliability and sheer professionalism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher married corinna in 1995 tributes poured in from september onwards , after he had announced his intention to retire at the season 's end .
some were warm and loving , some were barbed and tinged with envy and some reflected a failure to understand that formula one was bringing down the curtain on the greatest and most complete driver ever to have raced in a grand prix . schumacher said his best memory was his title win in 2000 . " we had a lot of hard work and setbacks so when we finally won it , it was the most beautiful championship , " said schumacher . he added he did have regrets . " there were things i would do differently , but if i went into that it would get too intense and we do n't have time right now .
my dad was happy to see me after the race and he said : ' finally , it 's over . " ' " he was quite happy .
i feel more relaxed although i think his heart rate was higher in the race than mine , " schumacher said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schumi-town honors favorite son ’ s final fling michael schumacher brings the checkered flag down on his record-breaking career sunday .

the event took place amid concerns far-right extremists are becoming more active , and more violent .
some 750 neo-nazis and other far-right supporters turned gathered saturday outside of a berlin prison to call for the release of michael regener , who has been jailed since 2003 , when a berlin court found his rock band landser , or foot soldiers , guilty of spreading hate against jews and foreigners in their songs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi marches are on the rise in germany the demonstration was organized by the far-right national democratic party , which last month won representation in the state legislature of mecklenburg-western pomerania .
the party , which is growing in popularity in the former east germany , also holds seats in saxony 's state parliament , where another extremist party is also represented . ' jews do not feel safe ' meanwhile , on saturday the israeli ambassador to germany called the rise of far-right organizations in germany " worrying " and said jews in the country " do not feel safe . " " antisemitism , the number of neo-nazis and the tendency towards violence have risen , " shimon stein told the neue osnabrucker zeitung , which published the interview in full on its website . " the current trend is worrying and calls for a mobilisation of the whole society , " he said .
the governing coalition in germany decided on friday to increase the budget for fighting right wing extremism by 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6.3 million -rrb- next year . ' beyond marginal ' commenting on the the entry of far-right deputies into three regional parliaments , the ambassador said " it is not a threat to democracy , but i think that it has gone beyond the stage of being a marginal phenomenon . " " i have the feeling that jews in germany do not feel safe .
they are not always able to practice their religion freely , " he said , particularly noting the strict security measures necessary at religious gatherings . " the desire for normality remains frustrated . " bernd wagner , a berlin-based expert on extremist movements and leader of the center for democratic culture in berlin , said right-extremist parallel societies are a phenomenon that exists " in many german states . "
it is just stronger in some and weaker in others , he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper over the weekend . ' not all brown ' however , he said it is not true that all of the former east germany " is colored brown , " referring to hitler 's brown-shirted army .
germany needs to deal in a differentiated way with the threat , depending on where it is coming from : sometimes with education and social work , sometimes with the police . wolfgang tiefensee , federal minister for urban affairs , told the saarbrücker zeitung newspaper over the weekend that he was worried about the " shockingly good " organization of the right-wing scene in some of germany 's states .
" there is right-wing extremism in the west and the east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.10.2006 deutsche telekom may axe more than 70,000 jobs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is one of germany 's largest employers in order to remain competitive , deutsche telekom needs to reduce costs and increase productivity by eliminating tens of thousands of jobs in the next few years .
even the chief executive 's job could be on the line . out of a full time workforce of 167,000 employed worldwide by the bonn-based telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , 74,000 employees are superfluous , according to the sunday newspaper , frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , which cited an internal company report circulated by the management board . the internal memo made perfectly clear that the cost to consumers of subscribing to deutsche telekom 's telephone and internet services is significantly higher than that of its competitors . competitors charge much less its t-com fixed line and t-online internet subsidiaries charge 71 euros monthly for flatrate connections or double that of a low-cost , no-name competitor , called 2play net.fon , for example .
other better known competitors , such as aol and arcor , which also offer high-speed dsl connections well below telekom 's rates , charge 55 euros and 50 euros for the same package , respectively . one reason cited for higher prices that are passed on to consumers , are inefficient structures and duplication of services that reduce productivity and lead to bloated costs .

ricke had deferred to such political concerns last year when he reduced his demand for job cuts by half from 60,000 down to 30,000 . the worker 's union verdi claims that new internet technologies will require fewer personnel , so that ricke 's talk of " streamlining operations " is irrelevant anyway . deutsche telekom is not the only major german company slashing jobs on a massive scale .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.10.2006 deutsche telekom may axe more than 70,000 jobs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is one of germany 's largest employers in order to remain competitive , deutsche telekom needs to reduce costs and increase productivity by eliminating tens of thousands of jobs in the next few years .
even the chief executive 's job could be on the line . out of a full time workforce of 167,000 employed worldwide by the bonn-based telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , 74,000 employees are superfluous , according to the sunday newspaper , frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , which cited an internal company report circulated by the management board . the internal memo made perfectly clear that the cost to consumers of subscribing to deutsche telekom 's telephone and internet services is significantly higher than that of its competitors . competitors charge much less its t-com fixed line and t-online internet subsidiaries charge 71 euros monthly for flatrate connections or double that of a low-cost , no-name competitor , called 2play net.fon , for example .
other better known competitors , such as aol and arcor , which also offer high-speed dsl connections well below telekom 's rates , charge 55 euros and 50 euros for the same package , respectively . one reason cited for higher prices that are passed on to consumers , are inefficient structures and duplication of services that reduce productivity and lead to bloated costs .
several german newspapers had reported over the weekend that in addition to 32,000 positions to be eliminated by 2008 , an additional 23,000 jobs would be cut by 2010 . additional job cuts can not be ruled out ulrich lissek , chief spokesman for telekom could not confirm the figures , but told reporters that the conglomerate " has always said that in the face of regulatory and technological changes , we can not rule out the elimination of additional jobs after 2008 . " meanwhile telekom has been losing domestic clients for its fixed line services , while its t-mobile cell phone unit is growing mainly because of its us activities .
the additional job cuts at deutsche telekom do not come as a surprise since the former state-owned monopoly , which was privatised in 1995 , has been cutting more than 10,000 jobs a year in the last decade in order to raise its profitability and competitiveness . furthermore , telekom chief kai-uwe ricke has repeatedly said that moves to cut more jobs would not necessarily cease in 2008 . telekom chief under heavy pressure even ricke 's own job could be on the line .
directors at telekom are apparently mulling the future of their boss , whose contract expires in 2007 .
the decision to renew ricke 's contract or replace him is expected to be made in december .
since a profits warning was issued this august , ricke has been under considerable pressure , as the number of fixed line subscribers has dropped and growth in the wireless sector has slowed down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom chief 's contract expires next year one name that has been bandied about to replace ricke , is ben verwaayen , the chief executive of british telecom , although the german government , which holds more than 30 percent of telekom directly and indirectly through the state-owned bank kfw , could favour an internal candidate according to the financial times . political fallout from job cuts the government 's key consideration is to minimise the political fallout from job cutbacks in the fixed line business .
ricke had deferred to such political concerns last year when he reduced his demand for job cuts by half from 60,000 down to 30,000 . the worker 's union verdi claims that new internet technologies will require fewer personnel , so that ricke 's talk of " streamlining operations " is irrelevant anyway . deutsche telekom is not the only major german company slashing jobs on a massive scale .
in the pharmaceutical sector , bayer 's recent takeover of schering will result in the elimination of 6,000 positions , the insolvency of benq mobile , the wireless manufacturer , has put 3,000 jobs on the line , while automobile giant volkswagen plans to cut 20,000 jobs by 2009 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's t-mobile wins licenses in the united states german telecommunications giant t-mobile is geared to expand its presence on the us market .
it won the most licenses in an fcc auction of advanced wireless services .

but it does say the party " acknowledges -lrb- same-sex relationships -rrb- , when people in these partnerships can rely on each other to take responsibility and care for one another . " at a press conference on monday in munich , where the policy position was presented , the head of the policy committee , alois glück , said the csu wanted its new position regarding gay relationships to reflect today 's reality . " the message is , the csu has a realistic and contemporary view on the family , but one which is also values oriented , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's capital munich is pretty gay friendly - the hinterlands less so the position is a nuanced once , which attempts to acknowledge that gay relationships do exist , and that they can have worth , but still firmly putting itself on the side of a traditional view of the family : mother , father and children . " we want to show that we respect the values which are lived in these partnerships , " said deputy party chief beate merk in an interview on bavarian radio , referring to same-sex couples .
" but we want to be clear , that only extends to a certain point . " in the last such policy position statement by the csu , from 1993 , gays and lesbians were not mentioned . the csu and gays some might question the significance of these cautious , almost guarded statements on the issue in a country where same-sex partnerships can be legally recognized .
but it marks the first time the conservative csu has addressed the topic in anything but fairly negative terms . franz josef strauss , long-time , respected csu premier of the state of bavaria who was often referred to as the " strong man of europe , " famously told die zeit newspaper in 1971 that he 'd rather be a " cold warrior than a warm brother . "
-lrb- the latter expression is a pejorative expression for a gay man . -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber has always stressed tradition the csu 's current head , edmund stoiber , once refused to talk about " these partnerships , " saying if he did , he might as well start worshipping the devil . " he probably would n't talk like that that today , but the csu has traditionally had , shall we say , a problematic attitude , " said hellmuth pusch , head of the bavarian section of the lesbian and gay association of germany .
" now we see that some rethinking is taking place . " still , he and other gay groups do not feel like the party has gone as far as it should .
while the new positioning is a slight change , pusch says bavaria and csu are still far behind the rest of germany when it comes to accepting homosexuality .
bavaria was one of the german federal states that went to germany 's highest court to try to block the law allowing registered same-sex partnerships and it is still one of the only states not to allow those partnerships to be registered at the registry office like heterosexual marriages , but requires couples to go to a notary . " but this is a beginning , " he said .
" the csu is are on the right path and we welcome that . " voters on their minds ? while some in the csu might feel its time to jettison , or at least revisit , some traditionalist viewpoints , others see political motives behind the party 's decision .
the left-wing taz daily , known for its clever headlines , entitled its story on the new policy " csu hot for gay voters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a same-sex couple at a registry office in hannover while that might be an exaggeration , it is a fact that the csu is finding its decades-long dominance of bavarian politics slipping a little .
it still got 62 percent of the vote in the last election , but the larger cities in bavaria such as munich , nuremberg and augsburg , are all governed by the spd . " in general , a party which formulates policies that do n't reflect life 's realities will lose more and more voters , " said axel hochrein , head of the bavarian branch of the lsu , a group representing gays and lesbians in the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the csu . warning call the csu 's tentative warming up to gays and lesbians does not sit well with everyone in the party .
a group of eight csu parliamentarians has released a statement warning that the party should not " weaken " its position of privileging traditional marriage .
according to the statement , children need a " father and mother in their different gender roles . " four of the eight lawmakers expressing these conservative sentiments were born in or after 1970 . " in the csu , you ca n't judge by the age of politicians , but you have to look at what area they come from , rural or urban , " said hochrein .
while members from the big bavarian cities advocate for more acceptance , those from rural regions have much different ideas . " in the countryside , which is very catholic and where the church has an enormous influence , even a single mother is still sometimes seen as scandalous , " he said .
" that is the balancing act the party has to deal with .

but it does say the party " acknowledges -lrb- same-sex relationships -rrb- , when people in these partnerships can rely on each other to take responsibility and care for one another . " at a press conference on monday in munich , where the policy position was presented , the head of the policy committee , alois glück , said the csu wanted its new position regarding gay relationships to reflect today 's reality . " the message is , the csu has a realistic and contemporary view on the family , but one which is also values oriented , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's capital munich is pretty gay friendly - the hinterlands less so the position is a nuanced once , which attempts to acknowledge that gay relationships do exist , and that they can have worth , but still firmly putting itself on the side of a traditional view of the family : mother , father and children . " we want to show that we respect the values which are lived in these partnerships , " said deputy party chief beate merk in an interview on bavarian radio , referring to same-sex couples .
" but we want to be clear , that only extends to a certain point . " in the last such policy position statement by the csu , from 1993 , gays and lesbians were not mentioned . the csu and gays some might question the significance of these cautious , almost guarded statements on the issue in a country where same-sex partnerships can be legally recognized .
but it marks the first time the conservative csu has addressed the topic in anything but fairly negative terms . franz josef strauss , long-time , respected csu premier of the state of bavaria who was often referred to as the " strong man of europe , " famously told die zeit newspaper in 1971 that he 'd rather be a " cold warrior than a warm brother . "
-lrb- the latter expression is a pejorative expression for a gay man . -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber has always stressed tradition the csu 's current head , edmund stoiber , once refused to talk about " these partnerships , " saying if he did , he might as well start worshipping the devil . " he probably would n't talk like that that today , but the csu has traditionally had , shall we say , a problematic attitude , " said hellmuth pusch , head of the bavarian section of the lesbian and gay association of germany .
" now we see that some rethinking is taking place . " still , he and other gay groups do not feel like the party has gone as far as it should .
while the new positioning is a slight change , pusch says bavaria and csu are still far behind the rest of germany when it comes to accepting homosexuality .
bavaria was one of the german federal states that went to germany 's highest court to try to block the law allowing registered same-sex partnerships and it is still one of the only states not to allow those partnerships to be registered at the registry office like heterosexual marriages , but requires couples to go to a notary . " but this is a beginning , " he said .
" the csu is are on the right path and we welcome that . " voters on their minds ? while some in the csu might feel its time to jettison , or at least revisit , some traditionalist viewpoints , others see political motives behind the party 's decision .
the left-wing taz daily , known for its clever headlines , entitled its story on the new policy " csu hot for gay voters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a same-sex couple at a registry office in hannover while that might be an exaggeration , it is a fact that the csu is finding its decades-long dominance of bavarian politics slipping a little .
it still got 62 percent of the vote in the last election , but the larger cities in bavaria such as munich , nuremberg and augsburg , are all governed by the spd . " in general , a party which formulates policies that do n't reflect life 's realities will lose more and more voters , " said axel hochrein , head of the bavarian branch of the lsu , a group representing gays and lesbians in the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the csu . warning call the csu 's tentative warming up to gays and lesbians does not sit well with everyone in the party .
a group of eight csu parliamentarians has released a statement warning that the party should not " weaken " its position of privileging traditional marriage .
according to the statement , children need a " father and mother in their different gender roles . " four of the eight lawmakers expressing these conservative sentiments were born in or after 1970 . " in the csu , you ca n't judge by the age of politicians , but you have to look at what area they come from , rural or urban , " said hochrein .
while members from the big bavarian cities advocate for more acceptance , those from rural regions have much different ideas . " in the countryside , which is very catholic and where the church has an enormous influence , even a single mother is still sometimes seen as scandalous , " he said .
" that is the balancing act the party has to deal with .

the party , which is growing in popularity in the former east germany , also holds seats in saxony 's state parliament , where another extremist party is also represented . ' jews do not feel safe ' meanwhile , on saturday the israeli ambassador to germany called the rise of far-right organizations in germany " worrying " and said jews in the country " do not feel safe .

but eads warned it might go to the debt markets next year in order to raise additional financing . group finance director hans-peter ring said that eads " will manage pro-actively its financial requirements and might go to the capital markets in 2007 , " possibly by issuing hybrid bonds . but the company , which has announced delays of up to 24 months in deliveries of the ambitious super-jumbo jet a380 , " has neither the need nor the short-term intention " of making a capital increase , ring insisted . despite eads ' insistence that it finances are very solid , such comments raised the specter of potential financing bottlenecks further down the line .

it must " remain in the german sphere " , the government spokesman ulrich wilhem said recently . german finance minister peer steinbrück defended the idea of a possible state stake in the european aerospace giant eads , in an interview to be published monday . " this is about stabilizing an enterprise , about keeping the jobs of qualified workers and especially about being up to the level of our french partners , " steinbrück said , referring to the delicate french-german balance within eads . his remarks came in response to a question by germany 's suddeutsche zeitung newspaper about whether eads ' problems would continue to grow without state intervention . the minister said no decision had been made about a german public stake in the company , a matter that has sparked speculation in recent days .
" there are possible solutions which are completely defensible from an interventionist point of view , " steinbrueck said . " nobody in the government wants to suddenly transform the federal state into a business , " steinbrück was quoted as saying in the suddeutsche zeitung .
" but we can not let airbus go into bankruptcy simply because society is undergoing an adaptation crisis or because a manufacturer wants to cede its share . " the current balance of power with eads is extremely delicate . germany 's interests are represented by daimlerchrysler 's 22.5-percent stake , while france is represented via a 30-percent interest shared by the state holding company sogeade and media group lagardere . spanish interests are represented by the holding group sepi , which owns 5.48 percent . lagardere has committed itself to halving its stake to put french interests back on a par with germany 's , but the balance of power would be upset if daimlerchrysler were to reduce its stake .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 23.10.2006 schumacher bids emotional farewell to f1 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tears of a champion : schumi prepares for life after his emotional retirement the 37-year-old michael schumacher bade farewell to a life that turned him from the unknown son of a bricklayer into the world 's greatest race-winning ferrari star .
he went out in style . in 15 years of formula one , he had demonstrated over and again a fearsome competitive instinct and an unbeatable will to win .
the statistics that piled up to praise his work were colossal - seven world titles , five with ferrari , 68 pole positions and 91 victories . michael schumacher , however , was left struggling for words on sunday as his career came to a dramatic end at the brazilian grand prix . " today , my racing career comes to an end and , obviously it 's a special moment for me and i am proud to have lived my career with some fantastic people - namely everyone who is a part of the ferrari family , " said the german star . " there is so much to say - i ca n't find the right words .
the things i will miss are probably the fans and in every moment they have been behind me and always supported me . " " their support helped me perform , especially in moments when it was difficult .
over the years that was immensely important .
i can only say thank you to those people and those fans , " schumacher said . no last victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitiveness was schumacher 's default mode in motor racing the seven-time world champion finished his career with one of his most stirring drives to come home in fourth place , cruelly just off the podium .
but he still managed to find a metaphor that brought symmetry to his 15 years of sustained and extraordinary racing .

he went out in style . in 15 years of formula one , he had demonstrated over and again a fearsome competitive instinct and an unbeatable will to win .
the statistics that piled up to praise his work were colossal - seven world titles , five with ferrari , 68 pole positions and 91 victories . michael schumacher , however , was left struggling for words on sunday as his career came to a dramatic end at the brazilian grand prix . " today , my racing career comes to an end and , obviously it 's a special moment for me and i am proud to have lived my career with some fantastic people - namely everyone who is a part of the ferrari family , " said the german star . " there is so much to say - i ca n't find the right words .
the things i will miss are probably the fans and in every moment they have been behind me and always supported me . " " their support helped me perform , especially in moments when it was difficult .
over the years that was immensely important .
i can only say thank you to those people and those fans , " schumacher said . no last victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitiveness was schumacher 's default mode in motor racing the seven-time world champion finished his career with one of his most stirring drives to come home in fourth place , cruelly just off the podium .
but he still managed to find a metaphor that brought symmetry to his 15 years of sustained and extraordinary racing . " in a way , it 's a closed circle now for me , because my formula one career started and finished after 500 meters which was , maybe , a symbol of what happened yesterday . " his words referred to the fact that his first race and his last were hit by problems that wrecked his hopes of victory .
but his actions on the track in his ferrari spoke volumes for his talent , speed , courage and determination as he stormed from the back of the field , after a puncture , to finish fourth . a dramatic race " the race was chaotic , i think that 's the right word , " he said , as rival and second-time champion fernando alonso began his celebrations , having finished second behind his ferrari team-mate felipe massa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher , right , with renault 's fernando alonso , from spain " we really had a superb car today from the pure speed we could have lapped everybody .
so i have to say it was the perfect end to the season in terms of car performance , but for me it did n't work out well . " schumacher offered warm congratulations to massa for his first triumph on brazilian soil . " i 'm very happy for felipe who drove an amazing race , " he said .
" it 's great for him to be the first brazilian to win at interlagos since ayrton senna .
it would have been nice if i could at least have made it to the podium alongside him .
i would also like to congratulate fernando .

a truce seems unlikely with the cabinet set to approve parts of a highly controversial health bill this week . the mass demonstrations organized by germany 's powerful trade unions this weekend saw an estimated 200,000 people take to the streets in protest of the grand coalition 's social and economic policies . in big cities across the country , workers ' representatives vented their anger over what they felt was a lop-sided reform process that was hurting the poor and sparing the affluent .
the mass rallies provoked angry reactions especially by senior conservative members of the ruling coalition of social and christian democrats . they claimed the unions had no right to take to the streets , as they had not made a single reasonable alternative proposal for reforms .
markus söder from the conservative christian social union , the christian democratic union 's bavarian sister party , was one of those who didn ’ t mince his words . conservatives brand unions as obstructive " we 'd have expected the trade unions to be jubilant in the face of a considerable drop in unemployment in the first year of the grand coalition 's work , " he said .
" but all we hear from them is a constant moaning and groaning .
i believe that the unions ' leadership is arch-conservative and that we can not move the country forward together with them .
in my view the unions for us are no longer a serious partner at the negotiating table . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sommer refuted claims that the unions were at fault michael sommer , head of the german confederation of trade unions , dismissed söder 's remarks as appalling and totally unfounded .
but even prominent members of the social democrat party , which traditionally has a working class electorate , said the trade unions are being obstructive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is accused of abandoning the people former chancellor gerhard schröder revealed in his autobiography this week that the trade unions had no small share in making him give up his post in 2005 .
but sommer rejects the accusations saying it 's not the trade unions that stand in the way of the country 's development . government not socially responsible , says union chief " a real risk for the country ’ s development are those companies which are doing well and are pocketing huge profits , but decide to lay off workers at the same time , " sommer said .
" be it the siemens electronics giant , the allianz insurance group or similar companies - they 've all forgotten how to act in a socially responsible way , and we 're not willing to accept that . " and as far as ex-chancellor gerhard schröder 's criticism is concerned - yes , we were against his agenda 2010 reform package because of the inherent social injustices .
but he can not really hold it against us that his party lost in elections . " slow reforms feeding brain drain meanwhile , the head of the german chambers of industry and commerce , ludwig georg braun , has warned that the slow reform process in the country was making more and more people turn their backs on germany and seek employment opportunities elsewhere . according to a recent survey , about 154,000 germans left the country in 2005 alone - the highest number recorded in over 50 years .
braun indicated that more than half of the emigrants were under 35 years of age , many of unable to find low-skill employment in germany and argued that germany needed an improved education policy and a drastic reduction in taxes and social fees to keep these people in the country . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de battling plummeting popularity , merkel vows reform drive german chancellor angela merkel plans to reverse her coalition government 's sinking popularity ratings with a renewed stab at controversial reforms .

a truce seems unlikely with the cabinet set to approve parts of a highly controversial health bill this week . the mass demonstrations organized by germany 's powerful trade unions this weekend saw an estimated 200,000 people take to the streets in protest of the grand coalition 's social and economic policies . in big cities across the country , workers ' representatives vented their anger over what they felt was a lop-sided reform process that was hurting the poor and sparing the affluent .
the mass rallies provoked angry reactions especially by senior conservative members of the ruling coalition of social and christian democrats . they claimed the unions had no right to take to the streets , as they had not made a single reasonable alternative proposal for reforms .
markus söder from the conservative christian social union , the christian democratic union 's bavarian sister party , was one of those who didn ’ t mince his words . conservatives brand unions as obstructive " we 'd have expected the trade unions to be jubilant in the face of a considerable drop in unemployment in the first year of the grand coalition 's work , " he said .
" but all we hear from them is a constant moaning and groaning .

in my view the unions for us are no longer a serious partner at the negotiating table . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sommer refuted claims that the unions were at fault michael sommer , head of the german confederation of trade unions , dismissed söder 's remarks as appalling and totally unfounded .

but sommer rejects the accusations saying it 's not the trade unions that stand in the way of the country 's development . government not socially responsible , says union chief " a real risk for the country ’ s development are those companies which are doing well and are pocketing huge profits , but decide to lay off workers at the same time , " sommer said .
" be it the siemens electronics giant , the allianz insurance group or similar companies - they 've all forgotten how to act in a socially responsible way , and we 're not willing to accept that . " and as far as ex-chancellor gerhard schröder 's criticism is concerned - yes , we were against his agenda 2010 reform package because of the inherent social injustices .

braun indicated that more than half of the emigrants were under 35 years of age , many of unable to find low-skill employment in germany and argued that germany needed an improved education policy and a drastic reduction in taxes and social fees to keep these people in the country . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de battling plummeting popularity , merkel vows reform drive german chancellor angela merkel plans to reverse her coalition government 's sinking popularity ratings with a renewed stab at controversial reforms .

gps navigation systems are beginning to get a bad rep in germany .
that 's probably because germans are actually too good at following instructions .
even when they are told to crash into a toilet shack . if car navigation systems could have their rathers , they would probably all want to be working in germany .
not only because the german autobahn is a speed-racer dream come true , but because germans are very good at following instructions .
if the system tells them to turn right , they turn right .
if it tells them to turn left , they turn left . and although one or two germans will find themselves asking philosophical questions about what it means to turn right or left at any point in their life , most will happily oblige and surrender to that bizarrely infantilizing feeling we all know from looking at the assembling instructions for an ikea cupboard .
it 's called total dependency . it is nice , from time to time , to surrender one 's control .
to feel there is a gentle digitalized voice to guide you through the winding , curving , meandering roads of life .

" from his navigation system all too literally .
30 meters before the crossing he was meant to take , the excessively obedient driver from freiburg drove his suv off the road into a nearby construction site , drove it up a stairway and crashed it into a poor , unsuspecting toilet shack that had never seen this type of action before . police in the eastern german town of rudolstadt said the incident had caused 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,500 -rrb- in damages to the stairway , 100 euros to the car and that the driver was also fined accordingly .
the ongoing fine for extreme obedience is 35 euros . earlier this month another german ignored the sign " closed for construction " on a hamburg highway and followed his navigation system into a pile of sand .
no injuries were reported . a navigation system is , it seems , the new dominatrix : virtual whip in hand , it tells you what to do .

but it does say the party " acknowledges -lrb- same-sex relationships -rrb- , when people in these partnerships can rely on each other to take responsibility and care for one another . " at a press conference on monday in munich , where the policy position was presented , the head of the policy committee , alois glück , said the csu wanted its new position regarding gay relationships to reflect today 's reality . " the message is , the csu has a realistic and contemporary view on the family , but one which is also values oriented , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's capital munich is pretty gay friendly - the hinterlands less so the position is a nuanced once , which attempts to acknowledge that gay relationships do exist , and that they can have worth , but still firmly putting itself on the side of a traditional view of the family : mother , father and children . " we want to show that we respect the values which are lived in these partnerships , " said deputy party chief beate merk in an interview on bavarian radio , referring to same-sex couples .
" but we want to be clear , that only extends to a certain point . " in the last such policy position statement by the csu , from 1993 , gays and lesbians were not mentioned . the csu and gays some might question the significance of these cautious , almost guarded statements on the issue in a country where same-sex partnerships can be legally recognized .
but it marks the first time the conservative csu has addressed the topic in anything but fairly negative terms . franz josef strauss , long-time , respected csu premier of the state of bavaria who was often referred to as the " strong man of europe , " famously told die zeit newspaper in 1971 that he 'd rather be a " cold warrior than a warm brother . "
-lrb- the latter expression is a pejorative expression for a gay man . -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber has always stressed tradition the csu 's current head , edmund stoiber , once refused to talk about " these partnerships , " saying if he did , he might as well start worshipping the devil . " he probably would n't talk like that that today , but the csu has traditionally had , shall we say , a problematic attitude , " said hellmuth pusch , head of the bavarian section of the lesbian and gay association of germany .
" now we see that some rethinking is taking place . " still , he and other gay groups do not feel like the party has gone as far as it should .
while the new positioning is a slight change , pusch says bavaria and csu are still far behind the rest of germany when it comes to accepting homosexuality .
bavaria was one of the german federal states that went to germany 's highest court to try to block the law allowing registered same-sex partnerships and it is still one of the only states not to allow those partnerships to be registered at the registry office like heterosexual marriages , but requires couples to go to a notary . " but this is a beginning , " he said .
" the csu is are on the right path and we welcome that . " voters on their minds ? while some in the csu might feel its time to jettison , or at least revisit , some traditionalist viewpoints , others see political motives behind the party 's decision .
the left-wing taz daily , known for its clever headlines , entitled its story on the new policy " csu hot for gay voters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a same-sex couple at a registry office in hannover while that might be an exaggeration , it is a fact that the csu is finding its decades-long dominance of bavarian politics slipping a little .
it still got 62 percent of the vote in the last election , but the larger cities in bavaria such as munich , nuremberg and augsburg , are all governed by the spd . " in general , a party which formulates policies that do n't reflect life 's realities will lose more and more voters , " said axel hochrein , head of the bavarian branch of the lsu , a group representing gays and lesbians in the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the csu . warning call the csu 's tentative warming up to gays and lesbians does not sit well with everyone in the party .
a group of eight csu parliamentarians has released a statement warning that the party should not " weaken " its position of privileging traditional marriage .
according to the statement , children need a " father and mother in their different gender roles . " four of the eight lawmakers expressing these conservative sentiments were born in or after 1970 . " in the csu , you ca n't judge by the age of politicians , but you have to look at what area they come from , rural or urban , " said hochrein .
while members from the big bavarian cities advocate for more acceptance , those from rural regions have much different ideas . " in the countryside , which is very catholic and where the church has an enormous influence , even a single mother is still sometimes seen as scandalous , " he said .
" that is the balancing act the party has to deal with .

" it is an alarm signal , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will these managers-in-training stick around ?
the country 's federal statistical office said there were 145,000 people who moved abroad in 2005 - about the number of people who live in a small city like potsdam near berlin .
it is the highest number since they began compiling that statistic , in 1954 , an fso spokesperson said . braun : structural problems to blame the most alarming aspect of the news is that more than half of the emigrants are younger than 35 . the main reason for the " brain drain " are the favorable conditions for wage earners in other countries , braun told die welt .
compared with other european countries , germany has high taxes and social security payments , a tight job market , and deficient education and training . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader kurt beck calls for calm in the debate " germany must absolutely deal with its structural problems .
it must become an attractive location for qualified and trained workers , " he said .
in addition , he added , the german job market needs to open up for well-trained foreign workers . beck calls for calm kurt beck , head of the social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the warning by the chamber of commerce was " rather excessive , " and called for calm in the debate . " when german firms expand across the globe , they also send their workers overseas , " he told the press .
" in a free society , it is normal to move overseas . "
in the end , what is important is that approximately equal numbers of people leave the country and come into the country , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should open up to more qualified workers from abroad , some say for his part , spd education and training expert jörg tauss said businesses are to blame for the high numbers of germans who leave and never come back . " an economy that ca n't offer jobs to qualified people - which simply offers them unpaid internships month after month , and has no concept of how to lure people back to open positions in germany - has no right to complain over the consequences of its own policies , " he told afp . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german scientists go abroad to pursue stem cell research german laws regarding embryonic stem cells are among the most restrictive in the world .
that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited .
-lrb- 11.07.2006 -rrb- german emigration hits highest level in 55 years germans are moving abroad in record numbers .
according to the latest migration statistics , around 145,000 germans left home for greener pastures last year , the highest tally since 1950 .
-lrb- 07.07.2006 -rrb- eu must change its immigration policy , experts warn rather than building the walls around " fortress europe " higher , as many eu politicians favor , migration experts say the eu needs a new progressive policy on immigration - for its own good .

even the chief executive 's job could be on the line . out of a full time workforce of 167,000 employed worldwide by the bonn-based telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , 74,000 employees are superfluous , according to the sunday newspaper , frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , which cited an internal company report circulated by the management board . the internal memo made perfectly clear that the cost to consumers of subscribing to deutsche telekom 's telephone and internet services is significantly higher than that of its competitors . competitors charge much less its t-com fixed line and t-online internet subsidiaries charge 71 euros monthly for flatrate connections or double that of a low-cost , no-name competitor , called 2play net.fon , for example .
other better known competitors , such as aol and arcor , which also offer high-speed dsl connections well below telekom 's rates , charge 55 euros and 50 euros for the same package , respectively . one reason cited for higher prices that are passed on to consumers , are inefficient structures and duplication of services that reduce productivity and lead to bloated costs .
several german newspapers had reported over the weekend that in addition to 32,000 positions to be eliminated by 2008 , an additional 23,000 jobs would be cut by 2010 . additional job cuts can not be ruled out ulrich lissek , chief spokesman for telekom could not confirm the figures , but told reporters that the conglomerate " has always said that in the face of regulatory and technological changes , we can not rule out the elimination of additional jobs after 2008 . " meanwhile telekom has been losing domestic clients for its fixed line services , while its t-mobile cell phone unit is growing mainly because of its us activities .
the additional job cuts at deutsche telekom do not come as a surprise since the former state-owned monopoly , which was privatised in 1995 , has been cutting more than 10,000 jobs a year in the last decade in order to raise its profitability and competitiveness . furthermore , telekom chief kai-uwe ricke has repeatedly said that moves to cut more jobs would not necessarily cease in 2008 . telekom chief under heavy pressure even ricke 's own job could be on the line .
directors at telekom are apparently mulling the future of their boss , whose contract expires in 2007 .
the decision to renew ricke 's contract or replace him is expected to be made in december .
since a profits warning was issued this august , ricke has been under considerable pressure , as the number of fixed line subscribers has dropped and growth in the wireless sector has slowed down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom chief 's contract expires next year one name that has been bandied about to replace ricke , is ben verwaayen , the chief executive of british telecom , although the german government , which holds more than 30 percent of telekom directly and indirectly through the state-owned bank kfw , could favour an internal candidate according to the financial times . political fallout from job cuts the government 's key consideration is to minimise the political fallout from job cutbacks in the fixed line business .
ricke had deferred to such political concerns last year when he reduced his demand for job cuts by half from 60,000 down to 30,000 . the worker 's union verdi claims that new internet technologies will require fewer personnel , so that ricke 's talk of " streamlining operations " is irrelevant anyway . deutsche telekom is not the only major german company slashing jobs on a massive scale .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.10.2006 deutsche telekom may axe more than 70,000 jobs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is one of germany 's largest employers in order to remain competitive , deutsche telekom needs to reduce costs and increase productivity by eliminating tens of thousands of jobs in the next few years .
even the chief executive 's job could be on the line . out of a full time workforce of 167,000 employed worldwide by the bonn-based telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , 74,000 employees are superfluous , according to the sunday newspaper , frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , which cited an internal company report circulated by the management board . the internal memo made perfectly clear that the cost to consumers of subscribing to deutsche telekom 's telephone and internet services is significantly higher than that of its competitors . competitors charge much less its t-com fixed line and t-online internet subsidiaries charge 71 euros monthly for flatrate connections or double that of a low-cost , no-name competitor , called 2play net.fon , for example .
other better known competitors , such as aol and arcor , which also offer high-speed dsl connections well below telekom 's rates , charge 55 euros and 50 euros for the same package , respectively . one reason cited for higher prices that are passed on to consumers , are inefficient structures and duplication of services that reduce productivity and lead to bloated costs .
several german newspapers had reported over the weekend that in addition to 32,000 positions to be eliminated by 2008 , an additional 23,000 jobs would be cut by 2010 . additional job cuts can not be ruled out ulrich lissek , chief spokesman for telekom could not confirm the figures , but told reporters that the conglomerate " has always said that in the face of regulatory and technological changes , we can not rule out the elimination of additional jobs after 2008 . " meanwhile telekom has been losing domestic clients for its fixed line services , while its t-mobile cell phone unit is growing mainly because of its us activities .
the additional job cuts at deutsche telekom do not come as a surprise since the former state-owned monopoly , which was privatised in 1995 , has been cutting more than 10,000 jobs a year in the last decade in order to raise its profitability and competitiveness . furthermore , telekom chief kai-uwe ricke has repeatedly said that moves to cut more jobs would not necessarily cease in 2008 . telekom chief under heavy pressure even ricke 's own job could be on the line .
directors at telekom are apparently mulling the future of their boss , whose contract expires in 2007 .
the decision to renew ricke 's contract or replace him is expected to be made in december .
since a profits warning was issued this august , ricke has been under considerable pressure , as the number of fixed line subscribers has dropped and growth in the wireless sector has slowed down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom chief 's contract expires next year one name that has been bandied about to replace ricke , is ben verwaayen , the chief executive of british telecom , although the german government , which holds more than 30 percent of telekom directly and indirectly through the state-owned bank kfw , could favour an internal candidate according to the financial times . political fallout from job cuts the government 's key consideration is to minimise the political fallout from job cutbacks in the fixed line business .
ricke had deferred to such political concerns last year when he reduced his demand for job cuts by half from 60,000 down to 30,000 . the worker 's union verdi claims that new internet technologies will require fewer personnel , so that ricke 's talk of " streamlining operations " is irrelevant anyway . deutsche telekom is not the only major german company slashing jobs on a massive scale .
in the pharmaceutical sector , bayer 's recent takeover of schering will result in the elimination of 6,000 positions , the insolvency of benq mobile , the wireless manufacturer , has put 3,000 jobs on the line , while automobile giant volkswagen plans to cut 20,000 jobs by 2009 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's t-mobile wins licenses in the united states german telecommunications giant t-mobile is geared to expand its presence on the us market .

" we are not dealing with nato matters , we are dealing with european defense , " said conference chairman reimar scherz , a retired brigadier general .
" for us it is very important to have a status report on where we are and where we 're going . " " the decisions are taken in brussels as far as european defense and security policies are concerned … and we have installed a european armament agency . " the western alliance nato is the number one security force in europe , but the european union is building its own defense force to strengthen its own defense capabilities and deal in crisis situations where nato is not engaged . the ultimate goal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl von wogau wants an efficient eu army the eu 's ultimate aim , according to the 1999 helsinki agreement and the 2004 headline goal is to create by 2010 a european military force of 50 to 60 thousand soldiers who can be deployed within 60 days and sustained in the field for at least one year . " european member states spend annually 170 billion euros -lrb- 215 billion -rrb- on defense , " said congress president karl von wogau , who is also chairman of the subcommittee on security and defence of the european parliament . " that 's a small amount , some 40 percent of what the americans spend .
but the americans are saying : you give out 40 percent , but your efficiency is at 10 percent .
which means we lose efficiency by often doing the same thing 25 times , " he said . the eu currently has 6,000 troops stationed in bosnia herzegovina and 2,000 in the democratic republic of congo .
a mission in macedonia was also recently completed . getting battle groups ready bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is increasingly taking on military roles in the world one of the eu priorities in defense matters is to make sure that its planned mobile battle groups are properly equipped and ready to report for duty early next year . " we have made decisions as far eu battle groups are concerned , " scherz said .
" there will be 13 battle groups early next year ...
1,500 soldiers each , and germany is participating in four battle groups .

" we are not dealing with nato matters , we are dealing with european defense , " said conference chairman reimar scherz , a retired brigadier general .
" for us it is very important to have a status report on where we are and where we 're going . " " the decisions are taken in brussels as far as european defense and security policies are concerned … and we have installed a european armament agency . " the western alliance nato is the number one security force in europe , but the european union is building its own defense force to strengthen its own defense capabilities and deal in crisis situations where nato is not engaged . the ultimate goal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl von wogau wants an efficient eu army the eu 's ultimate aim , according to the 1999 helsinki agreement and the 2004 headline goal is to create by 2010 a european military force of 50 to 60 thousand soldiers who can be deployed within 60 days and sustained in the field for at least one year . " european member states spend annually 170 billion euros -lrb- 215 billion -rrb- on defense , " said congress president karl von wogau , who is also chairman of the subcommittee on security and defence of the european parliament . " that 's a small amount , some 40 percent of what the americans spend .
but the americans are saying : you give out 40 percent , but your efficiency is at 10 percent .
which means we lose efficiency by often doing the same thing 25 times , " he said . the eu currently has 6,000 troops stationed in bosnia herzegovina and 2,000 in the democratic republic of congo .
a mission in macedonia was also recently completed . getting battle groups ready bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is increasingly taking on military roles in the world one of the eu priorities in defense matters is to make sure that its planned mobile battle groups are properly equipped and ready to report for duty early next year . " we have made decisions as far eu battle groups are concerned , " scherz said .
" there will be 13 battle groups early next year ...
1,500 soldiers each , and germany is participating in four battle groups .
those decisions have been taken , but the question is how these decisions will be implemented . " the battle groups will be similar to nato 's rapid reaction force , but will be under eu command .

gps navigation systems are beginning to get a bad rep in germany .
that 's probably because germans are actually too good at following instructions .
even when they are told to crash into a toilet shack . if car navigation systems could have their rathers , they would probably all want to be working in germany .
not only because the german autobahn is a speed-racer dream come true , but because germans are very good at following instructions .
if the system tells them to turn right , they turn right .
if it tells them to turn left , they turn left . and although one or two germans will find themselves asking philosophical questions about what it means to turn right or left at any point in their life , most will happily oblige and surrender to that bizarrely infantilizing feeling we all know from looking at the assembling instructions for an ikea cupboard .
it 's called total dependency . it is nice , from time to time , to surrender one 's control .
to feel there is a gentle digitalized voice to guide you through the winding , curving , meandering roads of life .
to know that you can will a virtual pat on the shoulder every time you do something right .
navigation systems are low-maintenance life companions : they never get tired and they do n't need anything for christmas . taking things literally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no toilet booth is safe any more a 53-year-old german driver recently took the command " turn right now ! " from his navigation system all too literally .
30 meters before the crossing he was meant to take , the excessively obedient driver from freiburg drove his suv off the road into a nearby construction site , drove it up a stairway and crashed it into a poor , unsuspecting toilet shack that had never seen this type of action before . police in the eastern german town of rudolstadt said the incident had caused 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,500 -rrb- in damages to the stairway , 100 euros to the car and that the driver was also fined accordingly .
the ongoing fine for extreme obedience is 35 euros . earlier this month another german ignored the sign " closed for construction " on a hamburg highway and followed his navigation system into a pile of sand .
no injuries were reported . a navigation system is , it seems , the new dominatrix : virtual whip in hand , it tells you what to do .
it is up to you to decide how much pain you 're willing to take on . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flushed with german pride when american gis in iraq get the call of nature , they politely ask to be excused and tiptoe off to the ladies ' room .

gps navigation systems are beginning to get a bad rep in germany .
that 's probably because germans are actually too good at following instructions .

not only because the german autobahn is a speed-racer dream come true , but because germans are very good at following instructions .
if the system tells them to turn right , they turn right .
if it tells them to turn left , they turn left . and although one or two germans will find themselves asking philosophical questions about what it means to turn right or left at any point in their life , most will happily oblige and surrender to that bizarrely infantilizing feeling we all know from looking at the assembling instructions for an ikea cupboard .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.10.2006 deutsche telekom may axe more than 70,000 jobs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is one of germany 's largest employers in order to remain competitive , deutsche telekom needs to reduce costs and increase productivity by eliminating tens of thousands of jobs in the next few years .
even the chief executive 's job could be on the line . out of a full time workforce of 167,000 employed worldwide by the bonn-based telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , 74,000 employees are superfluous , according to the sunday newspaper , frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , which cited an internal company report circulated by the management board . the internal memo made perfectly clear that the cost to consumers of subscribing to deutsche telekom 's telephone and internet services is significantly higher than that of its competitors . competitors charge much less its t-com fixed line and t-online internet subsidiaries charge 71 euros monthly for flatrate connections or double that of a low-cost , no-name competitor , called 2play net.fon , for example .
other better known competitors , such as aol and arcor , which also offer high-speed dsl connections well below telekom 's rates , charge 55 euros and 50 euros for the same package , respectively . one reason cited for higher prices that are passed on to consumers , are inefficient structures and duplication of services that reduce productivity and lead to bloated costs .
several german newspapers had reported over the weekend that in addition to 32,000 positions to be eliminated by 2008 , an additional 23,000 jobs would be cut by 2010 . additional job cuts can not be ruled out ulrich lissek , chief spokesman for telekom could not confirm the figures , but told reporters that the conglomerate " has always said that in the face of regulatory and technological changes , we can not rule out the elimination of additional jobs after 2008 . " meanwhile telekom has been losing domestic clients for its fixed line services , while its t-mobile cell phone unit is growing mainly because of its us activities .
the additional job cuts at deutsche telekom do not come as a surprise since the former state-owned monopoly , which was privatised in 1995 , has been cutting more than 10,000 jobs a year in the last decade in order to raise its profitability and competitiveness . furthermore , telekom chief kai-uwe ricke has repeatedly said that moves to cut more jobs would not necessarily cease in 2008 . telekom chief under heavy pressure even ricke 's own job could be on the line .
directors at telekom are apparently mulling the future of their boss , whose contract expires in 2007 .
the decision to renew ricke 's contract or replace him is expected to be made in december .
since a profits warning was issued this august , ricke has been under considerable pressure , as the number of fixed line subscribers has dropped and growth in the wireless sector has slowed down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom chief 's contract expires next year one name that has been bandied about to replace ricke , is ben verwaayen , the chief executive of british telecom , although the german government , which holds more than 30 percent of telekom directly and indirectly through the state-owned bank kfw , could favour an internal candidate according to the financial times . political fallout from job cuts the government 's key consideration is to minimise the political fallout from job cutbacks in the fixed line business .
ricke had deferred to such political concerns last year when he reduced his demand for job cuts by half from 60,000 down to 30,000 . the worker 's union verdi claims that new internet technologies will require fewer personnel , so that ricke 's talk of " streamlining operations " is irrelevant anyway . deutsche telekom is not the only major german company slashing jobs on a massive scale .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.10.2006 deutsche telekom may axe more than 70,000 jobs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is one of germany 's largest employers in order to remain competitive , deutsche telekom needs to reduce costs and increase productivity by eliminating tens of thousands of jobs in the next few years .
even the chief executive 's job could be on the line . out of a full time workforce of 167,000 employed worldwide by the bonn-based telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , 74,000 employees are superfluous , according to the sunday newspaper , frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , which cited an internal company report circulated by the management board . the internal memo made perfectly clear that the cost to consumers of subscribing to deutsche telekom 's telephone and internet services is significantly higher than that of its competitors . competitors charge much less its t-com fixed line and t-online internet subsidiaries charge 71 euros monthly for flatrate connections or double that of a low-cost , no-name competitor , called 2play net.fon , for example .
other better known competitors , such as aol and arcor , which also offer high-speed dsl connections well below telekom 's rates , charge 55 euros and 50 euros for the same package , respectively . one reason cited for higher prices that are passed on to consumers , are inefficient structures and duplication of services that reduce productivity and lead to bloated costs .
several german newspapers had reported over the weekend that in addition to 32,000 positions to be eliminated by 2008 , an additional 23,000 jobs would be cut by 2010 . additional job cuts can not be ruled out ulrich lissek , chief spokesman for telekom could not confirm the figures , but told reporters that the conglomerate " has always said that in the face of regulatory and technological changes , we can not rule out the elimination of additional jobs after 2008 . " meanwhile telekom has been losing domestic clients for its fixed line services , while its t-mobile cell phone unit is growing mainly because of its us activities .
the additional job cuts at deutsche telekom do not come as a surprise since the former state-owned monopoly , which was privatised in 1995 , has been cutting more than 10,000 jobs a year in the last decade in order to raise its profitability and competitiveness . furthermore , telekom chief kai-uwe ricke has repeatedly said that moves to cut more jobs would not necessarily cease in 2008 . telekom chief under heavy pressure even ricke 's own job could be on the line .
directors at telekom are apparently mulling the future of their boss , whose contract expires in 2007 .
the decision to renew ricke 's contract or replace him is expected to be made in december .
since a profits warning was issued this august , ricke has been under considerable pressure , as the number of fixed line subscribers has dropped and growth in the wireless sector has slowed down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom chief 's contract expires next year one name that has been bandied about to replace ricke , is ben verwaayen , the chief executive of british telecom , although the german government , which holds more than 30 percent of telekom directly and indirectly through the state-owned bank kfw , could favour an internal candidate according to the financial times . political fallout from job cuts the government 's key consideration is to minimise the political fallout from job cutbacks in the fixed line business .
ricke had deferred to such political concerns last year when he reduced his demand for job cuts by half from 60,000 down to 30,000 . the worker 's union verdi claims that new internet technologies will require fewer personnel , so that ricke 's talk of " streamlining operations " is irrelevant anyway . deutsche telekom is not the only major german company slashing jobs on a massive scale .
in the pharmaceutical sector , bayer 's recent takeover of schering will result in the elimination of 6,000 positions , the insolvency of benq mobile , the wireless manufacturer , has put 3,000 jobs on the line , while automobile giant volkswagen plans to cut 20,000 jobs by 2009 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's t-mobile wins licenses in the united states german telecommunications giant t-mobile is geared to expand its presence on the us market .

a truce seems unlikely with the cabinet set to approve parts of a highly controversial health bill this week . the mass demonstrations organized by germany 's powerful trade unions this weekend saw an estimated 200,000 people take to the streets in protest of the grand coalition 's social and economic policies . in big cities across the country , workers ' representatives vented their anger over what they felt was a lop-sided reform process that was hurting the poor and sparing the affluent .
the mass rallies provoked angry reactions especially by senior conservative members of the ruling coalition of social and christian democrats . they claimed the unions had no right to take to the streets , as they had not made a single reasonable alternative proposal for reforms .
markus söder from the conservative christian social union , the christian democratic union 's bavarian sister party , was one of those who didn ’ t mince his words . conservatives brand unions as obstructive " we 'd have expected the trade unions to be jubilant in the face of a considerable drop in unemployment in the first year of the grand coalition 's work , " he said .
" but all we hear from them is a constant moaning and groaning .

in my view the unions for us are no longer a serious partner at the negotiating table . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sommer refuted claims that the unions were at fault michael sommer , head of the german confederation of trade unions , dismissed söder 's remarks as appalling and totally unfounded .

" be it the siemens electronics giant , the allianz insurance group or similar companies - they 've all forgotten how to act in a socially responsible way , and we 're not willing to accept that . " and as far as ex-chancellor gerhard schröder 's criticism is concerned - yes , we were against his agenda 2010 reform package because of the inherent social injustices .

he went out in style . in 15 years of formula one , he had demonstrated over and again a fearsome competitive instinct and an unbeatable will to win .
the statistics that piled up to praise his work were colossal - seven world titles , five with ferrari , 68 pole positions and 91 victories . michael schumacher , however , was left struggling for words on sunday as his career came to a dramatic end at the brazilian grand prix . " today , my racing career comes to an end and , obviously it 's a special moment for me and i am proud to have lived my career with some fantastic people - namely everyone who is a part of the ferrari family , " said the german star . " there is so much to say - i ca n't find the right words .
the things i will miss are probably the fans and in every moment they have been behind me and always supported me . " " their support helped me perform , especially in moments when it was difficult .
over the years that was immensely important .
i can only say thank you to those people and those fans , " schumacher said . no last victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitiveness was schumacher 's default mode in motor racing the seven-time world champion finished his career with one of his most stirring drives to come home in fourth place , cruelly just off the podium .
but he still managed to find a metaphor that brought symmetry to his 15 years of sustained and extraordinary racing .

he went out in style . in 15 years of formula one , he had demonstrated over and again a fearsome competitive instinct and an unbeatable will to win .
the statistics that piled up to praise his work were colossal - seven world titles , five with ferrari , 68 pole positions and 91 victories . michael schumacher , however , was left struggling for words on sunday as his career came to a dramatic end at the brazilian grand prix . " today , my racing career comes to an end and , obviously it 's a special moment for me and i am proud to have lived my career with some fantastic people - namely everyone who is a part of the ferrari family , " said the german star . " there is so much to say - i ca n't find the right words .
the things i will miss are probably the fans and in every moment they have been behind me and always supported me . " " their support helped me perform , especially in moments when it was difficult .
over the years that was immensely important .
i can only say thank you to those people and those fans , " schumacher said . no last victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitiveness was schumacher 's default mode in motor racing the seven-time world champion finished his career with one of his most stirring drives to come home in fourth place , cruelly just off the podium .
but he still managed to find a metaphor that brought symmetry to his 15 years of sustained and extraordinary racing . " in a way , it 's a closed circle now for me , because my formula one career started and finished after 500 meters which was , maybe , a symbol of what happened yesterday . " his words referred to the fact that his first race and his last were hit by problems that wrecked his hopes of victory .
but his actions on the track in his ferrari spoke volumes for his talent , speed , courage and determination as he stormed from the back of the field , after a puncture , to finish fourth . a dramatic race " the race was chaotic , i think that 's the right word , " he said , as rival and second-time champion fernando alonso began his celebrations , having finished second behind his ferrari team-mate felipe massa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher , right , with renault 's fernando alonso , from spain " we really had a superb car today from the pure speed we could have lapped everybody .
so i have to say it was the perfect end to the season in terms of car performance , but for me it did n't work out well . " schumacher offered warm congratulations to massa for his first triumph on brazilian soil . " i 'm very happy for felipe who drove an amazing race , " he said .
" it 's great for him to be the first brazilian to win at interlagos since ayrton senna .
it would have been nice if i could at least have made it to the podium alongside him .
i would also like to congratulate fernando .

a truce seems unlikely with the cabinet set to approve parts of a highly controversial health bill this week . the mass demonstrations organized by germany 's powerful trade unions this weekend saw an estimated 200,000 people take to the streets in protest of the grand coalition 's social and economic policies . in big cities across the country , workers ' representatives vented their anger over what they felt was a lop-sided reform process that was hurting the poor and sparing the affluent .
the mass rallies provoked angry reactions especially by senior conservative members of the ruling coalition of social and christian democrats . they claimed the unions had no right to take to the streets , as they had not made a single reasonable alternative proposal for reforms .
markus söder from the conservative christian social union , the christian democratic union 's bavarian sister party , was one of those who didn ’ t mince his words . conservatives brand unions as obstructive " we 'd have expected the trade unions to be jubilant in the face of a considerable drop in unemployment in the first year of the grand coalition 's work , " he said .
" but all we hear from them is a constant moaning and groaning .
i believe that the unions ' leadership is arch-conservative and that we can not move the country forward together with them .
in my view the unions for us are no longer a serious partner at the negotiating table . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sommer refuted claims that the unions were at fault michael sommer , head of the german confederation of trade unions , dismissed söder 's remarks as appalling and totally unfounded .

but sommer rejects the accusations saying it 's not the trade unions that stand in the way of the country 's development . government not socially responsible , says union chief " a real risk for the country ’ s development are those companies which are doing well and are pocketing huge profits , but decide to lay off workers at the same time , " sommer said .
" be it the siemens electronics giant , the allianz insurance group or similar companies - they 've all forgotten how to act in a socially responsible way , and we 're not willing to accept that .

but eads warned it might go to the debt markets next year in order to raise additional financing . group finance director hans-peter ring said that eads " will manage pro-actively its financial requirements and might go to the capital markets in 2007 , " possibly by issuing hybrid bonds . but the company , which has announced delays of up to 24 months in deliveries of the ambitious super-jumbo jet a380 , " has neither the need nor the short-term intention " of making a capital increase , ring insisted . despite eads ' insistence that it finances are very solid , such comments raised the specter of potential financing bottlenecks further down the line .
and that could explain the government 's chronic prevarication as to how best safeguard german interests in the company . after all , if the german state does acquire a stake in the company , it will be compelled to put up a large chunk of the financing should a capital increase ever become necessary . what will daimler do ? the crunch of the matter lies with german-us auto maker daimlerchrysler , which holds a stake of 22.5 percent in eads but has signaled its intention to reduce that stake to 15 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an a380 superjumbo - the source of many problems berlin is adamant that the 7.5-percent stake being put for sale should remain in german hands and must not be allowed to fall into french or even russian hands .
it must " remain in the german sphere " , the government spokesman ulrich wilhem said recently . german finance minister peer steinbrück defended the idea of a possible state stake in the european aerospace giant eads , in an interview to be published monday . " this is about stabilizing an enterprise , about keeping the jobs of qualified workers and especially about being up to the level of our french partners , " steinbrück said , referring to the delicate french-german balance within eads . his remarks came in response to a question by germany 's suddeutsche zeitung newspaper about whether eads ' problems would continue to grow without state intervention . the minister said no decision had been made about a german public stake in the company , a matter that has sparked speculation in recent days .
" there are possible solutions which are completely defensible from an interventionist point of view , " steinbrueck said . " nobody in the government wants to suddenly transform the federal state into a business , " steinbrück was quoted as saying in the suddeutsche zeitung .
" but we can not let airbus go into bankruptcy simply because society is undergoing an adaptation crisis or because a manufacturer wants to cede its share . " the current balance of power with eads is extremely delicate . germany 's interests are represented by daimlerchrysler 's 22.5-percent stake , while france is represented via a 30-percent interest shared by the state holding company sogeade and media group lagardere . spanish interests are represented by the holding group sepi , which owns 5.48 percent . lagardere has committed itself to halving its stake to put french interests back on a par with germany 's , but the balance of power would be upset if daimlerchrysler were to reduce its stake .
in september , russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank bought 5.02 percent and moscow has signaled its intention of increasing its say in the company , a development that would be welcomed by eads german co-chief executive , thomas enders . enders said in a newspaper interview published on monday that he welcomed the acquisition of a stake in the european aerospace giant by the russian state .
" the entry of the russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank into eads share capital underlines the huge interest of russian investors " in the european aeronautic defence and space company , enders told the daily die welt .
" cooperation with the russian aerospace industry is of strategic importance for us .
russia is not only an important market , but it has a great deal of experience in the development and construction of aircraft , " enders said . calls for and against state involvement daimlerchrysler chief dieter zetsche is opposed to the idea of the german state acquiring the shares . " fundamentally , an increase in state influence is not desirable for the group , " he told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . there is also opposition within eads to the idea of state involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus plant in hamburg enders said in an interview published in the wall street journal that such a solution would mark a " return to the stone age . " but there are plenty of people in germany , not least a number of top-ranking politicians , who argue that is the government 's patriotic duty to get its hands on the shares . the group 's plane maker airbus employs 22,000 people at seven different sites around the country .
the northern port of hamburg is home to airbus ' biggest german site . the government " has a crucial political responsibility " in the matter , the chief whip of the social democrat spd party , peter struck , insisted . a number of politicians have said the government should acquire the stake via the state-owned redevelopment bank kfw . hamburg mayor ole von beust caused a stir last week when he said that a corresponding deal had been reached .
but chancellor angela merkel swiftly qualified that statement , insisting that no decision had been made yet . but she added : " i 'm not ruling anything out " . economy minister michael glos insists that a future investor in eads should come from the private sector .
newspapers have suggested that a group of suppliers to airbus or even a consortium of banks could take daimlerchrysler 's stake . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus parent company considers selling factories the european aerospace group eads would consider selling some airbus factories provided that new owners could reduce operating costs , eads co-chairman manfred bischoff said on friday .

but eads warned it might go to the debt markets next year in order to raise additional financing . group finance director hans-peter ring said that eads " will manage pro-actively its financial requirements and might go to the capital markets in 2007 , " possibly by issuing hybrid bonds . but the company , which has announced delays of up to 24 months in deliveries of the ambitious super-jumbo jet a380 , " has neither the need nor the short-term intention " of making a capital increase , ring insisted . despite eads ' insistence that it finances are very solid , such comments raised the specter of potential financing bottlenecks further down the line .
and that could explain the government 's chronic prevarication as to how best safeguard german interests in the company . after all , if the german state does acquire a stake in the company , it will be compelled to put up a large chunk of the financing should a capital increase ever become necessary . what will daimler do ? the crunch of the matter lies with german-us auto maker daimlerchrysler , which holds a stake of 22.5 percent in eads but has signaled its intention to reduce that stake to 15 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an a380 superjumbo - the source of many problems berlin is adamant that the 7.5-percent stake being put for sale should remain in german hands and must not be allowed to fall into french or even russian hands .
it must " remain in the german sphere " , the government spokesman ulrich wilhem said recently . german finance minister peer steinbrück defended the idea of a possible state stake in the european aerospace giant eads , in an interview to be published monday . " this is about stabilizing an enterprise , about keeping the jobs of qualified workers and especially about being up to the level of our french partners , " steinbrück said , referring to the delicate french-german balance within eads . his remarks came in response to a question by germany 's suddeutsche zeitung newspaper about whether eads ' problems would continue to grow without state intervention . the minister said no decision had been made about a german public stake in the company , a matter that has sparked speculation in recent days .
" there are possible solutions which are completely defensible from an interventionist point of view , " steinbrueck said . " nobody in the government wants to suddenly transform the federal state into a business , " steinbrück was quoted as saying in the suddeutsche zeitung .
" but we can not let airbus go into bankruptcy simply because society is undergoing an adaptation crisis or because a manufacturer wants to cede its share . " the current balance of power with eads is extremely delicate . germany 's interests are represented by daimlerchrysler 's 22.5-percent stake , while france is represented via a 30-percent interest shared by the state holding company sogeade and media group lagardere . spanish interests are represented by the holding group sepi , which owns 5.48 percent . lagardere has committed itself to halving its stake to put french interests back on a par with germany 's , but the balance of power would be upset if daimlerchrysler were to reduce its stake .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 23.10.2006 bavarian conservatives inch towards acceptance of gays großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the csu appears a little more tolerant of gay bavarians these days the majority party of bavaria , the christian social union , has for the first time recognized that some gay relationships have value , although equating them with traditional marriage remains out of the question . the recognition , which is seen by some as a long-overdue wake-up to reality and by others as a danger to the traditional family , comes in the form of a draft policy statement released by the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- on monday . in the eight-page section on family policy , the party in power for decades in largely catholic , widely conservative bavaria rejects the idea of giving same-sex partnerships the same legal foundation as a marriage between a man and a women , or allowing gay and lesbian couples to adopt children .
but it does say the party " acknowledges -lrb- same-sex relationships -rrb- , when people in these partnerships can rely on each other to take responsibility and care for one another . " at a press conference on monday in munich , where the policy position was presented , the head of the policy committee , alois glück , said the csu wanted its new position regarding gay relationships to reflect today 's reality . " the message is , the csu has a realistic and contemporary view on the family , but one which is also values oriented , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's capital munich is pretty gay friendly - the hinterlands less so the position is a nuanced once , which attempts to acknowledge that gay relationships do exist , and that they can have worth , but still firmly putting itself on the side of a traditional view of the family : mother , father and children . " we want to show that we respect the values which are lived in these partnerships , " said deputy party chief beate merk in an interview on bavarian radio , referring to same-sex couples .
" but we want to be clear , that only extends to a certain point . " in the last such policy position statement by the csu , from 1993 , gays and lesbians were not mentioned . the csu and gays some might question the significance of these cautious , almost guarded statements on the issue in a country where same-sex partnerships can be legally recognized .
but it marks the first time the conservative csu has addressed the topic in anything but fairly negative terms . franz josef strauss , long-time , respected csu premier of the state of bavaria who was often referred to as the " strong man of europe , " famously told die zeit newspaper in 1971 that he 'd rather be a " cold warrior than a warm brother . "
-lrb- the latter expression is a pejorative expression for a gay man . -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber has always stressed tradition the csu 's current head , edmund stoiber , once refused to talk about " these partnerships , " saying if he did , he might as well start worshipping the devil . " he probably would n't talk like that that today , but the csu has traditionally had , shall we say , a problematic attitude , " said hellmuth pusch , head of the bavarian section of the lesbian and gay association of germany .
" now we see that some rethinking is taking place . " still , he and other gay groups do not feel like the party has gone as far as it should .
while the new positioning is a slight change , pusch says bavaria and csu are still far behind the rest of germany when it comes to accepting homosexuality .
bavaria was one of the german federal states that went to germany 's highest court to try to block the law allowing registered same-sex partnerships and it is still one of the only states not to allow those partnerships to be registered at the registry office like heterosexual marriages , but requires couples to go to a notary . " but this is a beginning , " he said .
" the csu is are on the right path and we welcome that . " voters on their minds ? while some in the csu might feel its time to jettison , or at least revisit , some traditionalist viewpoints , others see political motives behind the party 's decision .
the left-wing taz daily , known for its clever headlines , entitled its story on the new policy " csu hot for gay voters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a same-sex couple at a registry office in hannover while that might be an exaggeration , it is a fact that the csu is finding its decades-long dominance of bavarian politics slipping a little .
it still got 62 percent of the vote in the last election , but the larger cities in bavaria such as munich , nuremberg and augsburg , are all governed by the spd . " in general , a party which formulates policies that do n't reflect life 's realities will lose more and more voters , " said axel hochrein , head of the bavarian branch of the lsu , a group representing gays and lesbians in the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the csu . warning call the csu 's tentative warming up to gays and lesbians does not sit well with everyone in the party .
a group of eight csu parliamentarians has released a statement warning that the party should not " weaken " its position of privileging traditional marriage .
according to the statement , children need a " father and mother in their different gender roles . " four of the eight lawmakers expressing these conservative sentiments were born in or after 1970 . " in the csu , you ca n't judge by the age of politicians , but you have to look at what area they come from , rural or urban , " said hochrein .

but it does say the party " acknowledges -lrb- same-sex relationships -rrb- , when people in these partnerships can rely on each other to take responsibility and care for one another . " at a press conference on monday in munich , where the policy position was presented , the head of the policy committee , alois glück , said the csu wanted its new position regarding gay relationships to reflect today 's reality . " the message is , the csu has a realistic and contemporary view on the family , but one which is also values oriented , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's capital munich is pretty gay friendly - the hinterlands less so the position is a nuanced once , which attempts to acknowledge that gay relationships do exist , and that they can have worth , but still firmly putting itself on the side of a traditional view of the family : mother , father and children . " we want to show that we respect the values which are lived in these partnerships , " said deputy party chief beate merk in an interview on bavarian radio , referring to same-sex couples .
" but we want to be clear , that only extends to a certain point . " in the last such policy position statement by the csu , from 1993 , gays and lesbians were not mentioned . the csu and gays some might question the significance of these cautious , almost guarded statements on the issue in a country where same-sex partnerships can be legally recognized .
but it marks the first time the conservative csu has addressed the topic in anything but fairly negative terms . franz josef strauss , long-time , respected csu premier of the state of bavaria who was often referred to as the " strong man of europe , " famously told die zeit newspaper in 1971 that he 'd rather be a " cold warrior than a warm brother . "
-lrb- the latter expression is a pejorative expression for a gay man . -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber has always stressed tradition the csu 's current head , edmund stoiber , once refused to talk about " these partnerships , " saying if he did , he might as well start worshipping the devil . " he probably would n't talk like that that today , but the csu has traditionally had , shall we say , a problematic attitude , " said hellmuth pusch , head of the bavarian section of the lesbian and gay association of germany .
" now we see that some rethinking is taking place . " still , he and other gay groups do not feel like the party has gone as far as it should .
while the new positioning is a slight change , pusch says bavaria and csu are still far behind the rest of germany when it comes to accepting homosexuality .
bavaria was one of the german federal states that went to germany 's highest court to try to block the law allowing registered same-sex partnerships and it is still one of the only states not to allow those partnerships to be registered at the registry office like heterosexual marriages , but requires couples to go to a notary . " but this is a beginning , " he said .
" the csu is are on the right path and we welcome that . " voters on their minds ? while some in the csu might feel its time to jettison , or at least revisit , some traditionalist viewpoints , others see political motives behind the party 's decision .
the left-wing taz daily , known for its clever headlines , entitled its story on the new policy " csu hot for gay voters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a same-sex couple at a registry office in hannover while that might be an exaggeration , it is a fact that the csu is finding its decades-long dominance of bavarian politics slipping a little .
it still got 62 percent of the vote in the last election , but the larger cities in bavaria such as munich , nuremberg and augsburg , are all governed by the spd . " in general , a party which formulates policies that do n't reflect life 's realities will lose more and more voters , " said axel hochrein , head of the bavarian branch of the lsu , a group representing gays and lesbians in the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the csu . warning call the csu 's tentative warming up to gays and lesbians does not sit well with everyone in the party .
a group of eight csu parliamentarians has released a statement warning that the party should not " weaken " its position of privileging traditional marriage .
according to the statement , children need a " father and mother in their different gender roles . " four of the eight lawmakers expressing these conservative sentiments were born in or after 1970 . " in the csu , you ca n't judge by the age of politicians , but you have to look at what area they come from , rural or urban , " said hochrein .
while members from the big bavarian cities advocate for more acceptance , those from rural regions have much different ideas . " in the countryside , which is very catholic and where the church has an enormous influence , even a single mother is still sometimes seen as scandalous , " he said .

but eads warned it might go to the debt markets next year in order to raise additional financing . group finance director hans-peter ring said that eads " will manage pro-actively its financial requirements and might go to the capital markets in 2007 , " possibly by issuing hybrid bonds . but the company , which has announced delays of up to 24 months in deliveries of the ambitious super-jumbo jet a380 , " has neither the need nor the short-term intention " of making a capital increase , ring insisted . despite eads ' insistence that it finances are very solid , such comments raised the specter of potential financing bottlenecks further down the line .
and that could explain the government 's chronic prevarication as to how best safeguard german interests in the company . after all , if the german state does acquire a stake in the company , it will be compelled to put up a large chunk of the financing should a capital increase ever become necessary . what will daimler do ? the crunch of the matter lies with german-us auto maker daimlerchrysler , which holds a stake of 22.5 percent in eads but has signaled its intention to reduce that stake to 15 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an a380 superjumbo - the source of many problems berlin is adamant that the 7.5-percent stake being put for sale should remain in german hands and must not be allowed to fall into french or even russian hands .
it must " remain in the german sphere " , the government spokesman ulrich wilhem said recently . german finance minister peer steinbrück defended the idea of a possible state stake in the european aerospace giant eads , in an interview to be published monday . " this is about stabilizing an enterprise , about keeping the jobs of qualified workers and especially about being up to the level of our french partners , " steinbrück said , referring to the delicate french-german balance within eads . his remarks came in response to a question by germany 's suddeutsche zeitung newspaper about whether eads ' problems would continue to grow without state intervention . the minister said no decision had been made about a german public stake in the company , a matter that has sparked speculation in recent days .
" there are possible solutions which are completely defensible from an interventionist point of view , " steinbrueck said . " nobody in the government wants to suddenly transform the federal state into a business , " steinbrück was quoted as saying in the suddeutsche zeitung .
" but we can not let airbus go into bankruptcy simply because society is undergoing an adaptation crisis or because a manufacturer wants to cede its share . " the current balance of power with eads is extremely delicate . germany 's interests are represented by daimlerchrysler 's 22.5-percent stake , while france is represented via a 30-percent interest shared by the state holding company sogeade and media group lagardere . spanish interests are represented by the holding group sepi , which owns 5.48 percent . lagardere has committed itself to halving its stake to put french interests back on a par with germany 's , but the balance of power would be upset if daimlerchrysler were to reduce its stake .
in september , russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank bought 5.02 percent and moscow has signaled its intention of increasing its say in the company , a development that would be welcomed by eads german co-chief executive , thomas enders . enders said in a newspaper interview published on monday that he welcomed the acquisition of a stake in the european aerospace giant by the russian state .
" the entry of the russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank into eads share capital underlines the huge interest of russian investors " in the european aeronautic defence and space company , enders told the daily die welt .
" cooperation with the russian aerospace industry is of strategic importance for us .
russia is not only an important market , but it has a great deal of experience in the development and construction of aircraft , " enders said . calls for and against state involvement daimlerchrysler chief dieter zetsche is opposed to the idea of the german state acquiring the shares . " fundamentally , an increase in state influence is not desirable for the group , " he told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . there is also opposition within eads to the idea of state involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus plant in hamburg enders said in an interview published in the wall street journal that such a solution would mark a " return to the stone age . " but there are plenty of people in germany , not least a number of top-ranking politicians , who argue that is the government 's patriotic duty to get its hands on the shares . the group 's plane maker airbus employs 22,000 people at seven different sites around the country .
the northern port of hamburg is home to airbus ' biggest german site . the government " has a crucial political responsibility " in the matter , the chief whip of the social democrat spd party , peter struck , insisted . a number of politicians have said the government should acquire the stake via the state-owned redevelopment bank kfw . hamburg mayor ole von beust caused a stir last week when he said that a corresponding deal had been reached .
but chancellor angela merkel swiftly qualified that statement , insisting that no decision had been made yet . but she added : " i 'm not ruling anything out " . economy minister michael glos insists that a future investor in eads should come from the private sector .
newspapers have suggested that a group of suppliers to airbus or even a consortium of banks could take daimlerchrysler 's stake . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus parent company considers selling factories the european aerospace group eads would consider selling some airbus factories provided that new owners could reduce operating costs , eads co-chairman manfred bischoff said on friday .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i agree completely with mr. schröder 's comments .
mr. bush 's professed dependence on " divine guidance " has no place in western politics , let alone in the politics of a country whose constitution expressly denotes a separation between church and state . - mike cohen , new mexico , usa mr. schröder has finally put into words what many think but are afraid to say out loud .
bravo gert ! - liliane chaglassian i totally agree with schröder 's thoughts on bush and religion in the us .
it would be good if there were a serious discussion in this country about the separation - or rather , non-separation - of church and state ! - gabrielle callison if anyone believes that political decisions can be made devoid of personal beliefs they are delusional , or a liar .
if bush 's decisions are biased by overtly christian beliefs this is no worse than being overtly humanist , capitalist , rationalist or islamic . - simon i think schröder hit the nail right on the head with bush 's religiosity and managed to say it in a matter of fact way without being unkind . - detlef karthaus 1 -rrb- schröder is right on the money , 2 -rrb- i could not say it better about us politics and religion . - michael ruso it is not unusual for politicians to use their memoirs to rationalize their tenure .
it 's generally not expected to be a truthful account , given the hard knocks of normal politics .
but in the case of former german chancellor gerhardt schröder , it is just more of the same .
sad to say , mr. schröeder was far and away the most irresponsible and self-indulgent chancellor in recent german history .
today mr. schröder claims he was not anti-american , but during his tenure he used constant anti-american rhetoric to raise his poll numbers .
that is what made mr. schröeder such a disaster from abroad .
we can take criticism in stride , but this was political demagogy performed for the most cynical purposes .
for those germans who dislike america - and dislike is fine , this is not a matter of love - mr. schröder still lied to them about the economy .
and he failed utterly to deal with the universally understood weaknesses of the german economy , the rigidity of the labor market , high taxation , and all the rest .
mr. schröder has apparently not changed a single idea since he was an immature radical .
he is simply stuck in the past .
schröder 's gazprom job put the icing on the cake as far as international observers of germany are concerned .
it looked very bad after political concessions made to russia under mr. schröeder 's rule .
the former chancellor should have been far , far more sensitive to the appearance of a quid pro quo . - bernard baars compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in book , schröder describes worries about bush 's religiosity ahead of the release of his memoirs , gerhard schröder says george bush left a positive impression on him , but the us leader 's constant references to god troubled him .

gps navigation systems are beginning to get a bad rep in germany .
that 's probably because germans are actually too good at following instructions .
even when they are told to crash into a toilet shack . if car navigation systems could have their rathers , they would probably all want to be working in germany .
not only because the german autobahn is a speed-racer dream come true , but because germans are very good at following instructions .
if the system tells them to turn right , they turn right .
if it tells them to turn left , they turn left . and although one or two germans will find themselves asking philosophical questions about what it means to turn right or left at any point in their life , most will happily oblige and surrender to that bizarrely infantilizing feeling we all know from looking at the assembling instructions for an ikea cupboard .
it 's called total dependency . it is nice , from time to time , to surrender one 's control .

gps navigation systems are beginning to get a bad rep in germany .
that 's probably because germans are actually too good at following instructions .
even when they are told to crash into a toilet shack . if car navigation systems could have their rathers , they would probably all want to be working in germany .
not only because the german autobahn is a speed-racer dream come true , but because germans are very good at following instructions .
if the system tells them to turn right , they turn right .
if it tells them to turn left , they turn left . and although one or two germans will find themselves asking philosophical questions about what it means to turn right or left at any point in their life , most will happily oblige and surrender to that bizarrely infantilizing feeling we all know from looking at the assembling instructions for an ikea cupboard .
it 's called total dependency . it is nice , from time to time , to surrender one 's control .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i agree completely with mr. schröder 's comments .
mr. bush 's professed dependence on " divine guidance " has no place in western politics , let alone in the politics of a country whose constitution expressly denotes a separation between church and state . - mike cohen , new mexico , usa mr. schröder has finally put into words what many think but are afraid to say out loud .
bravo gert ! - liliane chaglassian i totally agree with schröder 's thoughts on bush and religion in the us .
it would be good if there were a serious discussion in this country about the separation - or rather , non-separation - of church and state ! - gabrielle callison if anyone believes that political decisions can be made devoid of personal beliefs they are delusional , or a liar .
if bush 's decisions are biased by overtly christian beliefs this is no worse than being overtly humanist , capitalist , rationalist or islamic . - simon i think schröder hit the nail right on the head with bush 's religiosity and managed to say it in a matter of fact way without being unkind . - detlef karthaus 1 -rrb- schröder is right on the money , 2 -rrb- i could not say it better about us politics and religion . - michael ruso it is not unusual for politicians to use their memoirs to rationalize their tenure .
it 's generally not expected to be a truthful account , given the hard knocks of normal politics .
but in the case of former german chancellor gerhardt schröder , it is just more of the same .
sad to say , mr. schröeder was far and away the most irresponsible and self-indulgent chancellor in recent german history .
today mr. schröder claims he was not anti-american , but during his tenure he used constant anti-american rhetoric to raise his poll numbers .
that is what made mr. schröeder such a disaster from abroad .
we can take criticism in stride , but this was political demagogy performed for the most cynical purposes .
for those germans who dislike america - and dislike is fine , this is not a matter of love - mr. schröder still lied to them about the economy .
and he failed utterly to deal with the universally understood weaknesses of the german economy , the rigidity of the labor market , high taxation , and all the rest .
mr. schröder has apparently not changed a single idea since he was an immature radical .
he is simply stuck in the past .
schröder 's gazprom job put the icing on the cake as far as international observers of germany are concerned .
it looked very bad after political concessions made to russia under mr. schröeder 's rule .
the former chancellor should have been far , far more sensitive to the appearance of a quid pro quo . - bernard baars compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in book , schröder describes worries about bush 's religiosity ahead of the release of his memoirs , gerhard schröder says george bush left a positive impression on him , but the us leader 's constant references to god troubled him .
schröder had few kind words for his own successor .
-lrb- 22.10.2006 -rrb- gerhard schröder takes a blow over gazprom germany 's opposition fdp party has threatened to demand a parliamentary inquiry into the so-called " pipeline affair " involving the former government of gerhard schröder and russian gas group gazprom .

even the chief executive 's job could be on the line . out of a full time workforce of 167,000 employed worldwide by the bonn-based telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , 74,000 employees are superfluous , according to the sunday newspaper , frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , which cited an internal company report circulated by the management board . the internal memo made perfectly clear that the cost to consumers of subscribing to deutsche telekom 's telephone and internet services is significantly higher than that of its competitors . competitors charge much less its t-com fixed line and t-online internet subsidiaries charge 71 euros monthly for flatrate connections or double that of a low-cost , no-name competitor , called 2play net.fon , for example .
other better known competitors , such as aol and arcor , which also offer high-speed dsl connections well below telekom 's rates , charge 55 euros and 50 euros for the same package , respectively . one reason cited for higher prices that are passed on to consumers , are inefficient structures and duplication of services that reduce productivity and lead to bloated costs .
several german newspapers had reported over the weekend that in addition to 32,000 positions to be eliminated by 2008 , an additional 23,000 jobs would be cut by 2010 . additional job cuts can not be ruled out ulrich lissek , chief spokesman for telekom could not confirm the figures , but told reporters that the conglomerate " has always said that in the face of regulatory and technological changes , we can not rule out the elimination of additional jobs after 2008 . " meanwhile telekom has been losing domestic clients for its fixed line services , while its t-mobile cell phone unit is growing mainly because of its us activities .
the additional job cuts at deutsche telekom do not come as a surprise since the former state-owned monopoly , which was privatised in 1995 , has been cutting more than 10,000 jobs a year in the last decade in order to raise its profitability and competitiveness . furthermore , telekom chief kai-uwe ricke has repeatedly said that moves to cut more jobs would not necessarily cease in 2008 . telekom chief under heavy pressure even ricke 's own job could be on the line .
directors at telekom are apparently mulling the future of their boss , whose contract expires in 2007 .
the decision to renew ricke 's contract or replace him is expected to be made in december .
since a profits warning was issued this august , ricke has been under considerable pressure , as the number of fixed line subscribers has dropped and growth in the wireless sector has slowed down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom chief 's contract expires next year one name that has been bandied about to replace ricke , is ben verwaayen , the chief executive of british telecom , although the german government , which holds more than 30 percent of telekom directly and indirectly through the state-owned bank kfw , could favour an internal candidate according to the financial times . political fallout from job cuts the government 's key consideration is to minimise the political fallout from job cutbacks in the fixed line business .
ricke had deferred to such political concerns last year when he reduced his demand for job cuts by half from 60,000 down to 30,000 . the worker 's union verdi claims that new internet technologies will require fewer personnel , so that ricke 's talk of " streamlining operations " is irrelevant anyway . deutsche telekom is not the only major german company slashing jobs on a massive scale .
in the pharmaceutical sector , bayer 's recent takeover of schering will result in the elimination of 6,000 positions , the insolvency of benq mobile , the wireless manufacturer , has put 3,000 jobs on the line , while automobile giant volkswagen plans to cut 20,000 jobs by 2009 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's t-mobile wins licenses in the united states german telecommunications giant t-mobile is geared to expand its presence on the us market .

" unless the warming of the north sea stops , this process -lrb- of changing fish stocks -rrb- will continue , " asmus said . according to asmus , one of the more obvious indications that climate change is having an effect is the slowly climbing average temperature of the north sea-waters . " for the last 18 years , the water has been getting continuously warmer - that is the longest warm period since the records began 130 years ago . " small climate change has big impacts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more oysters have been found in the north sea although the increase is only around one-tenth so far , which equals a temperature change of less than two degrees , species have already started reacted to the variation . " certain fish types , like the plaice fish , plunge into deeper and colder waters , while other types like cod are drawn still further north " , asmus said in return more and more fishes move from the southern and warmer waters into the north sea . " we have even already discovered anchovies here , " he added . exotic creatures , like the pacific oyster are now being found , with the increased temperatures but mussels which once dominated the north sea , have now been displaced . asmus is of the opinion that the changes will be be more rapid in the future and that the extinction of species in the medium-term can not be discounted . " these species have no chance to adapt to these new living conditions but rather they can only avoid it , " asmus said .
" at present , we do not know what will happen with the arctic region if the warming of the sea water further continues . " the temperature variations of the north sea however , is not just a phenomenon restricted to the atlantic , asmus explained . " through global warming , more and more subtropical species are moving into the mediterranean sea , -lrb- and -rrb- we have also observed similar changes off the coasts of west africa .

bavaria was one of the german federal states that went to germany 's highest court to try to block the law allowing registered same-sex partnerships and it is still one of the only states not to allow those partnerships to be registered at the registry office like heterosexual marriages , but requires couples to go to a notary . " but this is a beginning , " he said .
" the csu is are on the right path and we welcome that . " voters on their minds ? while some in the csu might feel its time to jettison , or at least revisit , some traditionalist viewpoints , others see political motives behind the party 's decision .
the left-wing taz daily , known for its clever headlines , entitled its story on the new policy " csu hot for gay voters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a same-sex couple at a registry office in hannover while that might be an exaggeration , it is a fact that the csu is finding its decades-long dominance of bavarian politics slipping a little .
it still got 62 percent of the vote in the last election , but the larger cities in bavaria such as munich , nuremberg and augsburg , are all governed by the spd . " in general , a party which formulates policies that do n't reflect life 's realities will lose more and more voters , " said axel hochrein , head of the bavarian branch of the lsu , a group representing gays and lesbians in the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the csu . warning call the csu 's tentative warming up to gays and lesbians does not sit well with everyone in the party .
a group of eight csu parliamentarians has released a statement warning that the party should not " weaken " its position of privileging traditional marriage .
according to the statement , children need a " father and mother in their different gender roles . " four of the eight lawmakers expressing these conservative sentiments were born in or after 1970 . " in the csu , you ca n't judge by the age of politicians , but you have to look at what area they come from , rural or urban , " said hochrein .
while members from the big bavarian cities advocate for more acceptance , those from rural regions have much different ideas . " in the countryside , which is very catholic and where the church has an enormous influence , even a single mother is still sometimes seen as scandalous , " he said .
" that is the balancing act the party has to deal with .

even the chief executive 's job could be on the line . out of a full time workforce of 167,000 employed worldwide by the bonn-based telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , 74,000 employees are superfluous , according to the sunday newspaper , frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , which cited an internal company report circulated by the management board . the internal memo made perfectly clear that the cost to consumers of subscribing to deutsche telekom 's telephone and internet services is significantly higher than that of its competitors . competitors charge much less its t-com fixed line and t-online internet subsidiaries charge 71 euros monthly for flatrate connections or double that of a low-cost , no-name competitor , called 2play net.fon , for example .
other better known competitors , such as aol and arcor , which also offer high-speed dsl connections well below telekom 's rates , charge 55 euros and 50 euros for the same package , respectively . one reason cited for higher prices that are passed on to consumers , are inefficient structures and duplication of services that reduce productivity and lead to bloated costs .
several german newspapers had reported over the weekend that in addition to 32,000 positions to be eliminated by 2008 , an additional 23,000 jobs would be cut by 2010 . additional job cuts can not be ruled out ulrich lissek , chief spokesman for telekom could not confirm the figures , but told reporters that the conglomerate " has always said that in the face of regulatory and technological changes , we can not rule out the elimination of additional jobs after 2008 . " meanwhile telekom has been losing domestic clients for its fixed line services , while its t-mobile cell phone unit is growing mainly because of its us activities .
the additional job cuts at deutsche telekom do not come as a surprise since the former state-owned monopoly , which was privatised in 1995 , has been cutting more than 10,000 jobs a year in the last decade in order to raise its profitability and competitiveness . furthermore , telekom chief kai-uwe ricke has repeatedly said that moves to cut more jobs would not necessarily cease in 2008 . telekom chief under heavy pressure even ricke 's own job could be on the line .
directors at telekom are apparently mulling the future of their boss , whose contract expires in 2007 .
the decision to renew ricke 's contract or replace him is expected to be made in december .
since a profits warning was issued this august , ricke has been under considerable pressure , as the number of fixed line subscribers has dropped and growth in the wireless sector has slowed down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom chief 's contract expires next year one name that has been bandied about to replace ricke , is ben verwaayen , the chief executive of british telecom , although the german government , which holds more than 30 percent of telekom directly and indirectly through the state-owned bank kfw , could favour an internal candidate according to the financial times . political fallout from job cuts the government 's key consideration is to minimise the political fallout from job cutbacks in the fixed line business .
ricke had deferred to such political concerns last year when he reduced his demand for job cuts by half from 60,000 down to 30,000 . the worker 's union verdi claims that new internet technologies will require fewer personnel , so that ricke 's talk of " streamlining operations " is irrelevant anyway . deutsche telekom is not the only major german company slashing jobs on a massive scale .
in the pharmaceutical sector , bayer 's recent takeover of schering will result in the elimination of 6,000 positions , the insolvency of benq mobile , the wireless manufacturer , has put 3,000 jobs on the line , while automobile giant volkswagen plans to cut 20,000 jobs by 2009 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's t-mobile wins licenses in the united states german telecommunications giant t-mobile is geared to expand its presence on the us market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the airbus saga : turbulence on the ground and in the air russia , eads cozy up with new airbus deals germans call for parity in airbus restructuring program mass strikes across europe hit airbus factories airbus decision on a350 looms amid us-eu trade dispute aerospace -pipe- 23.10.2006 germany undecided on role in eads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany mulls its next step in the airbus crisis as russian investors circle in the minefield of national egos at the heart of eads , the german government seems undecided about how best to shore up its interests without being left to foot the bill if the aerospace giant 's finances deteriorate . the european aeronautic defence and space company insisted friday that it currently had enough cash to cope with the huge problems facing its crisis-ridden airplane maker airbus .
but eads warned it might go to the debt markets next year in order to raise additional financing . group finance director hans-peter ring said that eads " will manage pro-actively its financial requirements and might go to the capital markets in 2007 , " possibly by issuing hybrid bonds . but the company , which has announced delays of up to 24 months in deliveries of the ambitious super-jumbo jet a380 , " has neither the need nor the short-term intention " of making a capital increase , ring insisted . despite eads ' insistence that it finances are very solid , such comments raised the specter of potential financing bottlenecks further down the line .
and that could explain the government 's chronic prevarication as to how best safeguard german interests in the company . after all , if the german state does acquire a stake in the company , it will be compelled to put up a large chunk of the financing should a capital increase ever become necessary . what will daimler do ? the crunch of the matter lies with german-us auto maker daimlerchrysler , which holds a stake of 22.5 percent in eads but has signaled its intention to reduce that stake to 15 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an a380 superjumbo - the source of many problems berlin is adamant that the 7.5-percent stake being put for sale should remain in german hands and must not be allowed to fall into french or even russian hands .
it must " remain in the german sphere " , the government spokesman ulrich wilhem said recently . german finance minister peer steinbrück defended the idea of a possible state stake in the european aerospace giant eads , in an interview to be published monday . " this is about stabilizing an enterprise , about keeping the jobs of qualified workers and especially about being up to the level of our french partners , " steinbrück said , referring to the delicate french-german balance within eads . his remarks came in response to a question by germany 's suddeutsche zeitung newspaper about whether eads ' problems would continue to grow without state intervention . the minister said no decision had been made about a german public stake in the company , a matter that has sparked speculation in recent days .
" there are possible solutions which are completely defensible from an interventionist point of view , " steinbrueck said . " nobody in the government wants to suddenly transform the federal state into a business , " steinbrück was quoted as saying in the suddeutsche zeitung .
" but we can not let airbus go into bankruptcy simply because society is undergoing an adaptation crisis or because a manufacturer wants to cede its share . " the current balance of power with eads is extremely delicate . germany 's interests are represented by daimlerchrysler 's 22.5-percent stake , while france is represented via a 30-percent interest shared by the state holding company sogeade and media group lagardere . spanish interests are represented by the holding group sepi , which owns 5.48 percent . lagardere has committed itself to halving its stake to put french interests back on a par with germany 's , but the balance of power would be upset if daimlerchrysler were to reduce its stake .
in september , russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank bought 5.02 percent and moscow has signaled its intention of increasing its say in the company , a development that would be welcomed by eads german co-chief executive , thomas enders . enders said in a newspaper interview published on monday that he welcomed the acquisition of a stake in the european aerospace giant by the russian state .
" the entry of the russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank into eads share capital underlines the huge interest of russian investors " in the european aeronautic defence and space company , enders told the daily die welt .
" cooperation with the russian aerospace industry is of strategic importance for us .
russia is not only an important market , but it has a great deal of experience in the development and construction of aircraft , " enders said . calls for and against state involvement daimlerchrysler chief dieter zetsche is opposed to the idea of the german state acquiring the shares . " fundamentally , an increase in state influence is not desirable for the group , " he told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . there is also opposition within eads to the idea of state involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus plant in hamburg enders said in an interview published in the wall street journal that such a solution would mark a " return to the stone age . " but there are plenty of people in germany , not least a number of top-ranking politicians , who argue that is the government 's patriotic duty to get its hands on the shares . the group 's plane maker airbus employs 22,000 people at seven different sites around the country .
the northern port of hamburg is home to airbus ' biggest german site . the government " has a crucial political responsibility " in the matter , the chief whip of the social democrat spd party , peter struck , insisted . a number of politicians have said the government should acquire the stake via the state-owned redevelopment bank kfw . hamburg mayor ole von beust caused a stir last week when he said that a corresponding deal had been reached .
but chancellor angela merkel swiftly qualified that statement , insisting that no decision had been made yet . but she added : " i 'm not ruling anything out " . economy minister michael glos insists that a future investor in eads should come from the private sector .
newspapers have suggested that a group of suppliers to airbus or even a consortium of banks could take daimlerchrysler 's stake . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus parent company considers selling factories the european aerospace group eads would consider selling some airbus factories provided that new owners could reduce operating costs , eads co-chairman manfred bischoff said on friday .

but eads warned it might go to the debt markets next year in order to raise additional financing . group finance director hans-peter ring said that eads " will manage pro-actively its financial requirements and might go to the capital markets in 2007 , " possibly by issuing hybrid bonds . but the company , which has announced delays of up to 24 months in deliveries of the ambitious super-jumbo jet a380 , " has neither the need nor the short-term intention " of making a capital increase , ring insisted . despite eads ' insistence that it finances are very solid , such comments raised the specter of potential financing bottlenecks further down the line .

" this is about stabilizing an enterprise , about keeping the jobs of qualified workers and especially about being up to the level of our french partners , " steinbrück said , referring to the delicate french-german balance within eads . his remarks came in response to a question by germany 's suddeutsche zeitung newspaper about whether eads ' problems would continue to grow without state intervention . the minister said no decision had been made about a german public stake in the company , a matter that has sparked speculation in recent days .
" there are possible solutions which are completely defensible from an interventionist point of view , " steinbrueck said . " nobody in the government wants to suddenly transform the federal state into a business , " steinbrück was quoted as saying in the suddeutsche zeitung .
" but we can not let airbus go into bankruptcy simply because society is undergoing an adaptation crisis or because a manufacturer wants to cede its share . " the current balance of power with eads is extremely delicate . germany 's interests are represented by daimlerchrysler 's 22.5-percent stake , while france is represented via a 30-percent interest shared by the state holding company sogeade and media group lagardere . spanish interests are represented by the holding group sepi , which owns 5.48 percent . lagardere has committed itself to halving its stake to put french interests back on a par with germany 's , but the balance of power would be upset if daimlerchrysler were to reduce its stake .

but eads warned it might go to the debt markets next year in order to raise additional financing . group finance director hans-peter ring said that eads " will manage pro-actively its financial requirements and might go to the capital markets in 2007 , " possibly by issuing hybrid bonds . but the company , which has announced delays of up to 24 months in deliveries of the ambitious super-jumbo jet a380 , " has neither the need nor the short-term intention " of making a capital increase , ring insisted . despite eads ' insistence that it finances are very solid , such comments raised the specter of potential financing bottlenecks further down the line .
and that could explain the government 's chronic prevarication as to how best safeguard german interests in the company . after all , if the german state does acquire a stake in the company , it will be compelled to put up a large chunk of the financing should a capital increase ever become necessary . what will daimler do ? the crunch of the matter lies with german-us auto maker daimlerchrysler , which holds a stake of 22.5 percent in eads but has signaled its intention to reduce that stake to 15 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an a380 superjumbo - the source of many problems berlin is adamant that the 7.5-percent stake being put for sale should remain in german hands and must not be allowed to fall into french or even russian hands .
it must " remain in the german sphere " , the government spokesman ulrich wilhem said recently . german finance minister peer steinbrück defended the idea of a possible state stake in the european aerospace giant eads , in an interview to be published monday . " this is about stabilizing an enterprise , about keeping the jobs of qualified workers and especially about being up to the level of our french partners , " steinbrück said , referring to the delicate french-german balance within eads . his remarks came in response to a question by germany 's suddeutsche zeitung newspaper about whether eads ' problems would continue to grow without state intervention . the minister said no decision had been made about a german public stake in the company , a matter that has sparked speculation in recent days .
" there are possible solutions which are completely defensible from an interventionist point of view , " steinbrueck said . " nobody in the government wants to suddenly transform the federal state into a business , " steinbrück was quoted as saying in the suddeutsche zeitung .
" but we can not let airbus go into bankruptcy simply because society is undergoing an adaptation crisis or because a manufacturer wants to cede its share . " the current balance of power with eads is extremely delicate . germany 's interests are represented by daimlerchrysler 's 22.5-percent stake , while france is represented via a 30-percent interest shared by the state holding company sogeade and media group lagardere . spanish interests are represented by the holding group sepi , which owns 5.48 percent . lagardere has committed itself to halving its stake to put french interests back on a par with germany 's , but the balance of power would be upset if daimlerchrysler were to reduce its stake .
in september , russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank bought 5.02 percent and moscow has signaled its intention of increasing its say in the company , a development that would be welcomed by eads german co-chief executive , thomas enders . enders said in a newspaper interview published on monday that he welcomed the acquisition of a stake in the european aerospace giant by the russian state .
" the entry of the russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank into eads share capital underlines the huge interest of russian investors " in the european aeronautic defence and space company , enders told the daily die welt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 23.10.2006 schumacher bids emotional farewell to f1 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tears of a champion : schumi prepares for life after his emotional retirement the 37-year-old michael schumacher bade farewell to a life that turned him from the unknown son of a bricklayer into the world 's greatest race-winning ferrari star .
he went out in style . in 15 years of formula one , he had demonstrated over and again a fearsome competitive instinct and an unbeatable will to win .
the statistics that piled up to praise his work were colossal - seven world titles , five with ferrari , 68 pole positions and 91 victories . michael schumacher , however , was left struggling for words on sunday as his career came to a dramatic end at the brazilian grand prix . " today , my racing career comes to an end and , obviously it 's a special moment for me and i am proud to have lived my career with some fantastic people - namely everyone who is a part of the ferrari family , " said the german star . " there is so much to say - i ca n't find the right words .
the things i will miss are probably the fans and in every moment they have been behind me and always supported me . " " their support helped me perform , especially in moments when it was difficult .
over the years that was immensely important .
i can only say thank you to those people and those fans , " schumacher said . no last victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitiveness was schumacher 's default mode in motor racing the seven-time world champion finished his career with one of his most stirring drives to come home in fourth place , cruelly just off the podium .
but he still managed to find a metaphor that brought symmetry to his 15 years of sustained and extraordinary racing . " in a way , it 's a closed circle now for me , because my formula one career started and finished after 500 meters which was , maybe , a symbol of what happened yesterday . " his words referred to the fact that his first race and his last were hit by problems that wrecked his hopes of victory .
but his actions on the track in his ferrari spoke volumes for his talent , speed , courage and determination as he stormed from the back of the field , after a puncture , to finish fourth . a dramatic race " the race was chaotic , i think that 's the right word , " he said , as rival and second-time champion fernando alonso began his celebrations , having finished second behind his ferrari team-mate felipe massa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher , right , with renault 's fernando alonso , from spain " we really had a superb car today from the pure speed we could have lapped everybody .
so i have to say it was the perfect end to the season in terms of car performance , but for me it did n't work out well . " schumacher offered warm congratulations to massa for his first triumph on brazilian soil . " i 'm very happy for felipe who drove an amazing race , " he said .
" it 's great for him to be the first brazilian to win at interlagos since ayrton senna .
it would have been nice if i could at least have made it to the podium alongside him .
i would also like to congratulate fernando . " a teutonic machine in his brilliant career , the man from the flatlands of kerpen in northern germany had become a teutonic machine , a human delivery system of speed and points and glory in a sport unused to such high standards of regularity , human reliability and sheer professionalism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher married corinna in 1995 tributes poured in from september onwards , after he had announced his intention to retire at the season 's end .
some were warm and loving , some were barbed and tinged with envy and some reflected a failure to understand that formula one was bringing down the curtain on the greatest and most complete driver ever to have raced in a grand prix . schumacher said his best memory was his title win in 2000 . " we had a lot of hard work and setbacks so when we finally won it , it was the most beautiful championship , " said schumacher . he added he did have regrets . " there were things i would do differently , but if i went into that it would get too intense and we do n't have time right now .

he went out in style . in 15 years of formula one , he had demonstrated over and again a fearsome competitive instinct and an unbeatable will to win .
the statistics that piled up to praise his work were colossal - seven world titles , five with ferrari , 68 pole positions and 91 victories . michael schumacher , however , was left struggling for words on sunday as his career came to a dramatic end at the brazilian grand prix . " today , my racing career comes to an end and , obviously it 's a special moment for me and i am proud to have lived my career with some fantastic people - namely everyone who is a part of the ferrari family , " said the german star . " there is so much to say - i ca n't find the right words .
the things i will miss are probably the fans and in every moment they have been behind me and always supported me . " " their support helped me perform , especially in moments when it was difficult .
over the years that was immensely important .
i can only say thank you to those people and those fans , " schumacher said . no last victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitiveness was schumacher 's default mode in motor racing the seven-time world champion finished his career with one of his most stirring drives to come home in fourth place , cruelly just off the podium .
but he still managed to find a metaphor that brought symmetry to his 15 years of sustained and extraordinary racing . " in a way , it 's a closed circle now for me , because my formula one career started and finished after 500 meters which was , maybe , a symbol of what happened yesterday . " his words referred to the fact that his first race and his last were hit by problems that wrecked his hopes of victory .
but his actions on the track in his ferrari spoke volumes for his talent , speed , courage and determination as he stormed from the back of the field , after a puncture , to finish fourth . a dramatic race " the race was chaotic , i think that 's the right word , " he said , as rival and second-time champion fernando alonso began his celebrations , having finished second behind his ferrari team-mate felipe massa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher , right , with renault 's fernando alonso , from spain " we really had a superb car today from the pure speed we could have lapped everybody .
so i have to say it was the perfect end to the season in terms of car performance , but for me it did n't work out well . " schumacher offered warm congratulations to massa for his first triumph on brazilian soil . " i 'm very happy for felipe who drove an amazing race , " he said .
" it 's great for him to be the first brazilian to win at interlagos since ayrton senna .
it would have been nice if i could at least have made it to the podium alongside him .
i would also like to congratulate fernando . " a teutonic machine in his brilliant career , the man from the flatlands of kerpen in northern germany had become a teutonic machine , a human delivery system of speed and points and glory in a sport unused to such high standards of regularity , human reliability and sheer professionalism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher married corinna in 1995 tributes poured in from september onwards , after he had announced his intention to retire at the season 's end .
some were warm and loving , some were barbed and tinged with envy and some reflected a failure to understand that formula one was bringing down the curtain on the greatest and most complete driver ever to have raced in a grand prix . schumacher said his best memory was his title win in 2000 . " we had a lot of hard work and setbacks so when we finally won it , it was the most beautiful championship , " said schumacher . he added he did have regrets . " there were things i would do differently , but if i went into that it would get too intense and we do n't have time right now .

he went out in style . in 15 years of formula one , he had demonstrated over and again a fearsome competitive instinct and an unbeatable will to win .
the statistics that piled up to praise his work were colossal - seven world titles , five with ferrari , 68 pole positions and 91 victories . michael schumacher , however , was left struggling for words on sunday as his career came to a dramatic end at the brazilian grand prix . " today , my racing career comes to an end and , obviously it 's a special moment for me and i am proud to have lived my career with some fantastic people - namely everyone who is a part of the ferrari family , " said the german star . " there is so much to say - i ca n't find the right words .
the things i will miss are probably the fans and in every moment they have been behind me and always supported me . " " their support helped me perform , especially in moments when it was difficult .
over the years that was immensely important .
i can only say thank you to those people and those fans , " schumacher said . no last victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitiveness was schumacher 's default mode in motor racing the seven-time world champion finished his career with one of his most stirring drives to come home in fourth place , cruelly just off the podium .
but he still managed to find a metaphor that brought symmetry to his 15 years of sustained and extraordinary racing . " in a way , it 's a closed circle now for me , because my formula one career started and finished after 500 meters which was , maybe , a symbol of what happened yesterday . " his words referred to the fact that his first race and his last were hit by problems that wrecked his hopes of victory .
but his actions on the track in his ferrari spoke volumes for his talent , speed , courage and determination as he stormed from the back of the field , after a puncture , to finish fourth . a dramatic race " the race was chaotic , i think that 's the right word , " he said , as rival and second-time champion fernando alonso began his celebrations , having finished second behind his ferrari team-mate felipe massa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher , right , with renault 's fernando alonso , from spain " we really had a superb car today from the pure speed we could have lapped everybody .
so i have to say it was the perfect end to the season in terms of car performance , but for me it did n't work out well . " schumacher offered warm congratulations to massa for his first triumph on brazilian soil . " i 'm very happy for felipe who drove an amazing race , " he said .
" it 's great for him to be the first brazilian to win at interlagos since ayrton senna .
it would have been nice if i could at least have made it to the podium alongside him .
i would also like to congratulate fernando . " a teutonic machine in his brilliant career , the man from the flatlands of kerpen in northern germany had become a teutonic machine , a human delivery system of speed and points and glory in a sport unused to such high standards of regularity , human reliability and sheer professionalism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher married corinna in 1995 tributes poured in from september onwards , after he had announced his intention to retire at the season 's end .
some were warm and loving , some were barbed and tinged with envy and some reflected a failure to understand that formula one was bringing down the curtain on the greatest and most complete driver ever to have raced in a grand prix . schumacher said his best memory was his title win in 2000 . " we had a lot of hard work and setbacks so when we finally won it , it was the most beautiful championship , " said schumacher . he added he did have regrets . " there were things i would do differently , but if i went into that it would get too intense and we do n't have time right now .
my dad was happy to see me after the race and he said : ' finally , it 's over . " ' " he was quite happy .

a truce seems unlikely with the cabinet set to approve parts of a highly controversial health bill this week . the mass demonstrations organized by germany 's powerful trade unions this weekend saw an estimated 200,000 people take to the streets in protest of the grand coalition 's social and economic policies . in big cities across the country , workers ' representatives vented their anger over what they felt was a lop-sided reform process that was hurting the poor and sparing the affluent .
the mass rallies provoked angry reactions especially by senior conservative members of the ruling coalition of social and christian democrats . they claimed the unions had no right to take to the streets , as they had not made a single reasonable alternative proposal for reforms .
markus söder from the conservative christian social union , the christian democratic union 's bavarian sister party , was one of those who didn ’ t mince his words . conservatives brand unions as obstructive " we 'd have expected the trade unions to be jubilant in the face of a considerable drop in unemployment in the first year of the grand coalition 's work , " he said .
" but all we hear from them is a constant moaning and groaning .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sommer refuted claims that the unions were at fault michael sommer , head of the german confederation of trade unions , dismissed söder 's remarks as appalling and totally unfounded .

" be it the siemens electronics giant , the allianz insurance group or similar companies - they 've all forgotten how to act in a socially responsible way , and we 're not willing to accept that . " and as far as ex-chancellor gerhard schröder 's criticism is concerned - yes , we were against his agenda 2010 reform package because of the inherent social injustices .

a truce seems unlikely with the cabinet set to approve parts of a highly controversial health bill this week . the mass demonstrations organized by germany 's powerful trade unions this weekend saw an estimated 200,000 people take to the streets in protest of the grand coalition 's social and economic policies . in big cities across the country , workers ' representatives vented their anger over what they felt was a lop-sided reform process that was hurting the poor and sparing the affluent .
the mass rallies provoked angry reactions especially by senior conservative members of the ruling coalition of social and christian democrats . they claimed the unions had no right to take to the streets , as they had not made a single reasonable alternative proposal for reforms .
markus söder from the conservative christian social union , the christian democratic union 's bavarian sister party , was one of those who didn ’ t mince his words . conservatives brand unions as obstructive " we 'd have expected the trade unions to be jubilant in the face of a considerable drop in unemployment in the first year of the grand coalition 's work , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the airbus saga : turbulence on the ground and in the air dw-world : russia , eads cozy up with new airbus deals dw-world : germans call for parity in airbus restructuring program dw-world : mass strikes across europe hit airbus factories dw-world : airbus decision on a350 looms amid us-eu trade dispute aerospace -pipe- 23.10.2006 germany undecided on role in eads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany mulls its next step in the airbus crisis as russian investors circle in the minefield of national egos at the heart of eads , the german government seems undecided about how best to shore up its interests without being left to foot the bill if the aerospace giant 's finances deteriorate . the european aeronautic defence and space company insisted friday that it currently had enough cash to cope with the huge problems facing its crisis-ridden airplane maker airbus .
but eads warned it might go to the debt markets next year in order to raise additional financing . group finance director hans-peter ring said that eads " will manage pro-actively its financial requirements and might go to the capital markets in 2007 , " possibly by issuing hybrid bonds . but the company , which has announced delays of up to 24 months in deliveries of the ambitious super-jumbo jet a380 , " has neither the need nor the short-term intention " of making a capital increase , ring insisted . despite eads ' insistence that it finances are very solid , such comments raised the specter of potential financing bottlenecks further down the line .
and that could explain the government 's chronic prevarication as to how best safeguard german interests in the company . after all , if the german state does acquire a stake in the company , it will be compelled to put up a large chunk of the financing should a capital increase ever become necessary . what will daimler do ? the crunch of the matter lies with german-us auto maker daimlerchrysler , which holds a stake of 22.5 percent in eads but has signaled its intention to reduce that stake to 15 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an a380 superjumbo - the source of many problems berlin is adamant that the 7.5-percent stake being put for sale should remain in german hands and must not be allowed to fall into french or even russian hands .
it must " remain in the german sphere " , the government spokesman ulrich wilhem said recently . german finance minister peer steinbrück defended the idea of a possible state stake in the european aerospace giant eads , in an interview to be published monday . " this is about stabilizing an enterprise , about keeping the jobs of qualified workers and especially about being up to the level of our french partners , " steinbrück said , referring to the delicate french-german balance within eads . his remarks came in response to a question by germany 's suddeutsche zeitung newspaper about whether eads ' problems would continue to grow without state intervention . the minister said no decision had been made about a german public stake in the company , a matter that has sparked speculation in recent days .
" there are possible solutions which are completely defensible from an interventionist point of view , " steinbrueck said . " nobody in the government wants to suddenly transform the federal state into a business , " steinbrück was quoted as saying in the suddeutsche zeitung .
" but we can not let airbus go into bankruptcy simply because society is undergoing an adaptation crisis or because a manufacturer wants to cede its share . " the current balance of power with eads is extremely delicate . germany 's interests are represented by daimlerchrysler 's 22.5-percent stake , while france is represented via a 30-percent interest shared by the state holding company sogeade and media group lagardere . spanish interests are represented by the holding group sepi , which owns 5.48 percent . lagardere has committed itself to halving its stake to put french interests back on a par with germany 's , but the balance of power would be upset if daimlerchrysler were to reduce its stake .
in september , russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank bought 5.02 percent and moscow has signaled its intention of increasing its say in the company , a development that would be welcomed by eads german co-chief executive , thomas enders . enders said in a newspaper interview published on monday that he welcomed the acquisition of a stake in the european aerospace giant by the russian state .
" the entry of the russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank into eads share capital underlines the huge interest of russian investors " in the european aeronautic defence and space company , enders told the daily die welt .
" cooperation with the russian aerospace industry is of strategic importance for us .
russia is not only an important market , but it has a great deal of experience in the development and construction of aircraft , " enders said . calls for and against state involvement daimlerchrysler chief dieter zetsche is opposed to the idea of the german state acquiring the shares . " fundamentally , an increase in state influence is not desirable for the group , " he told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . there is also opposition within eads to the idea of state involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus plant in hamburg enders said in an interview published in the wall street journal that such a solution would mark a " return to the stone age . " but there are plenty of people in germany , not least a number of top-ranking politicians , who argue that is the government 's patriotic duty to get its hands on the shares . the group 's plane maker airbus employs 22,000 people at seven different sites around the country .

it swept up millions of ordinary people , and initially forced the withdrawal of soviet forces , but was then brutally crushed by soviet tanks . some 200,000 people fled in the aftermath , and over 200 hungarians , including imre nagy , who was prime minister at the time , were executed , sealing hungary 's fate as a soviet satellite until the fall of the iron curtain and its transition to a democracy in 1989 .
hungary joined the european union in 2004 with several other former satellite states in central and eastern europe . the 1956 commemorations threaten to be overshadowed by hungary 's current political divide .
fidesz , the main right wing party , which opposes gyurcsany 's governing socialists , the successor to the communist party , plans to boycott the commemorations and hold a separate rally .
gyurcsany , a former leftist youth leader , has been accused of using his old communist party links to make a personal fortune through unsavoury property deals in the early 1990s , after the break up of the soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right wing opposition plans hold separate rally european leaders to attend ceremonies today delegations from over 50 countries , including spain 's king juan carlos , european commission president josé manuel barroso , german president horst kohler and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , will attend services at the parliament square , and are scheduled to visit the grave of imre nagy later during the day . the celebrations , which commenced sunday , were already marred when veterans of the 1956 uprising , refused to shake hands with gyurcsany at a state awards ceremony .
hungarian president laszlo solyom appealed to the opposition fidesz party to put aside party differences and celebrate in the spirit of the uprising . appeals for national unity " to be selective with the past has become standard since 1989 .
-lrb- politicians -rrb- are not only celebrating apart , they are celebrating different things .
they say there are many 1956s and with this , the value and significance of 1956 is devalued .
i however say that there is only one revolution of 1956 , " said solyom at sunday 's ceremony that began with a concert at the hungarian state opera . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there is only one revolution of 1956 " austrian president heinz fischer , who was also at the ceremony , urged hungarians to overcome their division .
" one thing is clear .
the freedom fight of 1956 was not in vain as it showed the courage of the hungarian people .
what was crushed in 1956 , was achieved peacefully in 1989 , " he said .

" unless the warming of the north sea stops , this process -lrb- of changing fish stocks -rrb- will continue , " asmus said . according to asmus , one of the more obvious indications that climate change is having an effect is the slowly climbing average temperature of the north sea-waters . " for the last 18 years , the water has been getting continuously warmer - that is the longest warm period since the records began 130 years ago . " small climate change has big impacts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more oysters have been found in the north sea although the increase is only around one-tenth so far , which equals a temperature change of less than two degrees , species have already started reacted to the variation . " certain fish types , like the plaice fish , plunge into deeper and colder waters , while other types like cod are drawn still further north " , asmus said in return more and more fishes move from the southern and warmer waters into the north sea . " we have even already discovered anchovies here , " he added . exotic creatures , like the pacific oyster are now being found , with the increased temperatures but mussels which once dominated the north sea , have now been displaced . asmus is of the opinion that the changes will be be more rapid in the future and that the extinction of species in the medium-term can not be discounted . " these species have no chance to adapt to these new living conditions but rather they can only avoid it , " asmus said .
" at present , we do not know what will happen with the arctic region if the warming of the sea water further continues . " the temperature variations of the north sea however , is not just a phenomenon restricted to the atlantic , asmus explained . " through global warming , more and more subtropical species are moving into the mediterranean sea , -lrb- and -rrb- we have also observed similar changes off the coasts of west africa .

others were far-right extremists equally opposed to gyurcsany , who has admitted to lying to voters on the economy to win re-election in april . " transitions are never easy " hungarian and foreign dignitaries assembled in the ornate parliament building , just a few dozen metres -lrb- yards -rrb- away from pitched battles between riot police and protestors , listened to speeches on the legacy of the 1956 uprising . " transitions are never easy , but hungary 's achievements over the past 16 years are substantial , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told them . barroso was among 19 european presidents , a couple of prime ministers , the king of norway and the head of nato who were in hungary , which joined the eu in 2004 , for the anniversary .
" the people of hungary now have a great opportunity in their grasp , " he said .
" by uniting , with purpose , they will be able to reap the full benefits that membership of the european union offers . " but unity appeared more elusive than ever before in the post-communist era , despite the legacy of the uprising in which a 10-million-strong nation came together in a mass upheaval against stalinist oppression . the uprising , which started out as a peaceful student protest on october 23 , 1956 , turned into armed resistance across hungary .
youngsters , dubbed freedom fighters , used guns and petrol bombs in fierce street battles against soviet tanks sent to put down the protests . the uprising was crushed two weeks later .
the crackdown resulted in the death of 2,800 hungarians .
a further 12,000 were wounded and 200,000 fled to the west . fidesz remains aloof fidesz went ahead with its boycott of monday 's ceremonies despite an appeal by the country 's president to celebrate the uprising as one people . the party has sought to compare prime minister gyurcsany to the former soviet oppressors , saying both had lied to keep power , after revelations that gyurcsany misled voters on the economy to win re-election in april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany on monday gyurcsany 's told fidesz and its leader , former prime minister viktor orban , not to confuse current political debates with the uprising . " 1956 was about the fight for freedom , while 2006 is about the order of freedom and democracy .
the 1956 revolution was replaced by the debates of a democracy , " he said in parliament . gyurcsany has admitted to lying to voters in a recording leaked in mid-september , which triggered more than a month of anti-government protests that degenerated into street violence . but he said that this was merely an " excuse " for fidesz 's boycott . fidesz has for years refused to commemorate the uprising anniversary with the socialists because it says that they are the inheritors of the communist party that colluded with the soviets back in 1956 . the 45-year-old gyurcsany was born five years after the uprising but was a communist youth leader in the 1980s . angry protests and clashes the unrest that gripped budapest started monday morning when police fought with a small group of far-right protestors , detaining 10 of them and leaving several people with bloodied faces after the confrontation . there followed a lull of several hours .
but by late afternoon , trouble had broken out across the capital .
several hundred riot police on downtown deak square were firing tear gas canisters and using three water cannons to disperse the crowd , an afp reporter said . mobile units were chasing small groups of protesters into nearby streets , while helicopters hovered overhead .
mounted police also charged protestors in some areas . mti news agency reported clashes between police and protesters in two other locations , near the western railway station and near the parliament building , with protestors hurling rocks and pieces of metal at security forces .

minister huw lewis said the change was needed to reach labour 's aim of wiping out welsh child poverty by 2020 .
milestones for 2010 have been laid down in areas such as teenage pregnancy , health and school achievement .
child poverty has fallen by a fifth in wales since 1999 , but over a quarter of families are still on low incomes . "
although we have made good progress ... it is clear that to achieve our 2020 goal we need a radical rethink of policy " minister huw lewis am last july social policy charity the joseph rowntree foundation reported that the number of children in poor welsh households dropped from 34 % to 27 % in the six years to 2005 .
the assembly government published its strategy on child strategy in 2005 , which led to another charity , save the children , to call for clear targets , a timetable , and the funding to carry it out .
the assembly government described its latest targets as " ambitious , " and said they would " guide work and measure success " .
one aim is to halve the number of children in poverty by 2010 .
" nothing can be more important than eradicating child poverty , " said mr lewis , the am for merthyr tydfil and rhymney .
" it is central to all of the welsh assembly government 's priorities and impacts on every portfolio .
' important goals ' " although we have made good progress and seen a 21 % reduction since 1999 , it is clear that to achieve our 2020 goal we need a radical rethink of policy across the assembly government . "
mr lewis said first minister rhodri morgan and his cabinet supported " this ambitious range of milestones and targets " .
he said the targets could change " depending on their usefulness , " but added that " our overall aim - equal chances and an end to poverty for all children by 2020 - will remain as one of the most important goals we have ever set " .
the next step could see ministers in cardiff bay asking for new powers under the government of wales act to force bodies which receive state funding to indicate how they can help to solve the problem .
the setting of new milestones was welcomed by sara reid , the deputy children 's commissioner for wales , as a way of speeding the process .
a family are considered to be officially poor if they are living on less than 60 % of britain 's median -lrb- average -rrb- level of household income .
the uk government also pledged in 1999 that it wanted to eradicate child poverty by 2020 .
however , it emerged last march that tony blair 's government had missed its first target .
official figures showed the number of children in poverty had dropped by 700,000 since 1999 , falling short by 300,000 .
ministers said the government remained committed to wiping out poverty within a generation , but opposition mps were critical .

minister huw lewis said the change was needed to reach labour 's aim of wiping out welsh child poverty by 2020 .
milestones for 2010 have been laid down in areas such as teenage pregnancy , health and school achievement .
child poverty has fallen by a fifth in wales since 1999 , but over a quarter of families are still on low incomes .
although we have made good progress ... it is clear that to achieve our 2020 goal we need a radical rethink of policy minister huw lewis am last july social policy charity the joseph rowntree foundation reported that the number of children in poor welsh households dropped from 34 % to 27 % in the six years to 2005 .
the assembly government published its strategy on child strategy in 2005 , which led to another charity , save the children , to call for clear targets , a timetable , and the funding to carry it out .
the assembly government described its latest targets as " ambitious , " and said they would " guide work and measure success " .
one aim is to halve the number of children in poverty by 2010 .

he said the targets could change " depending on their usefulness , " but added that " our overall aim - equal chances and an end to poverty for all children by 2020 - will remain as one of the most important goals we have ever set " .
the next step could see ministers in cardiff bay asking for new powers under the government of wales act to force bodies which receive state funding to indicate how they can help to solve the problem .
the setting of new milestones was welcomed by sara reid , the deputy children 's commissioner for wales , as a way of speeding the process .

however , it emerged last march that tony blair 's government had missed its first target .
official figures showed the number of children in poverty had dropped by 700,000 since 1999 , falling short by 300,000 .

caerphilly council hoped talks would lead to a " satisfactory conclusion " .
no-one was available at the school .
the dispute centres on new payments - teacher and learning responsibility , or tlrs - which are worth up to £ 11,000 a year .
tlrs replace the old system of management allowances , which ministers said were outdated and open to abuse .
i sincerely hope they are coming to the table intent on a successful outcome chris keates , nasuwt but nasuwt said the school 's management had failed to follow agreed procedures .
it claimed the new payments meant some staff at the school would be expected to do the same amount of work , or more , for lower pay .
earlier in october , union members mounted a picket line outside the school in one-day strike action .
nasuwt said it had now given notice of continuous strike action if there is a failure of " critical " talks , which will be held in conjunction with conciliation service acas .
general secretary chris keates said the union wanted to avoid an " all-out " strike .
she said : " i sincerely hope they are coming to the table intent on a successful outcome for all parties .
" in the unfortunate event of the talks failing to achieve settlement all-out continuous strike action will commence on 7 november . "
caerphilly council said : " we have been advocating for some weeks a meeting of all parties to discuss a way forward .
" we are pleased this is occurring on monday and hope this is a beginning of a satisfactory conclusion to the matter . "
no-one was available for comment at the school on monday .

speaking before a south pacific leaders meeting , mr howard said he still wanted to provide significant amounts of aid .
" our only request is that that aid be accompanied by improved standards of governance , " he said .
the three-day pacific islands forum in fiji is being held at a time of tension between australia and its neighbours .
the row stems mainly from the involvement of the solomon islands and papua new guinea in the case of fugitive australian lawyer julian moti , who is wanted on child abuse charges .
strained ties canberra has asked the solomon islands to extradite mr moti - a close friend of solomons prime minister manasseh sogavare - to face charges in his home country .
the solomons government , which receives millions of dollars in australian assistance , has said the extradition request is politically motivated , and has accused australia of using aid money to further its own national agenda in the south pacific .
mr howard , though , has rejected this argument , saying : " the real issue there is allowing the law to take its course .
this man is wanted to answer criminal charges . "
" we 're not trying to make the solomon islands into another australia , " he said .
" we are , however , respectfully requiring countries who receive our aid to lift their standards of governance . "
relations between australia and papua new guinea are also strained , because mr moti was able to escape from there to the solomon islands .
pacific forum chairman , fiji prime minister laisenia qarase , said he was sure a way of resolving the issues would be found .
" there will be strong words here and there , but that 's part of the game , and it 's very healthy , very democratic , " mr qarase told the associated press .
the forum will culminate in a leaders ' retreat on wednesday .

speaking before a south pacific leaders meeting , mr howard said he still wanted to provide significant amounts of aid .
" our only request is that that aid be accompanied by improved standards of governance , " he said .
the three-day pacific islands forum in fiji is being held at a time of tension between australia and its neighbours .

in a nationwide referendum , people voted by a margin of four to one to back the $ 5.2bn plan , which involves building a new channel and new locks .
many modern container ships are too large for the 50-mile -lrb- 80km -rrb- canal linking the pacific and atlantic .
the government hopes the scheme , which will double the canal 's capacity , will help lift the nation out of poverty .
president martin torrijos welcomed the result as celebratory fireworks lit up the sky .
" never in the history of the country have we panamanians taken a decision of this magnitude , " he said .
" we have laid the foundation to build a better country . "
work on the expansion plan is due to start in 2008 and be completed in 2014 .
panamanian authorities say it will generate thousands of jobs .
traffic jam the canal was completed in 1914 and , despite a series of upgrades over the past 92 years , has failed to keep pace with the growing scale of cargo ships .
panama canal facts handles an estimated 5 % of world trade the main goods shipped are oil products , grain and container cargo last year the canal handled 14,000 transits , shipping 200m tons of cargo traffic between asia and the east coast of the us accounts for more than 40 % of shipping q & a : what is proposed ?
forty ships a day - 14,000 a year - pass through it , about 5 % of all world shipping .
traffic has become so heavy that vessels using the canal can face costly delays as they wait in a queue to pass through .
the panama canal authority , which runs the waterway , had warned that if the canal was not expanded , business would be lost to other shipping routes , including the suez canal .
nicaragua , to the north , has proposed building its own canal between the pacific and atlantic oceans .
' top source of income ' panama 's canal expansion has been the subject of nationwide debate , although voter turnout was low at about 40 % .
supporters say it will bring widespread benefits to the country , but opponents argue it will add to panama 's debt .
in panama city , voters wearing green " yes " t-shirts far outnumbered opponents of the plan .
" voting ' no ' is like closing the door on the canal , " boat salesman leonardo aspira told the associated press news agency .
" it 's the top source of income for panama and improving it means more money for the government and less poverty , " he said .
but others have warned of corruption , and journalist maribel cuervo told the bbc the money would be better spent helping the poor .
" so how come the government is thinking -lsb- about -rsb- the maritime , commerce , and the shippers and all that ?
we have people living in extreme poverty . "
as many as 60 % of panama 's three million people live in poverty , according to some estimates .
increased revenue from tolls is expected to cover some of the costs , but the plan still needs $ 2.3bn in loans .

in a nationwide referendum , people voted by a margin of four to one to back the $ 5.2bn plan , which involves building a new channel and new locks .
many modern container ships are too large for the 50-mile -lrb- 80km -rrb- canal linking the pacific and atlantic .
the government hopes the scheme , which will double the canal 's capacity , will help lift the nation out of poverty .

about 150,000 people across the uk were paying into the farepak savings scheme when the swindon-based company went into administration on 13 october .
lynn nelson from belfast said customers from northern ireland felt they were being ignored .
" i scraped every week to get the kids a good christmas .
now they are not going to get that good christmas , " she said .
" somebody out there , please help . "
consumer minister ian mccartney has heard proposals for a goodwill scheme for customers who have lost out .
the minister met the british retail consortium -lrb- brc -rrb- over proposals for a goodwill scheme for customers who have lost out .
' keen to help ' mr mccartney said last week that the scheme must be " simple , not derisory , fraud free , easy to administer at store level and have as much choice as possible " .
" this will not be a compensation package and members of the brc are under no legal obligation to provide any help , " he said .
" but they have had a lot of interest from many large retailers , who are keen to try and do something . "
brc spokesman richard dodd added : " this is purely a goodwill gesture .
" the fact that farepak has gone bust is nothing to do with other retailers , so they are not under any obligation to step in . "
the brc is contacting its members so they can decide what they might be able to provide .

whatever the reason , 65 % of us do n't have a will .
we all assume that our money and possessions will be handed on to our nearest and dearest - but that is n't necessarily the case .
unmarried couples in particular could be in for a nasty shock when one partner dies - even if they 've been living together for many years .
this morning on breakfast : declan curry asked for your questions on making a will , to put to our specialist solicitor elizabeth hicks we had so many e-mails and text messages , that we 've put together a round-up of your questions and our solicitor 's answers making a will : your questions answered q : can you write your own will ?
a : yes you can , but it 's always advisable to get a solicitor to give you proper advice on tax and trusts q : are will-writing services just as good ?
a : possibly .
the man thing is that the more complex your case , the greater your need for advice .
q : if you 've lived with someone for years , will you automatically inherit if they die ?
a : no , there 's no automatic inheritance and the idea of common law marriage is a myth .
you could still make a claim under a law passed in 1975 without a will : if your savings and home total less than £ 125,000 , your husband or wife will inherit the lot above that figure , your children get half of the remainder unmarried live-in partners get nothing -lrb- unless they 're official civil partners -rrb- if you 're not married and have no relatives , the taxman gets it all q : what happens if you live together and have children ?
a : the children will inherit , under the intestacy laws .
again , the live-in partner could make a claim on the estate q : i 'm separated from my husband .
could he still inherit my house ?
a : yes , he could make claim on your estate .
and , even if you write him out of your will , he could still challenge that .
these answers apply to england only ; the law in scotland is different .
and , please do n't rely on this story alone to decide whether or not you need to make a will .
if you 're in doubt , get some specialist advice .

after converging on parliament , some protesters broke off and headed for the state radio building where fighting broke out .
the upsurge of anger and determination of the crowd caught the authorities by surprise , and the uprising quickly spread .
symbols of russian rule were attacked and destroyed - steadily , hungarians took back control of their capital city .
many soldiers sided with the uprising and helped to distribute weapons and ammunition , arming the makeshift army .
fighters were young and old , men and women .
the uprising affected people across the country , in cities and countryside .
the fighters used urban warfare tactics such as petrol bombs to disable tanks .
moscow withdrew its troops on 30 october .
there were heavy casualties on both sides , and the fighters often dealt a savage death to the hated secret police .
imre nagy acted as prime minister - when the uprising failed he was executed for refusing to condemn the fighters .
when the russians returned on 4 november , they met stiff resistance at the killian barracks and on csepel island .
