it 's expected to aid anti-terror measures at the eu-level . when germany 's anti-terror register finally comes into being , it wo n't just make things easier for german officials - it will also improve cooperation with the european police force , europol , which is already working on an eu-wide counter-terrorism database . at its headquarters in the hague , europol has computers where eu member states can save names and relevant details about terrorist suspects or witnesses .
additionally , the databanks contain information on organized crime , drug smuggling and human trafficking .
the computer system , tecs , can compare and analyze as many as a million data sets . the data is entered into the system directly by the 25 eu member states .
each country is represented by its own liaison officer , or elos , in the hague .
as a rule , only these liaison officers have access to the national databanks . if a member state wants to find out whether there is information in tecs on a terror suspect , europol puts together an information packet - a service that europol 's director , max-peter ratzel , is intent on putting first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol director max-peter ratzel " terrorism is , of course , very much in the foreground , because that 's where the biggest risks lie , " ratzel said .
" we have to do everything possible in order to identify and eliminate threats , so that we can offer member states the means to avoid danger .
we only need a few people to filter out the right information ; the member states are then responsible for acting on that information . " privacy advocates are critical though , about the fact that the member states can relatively freely feed data into tecs which is then consolidated into suspect profiles .
tecs saves the data for a period of at least three years . europol got its start in the mid-90s as an agency to fight drugs-related crime .
gradually , it 's grown into an institution with a staff of 500 whose main task is to organize information exchanges . other eu networks in addition to europol 's databanks , five of the largest eu states - france , britain , italy , spain and germany - share a computer network aimed at fighting terrorism .
seven states - france , spain , the netherlands , belgium , luxembourg , austria and germany - have also signed a pact to improve cross-border cooperation of their police forces when it comes to the arrest , search and trailing of suspects . but cross-border cooperation of police is by no means comprehensively regulated across the eu , and many states have misgivings .
eu commissioner for justice and security franco frattini has been pushing for stronger cooperation , and is hopeful progress will be made given the current threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following the foiled plot to blow up planes flying from britain to the us , germany is again focused on security for air and rail passengers " there is now , i think , a consensus among the member states that it 's important to really work together , " frattini said .
" we have to stay on the ball . " a directive by the eu 's interior ministry to retain internet and phone data to aid police investigations is , after the introduction of europe-wide arrest warrants , a necessary step , frattini said .
he is also working on other legislative measures to put on the table by the end of this year .
the eu would like to introduce tougher controls on the production and trade in explosives , for example .
it 's also looking into why and how muslim youths in europe are being radicalized . personal freedom still a concern frattini stresses that civil liberties should not be sacrificed in the drive for better protection from terrorists .
in this respect , he said , the united states with its far-reaching curtailments on telecommunications secrecy is no role model for the eu . " this is our political challenge , " frattini said . "
if terrorists force us to restrict our freedom , then the terrorists win .
we can never allow that to happen . " although much has been achieved when it comes to improving police cooperation at the european level , the eu 's anti-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries bemoans the fact that in some areas , progress has been too slow .
he said he is hopeful that eu interior ministers will eventually give up their opposition to majority-rules decisions at the european level . " there 's a lot of demand for the eu to help its member states more effectively , " de vries said .
" i hope that the discussion about a transition from unanimous to majority decisions will be a motivating factor to do more than we have in the past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.08.2006 opinion : deficit-sinner germany mending its ways großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany may manage this year to keep its deficit down to the level required by the eu stability pact , which underpins the euro .
instead of raising taxes , however , it should reduce spending , says dw 's karl zawadzky . first the good news : germany managed to reduce its national deficit to 2.5 percent in the first half of this year .
the positive trend can be traced back to a broader economic upswing , which brought in increased tax revenues . the public deficit is n't likely to increase in the second half of 2006 , and germany may even finally be able to shed its stigma in the european union as the " stability pact rogue " - an image it had earned through several years of higher-than-permitted debt statistics .
the national deficit in the first half of 2005 was , for example , as high as 3.7 percent . according to figures released thursday by the federal statistical office , the national deficit in the first half of this year amounted to 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 35.8 billion -rrb- in real numbers , which is a good 12 billion euros less than during the same time frame last year . social security contributions , on the other hand , have remained stagnant due to only minimal changes in wages .
however , expenditures made by the government unemployment agencies this year dropped dramatically as a result of cutbacks . finance minister peer steinbrück , who bore the consequences of the political demise of his predecessor hans eichel , is reluctant to be too hasty in celebrating the success reports , lest he eat his words in just a few months ' time . tax hikes to maintain low deficit ? the government has emphasized that it will stick to its promise that , starting next year , germany 's national deficit will not exceed the maximum deficit agreed upon in the eu 's stability pact .
this contractual agreement stipulates that the deficit of all public budgets , including social security , may not exceed 3 percent of the country 's gross domestic product . thanks to positive market conditions in recent months and the higher tax revenues that resulted , germany wo n't violate the pact this year .
even a slight economic downturn will not prevent germany from meeting the deficit standard in the future . now for the not-so-good news : in order to keep the deficit within the limitations set by the stability pact , hefty tax hikes are necessary . at the beginning of 2007 , sales tax will be raised from 16 to 19 percent .
tax increases in other areas are planned as well , though they wo n't be quite as big as the sales tax hike . taken together , tax revenues are expected to increase by more than 20 billion euros per year , which will keep germany on the safe side as far as the stability pact criteria are concerned . cut spending instead of raising taxes however , burdening the taxpayers in order to meet eu deficit criteria is problematic . federal , state and local expenditures will continue to increase , even if only slightly .
market fluctuation aside , germany has a structural problem : germans pay more in tax and social contributions than those in other industrial countries . considerable reductions in spending - not another tax hike for the already burdened taxpayers - would be a better approach to trimming down the national deficit . karl zawadzky is deutsche welle 's chief business correspondent . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany up in arms over minister 's holiday comments germany 's finance minister has sparked outrage by suggesting germans should spend less on their annual holidays and instead put money aside for their old age .

why does n't she like me ?
what is a condom ?
generations of confused german teenagers have turned to dr. sommer for honesty - and explicit photos . sandra , 16 , looks up coyly from the pages of bravo , wearing a black choker and nothing else .
boyfriend elias , 18 , grins from the opposite page , also in his natural state . " tell me , why do you love each other ? " reads the headline .
and the young couple tells why - and exactly how . sell this in america , and risk prison time for child pornography . but in germany , this is nothing tawdry . it 's the country 's most popular teenage magazine , and it turns 50 on saturday . sandra and elias ' graphic spread is in the same issue as a free sheet of fake tattoos , a feature about harry potter , and an exclusive report on tokio hotel , the german boy band currently making girls swoon . a german institution since 1969 , dr. sommer combines no-holds-barred sex advice with full-frontal photos . it highlights a basic cultural divide between germany and many other countries - of how openly sex is discussed , especially among youth . " it is not pornography , " says bravo 's deputy editor , alex gernandt .
" it deals with naked people , but in a very sensitive way .
we try to portray young people to tell readers , ' you are not too fat , not too thin .
you are ok the way you are . ' " there are a lot less teenage pregnancies in germany in comparison to the united kingdom or the us , and i think bravo has its share in that success , " gernandt said . breaking taboos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was seduced at 14 , " kristijan says the current dr. sommer , eveline von arx , credits the column with germany 's free sexual attitudes . when it began in 1969 , " dr. sommer really broke taboos , and it was really spectacular to do something like that , " said von arx , who has been writing the column for three years .
" it 's not that spectacular anymore .
people are used to it .
everybody knows it . " each weekly issue of bravo now features photos of two teenagers , generally between 16 and 20 , in the nude , with interviews about their bodies and experiences . anyone under 18 , like sandra , must have his or her parents ' permission to appear . they are paid 400 euros -lrb- a little more than $ 500 -rrb- to pose , and many report the experience is a self-esteem boost , von arx said . weekly letters range from " my boyfriend is once again interested in his former girlfriend " to " everybody 's had sex , only i have n't . "
sample answer : " nowhere does it say that youth have to have sex by a certain time … talk to your boyfriend about it .
tell him how you feel . " " you can be sexy here " bravo 's web site even features explicit petting and positions photo galleries that would n't last a day in other countries . the magazine publishes its eastern european editions with little to no nudity .
but in germany , even teachers and religious leaders seem to welcome the column .
von arx has spoken in schools and was even invited as a youth expert to a big evangelical christian conference last year . gisela gille , chairman of germany 's society for the health of women , said bravo plays an important role in the sexual education of germany 's 12- to 15-year-olds , particularly the lesser educated .
gille said the advice satisfies basic curiosities , but that many teenagers read bravo only for a short time and stop when they become more experienced . tanja reddig , a 17-year-old berlin student , said that she read dr. sommer when she was 12 and 13 and did n't see what the fuss was over the nudity . " you can be sexy here and you do n't get any problems , " she said .
" in america , they ca n't show bodies .
they must hide something .
some teenagers do n't want to ask their parents things , so they could write a letter to dr. sommer . " started by popular demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's youth seem concerned with balancing love and work dr. sommer began during the sexual revolution of 1969 .
bravo was then a strictly entertainment magazine , but its young readers nonetheless kept writing letters about love and sex . so editors figured such a column would increase their readership , according to antje pfeffer of the berlin-based archive of youth culture -lrb- archiv der jugendkulturen -rrb- , which has published a book about bravo 's 50 year history . " dr. sommer immediately was greeted as too open , " pfeffer said . some parents glued the dr. sommer pages together so their teenagers could n't read the column , others banned it from the house .
some schools confiscated it , and in communist east germany , many clamored for smuggled copies . but from the start , the column took its mission quite seriously .
the first dr. sommer , martin goldstein , recalled in the berlin archive 's book that he and his team of social workers , psychologists , sociologists , political scientists , family counselors and parents would spend hours going through letters : i have fallen in love with a sweet young boy .
if he would kiss me , i would be happy for my entire life .
how can i get him to do it ?
i see him almost every day and i already know his name .
but do n't tell me that i should talk to him .
janne , 14 the boys in our village seem to have no interest in us , no matter what we do . we do not know how we can get their attention .
ina , renate , anne and beate , 15 and 16 the team tried to respond in an encouraging , non-judgemental way .
but often , they wondered whether the teenagers had anyone else they could confide in .
they were shocked at how many letters were sent in - sometimes 3,000 to 5,000 a month . " we believed it was because young people wanted to be listened to , " goldstein recalled . evolving topics soon , they were dealing with much thornier issues , such as a 1988 letter titled " my mum 's boyfriend sexually abused me . " by the end of the 1980s , dr. sommer had become more mainstream , and answers seemed freer .
for instance , nicola , 15 , wrote in with the basic question , " how do i show him that i want more ? " the answer : tell him what you want .
or , just push his hand higher . von arx says many of the letters have not changed much over the years .
but recently she has seen more teenagers concerned that they wo n't get ahead in school because they are so distracted by lovesickness . she is often asked if the column is even necessary anymore . " people think our society is very sexualized , and naked bodies and sex are everywhere , and young people should know everything , " she said .

why does n't she like me ?
what is a condom ?
generations of confused german teenagers have turned to dr. sommer for honesty - and explicit photos . sandra , 16 , looks up coyly from the pages of bravo , wearing a black choker and nothing else .
boyfriend elias , 18 , grins from the opposite page , also in his natural state . " tell me , why do you love each other ? " reads the headline .
and the young couple tells why - and exactly how . sell this in america , and risk prison time for child pornography . but in germany , this is nothing tawdry . it 's the country 's most popular teenage magazine , and it turns 50 on saturday . sandra and elias ' graphic spread is in the same issue as a free sheet of fake tattoos , a feature about harry potter , and an exclusive report on tokio hotel , the german boy band currently making girls swoon . a german institution since 1969 , dr. sommer combines no-holds-barred sex advice with full-frontal photos . it highlights a basic cultural divide between germany and many other countries - of how openly sex is discussed , especially among youth . " it is not pornography , " says bravo 's deputy editor , alex gernandt .
" it deals with naked people , but in a very sensitive way .
we try to portray young people to tell readers , ' you are not too fat , not too thin .
you are ok the way you are . ' " there are a lot less teenage pregnancies in germany in comparison to the united kingdom or the us , and i think bravo has its share in that success , " gernandt said . breaking taboos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was seduced at 14 , " kristijan says the current dr. sommer , eveline von arx , credits the column with germany 's free sexual attitudes . when it began in 1969 , " dr. sommer really broke taboos , and it was really spectacular to do something like that , " said von arx , who has been writing the column for three years .
" it 's not that spectacular anymore .
people are used to it .
everybody knows it . " each weekly issue of bravo now features photos of two teenagers , generally between 16 and 20 , in the nude , with interviews about their bodies and experiences . anyone under 18 , like sandra , must have his or her parents ' permission to appear . they are paid 400 euros -lrb- a little more than $ 500 -rrb- to pose , and many report the experience is a self-esteem boost , von arx said . weekly letters range from " my boyfriend is once again interested in his former girlfriend " to " everybody 's had sex , only i have n't . "
sample answer : " nowhere does it say that youth have to have sex by a certain time … talk to your boyfriend about it .
tell him how you feel . " " you can be sexy here " bravo 's web site even features explicit petting and positions photo galleries that would n't last a day in other countries . the magazine publishes its eastern european editions with little to no nudity .
but in germany , even teachers and religious leaders seem to welcome the column .
von arx has spoken in schools and was even invited as a youth expert to a big evangelical christian conference last year . gisela gille , chairman of germany 's society for the health of women , said bravo plays an important role in the sexual education of germany 's 12- to 15-year-olds , particularly the lesser educated .
gille said the advice satisfies basic curiosities , but that many teenagers read bravo only for a short time and stop when they become more experienced . tanja reddig , a 17-year-old berlin student , said that she read dr. sommer when she was 12 and 13 and did n't see what the fuss was over the nudity . " you can be sexy here and you do n't get any problems , " she said .
" in america , they ca n't show bodies .
they must hide something .
some teenagers do n't want to ask their parents things , so they could write a letter to dr. sommer . " started by popular demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's youth seem concerned with balancing love and work dr. sommer began during the sexual revolution of 1969 .
bravo was then a strictly entertainment magazine , but its young readers nonetheless kept writing letters about love and sex . so editors figured such a column would increase their readership , according to antje pfeffer of the berlin-based archive of youth culture -lrb- archiv der jugendkulturen -rrb- , which has published a book about bravo 's 50 year history . " dr. sommer immediately was greeted as too open , " pfeffer said . some parents glued the dr. sommer pages together so their teenagers could n't read the column , others banned it from the house .
some schools confiscated it , and in communist east germany , many clamored for smuggled copies . but from the start , the column took its mission quite seriously .
the first dr. sommer , martin goldstein , recalled in the berlin archive 's book that he and his team of social workers , psychologists , sociologists , political scientists , family counselors and parents would spend hours going through letters : i have fallen in love with a sweet young boy .
if he would kiss me , i would be happy for my entire life .
how can i get him to do it ?
i see him almost every day and i already know his name .
but do n't tell me that i should talk to him .
janne , 14 the boys in our village seem to have no interest in us , no matter what we do . we do not know how we can get their attention .
ina , renate , anne and beate , 15 and 16 the team tried to respond in an encouraging , non-judgemental way .
but often , they wondered whether the teenagers had anyone else they could confide in .
they were shocked at how many letters were sent in - sometimes 3,000 to 5,000 a month . " we believed it was because young people wanted to be listened to , " goldstein recalled . evolving topics soon , they were dealing with much thornier issues , such as a 1988 letter titled " my mum 's boyfriend sexually abused me . " by the end of the 1980s , dr. sommer had become more mainstream , and answers seemed freer .
for instance , nicola , 15 , wrote in with the basic question , " how do i show him that i want more ? " the answer : tell him what you want .
or , just push his hand higher . von arx says many of the letters have not changed much over the years .
but recently she has seen more teenagers concerned that they wo n't get ahead in school because they are so distracted by lovesickness . she is often asked if the column is even necessary anymore . " people think our society is very sexualized , and naked bodies and sex are everywhere , and young people should know everything , " she said .
" but they do n't know anything sometimes .

the positive trend can be traced back to a broader economic upswing , which brought in increased tax revenues . the public deficit is n't likely to increase in the second half of 2006 , and germany may even finally be able to shed its stigma in the european union as the " stability pact rogue " - an image it had earned through several years of higher-than-permitted debt statistics .
the national deficit in the first half of 2005 was , for example , as high as 3.7 percent . according to figures released thursday by the federal statistical office , the national deficit in the first half of this year amounted to 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 35.8 billion -rrb- in real numbers , which is a good 12 billion euros less than during the same time frame last year . social security contributions , on the other hand , have remained stagnant due to only minimal changes in wages .
however , expenditures made by the government unemployment agencies this year dropped dramatically as a result of cutbacks . finance minister peer steinbrück , who bore the consequences of the political demise of his predecessor hans eichel , is reluctant to be too hasty in celebrating the success reports , lest he eat his words in just a few months ' time . tax hikes to maintain low deficit ? the government has emphasized that it will stick to its promise that , starting next year , germany 's national deficit will not exceed the maximum deficit agreed upon in the eu 's stability pact .
this contractual agreement stipulates that the deficit of all public budgets , including social security , may not exceed 3 percent of the country 's gross domestic product . thanks to positive market conditions in recent months and the higher tax revenues that resulted , germany wo n't violate the pact this year .
even a slight economic downturn will not prevent germany from meeting the deficit standard in the future . now for the not-so-good news : in order to keep the deficit within the limitations set by the stability pact , hefty tax hikes are necessary . at the beginning of 2007 , sales tax will be raised from 16 to 19 percent .
tax increases in other areas are planned as well , though they wo n't be quite as big as the sales tax hike . taken together , tax revenues are expected to increase by more than 20 billion euros per year , which will keep germany on the safe side as far as the stability pact criteria are concerned . cut spending instead of raising taxes however , burdening the taxpayers in order to meet eu deficit criteria is problematic . federal , state and local expenditures will continue to increase , even if only slightly .
market fluctuation aside , germany has a structural problem : germans pay more in tax and social contributions than those in other industrial countries . considerable reductions in spending - not another tax hike for the already burdened taxpayers - would be a better approach to trimming down the national deficit . karl zawadzky is deutsche welle 's chief business correspondent . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany up in arms over minister 's holiday comments germany 's finance minister has sparked outrage by suggesting germans should spend less on their annual holidays and instead put money aside for their old age .

chirac said he agreed to send the extra two battalions after winning a robust mandate for unifil and guarantees the force would be able to cope if hostilities flare up again . " i wonder how it would have been judged if i had raced off like a mad dog without thinking or securing minimum guarantees , " he said in paris . he also questioned the goal of boosting the force to 15,000 soldiers , calling that " a totally excessive figure " given lebanon 's relatively small size . other eu contributors the announcement of the french reinforcements spurred some of the other eu countries into firming up previously vague promises to contribute . spain was said to be ready to send 1,000 to 1,200 soldiers , substantially more than the 800 initially cited in media reports . poland 's private television station tvn24 reported foreign minister anna fotyga as saying warsaw 's total contribution would be around 500 troops which includes 214 already serving with unifil . belgian foreign minister guy verhofstadt said his country would provide 300 soldiers by late september or early october , with the possibility of adding nearly 100 more later .

kurnaz will not attend as he is with his family and needs time to adjust to his freedom , he said . " he will undergo medical treatment and will not be appearing in public , " docke said .
" mr kurnaz has been through hell . " earlier , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said an agreement on the release of kurnaz had come after the successful conclusion of long negotiations between the us and german governments . no proof of terrorist activity kurnaz , dubbed the " bremen taliban " after the northern german city where he lived , was arrested in pakistan in late 2001 , and taken to guantanamo bay in 2002 on suspicion of having fought for al qaeda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allegations of torture at guantanamo bay have prompted widespread protest from human rights organizations a us court found allegations of kurnaz 's involvement in terrorist activities to be untrue .
his release follows months of talks between the us and german governments .
chancellor angela merkel reportedly brought up the issue when she met with president george w. bush in stralsund last month . kurnaz said he suffered abuse including sexual humiliation , water torture and the desecration of islam at guantanamo . according to reports in der spiegel , berlin has refused us requests that kurnaz be put under constant surveillance and his passport confiscated .
however , he will not be free to completely return to his old life .
prosecutors in bremen intend to investigate kurnaz on suspicion of involvement in a criminal network .
experts close to the case say kurnaz 's detention at guantanamo was unlawful . us and german intelligence concluded as early as 2002 that kurnaz had no connection to al qaeda , the taliban or any terrorist threat , said baher azmy , a seton hall law school professor who has represented kurnaz since mid-2004 . " the government 's evidence against kurnaz has ranged from incredibly tangential to at times preposterous , " azmy said in a statement . " kurnaz 's case lays to shameful waste the government 's repeated assertions that guantanamo houses only hardened terrorists or persons captured on the battlefield , " azmy said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de release of german-born guantanamo prisoner expected soon top german politicians have been advocating his release for months .
now it looks like murat kurnaz from bremen will return home by the end of the month , after more than four years at guantanamo .

german authorities may have delayed his release by years , according to media reports .

a year ago , murat kurnaz left bremen to " see and experience the koran " in pakistan .
since then , he 's been locked up at guantanamo bay , suspected of fighting for the taliban .

kurnaz will not attend as he is with his family and needs time to adjust to his freedom , he said . " he will undergo medical treatment and will not be appearing in public , " docke said .
" mr kurnaz has been through hell . " earlier , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said an agreement on the release of kurnaz had come after the successful conclusion of long negotiations between the us and german governments . no proof of terrorist activity kurnaz , dubbed the " bremen taliban " after the northern german city where he lived , was arrested in pakistan in late 2001 , and taken to guantanamo bay in 2002 on suspicion of having fought for al qaeda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allegations of torture at guantanamo bay have prompted widespread protest from human rights organizations a us court found allegations of kurnaz 's involvement in terrorist activities to be untrue .
his release follows months of talks between the us and german governments .
chancellor angela merkel reportedly brought up the issue when she met with president george w. bush in stralsund last month . kurnaz said he suffered abuse including sexual humiliation , water torture and the desecration of islam at guantanamo . according to reports in der spiegel , berlin has refused us requests that kurnaz be put under constant surveillance and his passport confiscated .
however , he will not be free to completely return to his old life .
prosecutors in bremen intend to investigate kurnaz on suspicion of involvement in a criminal network .
experts close to the case say kurnaz 's detention at guantanamo was unlawful . us and german intelligence concluded as early as 2002 that kurnaz had no connection to al qaeda , the taliban or any terrorist threat , said baher azmy , a seton hall law school professor who has represented kurnaz since mid-2004 . " the government 's evidence against kurnaz has ranged from incredibly tangential to at times preposterous , " azmy said in a statement . " kurnaz 's case lays to shameful waste the government 's repeated assertions that guantanamo houses only hardened terrorists or persons captured on the battlefield , " azmy said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de release of german-born guantanamo prisoner expected soon top german politicians have been advocating his release for months .
now it looks like murat kurnaz from bremen will return home by the end of the month , after more than four years at guantanamo .

21 , 2006 -rrb- " bremen taliban " release anticipated a turkish man living in bremen is expected to be allowed to return to germany from the us military base in guantanamo bay .
german authorities may have delayed his release by years , according to media reports .
-lrb- march 29 , 2006 -rrb- ' bremen taliban ' or victim of circumstance ?
a year ago , murat kurnaz left bremen to " see and experience the koran " in pakistan .
since then , he 's been locked up at guantanamo bay , suspected of fighting for the taliban .
but german investigators say there 's no proof .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.08.2006 opinion : deficit-sinner germany mending its ways großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany may manage this year to keep its deficit down to the level required by the eu stability pact , which underpins the euro .
instead of raising taxes , however , it should reduce spending , says dw 's karl zawadzky . first the good news : germany managed to reduce its national deficit to 2.5 percent in the first half of this year .
the positive trend can be traced back to a broader economic upswing , which brought in increased tax revenues . the public deficit is n't likely to increase in the second half of 2006 , and germany may even finally be able to shed its stigma in the european union as the " stability pact rogue " - an image it had earned through several years of higher-than-permitted debt statistics .
the national deficit in the first half of 2005 was , for example , as high as 3.7 percent . according to figures released thursday by the federal statistical office , the national deficit in the first half of this year amounted to 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 35.8 billion -rrb- in real numbers , which is a good 12 billion euros less than during the same time frame last year . social security contributions , on the other hand , have remained stagnant due to only minimal changes in wages .
however , expenditures made by the government unemployment agencies this year dropped dramatically as a result of cutbacks . finance minister peer steinbrück , who bore the consequences of the political demise of his predecessor hans eichel , is reluctant to be too hasty in celebrating the success reports , lest he eat his words in just a few months ' time . tax hikes to maintain low deficit ? the government has emphasized that it will stick to its promise that , starting next year , germany 's national deficit will not exceed the maximum deficit agreed upon in the eu 's stability pact .
this contractual agreement stipulates that the deficit of all public budgets , including social security , may not exceed 3 percent of the country 's gross domestic product . thanks to positive market conditions in recent months and the higher tax revenues that resulted , germany wo n't violate the pact this year .
even a slight economic downturn will not prevent germany from meeting the deficit standard in the future . now for the not-so-good news : in order to keep the deficit within the limitations set by the stability pact , hefty tax hikes are necessary . at the beginning of 2007 , sales tax will be raised from 16 to 19 percent .
tax increases in other areas are planned as well , though they wo n't be quite as big as the sales tax hike . taken together , tax revenues are expected to increase by more than 20 billion euros per year , which will keep germany on the safe side as far as the stability pact criteria are concerned . cut spending instead of raising taxes however , burdening the taxpayers in order to meet eu deficit criteria is problematic . federal , state and local expenditures will continue to increase , even if only slightly .
market fluctuation aside , germany has a structural problem : germans pay more in tax and social contributions than those in other industrial countries . considerable reductions in spending - not another tax hike for the already burdened taxpayers - would be a better approach to trimming down the national deficit . karl zawadzky is deutsche welle 's chief business correspondent . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany up in arms over minister 's holiday comments germany 's finance minister has sparked outrage by suggesting germans should spend less on their annual holidays and instead put money aside for their old age .

many of the demonstrators were members of berlin 's jewish community or the conservative christian democrats . however , there were some there who belonged to the far-left and sported all the accoutrements of those who are known as autonomen in germany - black clothing , buttons or patches with political slogans or insignia , and often scarves , sunglasses or baseball caps to make them harder to identify . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators often clash with police but this time they had n't come to disrupt the demonstration , shout out anti-zionist slogans or get into tussles with police , as they often do .
the group of anti-germans had actually organized the demonstration under the slogan " unconditional solidarity with israel , " one of the core positions of their movement . such a stance puts the group firmly at odds with the majority viewpoint of germany 's far-left movement , which since the 1970s has been overwhelmingly pro-palestinian and very critical of israeli policy .
completing the philosophical break is the support of many anti-germans for us president george w. bush , who for the traditional far left is anathema .

" so -lrb- anti-germans -rrb- act according to the motto : the enemy of my enemy is my friend .

kurnaz will not attend as he is with his family and needs time to adjust to his freedom , he said . " he will undergo medical treatment and will not be appearing in public , " docke said .
" mr kurnaz has been through hell . " earlier , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said an agreement on the release of kurnaz had come after the successful conclusion of long negotiations between the us and german governments . no proof of terrorist activity kurnaz , dubbed the " bremen taliban " after the northern german city where he lived , was arrested in pakistan in late 2001 , and taken to guantanamo bay in 2002 on suspicion of having fought for al qaeda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allegations of torture at guantanamo bay have prompted widespread protest from human rights organizations a us court found allegations of kurnaz 's involvement in terrorist activities to be untrue .
his release follows months of talks between the us and german governments .
chancellor angela merkel reportedly brought up the issue when she met with president george w. bush in stralsund last month . kurnaz said he suffered abuse including sexual humiliation , water torture and the desecration of islam at guantanamo . according to reports in der spiegel , berlin has refused us requests that kurnaz be put under constant surveillance and his passport confiscated .
however , he will not be free to completely return to his old life .
prosecutors in bremen intend to investigate kurnaz on suspicion of involvement in a criminal network .
experts close to the case say kurnaz 's detention at guantanamo was unlawful . us and german intelligence concluded as early as 2002 that kurnaz had no connection to al qaeda , the taliban or any terrorist threat , said baher azmy , a seton hall law school professor who has represented kurnaz since mid-2004 . " the government 's evidence against kurnaz has ranged from incredibly tangential to at times preposterous , " azmy said in a statement . " kurnaz 's case lays to shameful waste the government 's repeated assertions that guantanamo houses only hardened terrorists or persons captured on the battlefield , " azmy said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de release of german-born guantanamo prisoner expected soon top german politicians have been advocating his release for months .

a year ago , murat kurnaz left bremen to " see and experience the koran " in pakistan .

most call themselves communists , yet loudly proclaim their support for israel and george w. bush . when it comes to the anti-germans , the political big tent theory appears to have become fact : groups that generally ca n't bear to be in the same room sometimes unite for a common cause . that was on show recently in western berlin , where thousands had gathered to show their support for israel during the recent conflict with hezbollah militants in lebanon .
many of the demonstrators were members of berlin 's jewish community or the conservative christian democrats . however , there were some there who belonged to the far-left and sported all the accoutrements of those who are known as autonomen in germany - black clothing , buttons or patches with political slogans or insignia , and often scarves , sunglasses or baseball caps to make them harder to identify . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators often clash with police but this time they had n't come to disrupt the demonstration , shout out anti-zionist slogans or get into tussles with police , as they often do .
the group of anti-germans had actually organized the demonstration under the slogan " unconditional solidarity with israel , " one of the core positions of their movement . such a stance puts the group firmly at odds with the majority viewpoint of germany 's far-left movement , which since the 1970s has been overwhelmingly pro-palestinian and very critical of israeli policy .
completing the philosophical break is the support of many anti-germans for us president george w. bush , who for the traditional far left is anathema . " it has to do with george w. bush 's conception for a new middle east , which is essentially supported , " said rüdiger göbel , deputy editor-in-chief of junge welt , a left-wing daily based in berlin .
" the anti-germans are actually closer to the neo-conservatives in the united states . " fighting a " new fascism " to many observers , the anti-germans are a conundrum .
most consider themselves communists , but according to a study carried out by patrick hagen at the university of cologne , they " have abandoned almost all of the essentials of the communist movement and the left , such as the positive relations to the working class , anti-imperialism and anti-racism which has led to a deep split within the extra-parliamentary left . " the anti-german movement can be traced back to the fall of the berlin wall , where some on the far left demonstrated against reunification , warning that a stronger germany could result in a new militarism and even a " fourth reich . "
they based their slogan on the phrase often used in holocaust remembrance ceremonies : " never again . "
the anti-germans went further , rallying around " germany , never again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators at a anti-nazi rally as time went on , the group began to show more support for the united states .
in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of the destruction of dresden by the allies , the anti-germans praised the bombing of the civil population , since in their view , so many of them had supported the nazi regime . but the movement really got behind the stars and stripes after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , which they saw as anti-semitic and targeted at israel .
to them , it marked the rise of a new type of fascism .
this time is was n't from the far right , but from radical islam and it had to be fought .
the us , in their eyes , was the only one willing to fight it . " islamic terrorists and states such as syria and iran want to liquidate israel , " said hermann gremliza , publisher of the leftist magazine konkret and one of the leading figures in the anti-german movement , in an e-mail response .
" so -lrb- anti-germans -rrb- act according to the motto : the enemy of my enemy is my friend . " just after the war in iraq broke out in 2003 , the anti-german magazine bahamas wrote an editorial entitled " bush - the man of peace ! " whose side are they on ? these kinds of positions have put the group in sometimes violent opposition to the traditional far left .
when anti-germans show up at left-wing demonstrations with signs supporting american policy or israel , they are generally not welcomed warmly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would che have supported george w. bush ?
" whoever carries an israeli flag is insulted and spit upon , " gremliza said .
" but what do you expect , we 're in germany . " the traditional far left accuses the anti-germans of getting in bed with the bourgeoisie .
some writers in the anti-german camp even write occasionally for the online site of the newsmagazine der spiegel or even such bastions of conservatism as the daily die welt . observers say that means they have an influence beyond their actual numbers , which are estimated between 500 and 3,000 .
gremliza , however , said around 50,000 people read his magazine konkret . anti-german goals , he says , are to uncover what group members see as the hypocrisy of a german foreign policy that has been harmful to israel and helped the rise of a new " islamic " fascism , which they see as a direct descendent of the form practiced by the nazis . " germany wants an alliance with the islamic world - against the us , " he said , despite angela merkel 's close ties to her american counterpart .

why does n't she like me ?
what is a condom ?
generations of confused german teenagers have turned to dr. sommer for honesty - and explicit photos . sandra , 16 , looks up coyly from the pages of bravo , wearing a black choker and nothing else .
boyfriend elias , 18 , grins from the opposite page , also in his natural state . " tell me , why do you love each other ? " reads the headline .
and the young couple tells why - and exactly how . sell this in america , and risk prison time for child pornography . but in germany , this is nothing tawdry . it 's the country 's most popular teenage magazine , and it turns 50 on saturday . sandra and elias ' graphic spread is in the same issue as a free sheet of fake tattoos , a feature about harry potter , and an exclusive report on tokio hotel , the german boy band currently making girls swoon . a german institution since 1969 , dr. sommer combines no-holds-barred sex advice with full-frontal photos . it highlights a basic cultural divide between germany and many other countries - of how openly sex is discussed , especially among youth . " it is not pornography , " says bravo 's deputy editor , alex gernandt .
" it deals with naked people , but in a very sensitive way .
we try to portray young people to tell readers , ' you are not too fat , not too thin .
you are ok the way you are . ' " there are a lot less teenage pregnancies in germany in comparison to the united kingdom or the us , and i think bravo has its share in that success , " gernandt said . breaking taboos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was seduced at 14 , " kristijan says the current dr. sommer , eveline von arx , credits the column with germany 's free sexual attitudes . when it began in 1969 , " dr. sommer really broke taboos , and it was really spectacular to do something like that , " said von arx , who has been writing the column for three years .
" it 's not that spectacular anymore .
people are used to it .
everybody knows it . " each weekly issue of bravo now features photos of two teenagers , generally between 16 and 20 , in the nude , with interviews about their bodies and experiences . anyone under 18 , like sandra , must have his or her parents ' permission to appear . they are paid 400 euros -lrb- a little more than $ 500 -rrb- to pose , and many report the experience is a self-esteem boost , von arx said . weekly letters range from " my boyfriend is once again interested in his former girlfriend " to " everybody 's had sex , only i have n't . "
sample answer : " nowhere does it say that youth have to have sex by a certain time … talk to your boyfriend about it .
tell him how you feel . " " you can be sexy here " bravo 's web site even features explicit petting and positions photo galleries that would n't last a day in other countries . the magazine publishes its eastern european editions with little to no nudity .
but in germany , even teachers and religious leaders seem to welcome the column .
von arx has spoken in schools and was even invited as a youth expert to a big evangelical christian conference last year . gisela gille , chairman of germany 's society for the health of women , said bravo plays an important role in the sexual education of germany 's 12- to 15-year-olds , particularly the lesser educated .
gille said the advice satisfies basic curiosities , but that many teenagers read bravo only for a short time and stop when they become more experienced . tanja reddig , a 17-year-old berlin student , said that she read dr. sommer when she was 12 and 13 and did n't see what the fuss was over the nudity . " you can be sexy here and you do n't get any problems , " she said .
" in america , they ca n't show bodies .
they must hide something .
some teenagers do n't want to ask their parents things , so they could write a letter to dr. sommer . " started by popular demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's youth seem concerned with balancing love and work dr. sommer began during the sexual revolution of 1969 .
bravo was then a strictly entertainment magazine , but its young readers nonetheless kept writing letters about love and sex . so editors figured such a column would increase their readership , according to antje pfeffer of the berlin-based archive of youth culture -lrb- archiv der jugendkulturen -rrb- , which has published a book about bravo 's 50 year history . " dr. sommer immediately was greeted as too open , " pfeffer said . some parents glued the dr. sommer pages together so their teenagers could n't read the column , others banned it from the house .
some schools confiscated it , and in communist east germany , many clamored for smuggled copies . but from the start , the column took its mission quite seriously .
the first dr. sommer , martin goldstein , recalled in the berlin archive 's book that he and his team of social workers , psychologists , sociologists , political scientists , family counselors and parents would spend hours going through letters : i have fallen in love with a sweet young boy .
if he would kiss me , i would be happy for my entire life .
how can i get him to do it ?
i see him almost every day and i already know his name .
but do n't tell me that i should talk to him .
janne , 14 the boys in our village seem to have no interest in us , no matter what we do . we do not know how we can get their attention .
ina , renate , anne and beate , 15 and 16 the team tried to respond in an encouraging , non-judgemental way .
but often , they wondered whether the teenagers had anyone else they could confide in .
they were shocked at how many letters were sent in - sometimes 3,000 to 5,000 a month . " we believed it was because young people wanted to be listened to , " goldstein recalled . evolving topics soon , they were dealing with much thornier issues , such as a 1988 letter titled " my mum 's boyfriend sexually abused me .

" it does not state what we expect - namely ' we are suspending uranium enrichment , coming to the negotiating table and will speak about the opportunities and possibilities for iran . '
that is unfortunately not the case , " merkel said in a television interview . " the decisive sentence is missing and this needs to be addressed . " germany is part of the sextet that offered the package of incentives to tehran to stop nuclear fuel work , along with the united states , britain , france , russia and china . on friday , france also said that the iranian response fell short .
however , french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said it was important to avoid an escalation of the conflict with iran . " for the moment it is not satisfactory , " he told rtl radio .
" but the worst thing would be to escalate into a confrontation with iran on the one hand , and the muslim world with iran , and the west .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.08.2006 opinion : deficit-sinner germany mending its ways großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany may manage this year to keep its deficit down to the level required by the eu stability pact , which underpins the euro .
instead of raising taxes , however , it should reduce spending , says dw 's karl zawadzky . first the good news : germany managed to reduce its national deficit to 2.5 percent in the first half of this year .
the positive trend can be traced back to a broader economic upswing , which brought in increased tax revenues . the public deficit is n't likely to increase in the second half of 2006 , and germany may even finally be able to shed its stigma in the european union as the " stability pact rogue " - an image it had earned through several years of higher-than-permitted debt statistics .
the national deficit in the first half of 2005 was , for example , as high as 3.7 percent . according to figures released thursday by the federal statistical office , the national deficit in the first half of this year amounted to 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 35.8 billion -rrb- in real numbers , which is a good 12 billion euros less than during the same time frame last year . social security contributions , on the other hand , have remained stagnant due to only minimal changes in wages .
however , expenditures made by the government unemployment agencies this year dropped dramatically as a result of cutbacks . finance minister peer steinbrück , who bore the consequences of the political demise of his predecessor hans eichel , is reluctant to be too hasty in celebrating the success reports , lest he eat his words in just a few months ' time . tax hikes to maintain low deficit ? the government has emphasized that it will stick to its promise that , starting next year , germany 's national deficit will not exceed the maximum deficit agreed upon in the eu 's stability pact .
this contractual agreement stipulates that the deficit of all public budgets , including social security , may not exceed 3 percent of the country 's gross domestic product . thanks to positive market conditions in recent months and the higher tax revenues that resulted , germany wo n't violate the pact this year .
even a slight economic downturn will not prevent germany from meeting the deficit standard in the future . now for the not-so-good news : in order to keep the deficit within the limitations set by the stability pact , hefty tax hikes are necessary . at the beginning of 2007 , sales tax will be raised from 16 to 19 percent .
tax increases in other areas are planned as well , though they wo n't be quite as big as the sales tax hike . taken together , tax revenues are expected to increase by more than 20 billion euros per year , which will keep germany on the safe side as far as the stability pact criteria are concerned . cut spending instead of raising taxes however , burdening the taxpayers in order to meet eu deficit criteria is problematic . federal , state and local expenditures will continue to increase , even if only slightly .
market fluctuation aside , germany has a structural problem : germans pay more in tax and social contributions than those in other industrial countries . considerable reductions in spending - not another tax hike for the already burdened taxpayers - would be a better approach to trimming down the national deficit . karl zawadzky is deutsche welle 's chief business correspondent . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany up in arms over minister 's holiday comments germany 's finance minister has sparked outrage by suggesting germans should spend less on their annual holidays and instead put money aside for their old age .

the bavarian capital has a multitude of cultural attractions to offer , a wealth of history and a reputation for high living , beer drinking and careless abandon . however , despite being one of the most visited cities in germany , the munich local authorities are concerned that a not-so-small problem may be damaging the city 's reputation among visitors .

it 's expected to aid anti-terror measures at the eu-level . when germany 's anti-terror register finally comes into being , it wo n't just make things easier for german officials - it will also improve cooperation with the european police force , europol , which is already working on an eu-wide counter-terrorism database . at its headquarters in the hague , europol has computers where eu member states can save names and relevant details about terrorist suspects or witnesses .
additionally , the databanks contain information on organized crime , drug smuggling and human trafficking .
the computer system , tecs , can compare and analyze as many as a million data sets . the data is entered into the system directly by the 25 eu member states .
each country is represented by its own liaison officer , or elos , in the hague .
as a rule , only these liaison officers have access to the national databanks . if a member state wants to find out whether there is information in tecs on a terror suspect , europol puts together an information packet - a service that europol 's director , max-peter ratzel , is intent on putting first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol director max-peter ratzel " terrorism is , of course , very much in the foreground , because that 's where the biggest risks lie , " ratzel said .
" we have to do everything possible in order to identify and eliminate threats , so that we can offer member states the means to avoid danger .
we only need a few people to filter out the right information ; the member states are then responsible for acting on that information . " privacy advocates are critical though , about the fact that the member states can relatively freely feed data into tecs which is then consolidated into suspect profiles .
tecs saves the data for a period of at least three years . europol got its start in the mid-90s as an agency to fight drugs-related crime .
gradually , it 's grown into an institution with a staff of 500 whose main task is to organize information exchanges . other eu networks in addition to europol 's databanks , five of the largest eu states - france , britain , italy , spain and germany - share a computer network aimed at fighting terrorism .
seven states - france , spain , the netherlands , belgium , luxembourg , austria and germany - have also signed a pact to improve cross-border cooperation of their police forces when it comes to the arrest , search and trailing of suspects . but cross-border cooperation of police is by no means comprehensively regulated across the eu , and many states have misgivings .
eu commissioner for justice and security franco frattini has been pushing for stronger cooperation , and is hopeful progress will be made given the current threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following the foiled plot to blow up planes flying from britain to the us , germany is again focused on security for air and rail passengers " there is now , i think , a consensus among the member states that it 's important to really work together , " frattini said .
" we have to stay on the ball . " a directive by the eu 's interior ministry to retain internet and phone data to aid police investigations is , after the introduction of europe-wide arrest warrants , a necessary step , frattini said .
he is also working on other legislative measures to put on the table by the end of this year .
the eu would like to introduce tougher controls on the production and trade in explosives , for example .
it 's also looking into why and how muslim youths in europe are being radicalized . personal freedom still a concern frattini stresses that civil liberties should not be sacrificed in the drive for better protection from terrorists .
in this respect , he said , the united states with its far-reaching curtailments on telecommunications secrecy is no role model for the eu . " this is our political challenge , " frattini said . "
if terrorists force us to restrict our freedom , then the terrorists win .
we can never allow that to happen . " although much has been achieved when it comes to improving police cooperation at the european level , the eu 's anti-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries bemoans the fact that in some areas , progress has been too slow .
he said he is hopeful that eu interior ministers will eventually give up their opposition to majority-rules decisions at the european level . " there 's a lot of demand for the eu to help its member states more effectively , " de vries said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.08.2006 strange bedfellows : radical leftists for bush großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-germans are against what they see as a newer form of fascists than neo-nazis among the german far-left , one subgroup called the anti-germans holds some contradictory views .
most call themselves communists , yet loudly proclaim their support for israel and george w. bush . when it comes to the anti-germans , the political big tent theory appears to have become fact : groups that generally ca n't bear to be in the same room sometimes unite for a common cause . that was on show recently in western berlin , where thousands had gathered to show their support for israel during the recent conflict with hezbollah militants in lebanon .
many of the demonstrators were members of berlin 's jewish community or the conservative christian democrats . however , there were some there who belonged to the far-left and sported all the accoutrements of those who are known as autonomen in germany - black clothing , buttons or patches with political slogans or insignia , and often scarves , sunglasses or baseball caps to make them harder to identify . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators often clash with police but this time they had n't come to disrupt the demonstration , shout out anti-zionist slogans or get into tussles with police , as they often do .
the group of anti-germans had actually organized the demonstration under the slogan " unconditional solidarity with israel , " one of the core positions of their movement . such a stance puts the group firmly at odds with the majority viewpoint of germany 's far-left movement , which since the 1970s has been overwhelmingly pro-palestinian and very critical of israeli policy .
completing the philosophical break is the support of many anti-germans for us president george w. bush , who for the traditional far left is anathema . " it has to do with george w. bush 's conception for a new middle east , which is essentially supported , " said rüdiger göbel , deputy editor-in-chief of junge welt , a left-wing daily based in berlin .

kurnaz will not attend as he is with his family and needs time to adjust to his freedom , he said . " he will undergo medical treatment and will not be appearing in public , " docke said .
" mr kurnaz has been through hell . " earlier , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said an agreement on the release of kurnaz had come after the successful conclusion of long negotiations between the us and german governments . no proof of terrorist activity kurnaz , dubbed the " bremen taliban " after the northern german city where he lived , was arrested in pakistan in late 2001 , and taken to guantanamo bay in 2002 on suspicion of having fought for al qaeda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allegations of torture at guantanamo bay have prompted widespread protest from human rights organizations a us court found allegations of kurnaz 's involvement in terrorist activities to be untrue .
his release follows months of talks between the us and german governments .
chancellor angela merkel reportedly brought up the issue when she met with president george w. bush in stralsund last month . kurnaz said he suffered abuse including sexual humiliation , water torture and the desecration of islam at guantanamo . according to reports in der spiegel , berlin has refused us requests that kurnaz be put under constant surveillance and his passport confiscated .
however , he will not be free to completely return to his old life .
prosecutors in bremen intend to investigate kurnaz on suspicion of involvement in a criminal network .
experts close to the case say kurnaz 's detention at guantanamo was unlawful . us and german intelligence concluded as early as 2002 that kurnaz had no connection to al qaeda , the taliban or any terrorist threat , said baher azmy , a seton hall law school professor who has represented kurnaz since mid-2004 . " the government 's evidence against kurnaz has ranged from incredibly tangential to at times preposterous , " azmy said in a statement . " kurnaz 's case lays to shameful waste the government 's repeated assertions that guantanamo houses only hardened terrorists or persons captured on the battlefield , " azmy said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de release of german-born guantanamo prisoner expected soon top german politicians have been advocating his release for months .

kurnaz will not attend as he is with his family and needs time to adjust to his freedom , he said . " he will undergo medical treatment and will not be appearing in public , " docke said .
" mr kurnaz has been through hell . " earlier , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said an agreement on the release of kurnaz had come after the successful conclusion of long negotiations between the us and german governments . no proof of terrorist activity kurnaz , dubbed the " bremen taliban " after the northern german city where he lived , was arrested in pakistan in late 2001 , and taken to guantanamo bay in 2002 on suspicion of having fought for al qaeda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allegations of torture at guantanamo bay have prompted widespread protest from human rights organizations a us court found allegations of kurnaz 's involvement in terrorist activities to be untrue .

" " we may have a unique opportunity to transform the cessation of hostilities into a durable ceasefire , " he added in brussels . the pledges came after france , which currently commands unifil , committed itself late thursday to a total deployment of 2,000 soldiers . but french president jacques chirac , who was speaking separately friday in paris , said a level of 15,000 troops was " excessive " and it made " no sense " to have such a large contingent alongside the lebanese army in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some un peacekeepers from france are already on the ground in lebanon in brussels though , finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said the total european contribution would be " something between 5,600 and 6,900 " soldiers , as well as air and naval assets . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy put the eu deployment at " 6,500 to 7,000 soldiers on the ground , which means that the spinal column of the reinforced unifil will be european . " the force is crucial to shoring up un resolution 1701 , which on august 14 brought an end to the 34-day conflict in lebanon between israel and hezbollah militants . annan said bangladesh , malaysia and indonesia had offered to participate in unifil - though israel has opposed contributions from those muslim countries because of an absence of diplomatic relations . the un chief also proposed that france see out its current term as commander of the force , which expires at the end of january , after which italy would take over .
italy is expected to supply up to 3,000 soldiers , which would make it the biggest contributor to the force . french role and reversal france , though , played a key role diplomatically in revamping the force , having co-authored the un resolution with the united states .
it also enjoys close relations with lebanon , a former protectorate .
douste-blazy said france had " absolutely " no problem with the change of command . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac , right , and angela merkel during a press conference in paris on friday chirac 's announcement that he was sending 1,600 more troops to lebanon came after international criticism over his initial , emergency deployment of just 200 soldiers to join the 200 already in unifil . a vanguard of 170 french reinforcements arrived in lebanon on friday , making france the only country so far to have actually sent troops .
chirac said he agreed to send the extra two battalions after winning a robust mandate for unifil and guarantees the force would be able to cope if hostilities flare up again . " i wonder how it would have been judged if i had raced off like a mad dog without thinking or securing minimum guarantees , " he said in paris . he also questioned the goal of boosting the force to 15,000 soldiers , calling that " a totally excessive figure " given lebanon 's relatively small size . other eu contributors the announcement of the french reinforcements spurred some of the other eu countries into firming up previously vague promises to contribute . spain was said to be ready to send 1,000 to 1,200 soldiers , substantially more than the 800 initially cited in media reports . poland 's private television station tvn24 reported foreign minister anna fotyga as saying warsaw 's total contribution would be around 500 troops which includes 214 already serving with unifil . belgian foreign minister guy verhofstadt said his country would provide 300 soldiers by late september or early october , with the possibility of adding nearly 100 more later .

kurnaz will not attend as he is with his family and needs time to adjust to his freedom , he said . " he will undergo medical treatment and will not be appearing in public , " docke said .
" mr kurnaz has been through hell . " earlier , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said an agreement on the release of kurnaz had come after the successful conclusion of long negotiations between the us and german governments . no proof of terrorist activity kurnaz , dubbed the " bremen taliban " after the northern german city where he lived , was arrested in pakistan in late 2001 , and taken to guantanamo bay in 2002 on suspicion of having fought for al qaeda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allegations of torture at guantanamo bay have prompted widespread protest from human rights organizations a us court found allegations of kurnaz 's involvement in terrorist activities to be untrue .
his release follows months of talks between the us and german governments .
chancellor angela merkel reportedly brought up the issue when she met with president george w. bush in stralsund last month . kurnaz said he suffered abuse including sexual humiliation , water torture and the desecration of islam at guantanamo . according to reports in der spiegel , berlin has refused us requests that kurnaz be put under constant surveillance and his passport confiscated .
however , he will not be free to completely return to his old life .
prosecutors in bremen intend to investigate kurnaz on suspicion of involvement in a criminal network .
experts close to the case say kurnaz 's detention at guantanamo was unlawful . us and german intelligence concluded as early as 2002 that kurnaz had no connection to al qaeda , the taliban or any terrorist threat , said baher azmy , a seton hall law school professor who has represented kurnaz since mid-2004 . " the government 's evidence against kurnaz has ranged from incredibly tangential to at times preposterous , " azmy said in a statement . " kurnaz 's case lays to shameful waste the government 's repeated assertions that guantanamo houses only hardened terrorists or persons captured on the battlefield , " azmy said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de release of german-born guantanamo prisoner expected soon top german politicians have been advocating his release for months .
now it looks like murat kurnaz from bremen will return home by the end of the month , after more than four years at guantanamo .

21 , 2006 -rrb- " bremen taliban " release anticipated a turkish man living in bremen is expected to be allowed to return to germany from the us military base in guantanamo bay .
german authorities may have delayed his release by years , according to media reports .

most call themselves communists , yet loudly proclaim their support for israel and george w. bush . when it comes to the anti-germans , the political big tent theory appears to have become fact : groups that generally ca n't bear to be in the same room sometimes unite for a common cause . that was on show recently in western berlin , where thousands had gathered to show their support for israel during the recent conflict with hezbollah militants in lebanon .
many of the demonstrators were members of berlin 's jewish community or the conservative christian democrats . however , there were some there who belonged to the far-left and sported all the accoutrements of those who are known as autonomen in germany - black clothing , buttons or patches with political slogans or insignia , and often scarves , sunglasses or baseball caps to make them harder to identify . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators often clash with police but this time they had n't come to disrupt the demonstration , shout out anti-zionist slogans or get into tussles with police , as they often do .
the group of anti-germans had actually organized the demonstration under the slogan " unconditional solidarity with israel , " one of the core positions of their movement . such a stance puts the group firmly at odds with the majority viewpoint of germany 's far-left movement , which since the 1970s has been overwhelmingly pro-palestinian and very critical of israeli policy .
completing the philosophical break is the support of many anti-germans for us president george w. bush , who for the traditional far left is anathema . " it has to do with george w. bush 's conception for a new middle east , which is essentially supported , " said rüdiger göbel , deputy editor-in-chief of junge welt , a left-wing daily based in berlin .
" the anti-germans are actually closer to the neo-conservatives in the united states . " fighting a " new fascism " to many observers , the anti-germans are a conundrum .
most consider themselves communists , but according to a study carried out by patrick hagen at the university of cologne , they " have abandoned almost all of the essentials of the communist movement and the left , such as the positive relations to the working class , anti-imperialism and anti-racism which has led to a deep split within the extra-parliamentary left . " the anti-german movement can be traced back to the fall of the berlin wall , where some on the far left demonstrated against reunification , warning that a stronger germany could result in a new militarism and even a " fourth reich . "
they based their slogan on the phrase often used in holocaust remembrance ceremonies : " never again . "
the anti-germans went further , rallying around " germany , never again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators at a anti-nazi rally as time went on , the group began to show more support for the united states .
in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of the destruction of dresden by the allies , the anti-germans praised the bombing of the civil population , since in their view , so many of them had supported the nazi regime . but the movement really got behind the stars and stripes after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , which they saw as anti-semitic and targeted at israel .
to them , it marked the rise of a new type of fascism .
this time is was n't from the far right , but from radical islam and it had to be fought .
the us , in their eyes , was the only one willing to fight it . " islamic terrorists and states such as syria and iran want to liquidate israel , " said hermann gremliza , publisher of the leftist magazine konkret and one of the leading figures in the anti-german movement , in an e-mail response .
" so -lrb- anti-germans -rrb- act according to the motto : the enemy of my enemy is my friend . " just after the war in iraq broke out in 2003 , the anti-german magazine bahamas wrote an editorial entitled " bush - the man of peace ! " whose side are they on ? these kinds of positions have put the group in sometimes violent opposition to the traditional far left .
when anti-germans show up at left-wing demonstrations with signs supporting american policy or israel , they are generally not welcomed warmly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would che have supported george w. bush ?
" whoever carries an israeli flag is insulted and spit upon , " gremliza said .
" but what do you expect , we 're in germany . " the traditional far left accuses the anti-germans of getting in bed with the bourgeoisie .
some writers in the anti-german camp even write occasionally for the online site of the newsmagazine der spiegel or even such bastions of conservatism as the daily die welt . observers say that means they have an influence beyond their actual numbers , which are estimated between 500 and 3,000 .
gremliza , however , said around 50,000 people read his magazine konkret . anti-german goals , he says , are to uncover what group members see as the hypocrisy of a german foreign policy that has been harmful to israel and helped the rise of a new " islamic " fascism , which they see as a direct descendent of the form practiced by the nazis . " germany wants an alliance with the islamic world - against the us , " he said , despite angela merkel 's close ties to her american counterpart .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.08.2006 opinion : deficit-sinner germany mending its ways großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany may manage this year to keep its deficit down to the level required by the eu stability pact , which underpins the euro .
instead of raising taxes , however , it should reduce spending , says dw 's karl zawadzky . first the good news : germany managed to reduce its national deficit to 2.5 percent in the first half of this year .
the positive trend can be traced back to a broader economic upswing , which brought in increased tax revenues . the public deficit is n't likely to increase in the second half of 2006 , and germany may even finally be able to shed its stigma in the european union as the " stability pact rogue " - an image it had earned through several years of higher-than-permitted debt statistics .
the national deficit in the first half of 2005 was , for example , as high as 3.7 percent . according to figures released thursday by the federal statistical office , the national deficit in the first half of this year amounted to 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 35.8 billion -rrb- in real numbers , which is a good 12 billion euros less than during the same time frame last year . social security contributions , on the other hand , have remained stagnant due to only minimal changes in wages .
however , expenditures made by the government unemployment agencies this year dropped dramatically as a result of cutbacks . finance minister peer steinbrück , who bore the consequences of the political demise of his predecessor hans eichel , is reluctant to be too hasty in celebrating the success reports , lest he eat his words in just a few months ' time . tax hikes to maintain low deficit ? the government has emphasized that it will stick to its promise that , starting next year , germany 's national deficit will not exceed the maximum deficit agreed upon in the eu 's stability pact .
this contractual agreement stipulates that the deficit of all public budgets , including social security , may not exceed 3 percent of the country 's gross domestic product . thanks to positive market conditions in recent months and the higher tax revenues that resulted , germany wo n't violate the pact this year .

instead of raising taxes , however , it should reduce spending , says dw 's karl zawadzky . first the good news : germany managed to reduce its national deficit to 2.5 percent in the first half of this year .
the positive trend can be traced back to a broader economic upswing , which brought in increased tax revenues . the public deficit is n't likely to increase in the second half of 2006 , and germany may even finally be able to shed its stigma in the european union as the " stability pact rogue " - an image it had earned through several years of higher-than-permitted debt statistics .
the national deficit in the first half of 2005 was , for example , as high as 3.7 percent . according to figures released thursday by the federal statistical office , the national deficit in the first half of this year amounted to 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 35.8 billion -rrb- in real numbers , which is a good 12 billion euros less than during the same time frame last year . social security contributions , on the other hand , have remained stagnant due to only minimal changes in wages .
however , expenditures made by the government unemployment agencies this year dropped dramatically as a result of cutbacks . finance minister peer steinbrück , who bore the consequences of the political demise of his predecessor hans eichel , is reluctant to be too hasty in celebrating the success reports , lest he eat his words in just a few months ' time . tax hikes to maintain low deficit ? the government has emphasized that it will stick to its promise that , starting next year , germany 's national deficit will not exceed the maximum deficit agreed upon in the eu 's stability pact .
this contractual agreement stipulates that the deficit of all public budgets , including social security , may not exceed 3 percent of the country 's gross domestic product . thanks to positive market conditions in recent months and the higher tax revenues that resulted , germany wo n't violate the pact this year .
even a slight economic downturn will not prevent germany from meeting the deficit standard in the future . now for the not-so-good news : in order to keep the deficit within the limitations set by the stability pact , hefty tax hikes are necessary . at the beginning of 2007 , sales tax will be raised from 16 to 19 percent .

why does n't she like me ?
what is a condom ?
generations of confused german teenagers have turned to dr. sommer for honesty - and explicit photos . sandra , 16 , looks up coyly from the pages of bravo , wearing a black choker and nothing else .
boyfriend elias , 18 , grins from the opposite page , also in his natural state . " tell me , why do you love each other ? " reads the headline .
and the young couple tells why - and exactly how . sell this in america , and risk prison time for child pornography . but in germany , this is nothing tawdry . it 's the country 's most popular teenage magazine , and it turns 50 on saturday . sandra and elias ' graphic spread is in the same issue as a free sheet of fake tattoos , a feature about harry potter , and an exclusive report on tokio hotel , the german boy band currently making girls swoon . a german institution since 1969 , dr. sommer combines no-holds-barred sex advice with full-frontal photos . it highlights a basic cultural divide between germany and many other countries - of how openly sex is discussed , especially among youth . " it is not pornography , " says bravo 's deputy editor , alex gernandt .
" it deals with naked people , but in a very sensitive way .
we try to portray young people to tell readers , ' you are not too fat , not too thin .
you are ok the way you are . ' " there are a lot less teenage pregnancies in germany in comparison to the united kingdom or the us , and i think bravo has its share in that success , " gernandt said . breaking taboos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was seduced at 14 , " kristijan says the current dr. sommer , eveline von arx , credits the column with germany 's free sexual attitudes . when it began in 1969 , " dr. sommer really broke taboos , and it was really spectacular to do something like that , " said von arx , who has been writing the column for three years .
" it 's not that spectacular anymore .
people are used to it .
everybody knows it . " each weekly issue of bravo now features photos of two teenagers , generally between 16 and 20 , in the nude , with interviews about their bodies and experiences . anyone under 18 , like sandra , must have his or her parents ' permission to appear . they are paid 400 euros -lrb- a little more than $ 500 -rrb- to pose , and many report the experience is a self-esteem boost , von arx said . weekly letters range from " my boyfriend is once again interested in his former girlfriend " to " everybody 's had sex , only i have n't . "
sample answer : " nowhere does it say that youth have to have sex by a certain time … talk to your boyfriend about it .
tell him how you feel . " " you can be sexy here " bravo 's web site even features explicit petting and positions photo galleries that would n't last a day in other countries . the magazine publishes its eastern european editions with little to no nudity .
but in germany , even teachers and religious leaders seem to welcome the column .
von arx has spoken in schools and was even invited as a youth expert to a big evangelical christian conference last year . gisela gille , chairman of germany 's society for the health of women , said bravo plays an important role in the sexual education of germany 's 12- to 15-year-olds , particularly the lesser educated .
gille said the advice satisfies basic curiosities , but that many teenagers read bravo only for a short time and stop when they become more experienced . tanja reddig , a 17-year-old berlin student , said that she read dr. sommer when she was 12 and 13 and did n't see what the fuss was over the nudity . " you can be sexy here and you do n't get any problems , " she said .
" in america , they ca n't show bodies .
they must hide something .
some teenagers do n't want to ask their parents things , so they could write a letter to dr. sommer . " started by popular demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's youth seem concerned with balancing love and work dr. sommer began during the sexual revolution of 1969 .
bravo was then a strictly entertainment magazine , but its young readers nonetheless kept writing letters about love and sex . so editors figured such a column would increase their readership , according to antje pfeffer of the berlin-based archive of youth culture -lrb- archiv der jugendkulturen -rrb- , which has published a book about bravo 's 50 year history . " dr. sommer immediately was greeted as too open , " pfeffer said . some parents glued the dr. sommer pages together so their teenagers could n't read the column , others banned it from the house .
some schools confiscated it , and in communist east germany , many clamored for smuggled copies . but from the start , the column took its mission quite seriously .
the first dr. sommer , martin goldstein , recalled in the berlin archive 's book that he and his team of social workers , psychologists , sociologists , political scientists , family counselors and parents would spend hours going through letters : i have fallen in love with a sweet young boy .
if he would kiss me , i would be happy for my entire life .
how can i get him to do it ?
i see him almost every day and i already know his name .
but do n't tell me that i should talk to him .
janne , 14 the boys in our village seem to have no interest in us , no matter what we do . we do not know how we can get their attention .
ina , renate , anne and beate , 15 and 16 the team tried to respond in an encouraging , non-judgemental way .
but often , they wondered whether the teenagers had anyone else they could confide in .
they were shocked at how many letters were sent in - sometimes 3,000 to 5,000 a month . " we believed it was because young people wanted to be listened to , " goldstein recalled . evolving topics soon , they were dealing with much thornier issues , such as a 1988 letter titled " my mum 's boyfriend sexually abused me . " by the end of the 1980s , dr. sommer had become more mainstream , and answers seemed freer .
for instance , nicola , 15 , wrote in with the basic question , " how do i show him that i want more ? " the answer : tell him what you want .
or , just push his hand higher . von arx says many of the letters have not changed much over the years .
but recently she has seen more teenagers concerned that they wo n't get ahead in school because they are so distracted by lovesickness . she is often asked if the column is even necessary anymore . " people think our society is very sexualized , and naked bodies and sex are everywhere , and young people should know everything , " she said .

people are used to it .
everybody knows it . " each weekly issue of bravo now features photos of two teenagers , generally between 16 and 20 , in the nude , with interviews about their bodies and experiences . anyone under 18 , like sandra , must have his or her parents ' permission to appear . they are paid 400 euros -lrb- a little more than $ 500 -rrb- to pose , and many report the experience is a self-esteem boost , von arx said . weekly letters range from " my boyfriend is once again interested in his former girlfriend " to " everybody 's had sex , only i have n't . "
sample answer : " nowhere does it say that youth have to have sex by a certain time … talk to your boyfriend about it .
tell him how you feel . " " you can be sexy here " bravo 's web site even features explicit petting and positions photo galleries that would n't last a day in other countries . the magazine publishes its eastern european editions with little to no nudity .
but in germany , even teachers and religious leaders seem to welcome the column .
von arx has spoken in schools and was even invited as a youth expert to a big evangelical christian conference last year . gisela gille , chairman of germany 's society for the health of women , said bravo plays an important role in the sexual education of germany 's 12- to 15-year-olds , particularly the lesser educated .
gille said the advice satisfies basic curiosities , but that many teenagers read bravo only for a short time and stop when they become more experienced . tanja reddig , a 17-year-old berlin student , said that she read dr. sommer when she was 12 and 13 and did n't see what the fuss was over the nudity . " you can be sexy here and you do n't get any problems , " she said .
" in america , they ca n't show bodies .
they must hide something .
some teenagers do n't want to ask their parents things , so they could write a letter to dr. sommer . " started by popular demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's youth seem concerned with balancing love and work dr. sommer began during the sexual revolution of 1969 .
bravo was then a strictly entertainment magazine , but its young readers nonetheless kept writing letters about love and sex . so editors figured such a column would increase their readership , according to antje pfeffer of the berlin-based archive of youth culture -lrb- archiv der jugendkulturen -rrb- , which has published a book about bravo 's 50 year history . " dr. sommer immediately was greeted as too open , " pfeffer said . some parents glued the dr. sommer pages together so their teenagers could n't read the column , others banned it from the house .
some schools confiscated it , and in communist east germany , many clamored for smuggled copies . but from the start , the column took its mission quite seriously .
the first dr. sommer , martin goldstein , recalled in the berlin archive 's book that he and his team of social workers , psychologists , sociologists , political scientists , family counselors and parents would spend hours going through letters : i have fallen in love with a sweet young boy .
if he would kiss me , i would be happy for my entire life .
how can i get him to do it ?
i see him almost every day and i already know his name .
but do n't tell me that i should talk to him .
janne , 14 the boys in our village seem to have no interest in us , no matter what we do . we do not know how we can get their attention .
ina , renate , anne and beate , 15 and 16 the team tried to respond in an encouraging , non-judgemental way .
but often , they wondered whether the teenagers had anyone else they could confide in .
they were shocked at how many letters were sent in - sometimes 3,000 to 5,000 a month . " we believed it was because young people wanted to be listened to , " goldstein recalled . evolving topics soon , they were dealing with much thornier issues , such as a 1988 letter titled " my mum 's boyfriend sexually abused me . " by the end of the 1980s , dr. sommer had become more mainstream , and answers seemed freer .
for instance , nicola , 15 , wrote in with the basic question , " how do i show him that i want more ? " the answer : tell him what you want .
or , just push his hand higher . von arx says many of the letters have not changed much over the years .
but recently she has seen more teenagers concerned that they wo n't get ahead in school because they are so distracted by lovesickness . she is often asked if the column is even necessary anymore . " people think our society is very sexualized , and naked bodies and sex are everywhere , and young people should know everything , " she said .
" but they do n't know anything sometimes .

the bavarian giants last won the trophy in 2001 and have failed to get any further than the quarter-finals in the last six years .
group b looks to be a tricky but far from impossible proposition in terms of bayern qualifying , with the german champions and inter favorites to progress . bremen face barca and ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barcelona begin their defense against levski sofia werder bremen find themselves in a tough group a with current titleholders barcelona , english champions chelsea and bulgaria 's debutants levski sofia .
bremen will want to exorcise the ghosts of last season , during which they came so close to beating juventus in the first knock-out round , drawing 4-4 on aggregate but losing out to the italian champions on away goals . bremen will need to beat either or both barca or chelsea to progress and will be hoping that the two great rivals will be more concerned with each other to worry about any potential german party-crashers . it will be the third time in three years that barcelona , who beat chelsea in the second round of last season 's competition , have been paired with the london club .

why does n't she like me ?
what is a condom ?
generations of confused german teenagers have turned to dr. sommer for honesty - and explicit photos . sandra , 16 , looks up coyly from the pages of bravo , wearing a black choker and nothing else .
boyfriend elias , 18 , grins from the opposite page , also in his natural state . " tell me , why do you love each other ? " reads the headline .
and the young couple tells why - and exactly how . sell this in america , and risk prison time for child pornography . but in germany , this is nothing tawdry . it 's the country 's most popular teenage magazine , and it turns 50 on saturday . sandra and elias ' graphic spread is in the same issue as a free sheet of fake tattoos , a feature about harry potter , and an exclusive report on tokio hotel , the german boy band currently making girls swoon . a german institution since 1969 , dr. sommer combines no-holds-barred sex advice with full-frontal photos . it highlights a basic cultural divide between germany and many other countries - of how openly sex is discussed , especially among youth . " it is not pornography , " says bravo 's deputy editor , alex gernandt .
" it deals with naked people , but in a very sensitive way .
we try to portray young people to tell readers , ' you are not too fat , not too thin .
you are ok the way you are . ' " there are a lot less teenage pregnancies in germany in comparison to the united kingdom or the us , and i think bravo has its share in that success , " gernandt said . breaking taboos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was seduced at 14 , " kristijan says the current dr. sommer , eveline von arx , credits the column with germany 's free sexual attitudes . when it began in 1969 , " dr. sommer really broke taboos , and it was really spectacular to do something like that , " said von arx , who has been writing the column for three years .
" it 's not that spectacular anymore .
people are used to it .
everybody knows it . " each weekly issue of bravo now features photos of two teenagers , generally between 16 and 20 , in the nude , with interviews about their bodies and experiences . anyone under 18 , like sandra , must have his or her parents ' permission to appear . they are paid 400 euros -lrb- a little more than $ 500 -rrb- to pose , and many report the experience is a self-esteem boost , von arx said . weekly letters range from " my boyfriend is once again interested in his former girlfriend " to " everybody 's had sex , only i have n't . "
sample answer : " nowhere does it say that youth have to have sex by a certain time … talk to your boyfriend about it .
tell him how you feel . " " you can be sexy here " bravo 's web site even features explicit petting and positions photo galleries that would n't last a day in other countries . the magazine publishes its eastern european editions with little to no nudity .
but in germany , even teachers and religious leaders seem to welcome the column .
von arx has spoken in schools and was even invited as a youth expert to a big evangelical christian conference last year . gisela gille , chairman of germany 's society for the health of women , said bravo plays an important role in the sexual education of germany 's 12- to 15-year-olds , particularly the lesser educated .
gille said the advice satisfies basic curiosities , but that many teenagers read bravo only for a short time and stop when they become more experienced . tanja reddig , a 17-year-old berlin student , said that she read dr. sommer when she was 12 and 13 and did n't see what the fuss was over the nudity . " you can be sexy here and you do n't get any problems , " she said .
" in america , they ca n't show bodies .
they must hide something .
some teenagers do n't want to ask their parents things , so they could write a letter to dr. sommer . " started by popular demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's youth seem concerned with balancing love and work dr. sommer began during the sexual revolution of 1969 .
bravo was then a strictly entertainment magazine , but its young readers nonetheless kept writing letters about love and sex . so editors figured such a column would increase their readership , according to antje pfeffer of the berlin-based archive of youth culture -lrb- archiv der jugendkulturen -rrb- , which has published a book about bravo 's 50 year history . " dr. sommer immediately was greeted as too open , " pfeffer said . some parents glued the dr. sommer pages together so their teenagers could n't read the column , others banned it from the house .
some schools confiscated it , and in communist east germany , many clamored for smuggled copies . but from the start , the column took its mission quite seriously .
the first dr. sommer , martin goldstein , recalled in the berlin archive 's book that he and his team of social workers , psychologists , sociologists , political scientists , family counselors and parents would spend hours going through letters : i have fallen in love with a sweet young boy .
if he would kiss me , i would be happy for my entire life .
how can i get him to do it ?
i see him almost every day and i already know his name .
but do n't tell me that i should talk to him .
janne , 14 the boys in our village seem to have no interest in us , no matter what we do . we do not know how we can get their attention .
ina , renate , anne and beate , 15 and 16 the team tried to respond in an encouraging , non-judgemental way .
but often , they wondered whether the teenagers had anyone else they could confide in .
they were shocked at how many letters were sent in - sometimes 3,000 to 5,000 a month . " we believed it was because young people wanted to be listened to , " goldstein recalled . evolving topics soon , they were dealing with much thornier issues , such as a 1988 letter titled " my mum 's boyfriend sexually abused me . " by the end of the 1980s , dr. sommer had become more mainstream , and answers seemed freer .
for instance , nicola , 15 , wrote in with the basic question , " how do i show him that i want more ? " the answer : tell him what you want .
or , just push his hand higher . von arx says many of the letters have not changed much over the years .
but recently she has seen more teenagers concerned that they wo n't get ahead in school because they are so distracted by lovesickness . she is often asked if the column is even necessary anymore . " people think our society is very sexualized , and naked bodies and sex are everywhere , and young people should know everything , " she said .

most call themselves communists , yet loudly proclaim their support for israel and george w. bush . when it comes to the anti-germans , the political big tent theory appears to have become fact : groups that generally ca n't bear to be in the same room sometimes unite for a common cause . that was on show recently in western berlin , where thousands had gathered to show their support for israel during the recent conflict with hezbollah militants in lebanon .
many of the demonstrators were members of berlin 's jewish community or the conservative christian democrats . however , there were some there who belonged to the far-left and sported all the accoutrements of those who are known as autonomen in germany - black clothing , buttons or patches with political slogans or insignia , and often scarves , sunglasses or baseball caps to make them harder to identify . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators often clash with police but this time they had n't come to disrupt the demonstration , shout out anti-zionist slogans or get into tussles with police , as they often do .
the group of anti-germans had actually organized the demonstration under the slogan " unconditional solidarity with israel , " one of the core positions of their movement . such a stance puts the group firmly at odds with the majority viewpoint of germany 's far-left movement , which since the 1970s has been overwhelmingly pro-palestinian and very critical of israeli policy .
completing the philosophical break is the support of many anti-germans for us president george w. bush , who for the traditional far left is anathema . " it has to do with george w. bush 's conception for a new middle east , which is essentially supported , " said rüdiger göbel , deputy editor-in-chief of junge welt , a left-wing daily based in berlin .
" the anti-germans are actually closer to the neo-conservatives in the united states . " fighting a " new fascism " to many observers , the anti-germans are a conundrum .
most consider themselves communists , but according to a study carried out by patrick hagen at the university of cologne , they " have abandoned almost all of the essentials of the communist movement and the left , such as the positive relations to the working class , anti-imperialism and anti-racism which has led to a deep split within the extra-parliamentary left . " the anti-german movement can be traced back to the fall of the berlin wall , where some on the far left demonstrated against reunification , warning that a stronger germany could result in a new militarism and even a " fourth reich . "
they based their slogan on the phrase often used in holocaust remembrance ceremonies : " never again . "
the anti-germans went further , rallying around " germany , never again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators at a anti-nazi rally as time went on , the group began to show more support for the united states .
in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of the destruction of dresden by the allies , the anti-germans praised the bombing of the civil population , since in their view , so many of them had supported the nazi regime . but the movement really got behind the stars and stripes after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , which they saw as anti-semitic and targeted at israel .
to them , it marked the rise of a new type of fascism .
this time is was n't from the far right , but from radical islam and it had to be fought .
the us , in their eyes , was the only one willing to fight it . " islamic terrorists and states such as syria and iran want to liquidate israel , " said hermann gremliza , publisher of the leftist magazine konkret and one of the leading figures in the anti-german movement , in an e-mail response .
" so -lrb- anti-germans -rrb- act according to the motto : the enemy of my enemy is my friend . " just after the war in iraq broke out in 2003 , the anti-german magazine bahamas wrote an editorial entitled " bush - the man of peace ! " whose side are they on ? these kinds of positions have put the group in sometimes violent opposition to the traditional far left .
when anti-germans show up at left-wing demonstrations with signs supporting american policy or israel , they are generally not welcomed warmly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would che have supported george w. bush ?
" whoever carries an israeli flag is insulted and spit upon , " gremliza said .
" but what do you expect , we 're in germany . " the traditional far left accuses the anti-germans of getting in bed with the bourgeoisie .
some writers in the anti-german camp even write occasionally for the online site of the newsmagazine der spiegel or even such bastions of conservatism as the daily die welt . observers say that means they have an influence beyond their actual numbers , which are estimated between 500 and 3,000 .
gremliza , however , said around 50,000 people read his magazine konkret . anti-german goals , he says , are to uncover what group members see as the hypocrisy of a german foreign policy that has been harmful to israel and helped the rise of a new " islamic " fascism , which they see as a direct descendent of the form practiced by the nazis . " germany wants an alliance with the islamic world - against the us , " he said , despite angela merkel 's close ties to her american counterpart .

kurnaz will not attend as he is with his family and needs time to adjust to his freedom , he said . " he will undergo medical treatment and will not be appearing in public , " docke said .
" mr kurnaz has been through hell . " earlier , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said an agreement on the release of kurnaz had come after the successful conclusion of long negotiations between the us and german governments . no proof of terrorist activity kurnaz , dubbed the " bremen taliban " after the northern german city where he lived , was arrested in pakistan in late 2001 , and taken to guantanamo bay in 2002 on suspicion of having fought for al qaeda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allegations of torture at guantanamo bay have prompted widespread protest from human rights organizations a us court found allegations of kurnaz 's involvement in terrorist activities to be untrue .
his release follows months of talks between the us and german governments .
chancellor angela merkel reportedly brought up the issue when she met with president george w. bush in stralsund last month . kurnaz said he suffered abuse including sexual humiliation , water torture and the desecration of islam at guantanamo . according to reports in der spiegel , berlin has refused us requests that kurnaz be put under constant surveillance and his passport confiscated .
however , he will not be free to completely return to his old life .
prosecutors in bremen intend to investigate kurnaz on suspicion of involvement in a criminal network .
experts close to the case say kurnaz 's detention at guantanamo was unlawful . us and german intelligence concluded as early as 2002 that kurnaz had no connection to al qaeda , the taliban or any terrorist threat , said baher azmy , a seton hall law school professor who has represented kurnaz since mid-2004 . " the government 's evidence against kurnaz has ranged from incredibly tangential to at times preposterous , " azmy said in a statement . " kurnaz 's case lays to shameful waste the government 's repeated assertions that guantanamo houses only hardened terrorists or persons captured on the battlefield , " azmy said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de release of german-born guantanamo prisoner expected soon top german politicians have been advocating his release for months .
now it looks like murat kurnaz from bremen will return home by the end of the month , after more than four years at guantanamo .

21 , 2006 -rrb- " bremen taliban " release anticipated a turkish man living in bremen is expected to be allowed to return to germany from the us military base in guantanamo bay .
german authorities may have delayed his release by years , according to media reports .
-lrb- march 29 , 2006 -rrb- ' bremen taliban ' or victim of circumstance ?
a year ago , murat kurnaz left bremen to " see and experience the koran " in pakistan .
since then , he 's been locked up at guantanamo bay , suspected of fighting for the taliban .
but german investigators say there 's no proof .

a first french contingent of 49 engineers arrived on saturday . " i have decided to send two extra battalions into the field to expand our unifil contingent .
two thousand french soldiers will thus be placed under the un flag in lebanon , " french president chirac said in a televised address on thursday evening . each french battalion counts 800 soldiers .
four hundred french soldiers are already serving in the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- . us , israel and lebanon welcome deployment the french decision was hailed by israel and us president george w. bush " i applaud the decision of france , as well as the significant pledges from italy and our other important allies .
i encourage other nations to make contributions as well , " bush said in a statement released by the white house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac answered the call " the fact that the french have decided to send troops will bring in additional nations , " miri eisen , a senior policy advisory to israeli prime minister ehud olmert , told the bbc . lebanon 's prime minister also praised france saying that its decision to contribute 2,000 soldiers to un troops in lebanon will bolster european participation and help consolidate stability in the country . " undoubtedly , the french decision will help boost european participation , " fuad siniora said in a statement .
" in turn , this will help speed up the formation of the international force , which along with the lebanese army , will protect civilians and achieve security and stability , " he said . the deployment of the french troops " helps strengthen stability in lebanon and allows the country to regain its territories through an israeli withdrawal and the extension of state authority over all territories , " he said . french general to retain command - for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french troops arrived in lebanon on friday the united nations announced thursday that french general alain pellegrini would keep command over the operation to monitor the tenuous ceasefire between israel and the lebanese shiite militia hezbollah . pellegrini , currently in command of the united nations interim force in lebanon , will retain his post after the force undergoes a robust expansion under a un resolution , a un spokesman said friday . " general alain pellegrini leads unifil and he will continue to do so " with the " very strong support " of secretary general kofi annan , un spokesman stephane dujarric told reporters . both france and italy have offered to command unifil , which faces the daunting task of policing the ceasefire between israel and the lebanese shiite militia hezbollah . the appointment of a commander of a un peacekeeping force is the responsibility of the secretary general .
kofi annan , speaking from brussels friday where eu ministers are meeting to thrash out details of the bloc 's deployment strategy , said that he expected to be able to announce the force 's " leadership this afternoon . " unifil to enforce ceasefire alongside lebanese terms of the august 14 truce between israel and hezbollah fighters were laid out in un security council resolution 1701 , under which lebanon was " to secure its borders and other entry points to prevent the entry in lebanon without its consent of arms . " lebanese troops have since deployed along the syrian border in the north and east of the country , military sources said . a reinforced unifil could help intercept arms shipments to hezbollah , the militant shiite group that captured two israeli soldiers on july 12 , sparking a massive riposte and 34 days of heavy fighting . france and italy leading eu efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unifil will be boosted but will not make its target , it seems france was criticized last week after it said that just 200 extra soldiers would join unifil , which was set up 28 years ago as a toothless observer force but which the un resolution aims to revamp into a more robust presence of 15,000 soldiers . at the request of britain , israel , lebanon and the united states , italy stepped forward and offered to lead the force , pledging a reported 3,000 soldiers . spain was prepared to commit a battalion of between 700 and 800 troops to the un force , military sources were quoted as saying by a news report late thursday . greece , finland , latvia , sweden and poland have also indicated they could send soldiers , prompting european commission chief jose manuel barroso to say thursday he was " confident that europe will provide the necessary support to expand the unifil . " eu will fail to meet 15,000-troop target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nations already have un troops in lebanon eu leaders have spoken about contributing 4,000 troops to unifil .
however , even if eu leaders on friday pledge several thousand soldiers , unifil will still be far short of the 15,000 target . deployment plans were complicated however , with threats by syria to close its border in the event of such a move by the un . following talks in helsinki with syrian counterpart walid muallem , finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja said : " they will close the frontier to all traffic " if un troops were posted on the lebanese side . syrian president bashar al-assad had already warned that such a deployment would represent a " hostile " position with regard to his country . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy sending signal to eu , us with lebanon offer as the eu struggles to gather military contributions for lebanon , italy has said it would lead the peacekeeping mission .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.08.2006 fighting terrorism at the eu level großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol began focusing on anti-terror measures after the 9/11 attacks observers of the debate in germany on the pros and cons of a nation-wide anti-terror register say the question is when , not if , such a database will be created .
it 's expected to aid anti-terror measures at the eu-level . when germany 's anti-terror register finally comes into being , it wo n't just make things easier for german officials - it will also improve cooperation with the european police force , europol , which is already working on an eu-wide counter-terrorism database . at its headquarters in the hague , europol has computers where eu member states can save names and relevant details about terrorist suspects or witnesses .
additionally , the databanks contain information on organized crime , drug smuggling and human trafficking .
the computer system , tecs , can compare and analyze as many as a million data sets . the data is entered into the system directly by the 25 eu member states .
each country is represented by its own liaison officer , or elos , in the hague .
as a rule , only these liaison officers have access to the national databanks . if a member state wants to find out whether there is information in tecs on a terror suspect , europol puts together an information packet - a service that europol 's director , max-peter ratzel , is intent on putting first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol director max-peter ratzel " terrorism is , of course , very much in the foreground , because that 's where the biggest risks lie , " ratzel said .
" we have to do everything possible in order to identify and eliminate threats , so that we can offer member states the means to avoid danger .
we only need a few people to filter out the right information ; the member states are then responsible for acting on that information . " privacy advocates are critical though , about the fact that the member states can relatively freely feed data into tecs which is then consolidated into suspect profiles .
tecs saves the data for a period of at least three years . europol got its start in the mid-90s as an agency to fight drugs-related crime .
gradually , it 's grown into an institution with a staff of 500 whose main task is to organize information exchanges . other eu networks in addition to europol 's databanks , five of the largest eu states - france , britain , italy , spain and germany - share a computer network aimed at fighting terrorism .
seven states - france , spain , the netherlands , belgium , luxembourg , austria and germany - have also signed a pact to improve cross-border cooperation of their police forces when it comes to the arrest , search and trailing of suspects . but cross-border cooperation of police is by no means comprehensively regulated across the eu , and many states have misgivings .
eu commissioner for justice and security franco frattini has been pushing for stronger cooperation , and is hopeful progress will be made given the current threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following the foiled plot to blow up planes flying from britain to the us , germany is again focused on security for air and rail passengers " there is now , i think , a consensus among the member states that it 's important to really work together , " frattini said .
" we have to stay on the ball . " a directive by the eu 's interior ministry to retain internet and phone data to aid police investigations is , after the introduction of europe-wide arrest warrants , a necessary step , frattini said .
he is also working on other legislative measures to put on the table by the end of this year .
the eu would like to introduce tougher controls on the production and trade in explosives , for example .
it 's also looking into why and how muslim youths in europe are being radicalized . personal freedom still a concern frattini stresses that civil liberties should not be sacrificed in the drive for better protection from terrorists .
in this respect , he said , the united states with its far-reaching curtailments on telecommunications secrecy is no role model for the eu . " this is our political challenge , " frattini said . "
if terrorists force us to restrict our freedom , then the terrorists win .
we can never allow that to happen . " although much has been achieved when it comes to improving police cooperation at the european level , the eu 's anti-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries bemoans the fact that in some areas , progress has been too slow .

it 's expected to aid anti-terror measures at the eu-level . when germany 's anti-terror register finally comes into being , it wo n't just make things easier for german officials - it will also improve cooperation with the european police force , europol , which is already working on an eu-wide counter-terrorism database . at its headquarters in the hague , europol has computers where eu member states can save names and relevant details about terrorist suspects or witnesses .
additionally , the databanks contain information on organized crime , drug smuggling and human trafficking .
the computer system , tecs , can compare and analyze as many as a million data sets . the data is entered into the system directly by the 25 eu member states .
each country is represented by its own liaison officer , or elos , in the hague .
as a rule , only these liaison officers have access to the national databanks . if a member state wants to find out whether there is information in tecs on a terror suspect , europol puts together an information packet - a service that europol 's director , max-peter ratzel , is intent on putting first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol director max-peter ratzel " terrorism is , of course , very much in the foreground , because that 's where the biggest risks lie , " ratzel said .
" we have to do everything possible in order to identify and eliminate threats , so that we can offer member states the means to avoid danger .
we only need a few people to filter out the right information ; the member states are then responsible for acting on that information . " privacy advocates are critical though , about the fact that the member states can relatively freely feed data into tecs which is then consolidated into suspect profiles .
tecs saves the data for a period of at least three years . europol got its start in the mid-90s as an agency to fight drugs-related crime .
gradually , it 's grown into an institution with a staff of 500 whose main task is to organize information exchanges . other eu networks in addition to europol 's databanks , five of the largest eu states - france , britain , italy , spain and germany - share a computer network aimed at fighting terrorism .
seven states - france , spain , the netherlands , belgium , luxembourg , austria and germany - have also signed a pact to improve cross-border cooperation of their police forces when it comes to the arrest , search and trailing of suspects . but cross-border cooperation of police is by no means comprehensively regulated across the eu , and many states have misgivings .
eu commissioner for justice and security franco frattini has been pushing for stronger cooperation , and is hopeful progress will be made given the current threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following the foiled plot to blow up planes flying from britain to the us , germany is again focused on security for air and rail passengers " there is now , i think , a consensus among the member states that it 's important to really work together , " frattini said .
" we have to stay on the ball . " a directive by the eu 's interior ministry to retain internet and phone data to aid police investigations is , after the introduction of europe-wide arrest warrants , a necessary step , frattini said .
he is also working on other legislative measures to put on the table by the end of this year .
the eu would like to introduce tougher controls on the production and trade in explosives , for example .
it 's also looking into why and how muslim youths in europe are being radicalized . personal freedom still a concern frattini stresses that civil liberties should not be sacrificed in the drive for better protection from terrorists .
in this respect , he said , the united states with its far-reaching curtailments on telecommunications secrecy is no role model for the eu . " this is our political challenge , " frattini said . "
if terrorists force us to restrict our freedom , then the terrorists win .
we can never allow that to happen . " although much has been achieved when it comes to improving police cooperation at the european level , the eu 's anti-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries bemoans the fact that in some areas , progress has been too slow .
he said he is hopeful that eu interior ministers will eventually give up their opposition to majority-rules decisions at the european level . " there 's a lot of demand for the eu to help its member states more effectively , " de vries said .

it 's expected to aid anti-terror measures at the eu-level . when germany 's anti-terror register finally comes into being , it wo n't just make things easier for german officials - it will also improve cooperation with the european police force , europol , which is already working on an eu-wide counter-terrorism database . at its headquarters in the hague , europol has computers where eu member states can save names and relevant details about terrorist suspects or witnesses .
additionally , the databanks contain information on organized crime , drug smuggling and human trafficking .
the computer system , tecs , can compare and analyze as many as a million data sets . the data is entered into the system directly by the 25 eu member states .
each country is represented by its own liaison officer , or elos , in the hague .
as a rule , only these liaison officers have access to the national databanks . if a member state wants to find out whether there is information in tecs on a terror suspect , europol puts together an information packet - a service that europol 's director , max-peter ratzel , is intent on putting first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol director max-peter ratzel " terrorism is , of course , very much in the foreground , because that 's where the biggest risks lie , " ratzel said .
" we have to do everything possible in order to identify and eliminate threats , so that we can offer member states the means to avoid danger .
we only need a few people to filter out the right information ; the member states are then responsible for acting on that information . " privacy advocates are critical though , about the fact that the member states can relatively freely feed data into tecs which is then consolidated into suspect profiles .
tecs saves the data for a period of at least three years . europol got its start in the mid-90s as an agency to fight drugs-related crime .
gradually , it 's grown into an institution with a staff of 500 whose main task is to organize information exchanges . other eu networks in addition to europol 's databanks , five of the largest eu states - france , britain , italy , spain and germany - share a computer network aimed at fighting terrorism .
seven states - france , spain , the netherlands , belgium , luxembourg , austria and germany - have also signed a pact to improve cross-border cooperation of their police forces when it comes to the arrest , search and trailing of suspects . but cross-border cooperation of police is by no means comprehensively regulated across the eu , and many states have misgivings .
eu commissioner for justice and security franco frattini has been pushing for stronger cooperation , and is hopeful progress will be made given the current threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following the foiled plot to blow up planes flying from britain to the us , germany is again focused on security for air and rail passengers " there is now , i think , a consensus among the member states that it 's important to really work together , " frattini said .
" we have to stay on the ball . " a directive by the eu 's interior ministry to retain internet and phone data to aid police investigations is , after the introduction of europe-wide arrest warrants , a necessary step , frattini said .
he is also working on other legislative measures to put on the table by the end of this year .
the eu would like to introduce tougher controls on the production and trade in explosives , for example .
it 's also looking into why and how muslim youths in europe are being radicalized . personal freedom still a concern frattini stresses that civil liberties should not be sacrificed in the drive for better protection from terrorists .
in this respect , he said , the united states with its far-reaching curtailments on telecommunications secrecy is no role model for the eu . " this is our political challenge , " frattini said . "
if terrorists force us to restrict our freedom , then the terrorists win .
we can never allow that to happen . " although much has been achieved when it comes to improving police cooperation at the european level , the eu 's anti-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries bemoans the fact that in some areas , progress has been too slow .
he said he is hopeful that eu interior ministers will eventually give up their opposition to majority-rules decisions at the european level . " there 's a lot of demand for the eu to help its member states more effectively , " de vries said .

it 's expected to aid anti-terror measures at the eu-level . when germany 's anti-terror register finally comes into being , it wo n't just make things easier for german officials - it will also improve cooperation with the european police force , europol , which is already working on an eu-wide counter-terrorism database . at its headquarters in the hague , europol has computers where eu member states can save names and relevant details about terrorist suspects or witnesses .
additionally , the databanks contain information on organized crime , drug smuggling and human trafficking .
the computer system , tecs , can compare and analyze as many as a million data sets . the data is entered into the system directly by the 25 eu member states .
each country is represented by its own liaison officer , or elos , in the hague .
as a rule , only these liaison officers have access to the national databanks . if a member state wants to find out whether there is information in tecs on a terror suspect , europol puts together an information packet - a service that europol 's director , max-peter ratzel , is intent on putting first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol director max-peter ratzel " terrorism is , of course , very much in the foreground , because that 's where the biggest risks lie , " ratzel said .
" we have to do everything possible in order to identify and eliminate threats , so that we can offer member states the means to avoid danger .
we only need a few people to filter out the right information ; the member states are then responsible for acting on that information . " privacy advocates are critical though , about the fact that the member states can relatively freely feed data into tecs which is then consolidated into suspect profiles .
tecs saves the data for a period of at least three years . europol got its start in the mid-90s as an agency to fight drugs-related crime .
gradually , it 's grown into an institution with a staff of 500 whose main task is to organize information exchanges . other eu networks in addition to europol 's databanks , five of the largest eu states - france , britain , italy , spain and germany - share a computer network aimed at fighting terrorism .
seven states - france , spain , the netherlands , belgium , luxembourg , austria and germany - have also signed a pact to improve cross-border cooperation of their police forces when it comes to the arrest , search and trailing of suspects . but cross-border cooperation of police is by no means comprehensively regulated across the eu , and many states have misgivings .
eu commissioner for justice and security franco frattini has been pushing for stronger cooperation , and is hopeful progress will be made given the current threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following the foiled plot to blow up planes flying from britain to the us , germany is again focused on security for air and rail passengers " there is now , i think , a consensus among the member states that it 's important to really work together , " frattini said .
" we have to stay on the ball . " a directive by the eu 's interior ministry to retain internet and phone data to aid police investigations is , after the introduction of europe-wide arrest warrants , a necessary step , frattini said .
he is also working on other legislative measures to put on the table by the end of this year .
the eu would like to introduce tougher controls on the production and trade in explosives , for example .
it 's also looking into why and how muslim youths in europe are being radicalized . personal freedom still a concern frattini stresses that civil liberties should not be sacrificed in the drive for better protection from terrorists .
in this respect , he said , the united states with its far-reaching curtailments on telecommunications secrecy is no role model for the eu . " this is our political challenge , " frattini said . "
if terrorists force us to restrict our freedom , then the terrorists win .
we can never allow that to happen . " although much has been achieved when it comes to improving police cooperation at the european level , the eu 's anti-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries bemoans the fact that in some areas , progress has been too slow .
he said he is hopeful that eu interior ministers will eventually give up their opposition to majority-rules decisions at the european level . " there 's a lot of demand for the eu to help its member states more effectively , " de vries said .

" " we may have a unique opportunity to transform the cessation of hostilities into a durable ceasefire , " he added in brussels . the pledges came after france , which currently commands unifil , committed itself late thursday to a total deployment of 2,000 soldiers . but french president jacques chirac , who was speaking separately friday in paris , said a level of 15,000 troops was " excessive " and it made " no sense " to have such a large contingent alongside the lebanese army in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some un peacekeepers from france are already on the ground in lebanon in brussels though , finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said the total european contribution would be " something between 5,600 and 6,900 " soldiers , as well as air and naval assets . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy put the eu deployment at " 6,500 to 7,000 soldiers on the ground , which means that the spinal column of the reinforced unifil will be european . " the force is crucial to shoring up un resolution 1701 , which on august 14 brought an end to the 34-day conflict in lebanon between israel and hezbollah militants . annan said bangladesh , malaysia and indonesia had offered to participate in unifil - though israel has opposed contributions from those muslim countries because of an absence of diplomatic relations . the un chief also proposed that france see out its current term as commander of the force , which expires at the end of january , after which italy would take over .
italy is expected to supply up to 3,000 soldiers , which would make it the biggest contributor to the force . french role and reversal france , though , played a key role diplomatically in revamping the force , having co-authored the un resolution with the united states .
it also enjoys close relations with lebanon , a former protectorate .
douste-blazy said france had " absolutely " no problem with the change of command . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac , right , and angela merkel during a press conference in paris on friday chirac 's announcement that he was sending 1,600 more troops to lebanon came after international criticism over his initial , emergency deployment of just 200 soldiers to join the 200 already in unifil . a vanguard of 170 french reinforcements arrived in lebanon on friday , making france the only country so far to have actually sent troops .
chirac said he agreed to send the extra two battalions after winning a robust mandate for unifil and guarantees the force would be able to cope if hostilities flare up again . " i wonder how it would have been judged if i had raced off like a mad dog without thinking or securing minimum guarantees , " he said in paris . he also questioned the goal of boosting the force to 15,000 soldiers , calling that " a totally excessive figure " given lebanon 's relatively small size . other eu contributors the announcement of the french reinforcements spurred some of the other eu countries into firming up previously vague promises to contribute . spain was said to be ready to send 1,000 to 1,200 soldiers , substantially more than the 800 initially cited in media reports . poland 's private television station tvn24 reported foreign minister anna fotyga as saying warsaw 's total contribution would be around 500 troops which includes 214 already serving with unifil . belgian foreign minister guy verhofstadt said his country would provide 300 soldiers by late september or early october , with the possibility of adding nearly 100 more later .
" peace in the middle east is an absolute necessity , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland 's foreign minister erkki tuomioja , right , and german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier finland pledged 250 soldiers . britain 's europe minister geoff hoon said that while his country 's military - heavily deployed in iraq and afghanistan - was too stretched to send ground troops , it might supply " specialized " units . other countries , notably greece and latvia , have also indicated they could send soldiers , but no details were provided friday . germany , wary of potential confrontations with israelis because of its nazi past , is prepared to offer naval units , not troops , as is sweden . the force is also to help lebanon halt arms smuggling to hezbollah over the border with syria , considered a main sponsor of the lebanese militia , if beirut requests . syria is concerned at the deployment of foreign troops in lebanon - from which it was forced to withdraw its soldiers last year under un pressure led by france - and has cut power supplies to its neighbor and warned it may close the border . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french troops arrive in lebanon as part of unifil deployment following an initial deployment of engineers , more french troops arrived in lebanon friday as part of the pledged 2,000-strong contingent which would form part of a un force to maintain the current ceasefire .

" it does not state what we expect - namely ' we are suspending uranium enrichment , coming to the negotiating table and will speak about the opportunities and possibilities for iran . '
that is unfortunately not the case , " merkel said in a television interview . " the decisive sentence is missing and this needs to be addressed . " germany is part of the sextet that offered the package of incentives to tehran to stop nuclear fuel work , along with the united states , britain , france , russia and china . on friday , france also said that the iranian response fell short .
however , french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said it was important to avoid an escalation of the conflict with iran . " for the moment it is not satisfactory , " he told rtl radio .
" but the worst thing would be to escalate into a confrontation with iran on the one hand , and the muslim world with iran , and the west .

31 " despite the positive dimensions of iran 's offer , the stage will be set for a full-scale international crisis . " russia : no need to discuss sanctions on friday , russia said that international concerns over iran 's nuclear program did not warrant any discussion of sanctions at the moment . " i know of no instances in world practice and previous experience in which sanctions have achieved their aim and proved effective , " russian defense minister sergei ivanov said .
" russia stands for further political and diplomatic efforts to settle the issue . " the us state department said on thursday that there was still time for iran to comply with the aug .
31 deadline . " we obviously encourage iran to make the right choice , " said state department spokesman gonzalo gallegos .
" if iran does n't comply , the resolution makes very clear that the un security council will then adopt appropriate measures under article 41 , chapter 7 -lrb- of the un charter -rrb- providing for sanctions .

instead of raising taxes , however , it should reduce spending , says dw 's karl zawadzky . first the good news : germany managed to reduce its national deficit to 2.5 percent in the first half of this year .
the positive trend can be traced back to a broader economic upswing , which brought in increased tax revenues . the public deficit is n't likely to increase in the second half of 2006 , and germany may even finally be able to shed its stigma in the european union as the " stability pact rogue " - an image it had earned through several years of higher-than-permitted debt statistics .
the national deficit in the first half of 2005 was , for example , as high as 3.7 percent . according to figures released thursday by the federal statistical office , the national deficit in the first half of this year amounted to 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 35.8 billion -rrb- in real numbers , which is a good 12 billion euros less than during the same time frame last year . social security contributions , on the other hand , have remained stagnant due to only minimal changes in wages .
however , expenditures made by the government unemployment agencies this year dropped dramatically as a result of cutbacks . finance minister peer steinbrück , who bore the consequences of the political demise of his predecessor hans eichel , is reluctant to be too hasty in celebrating the success reports , lest he eat his words in just a few months ' time . tax hikes to maintain low deficit ? the government has emphasized that it will stick to its promise that , starting next year , germany 's national deficit will not exceed the maximum deficit agreed upon in the eu 's stability pact .
this contractual agreement stipulates that the deficit of all public budgets , including social security , may not exceed 3 percent of the country 's gross domestic product . thanks to positive market conditions in recent months and the higher tax revenues that resulted , germany wo n't violate the pact this year .
even a slight economic downturn will not prevent germany from meeting the deficit standard in the future . now for the not-so-good news : in order to keep the deficit within the limitations set by the stability pact , hefty tax hikes are necessary . at the beginning of 2007 , sales tax will be raised from 16 to 19 percent .
tax increases in other areas are planned as well , though they wo n't be quite as big as the sales tax hike . taken together , tax revenues are expected to increase by more than 20 billion euros per year , which will keep germany on the safe side as far as the stability pact criteria are concerned . cut spending instead of raising taxes however , burdening the taxpayers in order to meet eu deficit criteria is problematic . federal , state and local expenditures will continue to increase , even if only slightly .
market fluctuation aside , germany has a structural problem : germans pay more in tax and social contributions than those in other industrial countries . considerable reductions in spending - not another tax hike for the already burdened taxpayers - would be a better approach to trimming down the national deficit . karl zawadzky is deutsche welle 's chief business correspondent . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany up in arms over minister 's holiday comments germany 's finance minister has sparked outrage by suggesting germans should spend less on their annual holidays and instead put money aside for their old age .

" " we may have a unique opportunity to transform the cessation of hostilities into a durable ceasefire , " he added in brussels . the pledges came after france , which currently commands unifil , committed itself late thursday to a total deployment of 2,000 soldiers . but french president jacques chirac , who was speaking separately friday in paris , said a level of 15,000 troops was " excessive " and it made " no sense " to have such a large contingent alongside the lebanese army in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some un peacekeepers from france are already on the ground in lebanon in brussels though , finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said the total european contribution would be " something between 5,600 and 6,900 " soldiers , as well as air and naval assets . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy put the eu deployment at " 6,500 to 7,000 soldiers on the ground , which means that the spinal column of the reinforced unifil will be european . " the force is crucial to shoring up un resolution 1701 , which on august 14 brought an end to the 34-day conflict in lebanon between israel and hezbollah militants . annan said bangladesh , malaysia and indonesia had offered to participate in unifil - though israel has opposed contributions from those muslim countries because of an absence of diplomatic relations . the un chief also proposed that france see out its current term as commander of the force , which expires at the end of january , after which italy would take over .

" i 'm quite happy with hamburg .
we finally get to play a german club , " lehmann said .
" i think sporting and cska moscow are good teams but we have the favorite position in this group . " " as for hamburg , they 're always dangerous in set pieces and you always have to be aware of this , " lehmann added . hamburg coach thomas doll was satisfied with the group .
" it 's a great draw for us .
our goal is to reach the quarter-finals .
it 's possible even if arsenal and porto will be favorites , " he said . a true competition of champions the money-spinning group stages of european soccer 's most prestigious competition also sees 2005 winners liverpool drawn with dutch champions psv eindhoven , bordeaux and turkey 's galatasaray in group c. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool won in dramatic style in 2005 spanish giants real madrid , nine-time european champions , are drawn in the same pool as five-time french champions lyon , as they were last year .

kurnaz will not attend as he is with his family and needs time to adjust to his freedom , he said . " he will undergo medical treatment and will not be appearing in public , " docke said .
" mr kurnaz has been through hell .

prosecutors in bremen intend to investigate kurnaz on suspicion of involvement in a criminal network .
experts close to the case say kurnaz 's detention at guantanamo was unlawful . us and german intelligence concluded as early as 2002 that kurnaz had no connection to al qaeda , the taliban or any terrorist threat , said baher azmy , a seton hall law school professor who has represented kurnaz since mid-2004 . " the government 's evidence against kurnaz has ranged from incredibly tangential to at times preposterous , " azmy said in a statement .

instead of raising taxes , however , it should reduce spending , says dw 's karl zawadzky . first the good news : germany managed to reduce its national deficit to 2.5 percent in the first half of this year .
the positive trend can be traced back to a broader economic upswing , which brought in increased tax revenues . the public deficit is n't likely to increase in the second half of 2006 , and germany may even finally be able to shed its stigma in the european union as the " stability pact rogue " - an image it had earned through several years of higher-than-permitted debt statistics .
the national deficit in the first half of 2005 was , for example , as high as 3.7 percent . according to figures released thursday by the federal statistical office , the national deficit in the first half of this year amounted to 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 35.8 billion -rrb- in real numbers , which is a good 12 billion euros less than during the same time frame last year . social security contributions , on the other hand , have remained stagnant due to only minimal changes in wages .
however , expenditures made by the government unemployment agencies this year dropped dramatically as a result of cutbacks . finance minister peer steinbrück , who bore the consequences of the political demise of his predecessor hans eichel , is reluctant to be too hasty in celebrating the success reports , lest he eat his words in just a few months ' time . tax hikes to maintain low deficit ? the government has emphasized that it will stick to its promise that , starting next year , germany 's national deficit will not exceed the maximum deficit agreed upon in the eu 's stability pact .
this contractual agreement stipulates that the deficit of all public budgets , including social security , may not exceed 3 percent of the country 's gross domestic product . thanks to positive market conditions in recent months and the higher tax revenues that resulted , germany wo n't violate the pact this year .
even a slight economic downturn will not prevent germany from meeting the deficit standard in the future . now for the not-so-good news : in order to keep the deficit within the limitations set by the stability pact , hefty tax hikes are necessary . at the beginning of 2007 , sales tax will be raised from 16 to 19 percent .
tax increases in other areas are planned as well , though they wo n't be quite as big as the sales tax hike . taken together , tax revenues are expected to increase by more than 20 billion euros per year , which will keep germany on the safe side as far as the stability pact criteria are concerned . cut spending instead of raising taxes however , burdening the taxpayers in order to meet eu deficit criteria is problematic . federal , state and local expenditures will continue to increase , even if only slightly .
market fluctuation aside , germany has a structural problem : germans pay more in tax and social contributions than those in other industrial countries . considerable reductions in spending - not another tax hike for the already burdened taxpayers - would be a better approach to trimming down the national deficit . karl zawadzky is deutsche welle 's chief business correspondent . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany up in arms over minister 's holiday comments germany 's finance minister has sparked outrage by suggesting germans should spend less on their annual holidays and instead put money aside for their old age .

instead of raising taxes , however , it should reduce spending , says dw 's karl zawadzky . first the good news : germany managed to reduce its national deficit to 2.5 percent in the first half of this year .
the positive trend can be traced back to a broader economic upswing , which brought in increased tax revenues . the public deficit is n't likely to increase in the second half of 2006 , and germany may even finally be able to shed its stigma in the european union as the " stability pact rogue " - an image it had earned through several years of higher-than-permitted debt statistics .
the national deficit in the first half of 2005 was , for example , as high as 3.7 percent . according to figures released thursday by the federal statistical office , the national deficit in the first half of this year amounted to 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 35.8 billion -rrb- in real numbers , which is a good 12 billion euros less than during the same time frame last year . social security contributions , on the other hand , have remained stagnant due to only minimal changes in wages .
however , expenditures made by the government unemployment agencies this year dropped dramatically as a result of cutbacks . finance minister peer steinbrück , who bore the consequences of the political demise of his predecessor hans eichel , is reluctant to be too hasty in celebrating the success reports , lest he eat his words in just a few months ' time . tax hikes to maintain low deficit ? the government has emphasized that it will stick to its promise that , starting next year , germany 's national deficit will not exceed the maximum deficit agreed upon in the eu 's stability pact .
this contractual agreement stipulates that the deficit of all public budgets , including social security , may not exceed 3 percent of the country 's gross domestic product . thanks to positive market conditions in recent months and the higher tax revenues that resulted , germany wo n't violate the pact this year .
even a slight economic downturn will not prevent germany from meeting the deficit standard in the future . now for the not-so-good news : in order to keep the deficit within the limitations set by the stability pact , hefty tax hikes are necessary . at the beginning of 2007 , sales tax will be raised from 16 to 19 percent .
tax increases in other areas are planned as well , though they wo n't be quite as big as the sales tax hike . taken together , tax revenues are expected to increase by more than 20 billion euros per year , which will keep germany on the safe side as far as the stability pact criteria are concerned . cut spending instead of raising taxes however , burdening the taxpayers in order to meet eu deficit criteria is problematic . federal , state and local expenditures will continue to increase , even if only slightly .
market fluctuation aside , germany has a structural problem : germans pay more in tax and social contributions than those in other industrial countries . considerable reductions in spending - not another tax hike for the already burdened taxpayers - would be a better approach to trimming down the national deficit . karl zawadzky is deutsche welle 's chief business correspondent . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany up in arms over minister 's holiday comments germany 's finance minister has sparked outrage by suggesting germans should spend less on their annual holidays and instead put money aside for their old age .

" earlier , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said an agreement on the release of kurnaz had come after the successful conclusion of long negotiations between the us and german governments . no proof of terrorist activity kurnaz , dubbed the " bremen taliban " after the northern german city where he lived , was arrested in pakistan in late 2001 , and taken to guantanamo bay in 2002 on suspicion of having fought for al qaeda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allegations of torture at guantanamo bay have prompted widespread protest from human rights organizations a us court found allegations of kurnaz 's involvement in terrorist activities to be untrue .
his release follows months of talks between the us and german governments .
chancellor angela merkel reportedly brought up the issue when she met with president george w. bush in stralsund last month . kurnaz said he suffered abuse including sexual humiliation , water torture and the desecration of islam at guantanamo . according to reports in der spiegel , berlin has refused us requests that kurnaz be put under constant surveillance and his passport confiscated .
however , he will not be free to completely return to his old life .
prosecutors in bremen intend to investigate kurnaz on suspicion of involvement in a criminal network .
experts close to the case say kurnaz 's detention at guantanamo was unlawful . us and german intelligence concluded as early as 2002 that kurnaz had no connection to al qaeda , the taliban or any terrorist threat , said baher azmy , a seton hall law school professor who has represented kurnaz since mid-2004 . " the government 's evidence against kurnaz has ranged from incredibly tangential to at times preposterous , " azmy said in a statement . " kurnaz 's case lays to shameful waste the government 's repeated assertions that guantanamo houses only hardened terrorists or persons captured on the battlefield , " azmy said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de release of german-born guantanamo prisoner expected soon top german politicians have been advocating his release for months .
now it looks like murat kurnaz from bremen will return home by the end of the month , after more than four years at guantanamo .

21 , 2006 -rrb- " bremen taliban " release anticipated a turkish man living in bremen is expected to be allowed to return to germany from the us military base in guantanamo bay .
german authorities may have delayed his release by years , according to media reports .
-lrb- march 29 , 2006 -rrb- ' bremen taliban ' or victim of circumstance ?
a year ago , murat kurnaz left bremen to " see and experience the koran " in pakistan .
since then , he 's been locked up at guantanamo bay , suspected of fighting for the taliban .
but german investigators say there 's no proof .

the source gave no further details . second suspect questioned in lebanon meanwhile , investigators are hoping that more of their questions about the plot will be answered following hamad 's interrogation , at which officials from germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- are present . " we 're confident that he will break his silence and that we 'll know much more later in the day , " bka president jörg ziercke told public broadcaster ard on friday morning . both hamad and el hajdib were identified on security camera footage dragging suitcases loaded with crudely made bombs onto trains in cologne . did they have help ? while investigators and political leaders have been pleased about the quick succession of arrests , big questions remain about the case , including whether the men were working alone or had the support of a terrorist network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziercke says it 's too early to say if the men belong to an international terrorist network ziercke said it is still too early to say if they belonged to an international network . " we assume that this concerns a terrorist group here in germany , which is also the view of the federal prosecutors , " he told german broadcaster n-tv . " we know that the suspects had accomplices .
at the moment we 're trying to determine whether this was an international network or if it was an autonomous terrorist group in germany . " german terror expert , elmar thevessen , has pointed out that hamad and el hajdib lived hundreds of miles apart , raising the question of how they were able to communicate and gain each other 's trust .
according to testimony from el hajdib , the two men first met in germany . " we know from jihad hamad , who gave himself up , that he only arrived in cologne in february of this year , just five months before the crime , " thevessen said .
" where did the contacts come from and how could he so quickly get himself set up to prepare an attack that almost succeeded ? " searches of hamad 's apartment have turned up damning evidence , including dna that matches that on the suitcases , as well as receipts for the gas canister and gas used in the failed plot . the plot has reminded germans that they are not immune to international terrorism .
wolfgang bosbach , a domestic policy expert for berlin 's conservative cdu / csu parliamentary group , has warned that there are an estimated 32,000 islamists in germany and some 3,000 of these were considered extremists .

" where did the contacts come from and how could he so quickly get himself set up to prepare an attack that almost succeeded ?

a first french contingent of 49 engineers arrived on saturday . " i have decided to send two extra battalions into the field to expand our unifil contingent .
two thousand french soldiers will thus be placed under the un flag in lebanon , " french president chirac said in a televised address on thursday evening . each french battalion counts 800 soldiers .
four hundred french soldiers are already serving in the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- . us , israel and lebanon welcome deployment the french decision was hailed by israel and us president george w. bush " i applaud the decision of france , as well as the significant pledges from italy and our other important allies .
i encourage other nations to make contributions as well , " bush said in a statement released by the white house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac answered the call " the fact that the french have decided to send troops will bring in additional nations , " miri eisen , a senior policy advisory to israeli prime minister ehud olmert , told the bbc . lebanon 's prime minister also praised france saying that its decision to contribute 2,000 soldiers to un troops in lebanon will bolster european participation and help consolidate stability in the country . " undoubtedly , the french decision will help boost european participation , " fuad siniora said in a statement .
" in turn , this will help speed up the formation of the international force , which along with the lebanese army , will protect civilians and achieve security and stability , " he said . the deployment of the french troops " helps strengthen stability in lebanon and allows the country to regain its territories through an israeli withdrawal and the extension of state authority over all territories , " he said . french general to retain command - for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french troops arrived in lebanon on friday the united nations announced thursday that french general alain pellegrini would keep command over the operation to monitor the tenuous ceasefire between israel and the lebanese shiite militia hezbollah . pellegrini , currently in command of the united nations interim force in lebanon , will retain his post after the force undergoes a robust expansion under a un resolution , a un spokesman said friday . " general alain pellegrini leads unifil and he will continue to do so " with the " very strong support " of secretary general kofi annan , un spokesman stephane dujarric told reporters . both france and italy have offered to command unifil , which faces the daunting task of policing the ceasefire between israel and the lebanese shiite militia hezbollah . the appointment of a commander of a un peacekeeping force is the responsibility of the secretary general .
kofi annan , speaking from brussels friday where eu ministers are meeting to thrash out details of the bloc 's deployment strategy , said that he expected to be able to announce the force 's " leadership this afternoon . " unifil to enforce ceasefire alongside lebanese terms of the august 14 truce between israel and hezbollah fighters were laid out in un security council resolution 1701 , under which lebanon was " to secure its borders and other entry points to prevent the entry in lebanon without its consent of arms . " lebanese troops have since deployed along the syrian border in the north and east of the country , military sources said . a reinforced unifil could help intercept arms shipments to hezbollah , the militant shiite group that captured two israeli soldiers on july 12 , sparking a massive riposte and 34 days of heavy fighting . france and italy leading eu efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unifil will be boosted but will not make its target , it seems france was criticized last week after it said that just 200 extra soldiers would join unifil , which was set up 28 years ago as a toothless observer force but which the un resolution aims to revamp into a more robust presence of 15,000 soldiers . at the request of britain , israel , lebanon and the united states , italy stepped forward and offered to lead the force , pledging a reported 3,000 soldiers . spain was prepared to commit a battalion of between 700 and 800 troops to the un force , military sources were quoted as saying by a news report late thursday . greece , finland , latvia , sweden and poland have also indicated they could send soldiers , prompting european commission chief jose manuel barroso to say thursday he was " confident that europe will provide the necessary support to expand the unifil . " eu will fail to meet 15,000-troop target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nations already have un troops in lebanon eu leaders have spoken about contributing 4,000 troops to unifil .
however , even if eu leaders on friday pledge several thousand soldiers , unifil will still be far short of the 15,000 target . deployment plans were complicated however , with threats by syria to close its border in the event of such a move by the un . following talks in helsinki with syrian counterpart walid muallem , finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja said : " they will close the frontier to all traffic " if un troops were posted on the lebanese side . syrian president bashar al-assad had already warned that such a deployment would represent a " hostile " position with regard to his country . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy sending signal to eu , us with lebanon offer as the eu struggles to gather military contributions for lebanon , italy has said it would lead the peacekeeping mission .

" it does not state what we expect - namely ' we are suspending uranium enrichment , coming to the negotiating table and will speak about the opportunities and possibilities for iran . '
that is unfortunately not the case , " merkel said in a television interview . " the decisive sentence is missing and this needs to be addressed . " germany is part of the sextet that offered the package of incentives to tehran to stop nuclear fuel work , along with the united states , britain , france , russia and china . on friday , france also said that the iranian response fell short .
however , french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said it was important to avoid an escalation of the conflict with iran . " for the moment it is not satisfactory , " he told rtl radio .
" but the worst thing would be to escalate into a confrontation with iran on the one hand , and the muslim world with iran , and the west .
that would be the clash of the civilizations that france today is practically alone in trying to avoid . " on tuesday , iran offered to start serious talks over its nuclear program but there was no sign that it had agreed to a united nations security council demand that it freeze uranium by aug .

" iran wants firm guarantees on the proposed offers of nuclear assistance , such as the sale of light water reactors to iran , as well as a secured nuclear fuel supply , " abbas maleki and kevah afrasiabi said on the agenceglobal.com web site . they said iran 's response was moderate in tone and encouraged the western powers to engage it rather than rush to sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some powers favor continuing diplomatic efforts rather than resorting to sanctions maleki , director of the international institute for caspian studies in tehran , and afrasiabi , a political scientist who has also taught in tehran , added that if there is a move towards sanctions after aug .
31 " despite the positive dimensions of iran 's offer , the stage will be set for a full-scale international crisis . " russia : no need to discuss sanctions on friday , russia said that international concerns over iran 's nuclear program did not warrant any discussion of sanctions at the moment . " i know of no instances in world practice and previous experience in which sanctions have achieved their aim and proved effective , " russian defense minister sergei ivanov said .
" russia stands for further political and diplomatic efforts to settle the issue . " the us state department said on thursday that there was still time for iran to comply with the aug .
31 deadline . " we obviously encourage iran to make the right choice , " said state department spokesman gonzalo gallegos .
" if iran does n't comply , the resolution makes very clear that the un security council will then adopt appropriate measures under article 41 , chapter 7 -lrb- of the un charter -rrb- providing for sanctions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.08.2006 two more suspects in german train bombing plot arrested großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two suspects have already been arrested in connection with the plot police in lebanon and southern germany on friday arrested the third and fourth suspects in connection with the failed plot to blow up german passenger trains . federal prosecutors in karlsruhe said that the third suspect , arrested in the southern german city of constance on friday , moved in the same circle as youssef mohamad el hajdib , the 21-year-old lebanese man who was arrested in kiel on saturday as he was apparently trying to flee the country . the prosecutor 's office said it was not yet clear " if and to what extent " the suspect in constance was involved in the failed plot to set off bombs on trains in dortmund and koblenz last month , but that police were searching the man 's student residence . also on friday , lebanese authorities arrested a fourth suspect , identified as a 24-year-old lebanese man with the initials k.h.d. his arrest was based on information provided by jihad hamad , another suspect who had turned himself in to lebanese authorities on thursday , a senior lebanese judicial source said .
the source gave no further details . second suspect questioned in lebanon meanwhile , investigators are hoping that more of their questions about the plot will be answered following hamad 's interrogation , at which officials from germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- are present . " we 're confident that he will break his silence and that we 'll know much more later in the day , " bka president jörg ziercke told public broadcaster ard on friday morning . both hamad and el hajdib were identified on security camera footage dragging suitcases loaded with crudely made bombs onto trains in cologne . did they have help ? while investigators and political leaders have been pleased about the quick succession of arrests , big questions remain about the case , including whether the men were working alone or had the support of a terrorist network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziercke says it 's too early to say if the men belong to an international terrorist network ziercke said it is still too early to say if they belonged to an international network . " we assume that this concerns a terrorist group here in germany , which is also the view of the federal prosecutors , " he told german broadcaster n-tv . " we know that the suspects had accomplices .
at the moment we 're trying to determine whether this was an international network or if it was an autonomous terrorist group in germany . " german terror expert , elmar thevessen , has pointed out that hamad and el hajdib lived hundreds of miles apart , raising the question of how they were able to communicate and gain each other 's trust .
according to testimony from el hajdib , the two men first met in germany . " we know from jihad hamad , who gave himself up , that he only arrived in cologne in february of this year , just five months before the crime , " thevessen said .
" where did the contacts come from and how could he so quickly get himself set up to prepare an attack that almost succeeded ? " searches of hamad 's apartment have turned up damning evidence , including dna that matches that on the suitcases , as well as receipts for the gas canister and gas used in the failed plot . the plot has reminded germans that they are not immune to international terrorism .
wolfgang bosbach , a domestic policy expert for berlin 's conservative cdu / csu parliamentary group , has warned that there are an estimated 32,000 islamists in germany and some 3,000 of these were considered extremists .
that , he said , represents a " considerable threat potential for our country .

" it does not state what we expect - namely ' we are suspending uranium enrichment , coming to the negotiating table and will speak about the opportunities and possibilities for iran . '
that is unfortunately not the case , " merkel said in a television interview . " the decisive sentence is missing and this needs to be addressed . " germany is part of the sextet that offered the package of incentives to tehran to stop nuclear fuel work , along with the united states , britain , france , russia and china . on friday , france also said that the iranian response fell short .
however , french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said it was important to avoid an escalation of the conflict with iran . " for the moment it is not satisfactory , " he told rtl radio .
" but the worst thing would be to escalate into a confrontation with iran on the one hand , and the muslim world with iran , and the west .
that would be the clash of the civilizations that france today is practically alone in trying to avoid . " on tuesday , iran offered to start serious talks over its nuclear program but there was no sign that it had agreed to a united nations security council demand that it freeze uranium by aug .

" iran wants firm guarantees on the proposed offers of nuclear assistance , such as the sale of light water reactors to iran , as well as a secured nuclear fuel supply , " abbas maleki and kevah afrasiabi said on the agenceglobal.com web site . they said iran 's response was moderate in tone and encouraged the western powers to engage it rather than rush to sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some powers favor continuing diplomatic efforts rather than resorting to sanctions maleki , director of the international institute for caspian studies in tehran , and afrasiabi , a political scientist who has also taught in tehran , added that if there is a move towards sanctions after aug .
31 " despite the positive dimensions of iran 's offer , the stage will be set for a full-scale international crisis . " russia : no need to discuss sanctions on friday , russia said that international concerns over iran 's nuclear program did not warrant any discussion of sanctions at the moment . " i know of no instances in world practice and previous experience in which sanctions have achieved their aim and proved effective , " russian defense minister sergei ivanov said .
" russia stands for further political and diplomatic efforts to settle the issue . " the us state department said on thursday that there was still time for iran to comply with the aug .
31 deadline . " we obviously encourage iran to make the right choice , " said state department spokesman gonzalo gallegos .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.08.2006 opinion : deficit-sinner germany mending its ways großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany may manage this year to keep its deficit down to the level required by the eu stability pact , which underpins the euro .
instead of raising taxes , however , it should reduce spending , says dw 's karl zawadzky . first the good news : germany managed to reduce its national deficit to 2.5 percent in the first half of this year .
the positive trend can be traced back to a broader economic upswing , which brought in increased tax revenues . the public deficit is n't likely to increase in the second half of 2006 , and germany may even finally be able to shed its stigma in the european union as the " stability pact rogue " - an image it had earned through several years of higher-than-permitted debt statistics .
the national deficit in the first half of 2005 was , for example , as high as 3.7 percent . according to figures released thursday by the federal statistical office , the national deficit in the first half of this year amounted to 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 35.8 billion -rrb- in real numbers , which is a good 12 billion euros less than during the same time frame last year . social security contributions , on the other hand , have remained stagnant due to only minimal changes in wages .
however , expenditures made by the government unemployment agencies this year dropped dramatically as a result of cutbacks . finance minister peer steinbrück , who bore the consequences of the political demise of his predecessor hans eichel , is reluctant to be too hasty in celebrating the success reports , lest he eat his words in just a few months ' time . tax hikes to maintain low deficit ? the government has emphasized that it will stick to its promise that , starting next year , germany 's national deficit will not exceed the maximum deficit agreed upon in the eu 's stability pact .
this contractual agreement stipulates that the deficit of all public budgets , including social security , may not exceed 3 percent of the country 's gross domestic product . thanks to positive market conditions in recent months and the higher tax revenues that resulted , germany wo n't violate the pact this year .
even a slight economic downturn will not prevent germany from meeting the deficit standard in the future . now for the not-so-good news : in order to keep the deficit within the limitations set by the stability pact , hefty tax hikes are necessary . at the beginning of 2007 , sales tax will be raised from 16 to 19 percent .
tax increases in other areas are planned as well , though they wo n't be quite as big as the sales tax hike . taken together , tax revenues are expected to increase by more than 20 billion euros per year , which will keep germany on the safe side as far as the stability pact criteria are concerned . cut spending instead of raising taxes however , burdening the taxpayers in order to meet eu deficit criteria is problematic . federal , state and local expenditures will continue to increase , even if only slightly .
market fluctuation aside , germany has a structural problem : germans pay more in tax and social contributions than those in other industrial countries . considerable reductions in spending - not another tax hike for the already burdened taxpayers - would be a better approach to trimming down the national deficit . karl zawadzky is deutsche welle 's chief business correspondent . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany up in arms over minister 's holiday comments germany 's finance minister has sparked outrage by suggesting germans should spend less on their annual holidays and instead put money aside for their old age .

however , expenditures made by the government unemployment agencies this year dropped dramatically as a result of cutbacks . finance minister peer steinbrück , who bore the consequences of the political demise of his predecessor hans eichel , is reluctant to be too hasty in celebrating the success reports , lest he eat his words in just a few months ' time . tax hikes to maintain low deficit ? the government has emphasized that it will stick to its promise that , starting next year , germany 's national deficit will not exceed the maximum deficit agreed upon in the eu 's stability pact .
this contractual agreement stipulates that the deficit of all public budgets , including social security , may not exceed 3 percent of the country 's gross domestic product . thanks to positive market conditions in recent months and the higher tax revenues that resulted , germany wo n't violate the pact this year .
even a slight economic downturn will not prevent germany from meeting the deficit standard in the future . now for the not-so-good news : in order to keep the deficit within the limitations set by the stability pact , hefty tax hikes are necessary . at the beginning of 2007 , sales tax will be raised from 16 to 19 percent .
tax increases in other areas are planned as well , though they wo n't be quite as big as the sales tax hike . taken together , tax revenues are expected to increase by more than 20 billion euros per year , which will keep germany on the safe side as far as the stability pact criteria are concerned . cut spending instead of raising taxes however , burdening the taxpayers in order to meet eu deficit criteria is problematic . federal , state and local expenditures will continue to increase , even if only slightly .
market fluctuation aside , germany has a structural problem : germans pay more in tax and social contributions than those in other industrial countries . considerable reductions in spending - not another tax hike for the already burdened taxpayers - would be a better approach to trimming down the national deficit . karl zawadzky is deutsche welle 's chief business correspondent . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany up in arms over minister 's holiday comments germany 's finance minister has sparked outrage by suggesting germans should spend less on their annual holidays and instead put money aside for their old age .

most call themselves communists , yet loudly proclaim their support for israel and george w. bush . when it comes to the anti-germans , the political big tent theory appears to have become fact : groups that generally ca n't bear to be in the same room sometimes unite for a common cause . that was on show recently in western berlin , where thousands had gathered to show their support for israel during the recent conflict with hezbollah militants in lebanon .
many of the demonstrators were members of berlin 's jewish community or the conservative christian democrats . however , there were some there who belonged to the far-left and sported all the accoutrements of those who are known as autonomen in germany - black clothing , buttons or patches with political slogans or insignia , and often scarves , sunglasses or baseball caps to make them harder to identify . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators often clash with police but this time they had n't come to disrupt the demonstration , shout out anti-zionist slogans or get into tussles with police , as they often do .
the group of anti-germans had actually organized the demonstration under the slogan " unconditional solidarity with israel , " one of the core positions of their movement . such a stance puts the group firmly at odds with the majority viewpoint of germany 's far-left movement , which since the 1970s has been overwhelmingly pro-palestinian and very critical of israeli policy .
completing the philosophical break is the support of many anti-germans for us president george w. bush , who for the traditional far left is anathema . " it has to do with george w. bush 's conception for a new middle east , which is essentially supported , " said rüdiger göbel , deputy editor-in-chief of junge welt , a left-wing daily based in berlin .
" the anti-germans are actually closer to the neo-conservatives in the united states . " fighting a " new fascism " to many observers , the anti-germans are a conundrum .
most consider themselves communists , but according to a study carried out by patrick hagen at the university of cologne , they " have abandoned almost all of the essentials of the communist movement and the left , such as the positive relations to the working class , anti-imperialism and anti-racism which has led to a deep split within the extra-parliamentary left . " the anti-german movement can be traced back to the fall of the berlin wall , where some on the far left demonstrated against reunification , warning that a stronger germany could result in a new militarism and even a " fourth reich . "
they based their slogan on the phrase often used in holocaust remembrance ceremonies : " never again . "
the anti-germans went further , rallying around " germany , never again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators at a anti-nazi rally as time went on , the group began to show more support for the united states .
in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of the destruction of dresden by the allies , the anti-germans praised the bombing of the civil population , since in their view , so many of them had supported the nazi regime . but the movement really got behind the stars and stripes after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , which they saw as anti-semitic and targeted at israel .
to them , it marked the rise of a new type of fascism .
this time is was n't from the far right , but from radical islam and it had to be fought .
the us , in their eyes , was the only one willing to fight it . " islamic terrorists and states such as syria and iran want to liquidate israel , " said hermann gremliza , publisher of the leftist magazine konkret and one of the leading figures in the anti-german movement , in an e-mail response .
" so -lrb- anti-germans -rrb- act according to the motto : the enemy of my enemy is my friend . " just after the war in iraq broke out in 2003 , the anti-german magazine bahamas wrote an editorial entitled " bush - the man of peace ! " whose side are they on ? these kinds of positions have put the group in sometimes violent opposition to the traditional far left .
when anti-germans show up at left-wing demonstrations with signs supporting american policy or israel , they are generally not welcomed warmly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would che have supported george w. bush ?
" whoever carries an israeli flag is insulted and spit upon , " gremliza said .
" but what do you expect , we 're in germany . " the traditional far left accuses the anti-germans of getting in bed with the bourgeoisie .
some writers in the anti-german camp even write occasionally for the online site of the newsmagazine der spiegel or even such bastions of conservatism as the daily die welt . observers say that means they have an influence beyond their actual numbers , which are estimated between 500 and 3,000 .
gremliza , however , said around 50,000 people read his magazine konkret . anti-german goals , he says , are to uncover what group members see as the hypocrisy of a german foreign policy that has been harmful to israel and helped the rise of a new " islamic " fascism , which they see as a direct descendent of the form practiced by the nazis . " germany wants an alliance with the islamic world - against the us , " he said , despite angela merkel 's close ties to her american counterpart .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.08.2006 strange bedfellows : radical leftists for bush großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-germans are against what they see as a newer form of fascists than neo-nazis among the german far-left , one subgroup called the anti-germans holds some contradictory views .
most call themselves communists , yet loudly proclaim their support for israel and george w. bush . when it comes to the anti-germans , the political big tent theory appears to have become fact : groups that generally ca n't bear to be in the same room sometimes unite for a common cause . that was on show recently in western berlin , where thousands had gathered to show their support for israel during the recent conflict with hezbollah militants in lebanon .
many of the demonstrators were members of berlin 's jewish community or the conservative christian democrats . however , there were some there who belonged to the far-left and sported all the accoutrements of those who are known as autonomen in germany - black clothing , buttons or patches with political slogans or insignia , and often scarves , sunglasses or baseball caps to make them harder to identify . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators often clash with police but this time they had n't come to disrupt the demonstration , shout out anti-zionist slogans or get into tussles with police , as they often do .
the group of anti-germans had actually organized the demonstration under the slogan " unconditional solidarity with israel , " one of the core positions of their movement . such a stance puts the group firmly at odds with the majority viewpoint of germany 's far-left movement , which since the 1970s has been overwhelmingly pro-palestinian and very critical of israeli policy .
completing the philosophical break is the support of many anti-germans for us president george w. bush , who for the traditional far left is anathema . " it has to do with george w. bush 's conception for a new middle east , which is essentially supported , " said rüdiger göbel , deputy editor-in-chief of junge welt , a left-wing daily based in berlin .
" the anti-germans are actually closer to the neo-conservatives in the united states . " fighting a " new fascism " to many observers , the anti-germans are a conundrum .
most consider themselves communists , but according to a study carried out by patrick hagen at the university of cologne , they " have abandoned almost all of the essentials of the communist movement and the left , such as the positive relations to the working class , anti-imperialism and anti-racism which has led to a deep split within the extra-parliamentary left . " the anti-german movement can be traced back to the fall of the berlin wall , where some on the far left demonstrated against reunification , warning that a stronger germany could result in a new militarism and even a " fourth reich . "
they based their slogan on the phrase often used in holocaust remembrance ceremonies : " never again . "
the anti-germans went further , rallying around " germany , never again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators at a anti-nazi rally as time went on , the group began to show more support for the united states .
in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of the destruction of dresden by the allies , the anti-germans praised the bombing of the civil population , since in their view , so many of them had supported the nazi regime . but the movement really got behind the stars and stripes after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , which they saw as anti-semitic and targeted at israel .
to them , it marked the rise of a new type of fascism .
this time is was n't from the far right , but from radical islam and it had to be fought .
the us , in their eyes , was the only one willing to fight it . " islamic terrorists and states such as syria and iran want to liquidate israel , " said hermann gremliza , publisher of the leftist magazine konkret and one of the leading figures in the anti-german movement , in an e-mail response .
" so -lrb- anti-germans -rrb- act according to the motto : the enemy of my enemy is my friend . " just after the war in iraq broke out in 2003 , the anti-german magazine bahamas wrote an editorial entitled " bush - the man of peace ! " whose side are they on ? these kinds of positions have put the group in sometimes violent opposition to the traditional far left .
when anti-germans show up at left-wing demonstrations with signs supporting american policy or israel , they are generally not welcomed warmly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would che have supported george w. bush ?
" whoever carries an israeli flag is insulted and spit upon , " gremliza said .
" but what do you expect , we 're in germany . " the traditional far left accuses the anti-germans of getting in bed with the bourgeoisie .
some writers in the anti-german camp even write occasionally for the online site of the newsmagazine der spiegel or even such bastions of conservatism as the daily die welt . observers say that means they have an influence beyond their actual numbers , which are estimated between 500 and 3,000 .
gremliza , however , said around 50,000 people read his magazine konkret . anti-german goals , he says , are to uncover what group members see as the hypocrisy of a german foreign policy that has been harmful to israel and helped the rise of a new " islamic " fascism , which they see as a direct descendent of the form practiced by the nazis . " germany wants an alliance with the islamic world - against the us , " he said , despite angela merkel 's close ties to her american counterpart .
" and no one notices , except the occasional commentator in the new york times and the anti-germans . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sheds the spirit of ' 68 with the country turning away from the red-green government and poised for a new political departure , dw-world spoke to green party politician hans-christian ströbele about the legacy of the late ' 60s .

many of the demonstrators were members of berlin 's jewish community or the conservative christian democrats . however , there were some there who belonged to the far-left and sported all the accoutrements of those who are known as autonomen in germany - black clothing , buttons or patches with political slogans or insignia , and often scarves , sunglasses or baseball caps to make them harder to identify . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators often clash with police but this time they had n't come to disrupt the demonstration , shout out anti-zionist slogans or get into tussles with police , as they often do .
the group of anti-germans had actually organized the demonstration under the slogan " unconditional solidarity with israel , " one of the core positions of their movement . such a stance puts the group firmly at odds with the majority viewpoint of germany 's far-left movement , which since the 1970s has been overwhelmingly pro-palestinian and very critical of israeli policy .
completing the philosophical break is the support of many anti-germans for us president george w. bush , who for the traditional far left is anathema . " it has to do with george w. bush 's conception for a new middle east , which is essentially supported , " said rüdiger göbel , deputy editor-in-chief of junge welt , a left-wing daily based in berlin .
" the anti-germans are actually closer to the neo-conservatives in the united states . " fighting a " new fascism " to many observers , the anti-germans are a conundrum .
most consider themselves communists , but according to a study carried out by patrick hagen at the university of cologne , they " have abandoned almost all of the essentials of the communist movement and the left , such as the positive relations to the working class , anti-imperialism and anti-racism which has led to a deep split within the extra-parliamentary left . " the anti-german movement can be traced back to the fall of the berlin wall , where some on the far left demonstrated against reunification , warning that a stronger germany could result in a new militarism and even a " fourth reich . "
they based their slogan on the phrase often used in holocaust remembrance ceremonies : " never again . "
the anti-germans went further , rallying around " germany , never again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators at a anti-nazi rally as time went on , the group began to show more support for the united states .
in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of the destruction of dresden by the allies , the anti-germans praised the bombing of the civil population , since in their view , so many of them had supported the nazi regime . but the movement really got behind the stars and stripes after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , which they saw as anti-semitic and targeted at israel .
to them , it marked the rise of a new type of fascism .
this time is was n't from the far right , but from radical islam and it had to be fought .
the us , in their eyes , was the only one willing to fight it . " islamic terrorists and states such as syria and iran want to liquidate israel , " said hermann gremliza , publisher of the leftist magazine konkret and one of the leading figures in the anti-german movement , in an e-mail response .
" so -lrb- anti-germans -rrb- act according to the motto : the enemy of my enemy is my friend . " just after the war in iraq broke out in 2003 , the anti-german magazine bahamas wrote an editorial entitled " bush - the man of peace ! " whose side are they on ? these kinds of positions have put the group in sometimes violent opposition to the traditional far left .
when anti-germans show up at left-wing demonstrations with signs supporting american policy or israel , they are generally not welcomed warmly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would che have supported george w. bush ?
" whoever carries an israeli flag is insulted and spit upon , " gremliza said .
" but what do you expect , we 're in germany . " the traditional far left accuses the anti-germans of getting in bed with the bourgeoisie .
some writers in the anti-german camp even write occasionally for the online site of the newsmagazine der spiegel or even such bastions of conservatism as the daily die welt . observers say that means they have an influence beyond their actual numbers , which are estimated between 500 and 3,000 .
gremliza , however , said around 50,000 people read his magazine konkret . anti-german goals , he says , are to uncover what group members see as the hypocrisy of a german foreign policy that has been harmful to israel and helped the rise of a new " islamic " fascism , which they see as a direct descendent of the form practiced by the nazis . " germany wants an alliance with the islamic world - against the us , " he said , despite angela merkel 's close ties to her american counterpart .

why does n't she like me ?
what is a condom ?
generations of confused german teenagers have turned to dr. sommer for honesty - and explicit photos . sandra , 16 , looks up coyly from the pages of bravo , wearing a black choker and nothing else .
boyfriend elias , 18 , grins from the opposite page , also in his natural state . " tell me , why do you love each other ? " reads the headline .
and the young couple tells why - and exactly how . sell this in america , and risk prison time for child pornography . but in germany , this is nothing tawdry . it 's the country 's most popular teenage magazine , and it turns 50 on saturday . sandra and elias ' graphic spread is in the same issue as a free sheet of fake tattoos , a feature about harry potter , and an exclusive report on tokio hotel , the german boy band currently making girls swoon . a german institution since 1969 , dr. sommer combines no-holds-barred sex advice with full-frontal photos . it highlights a basic cultural divide between germany and many other countries - of how openly sex is discussed , especially among youth . " it is not pornography , " says bravo 's deputy editor , alex gernandt .
" it deals with naked people , but in a very sensitive way .
we try to portray young people to tell readers , ' you are not too fat , not too thin .
you are ok the way you are . ' " there are a lot less teenage pregnancies in germany in comparison to the united kingdom or the us , and i think bravo has its share in that success , " gernandt said . breaking taboos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was seduced at 14 , " kristijan says the current dr. sommer , eveline von arx , credits the column with germany 's free sexual attitudes . when it began in 1969 , " dr. sommer really broke taboos , and it was really spectacular to do something like that , " said von arx , who has been writing the column for three years .
" it 's not that spectacular anymore .
people are used to it .
everybody knows it . " each weekly issue of bravo now features photos of two teenagers , generally between 16 and 20 , in the nude , with interviews about their bodies and experiences . anyone under 18 , like sandra , must have his or her parents ' permission to appear . they are paid 400 euros -lrb- a little more than $ 500 -rrb- to pose , and many report the experience is a self-esteem boost , von arx said . weekly letters range from " my boyfriend is once again interested in his former girlfriend " to " everybody 's had sex , only i have n't . "
sample answer : " nowhere does it say that youth have to have sex by a certain time … talk to your boyfriend about it .
tell him how you feel . " " you can be sexy here " bravo 's web site even features explicit petting and positions photo galleries that would n't last a day in other countries . the magazine publishes its eastern european editions with little to no nudity .
but in germany , even teachers and religious leaders seem to welcome the column .
von arx has spoken in schools and was even invited as a youth expert to a big evangelical christian conference last year . gisela gille , chairman of germany 's society for the health of women , said bravo plays an important role in the sexual education of germany 's 12- to 15-year-olds , particularly the lesser educated .
gille said the advice satisfies basic curiosities , but that many teenagers read bravo only for a short time and stop when they become more experienced . tanja reddig , a 17-year-old berlin student , said that she read dr. sommer when she was 12 and 13 and did n't see what the fuss was over the nudity . " you can be sexy here and you do n't get any problems , " she said .
" in america , they ca n't show bodies .
they must hide something .
some teenagers do n't want to ask their parents things , so they could write a letter to dr. sommer . " started by popular demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's youth seem concerned with balancing love and work dr. sommer began during the sexual revolution of 1969 .
bravo was then a strictly entertainment magazine , but its young readers nonetheless kept writing letters about love and sex . so editors figured such a column would increase their readership , according to antje pfeffer of the berlin-based archive of youth culture -lrb- archiv der jugendkulturen -rrb- , which has published a book about bravo 's 50 year history . " dr. sommer immediately was greeted as too open , " pfeffer said . some parents glued the dr. sommer pages together so their teenagers could n't read the column , others banned it from the house .
some schools confiscated it , and in communist east germany , many clamored for smuggled copies . but from the start , the column took its mission quite seriously .
the first dr. sommer , martin goldstein , recalled in the berlin archive 's book that he and his team of social workers , psychologists , sociologists , political scientists , family counselors and parents would spend hours going through letters : i have fallen in love with a sweet young boy .
if he would kiss me , i would be happy for my entire life .
how can i get him to do it ?
i see him almost every day and i already know his name .
but do n't tell me that i should talk to him .
janne , 14 the boys in our village seem to have no interest in us , no matter what we do . we do not know how we can get their attention .
ina , renate , anne and beate , 15 and 16 the team tried to respond in an encouraging , non-judgemental way .
but often , they wondered whether the teenagers had anyone else they could confide in .
they were shocked at how many letters were sent in - sometimes 3,000 to 5,000 a month . " we believed it was because young people wanted to be listened to , " goldstein recalled . evolving topics soon , they were dealing with much thornier issues , such as a 1988 letter titled " my mum 's boyfriend sexually abused me . " by the end of the 1980s , dr. sommer had become more mainstream , and answers seemed freer .
for instance , nicola , 15 , wrote in with the basic question , " how do i show him that i want more ? " the answer : tell him what you want .
or , just push his hand higher . von arx says many of the letters have not changed much over the years .
but recently she has seen more teenagers concerned that they wo n't get ahead in school because they are so distracted by lovesickness . she is often asked if the column is even necessary anymore . " people think our society is very sexualized , and naked bodies and sex are everywhere , and young people should know everything , " she said .

gille said the advice satisfies basic curiosities , but that many teenagers read bravo only for a short time and stop when they become more experienced . tanja reddig , a 17-year-old berlin student , said that she read dr. sommer when she was 12 and 13 and did n't see what the fuss was over the nudity . " you can be sexy here and you do n't get any problems , " she said .
" in america , they ca n't show bodies .
they must hide something .
some teenagers do n't want to ask their parents things , so they could write a letter to dr. sommer . " started by popular demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's youth seem concerned with balancing love and work dr. sommer began during the sexual revolution of 1969 .
bravo was then a strictly entertainment magazine , but its young readers nonetheless kept writing letters about love and sex . so editors figured such a column would increase their readership , according to antje pfeffer of the berlin-based archive of youth culture -lrb- archiv der jugendkulturen -rrb- , which has published a book about bravo 's 50 year history . " dr. sommer immediately was greeted as too open , " pfeffer said . some parents glued the dr. sommer pages together so their teenagers could n't read the column , others banned it from the house .
some schools confiscated it , and in communist east germany , many clamored for smuggled copies . but from the start , the column took its mission quite seriously .
the first dr. sommer , martin goldstein , recalled in the berlin archive 's book that he and his team of social workers , psychologists , sociologists , political scientists , family counselors and parents would spend hours going through letters : i have fallen in love with a sweet young boy .
if he would kiss me , i would be happy for my entire life .

they were shocked at how many letters were sent in - sometimes 3,000 to 5,000 a month . " we believed it was because young people wanted to be listened to , " goldstein recalled . evolving topics soon , they were dealing with much thornier issues , such as a 1988 letter titled " my mum 's boyfriend sexually abused me .

for instance , nicola , 15 , wrote in with the basic question , " how do i show him that i want more ? " the answer : tell him what you want .
or , just push his hand higher . von arx says many of the letters have not changed much over the years .
but recently she has seen more teenagers concerned that they wo n't get ahead in school because they are so distracted by lovesickness . she is often asked if the column is even necessary anymore .

why does n't she like me ?
what is a condom ?
generations of confused german teenagers have turned to dr. sommer for honesty - and explicit photos . sandra , 16 , looks up coyly from the pages of bravo , wearing a black choker and nothing else .
boyfriend elias , 18 , grins from the opposite page , also in his natural state . " tell me , why do you love each other ? " reads the headline .
and the young couple tells why - and exactly how . sell this in america , and risk prison time for child pornography . but in germany , this is nothing tawdry . it 's the country 's most popular teenage magazine , and it turns 50 on saturday . sandra and elias ' graphic spread is in the same issue as a free sheet of fake tattoos , a feature about harry potter , and an exclusive report on tokio hotel , the german boy band currently making girls swoon . a german institution since 1969 , dr. sommer combines no-holds-barred sex advice with full-frontal photos . it highlights a basic cultural divide between germany and many other countries - of how openly sex is discussed , especially among youth . " it is not pornography , " says bravo 's deputy editor , alex gernandt .
" it deals with naked people , but in a very sensitive way .
we try to portray young people to tell readers , ' you are not too fat , not too thin .
you are ok the way you are . ' " there are a lot less teenage pregnancies in germany in comparison to the united kingdom or the us , and i think bravo has its share in that success , " gernandt said . breaking taboos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was seduced at 14 , " kristijan says the current dr. sommer , eveline von arx , credits the column with germany 's free sexual attitudes . when it began in 1969 , " dr. sommer really broke taboos , and it was really spectacular to do something like that , " said von arx , who has been writing the column for three years .
" it 's not that spectacular anymore .
people are used to it .
everybody knows it . " each weekly issue of bravo now features photos of two teenagers , generally between 16 and 20 , in the nude , with interviews about their bodies and experiences . anyone under 18 , like sandra , must have his or her parents ' permission to appear . they are paid 400 euros -lrb- a little more than $ 500 -rrb- to pose , and many report the experience is a self-esteem boost , von arx said . weekly letters range from " my boyfriend is once again interested in his former girlfriend " to " everybody 's had sex , only i have n't . "
sample answer : " nowhere does it say that youth have to have sex by a certain time … talk to your boyfriend about it .
tell him how you feel . " " you can be sexy here " bravo 's web site even features explicit petting and positions photo galleries that would n't last a day in other countries . the magazine publishes its eastern european editions with little to no nudity .
but in germany , even teachers and religious leaders seem to welcome the column .
von arx has spoken in schools and was even invited as a youth expert to a big evangelical christian conference last year . gisela gille , chairman of germany 's society for the health of women , said bravo plays an important role in the sexual education of germany 's 12- to 15-year-olds , particularly the lesser educated .

many of the demonstrators were members of berlin 's jewish community or the conservative christian democrats . however , there were some there who belonged to the far-left and sported all the accoutrements of those who are known as autonomen in germany - black clothing , buttons or patches with political slogans or insignia , and often scarves , sunglasses or baseball caps to make them harder to identify . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators often clash with police but this time they had n't come to disrupt the demonstration , shout out anti-zionist slogans or get into tussles with police , as they often do .
the group of anti-germans had actually organized the demonstration under the slogan " unconditional solidarity with israel , " one of the core positions of their movement . such a stance puts the group firmly at odds with the majority viewpoint of germany 's far-left movement , which since the 1970s has been overwhelmingly pro-palestinian and very critical of israeli policy .
completing the philosophical break is the support of many anti-germans for us president george w. bush , who for the traditional far left is anathema . " it has to do with george w. bush 's conception for a new middle east , which is essentially supported , " said rüdiger göbel , deputy editor-in-chief of junge welt , a left-wing daily based in berlin .

" the anti-german movement can be traced back to the fall of the berlin wall , where some on the far left demonstrated against reunification , warning that a stronger germany could result in a new militarism and even a " fourth reich .

" so -lrb- anti-germans -rrb- act according to the motto : the enemy of my enemy is my friend .

most call themselves communists , yet loudly proclaim their support for israel and george w. bush . when it comes to the anti-germans , the political big tent theory appears to have become fact : groups that generally ca n't bear to be in the same room sometimes unite for a common cause . that was on show recently in western berlin , where thousands had gathered to show their support for israel during the recent conflict with hezbollah militants in lebanon .
many of the demonstrators were members of berlin 's jewish community or the conservative christian democrats . however , there were some there who belonged to the far-left and sported all the accoutrements of those who are known as autonomen in germany - black clothing , buttons or patches with political slogans or insignia , and often scarves , sunglasses or baseball caps to make them harder to identify . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators often clash with police but this time they had n't come to disrupt the demonstration , shout out anti-zionist slogans or get into tussles with police , as they often do .
the group of anti-germans had actually organized the demonstration under the slogan " unconditional solidarity with israel , " one of the core positions of their movement . such a stance puts the group firmly at odds with the majority viewpoint of germany 's far-left movement , which since the 1970s has been overwhelmingly pro-palestinian and very critical of israeli policy .
completing the philosophical break is the support of many anti-germans for us president george w. bush , who for the traditional far left is anathema . " it has to do with george w. bush 's conception for a new middle east , which is essentially supported , " said rüdiger göbel , deputy editor-in-chief of junge welt , a left-wing daily based in berlin .
" the anti-germans are actually closer to the neo-conservatives in the united states . " fighting a " new fascism " to many observers , the anti-germans are a conundrum .
most consider themselves communists , but according to a study carried out by patrick hagen at the university of cologne , they " have abandoned almost all of the essentials of the communist movement and the left , such as the positive relations to the working class , anti-imperialism and anti-racism which has led to a deep split within the extra-parliamentary left . " the anti-german movement can be traced back to the fall of the berlin wall , where some on the far left demonstrated against reunification , warning that a stronger germany could result in a new militarism and even a " fourth reich . "
they based their slogan on the phrase often used in holocaust remembrance ceremonies : " never again . "
the anti-germans went further , rallying around " germany , never again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators at a anti-nazi rally as time went on , the group began to show more support for the united states .
in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of the destruction of dresden by the allies , the anti-germans praised the bombing of the civil population , since in their view , so many of them had supported the nazi regime . but the movement really got behind the stars and stripes after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , which they saw as anti-semitic and targeted at israel .
to them , it marked the rise of a new type of fascism .
this time is was n't from the far right , but from radical islam and it had to be fought .
the us , in their eyes , was the only one willing to fight it . " islamic terrorists and states such as syria and iran want to liquidate israel , " said hermann gremliza , publisher of the leftist magazine konkret and one of the leading figures in the anti-german movement , in an e-mail response .
" so -lrb- anti-germans -rrb- act according to the motto : the enemy of my enemy is my friend . " just after the war in iraq broke out in 2003 , the anti-german magazine bahamas wrote an editorial entitled " bush - the man of peace ! " whose side are they on ? these kinds of positions have put the group in sometimes violent opposition to the traditional far left .
when anti-germans show up at left-wing demonstrations with signs supporting american policy or israel , they are generally not welcomed warmly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would che have supported george w. bush ?
" whoever carries an israeli flag is insulted and spit upon , " gremliza said .
" but what do you expect , we 're in germany . " the traditional far left accuses the anti-germans of getting in bed with the bourgeoisie .
some writers in the anti-german camp even write occasionally for the online site of the newsmagazine der spiegel or even such bastions of conservatism as the daily die welt . observers say that means they have an influence beyond their actual numbers , which are estimated between 500 and 3,000 .
gremliza , however , said around 50,000 people read his magazine konkret . anti-german goals , he says , are to uncover what group members see as the hypocrisy of a german foreign policy that has been harmful to israel and helped the rise of a new " islamic " fascism , which they see as a direct descendent of the form practiced by the nazis . " germany wants an alliance with the islamic world - against the us , " he said , despite angela merkel 's close ties to her american counterpart .

why does n't she like me ?
what is a condom ?
generations of confused german teenagers have turned to dr. sommer for honesty - and explicit photos . sandra , 16 , looks up coyly from the pages of bravo , wearing a black choker and nothing else .
boyfriend elias , 18 , grins from the opposite page , also in his natural state . " tell me , why do you love each other ? " reads the headline .
and the young couple tells why - and exactly how . sell this in america , and risk prison time for child pornography . but in germany , this is nothing tawdry . it 's the country 's most popular teenage magazine , and it turns 50 on saturday . sandra and elias ' graphic spread is in the same issue as a free sheet of fake tattoos , a feature about harry potter , and an exclusive report on tokio hotel , the german boy band currently making girls swoon . a german institution since 1969 , dr. sommer combines no-holds-barred sex advice with full-frontal photos . it highlights a basic cultural divide between germany and many other countries - of how openly sex is discussed , especially among youth . " it is not pornography , " says bravo 's deputy editor , alex gernandt .
" it deals with naked people , but in a very sensitive way .
we try to portray young people to tell readers , ' you are not too fat , not too thin .
you are ok the way you are . ' " there are a lot less teenage pregnancies in germany in comparison to the united kingdom or the us , and i think bravo has its share in that success , " gernandt said . breaking taboos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was seduced at 14 , " kristijan says the current dr. sommer , eveline von arx , credits the column with germany 's free sexual attitudes . when it began in 1969 , " dr. sommer really broke taboos , and it was really spectacular to do something like that , " said von arx , who has been writing the column for three years .
" it 's not that spectacular anymore .
people are used to it .
everybody knows it . " each weekly issue of bravo now features photos of two teenagers , generally between 16 and 20 , in the nude , with interviews about their bodies and experiences . anyone under 18 , like sandra , must have his or her parents ' permission to appear . they are paid 400 euros -lrb- a little more than $ 500 -rrb- to pose , and many report the experience is a self-esteem boost , von arx said . weekly letters range from " my boyfriend is once again interested in his former girlfriend " to " everybody 's had sex , only i have n't . "
sample answer : " nowhere does it say that youth have to have sex by a certain time … talk to your boyfriend about it .
tell him how you feel . " " you can be sexy here " bravo 's web site even features explicit petting and positions photo galleries that would n't last a day in other countries . the magazine publishes its eastern european editions with little to no nudity .
but in germany , even teachers and religious leaders seem to welcome the column .
von arx has spoken in schools and was even invited as a youth expert to a big evangelical christian conference last year . gisela gille , chairman of germany 's society for the health of women , said bravo plays an important role in the sexual education of germany 's 12- to 15-year-olds , particularly the lesser educated .
gille said the advice satisfies basic curiosities , but that many teenagers read bravo only for a short time and stop when they become more experienced . tanja reddig , a 17-year-old berlin student , said that she read dr. sommer when she was 12 and 13 and did n't see what the fuss was over the nudity . " you can be sexy here and you do n't get any problems , " she said .
" in america , they ca n't show bodies .
they must hide something .
some teenagers do n't want to ask their parents things , so they could write a letter to dr. sommer . " started by popular demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's youth seem concerned with balancing love and work dr. sommer began during the sexual revolution of 1969 .
bravo was then a strictly entertainment magazine , but its young readers nonetheless kept writing letters about love and sex . so editors figured such a column would increase their readership , according to antje pfeffer of the berlin-based archive of youth culture -lrb- archiv der jugendkulturen -rrb- , which has published a book about bravo 's 50 year history . " dr. sommer immediately was greeted as too open , " pfeffer said . some parents glued the dr. sommer pages together so their teenagers could n't read the column , others banned it from the house .
some schools confiscated it , and in communist east germany , many clamored for smuggled copies . but from the start , the column took its mission quite seriously .
the first dr. sommer , martin goldstein , recalled in the berlin archive 's book that he and his team of social workers , psychologists , sociologists , political scientists , family counselors and parents would spend hours going through letters : i have fallen in love with a sweet young boy .

why does n't she like me ?
what is a condom ?
generations of confused german teenagers have turned to dr. sommer for honesty - and explicit photos . sandra , 16 , looks up coyly from the pages of bravo , wearing a black choker and nothing else .
boyfriend elias , 18 , grins from the opposite page , also in his natural state . " tell me , why do you love each other ? " reads the headline .
and the young couple tells why - and exactly how . sell this in america , and risk prison time for child pornography . but in germany , this is nothing tawdry . it 's the country 's most popular teenage magazine , and it turns 50 on saturday . sandra and elias ' graphic spread is in the same issue as a free sheet of fake tattoos , a feature about harry potter , and an exclusive report on tokio hotel , the german boy band currently making girls swoon . a german institution since 1969 , dr. sommer combines no-holds-barred sex advice with full-frontal photos . it highlights a basic cultural divide between germany and many other countries - of how openly sex is discussed , especially among youth . " it is not pornography , " says bravo 's deputy editor , alex gernandt .
" it deals with naked people , but in a very sensitive way .
we try to portray young people to tell readers , ' you are not too fat , not too thin .
you are ok the way you are . ' " there are a lot less teenage pregnancies in germany in comparison to the united kingdom or the us , and i think bravo has its share in that success , " gernandt said . breaking taboos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was seduced at 14 , " kristijan says the current dr. sommer , eveline von arx , credits the column with germany 's free sexual attitudes . when it began in 1969 , " dr. sommer really broke taboos , and it was really spectacular to do something like that , " said von arx , who has been writing the column for three years .
" it 's not that spectacular anymore .
people are used to it .
everybody knows it . " each weekly issue of bravo now features photos of two teenagers , generally between 16 and 20 , in the nude , with interviews about their bodies and experiences . anyone under 18 , like sandra , must have his or her parents ' permission to appear . they are paid 400 euros -lrb- a little more than $ 500 -rrb- to pose , and many report the experience is a self-esteem boost , von arx said . weekly letters range from " my boyfriend is once again interested in his former girlfriend " to " everybody 's had sex , only i have n't . "
sample answer : " nowhere does it say that youth have to have sex by a certain time … talk to your boyfriend about it .
tell him how you feel . " " you can be sexy here " bravo 's web site even features explicit petting and positions photo galleries that would n't last a day in other countries . the magazine publishes its eastern european editions with little to no nudity .
but in germany , even teachers and religious leaders seem to welcome the column .
von arx has spoken in schools and was even invited as a youth expert to a big evangelical christian conference last year . gisela gille , chairman of germany 's society for the health of women , said bravo plays an important role in the sexual education of germany 's 12- to 15-year-olds , particularly the lesser educated .
gille said the advice satisfies basic curiosities , but that many teenagers read bravo only for a short time and stop when they become more experienced . tanja reddig , a 17-year-old berlin student , said that she read dr. sommer when she was 12 and 13 and did n't see what the fuss was over the nudity . " you can be sexy here and you do n't get any problems , " she said .
" in america , they ca n't show bodies .
they must hide something .
some teenagers do n't want to ask their parents things , so they could write a letter to dr. sommer . " started by popular demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's youth seem concerned with balancing love and work dr. sommer began during the sexual revolution of 1969 .
bravo was then a strictly entertainment magazine , but its young readers nonetheless kept writing letters about love and sex . so editors figured such a column would increase their readership , according to antje pfeffer of the berlin-based archive of youth culture -lrb- archiv der jugendkulturen -rrb- , which has published a book about bravo 's 50 year history . " dr. sommer immediately was greeted as too open , " pfeffer said . some parents glued the dr. sommer pages together so their teenagers could n't read the column , others banned it from the house .
some schools confiscated it , and in communist east germany , many clamored for smuggled copies . but from the start , the column took its mission quite seriously .
the first dr. sommer , martin goldstein , recalled in the berlin archive 's book that he and his team of social workers , psychologists , sociologists , political scientists , family counselors and parents would spend hours going through letters : i have fallen in love with a sweet young boy .
if he would kiss me , i would be happy for my entire life .
how can i get him to do it ?
i see him almost every day and i already know his name .
but do n't tell me that i should talk to him .

few come to see a 44-year-old naked homeless woman washing herself .
but the city just ca n't stop bille taking off her clothes in public . tourists traveling around germany find it hard to resist munich .
the bavarian capital has a multitude of cultural attractions to offer , a wealth of history and a reputation for high living , beer drinking and careless abandon . however , despite being one of the most visited cities in germany , the munich local authorities are concerned that a not-so-small problem may be damaging the city 's reputation among visitors .

the source gave no further details . second suspect questioned in lebanon meanwhile , investigators are hoping that more of their questions about the plot will be answered following hamad 's interrogation , at which officials from germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- are present . " we 're confident that he will break his silence and that we 'll know much more later in the day , " bka president jörg ziercke told public broadcaster ard on friday morning . both hamad and el hajdib were identified on security camera footage dragging suitcases loaded with crudely made bombs onto trains in cologne . did they have help ? while investigators and political leaders have been pleased about the quick succession of arrests , big questions remain about the case , including whether the men were working alone or had the support of a terrorist network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziercke says it 's too early to say if the men belong to an international terrorist network ziercke said it is still too early to say if they belonged to an international network . " we assume that this concerns a terrorist group here in germany , which is also the view of the federal prosecutors , " he told german broadcaster n-tv . " we know that the suspects had accomplices .
at the moment we 're trying to determine whether this was an international network or if it was an autonomous terrorist group in germany . " german terror expert , elmar thevessen , has pointed out that hamad and el hajdib lived hundreds of miles apart , raising the question of how they were able to communicate and gain each other 's trust .
according to testimony from el hajdib , the two men first met in germany . " we know from jihad hamad , who gave himself up , that he only arrived in cologne in february of this year , just five months before the crime , " thevessen said .
" where did the contacts come from and how could he so quickly get himself set up to prepare an attack that almost succeeded ? " searches of hamad 's apartment have turned up damning evidence , including dna that matches that on the suitcases , as well as receipts for the gas canister and gas used in the failed plot . the plot has reminded germans that they are not immune to international terrorism .
wolfgang bosbach , a domestic policy expert for berlin 's conservative cdu / csu parliamentary group , has warned that there are an estimated 32,000 islamists in germany and some 3,000 of these were considered extremists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.08.2006 fighting terrorism at the eu level großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol began focusing on anti-terror measures after the 9/11 attacks observers of the debate in germany on the pros and cons of a nation-wide anti-terror register say the question is when , not if , such a database will be created .
it 's expected to aid anti-terror measures at the eu-level . when germany 's anti-terror register finally comes into being , it wo n't just make things easier for german officials - it will also improve cooperation with the european police force , europol , which is already working on an eu-wide counter-terrorism database . at its headquarters in the hague , europol has computers where eu member states can save names and relevant details about terrorist suspects or witnesses .
additionally , the databanks contain information on organized crime , drug smuggling and human trafficking .
the computer system , tecs , can compare and analyze as many as a million data sets . the data is entered into the system directly by the 25 eu member states .
each country is represented by its own liaison officer , or elos , in the hague .
as a rule , only these liaison officers have access to the national databanks . if a member state wants to find out whether there is information in tecs on a terror suspect , europol puts together an information packet - a service that europol 's director , max-peter ratzel , is intent on putting first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol director max-peter ratzel " terrorism is , of course , very much in the foreground , because that 's where the biggest risks lie , " ratzel said .
" we have to do everything possible in order to identify and eliminate threats , so that we can offer member states the means to avoid danger .
we only need a few people to filter out the right information ; the member states are then responsible for acting on that information . " privacy advocates are critical though , about the fact that the member states can relatively freely feed data into tecs which is then consolidated into suspect profiles .
tecs saves the data for a period of at least three years . europol got its start in the mid-90s as an agency to fight drugs-related crime .
gradually , it 's grown into an institution with a staff of 500 whose main task is to organize information exchanges . other eu networks in addition to europol 's databanks , five of the largest eu states - france , britain , italy , spain and germany - share a computer network aimed at fighting terrorism .
seven states - france , spain , the netherlands , belgium , luxembourg , austria and germany - have also signed a pact to improve cross-border cooperation of their police forces when it comes to the arrest , search and trailing of suspects . but cross-border cooperation of police is by no means comprehensively regulated across the eu , and many states have misgivings .
eu commissioner for justice and security franco frattini has been pushing for stronger cooperation , and is hopeful progress will be made given the current threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following the foiled plot to blow up planes flying from britain to the us , germany is again focused on security for air and rail passengers " there is now , i think , a consensus among the member states that it 's important to really work together , " frattini said .
" we have to stay on the ball . " a directive by the eu 's interior ministry to retain internet and phone data to aid police investigations is , after the introduction of europe-wide arrest warrants , a necessary step , frattini said .
he is also working on other legislative measures to put on the table by the end of this year .
the eu would like to introduce tougher controls on the production and trade in explosives , for example .
it 's also looking into why and how muslim youths in europe are being radicalized . personal freedom still a concern frattini stresses that civil liberties should not be sacrificed in the drive for better protection from terrorists .
in this respect , he said , the united states with its far-reaching curtailments on telecommunications secrecy is no role model for the eu . " this is our political challenge , " frattini said . "
if terrorists force us to restrict our freedom , then the terrorists win .
we can never allow that to happen . " although much has been achieved when it comes to improving police cooperation at the european level , the eu 's anti-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries bemoans the fact that in some areas , progress has been too slow .
he said he is hopeful that eu interior ministers will eventually give up their opposition to majority-rules decisions at the european level . " there 's a lot of demand for the eu to help its member states more effectively , " de vries said .
" i hope that the discussion about a transition from unanimous to majority decisions will be a motivating factor to do more than we have in the past .

it 's expected to aid anti-terror measures at the eu-level . when germany 's anti-terror register finally comes into being , it wo n't just make things easier for german officials - it will also improve cooperation with the european police force , europol , which is already working on an eu-wide counter-terrorism database . at its headquarters in the hague , europol has computers where eu member states can save names and relevant details about terrorist suspects or witnesses .
additionally , the databanks contain information on organized crime , drug smuggling and human trafficking .
the computer system , tecs , can compare and analyze as many as a million data sets . the data is entered into the system directly by the 25 eu member states .
each country is represented by its own liaison officer , or elos , in the hague .
as a rule , only these liaison officers have access to the national databanks . if a member state wants to find out whether there is information in tecs on a terror suspect , europol puts together an information packet - a service that europol 's director , max-peter ratzel , is intent on putting first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol director max-peter ratzel " terrorism is , of course , very much in the foreground , because that 's where the biggest risks lie , " ratzel said .
" we have to do everything possible in order to identify and eliminate threats , so that we can offer member states the means to avoid danger .
we only need a few people to filter out the right information ; the member states are then responsible for acting on that information . " privacy advocates are critical though , about the fact that the member states can relatively freely feed data into tecs which is then consolidated into suspect profiles .
tecs saves the data for a period of at least three years . europol got its start in the mid-90s as an agency to fight drugs-related crime .
gradually , it 's grown into an institution with a staff of 500 whose main task is to organize information exchanges . other eu networks in addition to europol 's databanks , five of the largest eu states - france , britain , italy , spain and germany - share a computer network aimed at fighting terrorism .
seven states - france , spain , the netherlands , belgium , luxembourg , austria and germany - have also signed a pact to improve cross-border cooperation of their police forces when it comes to the arrest , search and trailing of suspects . but cross-border cooperation of police is by no means comprehensively regulated across the eu , and many states have misgivings .
eu commissioner for justice and security franco frattini has been pushing for stronger cooperation , and is hopeful progress will be made given the current threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following the foiled plot to blow up planes flying from britain to the us , germany is again focused on security for air and rail passengers " there is now , i think , a consensus among the member states that it 's important to really work together , " frattini said .
" we have to stay on the ball . " a directive by the eu 's interior ministry to retain internet and phone data to aid police investigations is , after the introduction of europe-wide arrest warrants , a necessary step , frattini said .
he is also working on other legislative measures to put on the table by the end of this year .
the eu would like to introduce tougher controls on the production and trade in explosives , for example .
it 's also looking into why and how muslim youths in europe are being radicalized . personal freedom still a concern frattini stresses that civil liberties should not be sacrificed in the drive for better protection from terrorists .
in this respect , he said , the united states with its far-reaching curtailments on telecommunications secrecy is no role model for the eu . " this is our political challenge , " frattini said . "
if terrorists force us to restrict our freedom , then the terrorists win .
we can never allow that to happen . " although much has been achieved when it comes to improving police cooperation at the european level , the eu 's anti-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries bemoans the fact that in some areas , progress has been too slow .
he said he is hopeful that eu interior ministers will eventually give up their opposition to majority-rules decisions at the european level . " there 's a lot of demand for the eu to help its member states more effectively , " de vries said .

why does n't she like me ?
what is a condom ?
generations of confused german teenagers have turned to dr. sommer for honesty - and explicit photos . sandra , 16 , looks up coyly from the pages of bravo , wearing a black choker and nothing else .
boyfriend elias , 18 , grins from the opposite page , also in his natural state . " tell me , why do you love each other ? " reads the headline .
and the young couple tells why - and exactly how . sell this in america , and risk prison time for child pornography . but in germany , this is nothing tawdry . it 's the country 's most popular teenage magazine , and it turns 50 on saturday . sandra and elias ' graphic spread is in the same issue as a free sheet of fake tattoos , a feature about harry potter , and an exclusive report on tokio hotel , the german boy band currently making girls swoon . a german institution since 1969 , dr. sommer combines no-holds-barred sex advice with full-frontal photos . it highlights a basic cultural divide between germany and many other countries - of how openly sex is discussed , especially among youth . " it is not pornography , " says bravo 's deputy editor , alex gernandt .
" it deals with naked people , but in a very sensitive way .
we try to portray young people to tell readers , ' you are not too fat , not too thin .
you are ok the way you are . ' " there are a lot less teenage pregnancies in germany in comparison to the united kingdom or the us , and i think bravo has its share in that success , " gernandt said . breaking taboos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was seduced at 14 , " kristijan says the current dr. sommer , eveline von arx , credits the column with germany 's free sexual attitudes . when it began in 1969 , " dr. sommer really broke taboos , and it was really spectacular to do something like that , " said von arx , who has been writing the column for three years .
" it 's not that spectacular anymore .
people are used to it .
everybody knows it . " each weekly issue of bravo now features photos of two teenagers , generally between 16 and 20 , in the nude , with interviews about their bodies and experiences . anyone under 18 , like sandra , must have his or her parents ' permission to appear . they are paid 400 euros -lrb- a little more than $ 500 -rrb- to pose , and many report the experience is a self-esteem boost , von arx said . weekly letters range from " my boyfriend is once again interested in his former girlfriend " to " everybody 's had sex , only i have n't . "
sample answer : " nowhere does it say that youth have to have sex by a certain time … talk to your boyfriend about it .
tell him how you feel . " " you can be sexy here " bravo 's web site even features explicit petting and positions photo galleries that would n't last a day in other countries . the magazine publishes its eastern european editions with little to no nudity .
but in germany , even teachers and religious leaders seem to welcome the column .
von arx has spoken in schools and was even invited as a youth expert to a big evangelical christian conference last year . gisela gille , chairman of germany 's society for the health of women , said bravo plays an important role in the sexual education of germany 's 12- to 15-year-olds , particularly the lesser educated .
gille said the advice satisfies basic curiosities , but that many teenagers read bravo only for a short time and stop when they become more experienced . tanja reddig , a 17-year-old berlin student , said that she read dr. sommer when she was 12 and 13 and did n't see what the fuss was over the nudity . " you can be sexy here and you do n't get any problems , " she said .
" in america , they ca n't show bodies .
they must hide something .
some teenagers do n't want to ask their parents things , so they could write a letter to dr. sommer . " started by popular demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's youth seem concerned with balancing love and work dr. sommer began during the sexual revolution of 1969 .
bravo was then a strictly entertainment magazine , but its young readers nonetheless kept writing letters about love and sex . so editors figured such a column would increase their readership , according to antje pfeffer of the berlin-based archive of youth culture -lrb- archiv der jugendkulturen -rrb- , which has published a book about bravo 's 50 year history . " dr. sommer immediately was greeted as too open , " pfeffer said . some parents glued the dr. sommer pages together so their teenagers could n't read the column , others banned it from the house .
some schools confiscated it , and in communist east germany , many clamored for smuggled copies . but from the start , the column took its mission quite seriously .
the first dr. sommer , martin goldstein , recalled in the berlin archive 's book that he and his team of social workers , psychologists , sociologists , political scientists , family counselors and parents would spend hours going through letters : i have fallen in love with a sweet young boy .
if he would kiss me , i would be happy for my entire life .
how can i get him to do it ?
i see him almost every day and i already know his name .
but do n't tell me that i should talk to him .
janne , 14 the boys in our village seem to have no interest in us , no matter what we do . we do not know how we can get their attention .
ina , renate , anne and beate , 15 and 16 the team tried to respond in an encouraging , non-judgemental way .
but often , they wondered whether the teenagers had anyone else they could confide in .
they were shocked at how many letters were sent in - sometimes 3,000 to 5,000 a month . " we believed it was because young people wanted to be listened to , " goldstein recalled . evolving topics soon , they were dealing with much thornier issues , such as a 1988 letter titled " my mum 's boyfriend sexually abused me . " by the end of the 1980s , dr. sommer had become more mainstream , and answers seemed freer .
for instance , nicola , 15 , wrote in with the basic question , " how do i show him that i want more ? " the answer : tell him what you want .
or , just push his hand higher . von arx says many of the letters have not changed much over the years .
but recently she has seen more teenagers concerned that they wo n't get ahead in school because they are so distracted by lovesickness . she is often asked if the column is even necessary anymore . " people think our society is very sexualized , and naked bodies and sex are everywhere , and young people should know everything , " she said .
" but they do n't know anything sometimes .

and the young couple tells why - and exactly how . sell this in america , and risk prison time for child pornography . but in germany , this is nothing tawdry . it 's the country 's most popular teenage magazine , and it turns 50 on saturday . sandra and elias ' graphic spread is in the same issue as a free sheet of fake tattoos , a feature about harry potter , and an exclusive report on tokio hotel , the german boy band currently making girls swoon . a german institution since 1969 , dr. sommer combines no-holds-barred sex advice with full-frontal photos . it highlights a basic cultural divide between germany and many other countries - of how openly sex is discussed , especially among youth . " it is not pornography , " says bravo 's deputy editor , alex gernandt .
" it deals with naked people , but in a very sensitive way .
we try to portray young people to tell readers , ' you are not too fat , not too thin .
you are ok the way you are . ' " there are a lot less teenage pregnancies in germany in comparison to the united kingdom or the us , and i think bravo has its share in that success , " gernandt said . breaking taboos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was seduced at 14 , " kristijan says the current dr. sommer , eveline von arx , credits the column with germany 's free sexual attitudes . when it began in 1969 , " dr. sommer really broke taboos , and it was really spectacular to do something like that , " said von arx , who has been writing the column for three years .
" it 's not that spectacular anymore .
people are used to it .
everybody knows it . " each weekly issue of bravo now features photos of two teenagers , generally between 16 and 20 , in the nude , with interviews about their bodies and experiences . anyone under 18 , like sandra , must have his or her parents ' permission to appear . they are paid 400 euros -lrb- a little more than $ 500 -rrb- to pose , and many report the experience is a self-esteem boost , von arx said . weekly letters range from " my boyfriend is once again interested in his former girlfriend " to " everybody 's had sex , only i have n't . "
sample answer : " nowhere does it say that youth have to have sex by a certain time … talk to your boyfriend about it .
tell him how you feel . " " you can be sexy here " bravo 's web site even features explicit petting and positions photo galleries that would n't last a day in other countries . the magazine publishes its eastern european editions with little to no nudity .
but in germany , even teachers and religious leaders seem to welcome the column .
von arx has spoken in schools and was even invited as a youth expert to a big evangelical christian conference last year . gisela gille , chairman of germany 's society for the health of women , said bravo plays an important role in the sexual education of germany 's 12- to 15-year-olds , particularly the lesser educated .
gille said the advice satisfies basic curiosities , but that many teenagers read bravo only for a short time and stop when they become more experienced . tanja reddig , a 17-year-old berlin student , said that she read dr. sommer when she was 12 and 13 and did n't see what the fuss was over the nudity . " you can be sexy here and you do n't get any problems , " she said .
" in america , they ca n't show bodies .
they must hide something .
some teenagers do n't want to ask their parents things , so they could write a letter to dr. sommer . " started by popular demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's youth seem concerned with balancing love and work dr. sommer began during the sexual revolution of 1969 .
bravo was then a strictly entertainment magazine , but its young readers nonetheless kept writing letters about love and sex . so editors figured such a column would increase their readership , according to antje pfeffer of the berlin-based archive of youth culture -lrb- archiv der jugendkulturen -rrb- , which has published a book about bravo 's 50 year history . " dr. sommer immediately was greeted as too open , " pfeffer said . some parents glued the dr. sommer pages together so their teenagers could n't read the column , others banned it from the house .
some schools confiscated it , and in communist east germany , many clamored for smuggled copies . but from the start , the column took its mission quite seriously .
the first dr. sommer , martin goldstein , recalled in the berlin archive 's book that he and his team of social workers , psychologists , sociologists , political scientists , family counselors and parents would spend hours going through letters : i have fallen in love with a sweet young boy .
if he would kiss me , i would be happy for my entire life .
how can i get him to do it ?
i see him almost every day and i already know his name .
but do n't tell me that i should talk to him .
janne , 14 the boys in our village seem to have no interest in us , no matter what we do . we do not know how we can get their attention .
ina , renate , anne and beate , 15 and 16 the team tried to respond in an encouraging , non-judgemental way .
but often , they wondered whether the teenagers had anyone else they could confide in .
they were shocked at how many letters were sent in - sometimes 3,000 to 5,000 a month . " we believed it was because young people wanted to be listened to , " goldstein recalled . evolving topics soon , they were dealing with much thornier issues , such as a 1988 letter titled " my mum 's boyfriend sexually abused me . " by the end of the 1980s , dr. sommer had become more mainstream , and answers seemed freer .
for instance , nicola , 15 , wrote in with the basic question , " how do i show him that i want more ? " the answer : tell him what you want .
or , just push his hand higher . von arx says many of the letters have not changed much over the years .
but recently she has seen more teenagers concerned that they wo n't get ahead in school because they are so distracted by lovesickness . she is often asked if the column is even necessary anymore . " people think our society is very sexualized , and naked bodies and sex are everywhere , and young people should know everything , " she said .

" each weekly issue of bravo now features photos of two teenagers , generally between 16 and 20 , in the nude , with interviews about their bodies and experiences . anyone under 18 , like sandra , must have his or her parents ' permission to appear . they are paid 400 euros -lrb- a little more than $ 500 -rrb- to pose , and many report the experience is a self-esteem boost , von arx said . weekly letters range from " my boyfriend is once again interested in his former girlfriend " to " everybody 's had sex , only i have n't . "
sample answer : " nowhere does it say that youth have to have sex by a certain time … talk to your boyfriend about it .
tell him how you feel . " " you can be sexy here " bravo 's web site even features explicit petting and positions photo galleries that would n't last a day in other countries . the magazine publishes its eastern european editions with little to no nudity .
but in germany , even teachers and religious leaders seem to welcome the column .
von arx has spoken in schools and was even invited as a youth expert to a big evangelical christian conference last year . gisela gille , chairman of germany 's society for the health of women , said bravo plays an important role in the sexual education of germany 's 12- to 15-year-olds , particularly the lesser educated .
gille said the advice satisfies basic curiosities , but that many teenagers read bravo only for a short time and stop when they become more experienced . tanja reddig , a 17-year-old berlin student , said that she read dr. sommer when she was 12 and 13 and did n't see what the fuss was over the nudity . " you can be sexy here and you do n't get any problems , " she said .
" in america , they ca n't show bodies .
they must hide something .
some teenagers do n't want to ask their parents things , so they could write a letter to dr. sommer . " started by popular demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's youth seem concerned with balancing love and work dr. sommer began during the sexual revolution of 1969 .
bravo was then a strictly entertainment magazine , but its young readers nonetheless kept writing letters about love and sex . so editors figured such a column would increase their readership , according to antje pfeffer of the berlin-based archive of youth culture -lrb- archiv der jugendkulturen -rrb- , which has published a book about bravo 's 50 year history . " dr. sommer immediately was greeted as too open , " pfeffer said . some parents glued the dr. sommer pages together so their teenagers could n't read the column , others banned it from the house .
some schools confiscated it , and in communist east germany , many clamored for smuggled copies . but from the start , the column took its mission quite seriously .
the first dr. sommer , martin goldstein , recalled in the berlin archive 's book that he and his team of social workers , psychologists , sociologists , political scientists , family counselors and parents would spend hours going through letters : i have fallen in love with a sweet young boy .
if he would kiss me , i would be happy for my entire life .
how can i get him to do it ?
i see him almost every day and i already know his name .
but do n't tell me that i should talk to him .
janne , 14 the boys in our village seem to have no interest in us , no matter what we do . we do not know how we can get their attention .
ina , renate , anne and beate , 15 and 16 the team tried to respond in an encouraging , non-judgemental way .
but often , they wondered whether the teenagers had anyone else they could confide in .
they were shocked at how many letters were sent in - sometimes 3,000 to 5,000 a month . " we believed it was because young people wanted to be listened to , " goldstein recalled . evolving topics soon , they were dealing with much thornier issues , such as a 1988 letter titled " my mum 's boyfriend sexually abused me . " by the end of the 1980s , dr. sommer had become more mainstream , and answers seemed freer .
for instance , nicola , 15 , wrote in with the basic question , " how do i show him that i want more ? " the answer : tell him what you want .
or , just push his hand higher . von arx says many of the letters have not changed much over the years .
but recently she has seen more teenagers concerned that they wo n't get ahead in school because they are so distracted by lovesickness . she is often asked if the column is even necessary anymore . " people think our society is very sexualized , and naked bodies and sex are everywhere , and young people should know everything , " she said .
" but they do n't know anything sometimes .

" " we may have a unique opportunity to transform the cessation of hostilities into a durable ceasefire , " he added in brussels . the pledges came after france , which currently commands unifil , committed itself late thursday to a total deployment of 2,000 soldiers . but french president jacques chirac , who was speaking separately friday in paris , said a level of 15,000 troops was " excessive " and it made " no sense " to have such a large contingent alongside the lebanese army in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some un peacekeepers from france are already on the ground in lebanon in brussels though , finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said the total european contribution would be " something between 5,600 and 6,900 " soldiers , as well as air and naval assets . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy put the eu deployment at " 6,500 to 7,000 soldiers on the ground , which means that the spinal column of the reinforced unifil will be european . " the force is crucial to shoring up un resolution 1701 , which on august 14 brought an end to the 34-day conflict in lebanon between israel and hezbollah militants . annan said bangladesh , malaysia and indonesia had offered to participate in unifil - though israel has opposed contributions from those muslim countries because of an absence of diplomatic relations . the un chief also proposed that france see out its current term as commander of the force , which expires at the end of january , after which italy would take over .
italy is expected to supply up to 3,000 soldiers , which would make it the biggest contributor to the force . french role and reversal france , though , played a key role diplomatically in revamping the force , having co-authored the un resolution with the united states .
it also enjoys close relations with lebanon , a former protectorate .
douste-blazy said france had " absolutely " no problem with the change of command . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac , right , and angela merkel during a press conference in paris on friday chirac 's announcement that he was sending 1,600 more troops to lebanon came after international criticism over his initial , emergency deployment of just 200 soldiers to join the 200 already in unifil . a vanguard of 170 french reinforcements arrived in lebanon on friday , making france the only country so far to have actually sent troops .
chirac said he agreed to send the extra two battalions after winning a robust mandate for unifil and guarantees the force would be able to cope if hostilities flare up again . " i wonder how it would have been judged if i had raced off like a mad dog without thinking or securing minimum guarantees , " he said in paris . he also questioned the goal of boosting the force to 15,000 soldiers , calling that " a totally excessive figure " given lebanon 's relatively small size . other eu contributors the announcement of the french reinforcements spurred some of the other eu countries into firming up previously vague promises to contribute . spain was said to be ready to send 1,000 to 1,200 soldiers , substantially more than the 800 initially cited in media reports . poland 's private television station tvn24 reported foreign minister anna fotyga as saying warsaw 's total contribution would be around 500 troops which includes 214 already serving with unifil . belgian foreign minister guy verhofstadt said his country would provide 300 soldiers by late september or early october , with the possibility of adding nearly 100 more later .
" peace in the middle east is an absolute necessity , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland 's foreign minister erkki tuomioja , right , and german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier finland pledged 250 soldiers . britain 's europe minister geoff hoon said that while his country 's military - heavily deployed in iraq and afghanistan - was too stretched to send ground troops , it might supply " specialized " units . other countries , notably greece and latvia , have also indicated they could send soldiers , but no details were provided friday . germany , wary of potential confrontations with israelis because of its nazi past , is prepared to offer naval units , not troops , as is sweden . the force is also to help lebanon halt arms smuggling to hezbollah over the border with syria , considered a main sponsor of the lebanese militia , if beirut requests . syria is concerned at the deployment of foreign troops in lebanon - from which it was forced to withdraw its soldiers last year under un pressure led by france - and has cut power supplies to its neighbor and warned it may close the border . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french troops arrive in lebanon as part of unifil deployment following an initial deployment of engineers , more french troops arrived in lebanon friday as part of the pledged 2,000-strong contingent which would form part of a un force to maintain the current ceasefire .

most call themselves communists , yet loudly proclaim their support for israel and george w. bush . when it comes to the anti-germans , the political big tent theory appears to have become fact : groups that generally ca n't bear to be in the same room sometimes unite for a common cause . that was on show recently in western berlin , where thousands had gathered to show their support for israel during the recent conflict with hezbollah militants in lebanon .
many of the demonstrators were members of berlin 's jewish community or the conservative christian democrats . however , there were some there who belonged to the far-left and sported all the accoutrements of those who are known as autonomen in germany - black clothing , buttons or patches with political slogans or insignia , and often scarves , sunglasses or baseball caps to make them harder to identify . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators often clash with police but this time they had n't come to disrupt the demonstration , shout out anti-zionist slogans or get into tussles with police , as they often do .
the group of anti-germans had actually organized the demonstration under the slogan " unconditional solidarity with israel , " one of the core positions of their movement . such a stance puts the group firmly at odds with the majority viewpoint of germany 's far-left movement , which since the 1970s has been overwhelmingly pro-palestinian and very critical of israeli policy .
completing the philosophical break is the support of many anti-germans for us president george w. bush , who for the traditional far left is anathema .

most call themselves communists , yet loudly proclaim their support for israel and george w. bush . when it comes to the anti-germans , the political big tent theory appears to have become fact : groups that generally ca n't bear to be in the same room sometimes unite for a common cause . that was on show recently in western berlin , where thousands had gathered to show their support for israel during the recent conflict with hezbollah militants in lebanon .
many of the demonstrators were members of berlin 's jewish community or the conservative christian democrats . however , there were some there who belonged to the far-left and sported all the accoutrements of those who are known as autonomen in germany - black clothing , buttons or patches with political slogans or insignia , and often scarves , sunglasses or baseball caps to make them harder to identify . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators often clash with police but this time they had n't come to disrupt the demonstration , shout out anti-zionist slogans or get into tussles with police , as they often do .
the group of anti-germans had actually organized the demonstration under the slogan " unconditional solidarity with israel , " one of the core positions of their movement . such a stance puts the group firmly at odds with the majority viewpoint of germany 's far-left movement , which since the 1970s has been overwhelmingly pro-palestinian and very critical of israeli policy .
completing the philosophical break is the support of many anti-germans for us president george w. bush , who for the traditional far left is anathema . " it has to do with george w. bush 's conception for a new middle east , which is essentially supported , " said rüdiger göbel , deputy editor-in-chief of junge welt , a left-wing daily based in berlin .
" the anti-germans are actually closer to the neo-conservatives in the united states . " fighting a " new fascism " to many observers , the anti-germans are a conundrum .
most consider themselves communists , but according to a study carried out by patrick hagen at the university of cologne , they " have abandoned almost all of the essentials of the communist movement and the left , such as the positive relations to the working class , anti-imperialism and anti-racism which has led to a deep split within the extra-parliamentary left . " the anti-german movement can be traced back to the fall of the berlin wall , where some on the far left demonstrated against reunification , warning that a stronger germany could result in a new militarism and even a " fourth reich . "
they based their slogan on the phrase often used in holocaust remembrance ceremonies : " never again . "
the anti-germans went further , rallying around " germany , never again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators at a anti-nazi rally as time went on , the group began to show more support for the united states .
in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of the destruction of dresden by the allies , the anti-germans praised the bombing of the civil population , since in their view , so many of them had supported the nazi regime . but the movement really got behind the stars and stripes after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , which they saw as anti-semitic and targeted at israel .
to them , it marked the rise of a new type of fascism .
this time is was n't from the far right , but from radical islam and it had to be fought .
the us , in their eyes , was the only one willing to fight it . " islamic terrorists and states such as syria and iran want to liquidate israel , " said hermann gremliza , publisher of the leftist magazine konkret and one of the leading figures in the anti-german movement , in an e-mail response .
" so -lrb- anti-germans -rrb- act according to the motto : the enemy of my enemy is my friend . " just after the war in iraq broke out in 2003 , the anti-german magazine bahamas wrote an editorial entitled " bush - the man of peace ! " whose side are they on ? these kinds of positions have put the group in sometimes violent opposition to the traditional far left .
when anti-germans show up at left-wing demonstrations with signs supporting american policy or israel , they are generally not welcomed warmly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would che have supported george w. bush ?
" whoever carries an israeli flag is insulted and spit upon , " gremliza said .
" but what do you expect , we 're in germany . " the traditional far left accuses the anti-germans of getting in bed with the bourgeoisie .
some writers in the anti-german camp even write occasionally for the online site of the newsmagazine der spiegel or even such bastions of conservatism as the daily die welt . observers say that means they have an influence beyond their actual numbers , which are estimated between 500 and 3,000 .
gremliza , however , said around 50,000 people read his magazine konkret . anti-german goals , he says , are to uncover what group members see as the hypocrisy of a german foreign policy that has been harmful to israel and helped the rise of a new " islamic " fascism , which they see as a direct descendent of the form practiced by the nazis . " germany wants an alliance with the islamic world - against the us , " he said , despite angela merkel 's close ties to her american counterpart .

kurnaz will not attend as he is with his family and needs time to adjust to his freedom , he said . " he will undergo medical treatment and will not be appearing in public , " docke said .
" mr kurnaz has been through hell . " earlier , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said an agreement on the release of kurnaz had come after the successful conclusion of long negotiations between the us and german governments . no proof of terrorist activity kurnaz , dubbed the " bremen taliban " after the northern german city where he lived , was arrested in pakistan in late 2001 , and taken to guantanamo bay in 2002 on suspicion of having fought for al qaeda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allegations of torture at guantanamo bay have prompted widespread protest from human rights organizations a us court found allegations of kurnaz 's involvement in terrorist activities to be untrue .
his release follows months of talks between the us and german governments .
chancellor angela merkel reportedly brought up the issue when she met with president george w. bush in stralsund last month . kurnaz said he suffered abuse including sexual humiliation , water torture and the desecration of islam at guantanamo . according to reports in der spiegel , berlin has refused us requests that kurnaz be put under constant surveillance and his passport confiscated .
however , he will not be free to completely return to his old life .
prosecutors in bremen intend to investigate kurnaz on suspicion of involvement in a criminal network .
experts close to the case say kurnaz 's detention at guantanamo was unlawful . us and german intelligence concluded as early as 2002 that kurnaz had no connection to al qaeda , the taliban or any terrorist threat , said baher azmy , a seton hall law school professor who has represented kurnaz since mid-2004 . " the government 's evidence against kurnaz has ranged from incredibly tangential to at times preposterous , " azmy said in a statement .

" undoubtedly , the french decision will help boost european participation , " fuad siniora said in a statement .
" in turn , this will help speed up the formation of the international force , which along with the lebanese army , will protect civilians and achieve security and stability , " he said . the deployment of the french troops " helps strengthen stability in lebanon and allows the country to regain its territories through an israeli withdrawal and the extension of state authority over all territories , " he said . french general to retain command - for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french troops arrived in lebanon on friday the united nations announced thursday that french general alain pellegrini would keep command over the operation to monitor the tenuous ceasefire between israel and the lebanese shiite militia hezbollah . pellegrini , currently in command of the united nations interim force in lebanon , will retain his post after the force undergoes a robust expansion under a un resolution , a un spokesman said friday . " general alain pellegrini leads unifil and he will continue to do so " with the " very strong support " of secretary general kofi annan , un spokesman stephane dujarric told reporters . both france and italy have offered to command unifil , which faces the daunting task of policing the ceasefire between israel and the lebanese shiite militia hezbollah . the appointment of a commander of a un peacekeeping force is the responsibility of the secretary general .
kofi annan , speaking from brussels friday where eu ministers are meeting to thrash out details of the bloc 's deployment strategy , said that he expected to be able to announce the force 's " leadership this afternoon . " unifil to enforce ceasefire alongside lebanese terms of the august 14 truce between israel and hezbollah fighters were laid out in un security council resolution 1701 , under which lebanon was " to secure its borders and other entry points to prevent the entry in lebanon without its consent of arms . " lebanese troops have since deployed along the syrian border in the north and east of the country , military sources said . a reinforced unifil could help intercept arms shipments to hezbollah , the militant shiite group that captured two israeli soldiers on july 12 , sparking a massive riposte and 34 days of heavy fighting . france and italy leading eu efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unifil will be boosted but will not make its target , it seems france was criticized last week after it said that just 200 extra soldiers would join unifil , which was set up 28 years ago as a toothless observer force but which the un resolution aims to revamp into a more robust presence of 15,000 soldiers . at the request of britain , israel , lebanon and the united states , italy stepped forward and offered to lead the force , pledging a reported 3,000 soldiers . spain was prepared to commit a battalion of between 700 and 800 troops to the un force , military sources were quoted as saying by a news report late thursday . greece , finland , latvia , sweden and poland have also indicated they could send soldiers , prompting european commission chief jose manuel barroso to say thursday he was " confident that europe will provide the necessary support to expand the unifil . " eu will fail to meet 15,000-troop target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nations already have un troops in lebanon eu leaders have spoken about contributing 4,000 troops to unifil .
however , even if eu leaders on friday pledge several thousand soldiers , unifil will still be far short of the 15,000 target . deployment plans were complicated however , with threats by syria to close its border in the event of such a move by the un . following talks in helsinki with syrian counterpart walid muallem , finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja said : " they will close the frontier to all traffic " if un troops were posted on the lebanese side . syrian president bashar al-assad had already warned that such a deployment would represent a " hostile " position with regard to his country . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy sending signal to eu , us with lebanon offer as the eu struggles to gather military contributions for lebanon , italy has said it would lead the peacekeeping mission .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.08.2006 opinion : deficit-sinner germany mending its ways großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany may manage this year to keep its deficit down to the level required by the eu stability pact , which underpins the euro .
instead of raising taxes , however , it should reduce spending , says dw 's karl zawadzky . first the good news : germany managed to reduce its national deficit to 2.5 percent in the first half of this year .
the positive trend can be traced back to a broader economic upswing , which brought in increased tax revenues . the public deficit is n't likely to increase in the second half of 2006 , and germany may even finally be able to shed its stigma in the european union as the " stability pact rogue " - an image it had earned through several years of higher-than-permitted debt statistics .
the national deficit in the first half of 2005 was , for example , as high as 3.7 percent . according to figures released thursday by the federal statistical office , the national deficit in the first half of this year amounted to 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 35.8 billion -rrb- in real numbers , which is a good 12 billion euros less than during the same time frame last year . social security contributions , on the other hand , have remained stagnant due to only minimal changes in wages .
however , expenditures made by the government unemployment agencies this year dropped dramatically as a result of cutbacks . finance minister peer steinbrück , who bore the consequences of the political demise of his predecessor hans eichel , is reluctant to be too hasty in celebrating the success reports , lest he eat his words in just a few months ' time . tax hikes to maintain low deficit ? the government has emphasized that it will stick to its promise that , starting next year , germany 's national deficit will not exceed the maximum deficit agreed upon in the eu 's stability pact .
this contractual agreement stipulates that the deficit of all public budgets , including social security , may not exceed 3 percent of the country 's gross domestic product . thanks to positive market conditions in recent months and the higher tax revenues that resulted , germany wo n't violate the pact this year .
even a slight economic downturn will not prevent germany from meeting the deficit standard in the future . now for the not-so-good news : in order to keep the deficit within the limitations set by the stability pact , hefty tax hikes are necessary . at the beginning of 2007 , sales tax will be raised from 16 to 19 percent .
tax increases in other areas are planned as well , though they wo n't be quite as big as the sales tax hike . taken together , tax revenues are expected to increase by more than 20 billion euros per year , which will keep germany on the safe side as far as the stability pact criteria are concerned . cut spending instead of raising taxes however , burdening the taxpayers in order to meet eu deficit criteria is problematic . federal , state and local expenditures will continue to increase , even if only slightly .
market fluctuation aside , germany has a structural problem : germans pay more in tax and social contributions than those in other industrial countries . considerable reductions in spending - not another tax hike for the already burdened taxpayers - would be a better approach to trimming down the national deficit . karl zawadzky is deutsche welle 's chief business correspondent . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany up in arms over minister 's holiday comments germany 's finance minister has sparked outrage by suggesting germans should spend less on their annual holidays and instead put money aside for their old age .

instead of raising taxes , however , it should reduce spending , says dw 's karl zawadzky . first the good news : germany managed to reduce its national deficit to 2.5 percent in the first half of this year .
the positive trend can be traced back to a broader economic upswing , which brought in increased tax revenues . the public deficit is n't likely to increase in the second half of 2006 , and germany may even finally be able to shed its stigma in the european union as the " stability pact rogue " - an image it had earned through several years of higher-than-permitted debt statistics .
the national deficit in the first half of 2005 was , for example , as high as 3.7 percent . according to figures released thursday by the federal statistical office , the national deficit in the first half of this year amounted to 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 35.8 billion -rrb- in real numbers , which is a good 12 billion euros less than during the same time frame last year . social security contributions , on the other hand , have remained stagnant due to only minimal changes in wages .
however , expenditures made by the government unemployment agencies this year dropped dramatically as a result of cutbacks . finance minister peer steinbrück , who bore the consequences of the political demise of his predecessor hans eichel , is reluctant to be too hasty in celebrating the success reports , lest he eat his words in just a few months ' time . tax hikes to maintain low deficit ? the government has emphasized that it will stick to its promise that , starting next year , germany 's national deficit will not exceed the maximum deficit agreed upon in the eu 's stability pact .
this contractual agreement stipulates that the deficit of all public budgets , including social security , may not exceed 3 percent of the country 's gross domestic product . thanks to positive market conditions in recent months and the higher tax revenues that resulted , germany wo n't violate the pact this year .

why does n't she like me ?
what is a condom ?
generations of confused german teenagers have turned to dr. sommer for honesty - and explicit photos . sandra , 16 , looks up coyly from the pages of bravo , wearing a black choker and nothing else .
boyfriend elias , 18 , grins from the opposite page , also in his natural state . " tell me , why do you love each other ? " reads the headline .
and the young couple tells why - and exactly how . sell this in america , and risk prison time for child pornography . but in germany , this is nothing tawdry . it 's the country 's most popular teenage magazine , and it turns 50 on saturday . sandra and elias ' graphic spread is in the same issue as a free sheet of fake tattoos , a feature about harry potter , and an exclusive report on tokio hotel , the german boy band currently making girls swoon . a german institution since 1969 , dr. sommer combines no-holds-barred sex advice with full-frontal photos . it highlights a basic cultural divide between germany and many other countries - of how openly sex is discussed , especially among youth . " it is not pornography , " says bravo 's deputy editor , alex gernandt .
" it deals with naked people , but in a very sensitive way .
we try to portray young people to tell readers , ' you are not too fat , not too thin .
you are ok the way you are . ' " there are a lot less teenage pregnancies in germany in comparison to the united kingdom or the us , and i think bravo has its share in that success , " gernandt said . breaking taboos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was seduced at 14 , " kristijan says the current dr. sommer , eveline von arx , credits the column with germany 's free sexual attitudes . when it began in 1969 , " dr. sommer really broke taboos , and it was really spectacular to do something like that , " said von arx , who has been writing the column for three years .
" it 's not that spectacular anymore .
people are used to it .
everybody knows it . " each weekly issue of bravo now features photos of two teenagers , generally between 16 and 20 , in the nude , with interviews about their bodies and experiences . anyone under 18 , like sandra , must have his or her parents ' permission to appear . they are paid 400 euros -lrb- a little more than $ 500 -rrb- to pose , and many report the experience is a self-esteem boost , von arx said . weekly letters range from " my boyfriend is once again interested in his former girlfriend " to " everybody 's had sex , only i have n't . "
sample answer : " nowhere does it say that youth have to have sex by a certain time … talk to your boyfriend about it .
tell him how you feel . " " you can be sexy here " bravo 's web site even features explicit petting and positions photo galleries that would n't last a day in other countries . the magazine publishes its eastern european editions with little to no nudity .
but in germany , even teachers and religious leaders seem to welcome the column .
von arx has spoken in schools and was even invited as a youth expert to a big evangelical christian conference last year . gisela gille , chairman of germany 's society for the health of women , said bravo plays an important role in the sexual education of germany 's 12- to 15-year-olds , particularly the lesser educated .
gille said the advice satisfies basic curiosities , but that many teenagers read bravo only for a short time and stop when they become more experienced . tanja reddig , a 17-year-old berlin student , said that she read dr. sommer when she was 12 and 13 and did n't see what the fuss was over the nudity . " you can be sexy here and you do n't get any problems , " she said .
" in america , they ca n't show bodies .
they must hide something .
some teenagers do n't want to ask their parents things , so they could write a letter to dr. sommer . " started by popular demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's youth seem concerned with balancing love and work dr. sommer began during the sexual revolution of 1969 .
bravo was then a strictly entertainment magazine , but its young readers nonetheless kept writing letters about love and sex . so editors figured such a column would increase their readership , according to antje pfeffer of the berlin-based archive of youth culture -lrb- archiv der jugendkulturen -rrb- , which has published a book about bravo 's 50 year history . " dr. sommer immediately was greeted as too open , " pfeffer said . some parents glued the dr. sommer pages together so their teenagers could n't read the column , others banned it from the house .
some schools confiscated it , and in communist east germany , many clamored for smuggled copies . but from the start , the column took its mission quite seriously .
the first dr. sommer , martin goldstein , recalled in the berlin archive 's book that he and his team of social workers , psychologists , sociologists , political scientists , family counselors and parents would spend hours going through letters : i have fallen in love with a sweet young boy .
if he would kiss me , i would be happy for my entire life .
how can i get him to do it ?
i see him almost every day and i already know his name .
but do n't tell me that i should talk to him .
janne , 14 the boys in our village seem to have no interest in us , no matter what we do . we do not know how we can get their attention .
ina , renate , anne and beate , 15 and 16 the team tried to respond in an encouraging , non-judgemental way .
but often , they wondered whether the teenagers had anyone else they could confide in .
they were shocked at how many letters were sent in - sometimes 3,000 to 5,000 a month . " we believed it was because young people wanted to be listened to , " goldstein recalled . evolving topics soon , they were dealing with much thornier issues , such as a 1988 letter titled " my mum 's boyfriend sexually abused me . " by the end of the 1980s , dr. sommer had become more mainstream , and answers seemed freer .
for instance , nicola , 15 , wrote in with the basic question , " how do i show him that i want more ? " the answer : tell him what you want .
or , just push his hand higher . von arx says many of the letters have not changed much over the years .
but recently she has seen more teenagers concerned that they wo n't get ahead in school because they are so distracted by lovesickness . she is often asked if the column is even necessary anymore . " people think our society is very sexualized , and naked bodies and sex are everywhere , and young people should know everything , " she said .
" but they do n't know anything sometimes .

additionally , the databanks contain information on organized crime , drug smuggling and human trafficking .
the computer system , tecs , can compare and analyze as many as a million data sets . the data is entered into the system directly by the 25 eu member states .
each country is represented by its own liaison officer , or elos , in the hague .
as a rule , only these liaison officers have access to the national databanks . if a member state wants to find out whether there is information in tecs on a terror suspect , europol puts together an information packet - a service that europol 's director , max-peter ratzel , is intent on putting first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol director max-peter ratzel " terrorism is , of course , very much in the foreground , because that 's where the biggest risks lie , " ratzel said .

that not-so-small problem is bille , a homeless woman who bathes naked everyday in munich 's many fountains . bille can regularly be seen shedding her clothes and washing her naked 150 kilo frame under the cleansing showers of munich 's 183 public fountains , complete with shampoos and bottles of shower gel . a law unto herself despite being repeatedly fined for breaking public nudity laws , 44-year-old bille continues to go about in the altogether in her bid to stay clean while living on the streets . instead of celebrating her resourcefulness , personal hygiene and confidence , the city authorities have slapped as many as 21 charges on bille , including " causing public disturbance as well as breaking and entering , " a munich police spokesman told the mass-circulation bild newspaper . a social worker also told bild that bille keeps rejecting a room in a homeless center .

why does n't she like me ?
what is a condom ?
generations of confused german teenagers have turned to dr. sommer for honesty - and explicit photos . sandra , 16 , looks up coyly from the pages of bravo , wearing a black choker and nothing else .
boyfriend elias , 18 , grins from the opposite page , also in his natural state . " tell me , why do you love each other ? " reads the headline .
and the young couple tells why - and exactly how . sell this in america , and risk prison time for child pornography . but in germany , this is nothing tawdry . it 's the country 's most popular teenage magazine , and it turns 50 on saturday . sandra and elias ' graphic spread is in the same issue as a free sheet of fake tattoos , a feature about harry potter , and an exclusive report on tokio hotel , the german boy band currently making girls swoon . a german institution since 1969 , dr. sommer combines no-holds-barred sex advice with full-frontal photos . it highlights a basic cultural divide between germany and many other countries - of how openly sex is discussed , especially among youth . " it is not pornography , " says bravo 's deputy editor , alex gernandt .
" it deals with naked people , but in a very sensitive way .
we try to portray young people to tell readers , ' you are not too fat , not too thin .
you are ok the way you are . ' " there are a lot less teenage pregnancies in germany in comparison to the united kingdom or the us , and i think bravo has its share in that success , " gernandt said . breaking taboos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was seduced at 14 , " kristijan says the current dr. sommer , eveline von arx , credits the column with germany 's free sexual attitudes . when it began in 1969 , " dr. sommer really broke taboos , and it was really spectacular to do something like that , " said von arx , who has been writing the column for three years .
" it 's not that spectacular anymore .
people are used to it .
everybody knows it . " each weekly issue of bravo now features photos of two teenagers , generally between 16 and 20 , in the nude , with interviews about their bodies and experiences . anyone under 18 , like sandra , must have his or her parents ' permission to appear . they are paid 400 euros -lrb- a little more than $ 500 -rrb- to pose , and many report the experience is a self-esteem boost , von arx said . weekly letters range from " my boyfriend is once again interested in his former girlfriend " to " everybody 's had sex , only i have n't . "
sample answer : " nowhere does it say that youth have to have sex by a certain time … talk to your boyfriend about it .
tell him how you feel . " " you can be sexy here " bravo 's web site even features explicit petting and positions photo galleries that would n't last a day in other countries . the magazine publishes its eastern european editions with little to no nudity .
but in germany , even teachers and religious leaders seem to welcome the column .
von arx has spoken in schools and was even invited as a youth expert to a big evangelical christian conference last year . gisela gille , chairman of germany 's society for the health of women , said bravo plays an important role in the sexual education of germany 's 12- to 15-year-olds , particularly the lesser educated .
gille said the advice satisfies basic curiosities , but that many teenagers read bravo only for a short time and stop when they become more experienced . tanja reddig , a 17-year-old berlin student , said that she read dr. sommer when she was 12 and 13 and did n't see what the fuss was over the nudity . " you can be sexy here and you do n't get any problems , " she said .
" in america , they ca n't show bodies .
they must hide something .
some teenagers do n't want to ask their parents things , so they could write a letter to dr. sommer . " started by popular demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's youth seem concerned with balancing love and work dr. sommer began during the sexual revolution of 1969 .
bravo was then a strictly entertainment magazine , but its young readers nonetheless kept writing letters about love and sex . so editors figured such a column would increase their readership , according to antje pfeffer of the berlin-based archive of youth culture -lrb- archiv der jugendkulturen -rrb- , which has published a book about bravo 's 50 year history . " dr. sommer immediately was greeted as too open , " pfeffer said . some parents glued the dr. sommer pages together so their teenagers could n't read the column , others banned it from the house .
some schools confiscated it , and in communist east germany , many clamored for smuggled copies . but from the start , the column took its mission quite seriously .
the first dr. sommer , martin goldstein , recalled in the berlin archive 's book that he and his team of social workers , psychologists , sociologists , political scientists , family counselors and parents would spend hours going through letters : i have fallen in love with a sweet young boy .
if he would kiss me , i would be happy for my entire life .
how can i get him to do it ?
i see him almost every day and i already know his name .
but do n't tell me that i should talk to him .
janne , 14 the boys in our village seem to have no interest in us , no matter what we do . we do not know how we can get their attention .
ina , renate , anne and beate , 15 and 16 the team tried to respond in an encouraging , non-judgemental way .
but often , they wondered whether the teenagers had anyone else they could confide in .
they were shocked at how many letters were sent in - sometimes 3,000 to 5,000 a month . " we believed it was because young people wanted to be listened to , " goldstein recalled . evolving topics soon , they were dealing with much thornier issues , such as a 1988 letter titled " my mum 's boyfriend sexually abused me . " by the end of the 1980s , dr. sommer had become more mainstream , and answers seemed freer .
for instance , nicola , 15 , wrote in with the basic question , " how do i show him that i want more ? " the answer : tell him what you want .
or , just push his hand higher . von arx says many of the letters have not changed much over the years .
but recently she has seen more teenagers concerned that they wo n't get ahead in school because they are so distracted by lovesickness . she is often asked if the column is even necessary anymore . " people think our society is very sexualized , and naked bodies and sex are everywhere , and young people should know everything , " she said .
" but they do n't know anything sometimes .

most call themselves communists , yet loudly proclaim their support for israel and george w. bush . when it comes to the anti-germans , the political big tent theory appears to have become fact : groups that generally ca n't bear to be in the same room sometimes unite for a common cause . that was on show recently in western berlin , where thousands had gathered to show their support for israel during the recent conflict with hezbollah militants in lebanon .
many of the demonstrators were members of berlin 's jewish community or the conservative christian democrats . however , there were some there who belonged to the far-left and sported all the accoutrements of those who are known as autonomen in germany - black clothing , buttons or patches with political slogans or insignia , and often scarves , sunglasses or baseball caps to make them harder to identify . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators often clash with police but this time they had n't come to disrupt the demonstration , shout out anti-zionist slogans or get into tussles with police , as they often do .
the group of anti-germans had actually organized the demonstration under the slogan " unconditional solidarity with israel , " one of the core positions of their movement . such a stance puts the group firmly at odds with the majority viewpoint of germany 's far-left movement , which since the 1970s has been overwhelmingly pro-palestinian and very critical of israeli policy .
completing the philosophical break is the support of many anti-germans for us president george w. bush , who for the traditional far left is anathema . " it has to do with george w. bush 's conception for a new middle east , which is essentially supported , " said rüdiger göbel , deputy editor-in-chief of junge welt , a left-wing daily based in berlin .
" the anti-germans are actually closer to the neo-conservatives in the united states . " fighting a " new fascism " to many observers , the anti-germans are a conundrum .
most consider themselves communists , but according to a study carried out by patrick hagen at the university of cologne , they " have abandoned almost all of the essentials of the communist movement and the left , such as the positive relations to the working class , anti-imperialism and anti-racism which has led to a deep split within the extra-parliamentary left . " the anti-german movement can be traced back to the fall of the berlin wall , where some on the far left demonstrated against reunification , warning that a stronger germany could result in a new militarism and even a " fourth reich . "
they based their slogan on the phrase often used in holocaust remembrance ceremonies : " never again . "
the anti-germans went further , rallying around " germany , never again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators at a anti-nazi rally as time went on , the group began to show more support for the united states .
in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of the destruction of dresden by the allies , the anti-germans praised the bombing of the civil population , since in their view , so many of them had supported the nazi regime . but the movement really got behind the stars and stripes after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , which they saw as anti-semitic and targeted at israel .
to them , it marked the rise of a new type of fascism .
this time is was n't from the far right , but from radical islam and it had to be fought .
the us , in their eyes , was the only one willing to fight it . " islamic terrorists and states such as syria and iran want to liquidate israel , " said hermann gremliza , publisher of the leftist magazine konkret and one of the leading figures in the anti-german movement , in an e-mail response .
" so -lrb- anti-germans -rrb- act according to the motto : the enemy of my enemy is my friend . " just after the war in iraq broke out in 2003 , the anti-german magazine bahamas wrote an editorial entitled " bush - the man of peace ! " whose side are they on ? these kinds of positions have put the group in sometimes violent opposition to the traditional far left .
when anti-germans show up at left-wing demonstrations with signs supporting american policy or israel , they are generally not welcomed warmly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would che have supported george w. bush ?
" whoever carries an israeli flag is insulted and spit upon , " gremliza said .
" but what do you expect , we 're in germany . " the traditional far left accuses the anti-germans of getting in bed with the bourgeoisie .
some writers in the anti-german camp even write occasionally for the online site of the newsmagazine der spiegel or even such bastions of conservatism as the daily die welt . observers say that means they have an influence beyond their actual numbers , which are estimated between 500 and 3,000 .
gremliza , however , said around 50,000 people read his magazine konkret . anti-german goals , he says , are to uncover what group members see as the hypocrisy of a german foreign policy that has been harmful to israel and helped the rise of a new " islamic " fascism , which they see as a direct descendent of the form practiced by the nazis . " germany wants an alliance with the islamic world - against the us , " he said , despite angela merkel 's close ties to her american counterpart .

why does n't she like me ?
what is a condom ?
generations of confused german teenagers have turned to dr. sommer for honesty - and explicit photos . sandra , 16 , looks up coyly from the pages of bravo , wearing a black choker and nothing else .
boyfriend elias , 18 , grins from the opposite page , also in his natural state . " tell me , why do you love each other ? " reads the headline .
and the young couple tells why - and exactly how . sell this in america , and risk prison time for child pornography . but in germany , this is nothing tawdry . it 's the country 's most popular teenage magazine , and it turns 50 on saturday . sandra and elias ' graphic spread is in the same issue as a free sheet of fake tattoos , a feature about harry potter , and an exclusive report on tokio hotel , the german boy band currently making girls swoon . a german institution since 1969 , dr. sommer combines no-holds-barred sex advice with full-frontal photos . it highlights a basic cultural divide between germany and many other countries - of how openly sex is discussed , especially among youth . " it is not pornography , " says bravo 's deputy editor , alex gernandt .
" it deals with naked people , but in a very sensitive way .
we try to portray young people to tell readers , ' you are not too fat , not too thin .
you are ok the way you are . ' " there are a lot less teenage pregnancies in germany in comparison to the united kingdom or the us , and i think bravo has its share in that success , " gernandt said . breaking taboos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was seduced at 14 , " kristijan says the current dr. sommer , eveline von arx , credits the column with germany 's free sexual attitudes . when it began in 1969 , " dr. sommer really broke taboos , and it was really spectacular to do something like that , " said von arx , who has been writing the column for three years .
" it 's not that spectacular anymore .
people are used to it .
everybody knows it . " each weekly issue of bravo now features photos of two teenagers , generally between 16 and 20 , in the nude , with interviews about their bodies and experiences . anyone under 18 , like sandra , must have his or her parents ' permission to appear . they are paid 400 euros -lrb- a little more than $ 500 -rrb- to pose , and many report the experience is a self-esteem boost , von arx said . weekly letters range from " my boyfriend is once again interested in his former girlfriend " to " everybody 's had sex , only i have n't . "
sample answer : " nowhere does it say that youth have to have sex by a certain time … talk to your boyfriend about it .
tell him how you feel . " " you can be sexy here " bravo 's web site even features explicit petting and positions photo galleries that would n't last a day in other countries . the magazine publishes its eastern european editions with little to no nudity .
but in germany , even teachers and religious leaders seem to welcome the column .
von arx has spoken in schools and was even invited as a youth expert to a big evangelical christian conference last year . gisela gille , chairman of germany 's society for the health of women , said bravo plays an important role in the sexual education of germany 's 12- to 15-year-olds , particularly the lesser educated .
gille said the advice satisfies basic curiosities , but that many teenagers read bravo only for a short time and stop when they become more experienced . tanja reddig , a 17-year-old berlin student , said that she read dr. sommer when she was 12 and 13 and did n't see what the fuss was over the nudity . " you can be sexy here and you do n't get any problems , " she said .
" in america , they ca n't show bodies .
they must hide something .
some teenagers do n't want to ask their parents things , so they could write a letter to dr. sommer . " started by popular demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's youth seem concerned with balancing love and work dr. sommer began during the sexual revolution of 1969 .
bravo was then a strictly entertainment magazine , but its young readers nonetheless kept writing letters about love and sex . so editors figured such a column would increase their readership , according to antje pfeffer of the berlin-based archive of youth culture -lrb- archiv der jugendkulturen -rrb- , which has published a book about bravo 's 50 year history . " dr. sommer immediately was greeted as too open , " pfeffer said . some parents glued the dr. sommer pages together so their teenagers could n't read the column , others banned it from the house .
some schools confiscated it , and in communist east germany , many clamored for smuggled copies . but from the start , the column took its mission quite seriously .
the first dr. sommer , martin goldstein , recalled in the berlin archive 's book that he and his team of social workers , psychologists , sociologists , political scientists , family counselors and parents would spend hours going through letters : i have fallen in love with a sweet young boy .
if he would kiss me , i would be happy for my entire life .
how can i get him to do it ?
i see him almost every day and i already know his name .

but often , they wondered whether the teenagers had anyone else they could confide in .
they were shocked at how many letters were sent in - sometimes 3,000 to 5,000 a month . " we believed it was because young people wanted to be listened to , " goldstein recalled . evolving topics soon , they were dealing with much thornier issues , such as a 1988 letter titled " my mum 's boyfriend sexually abused me . " by the end of the 1980s , dr. sommer had become more mainstream , and answers seemed freer .
for instance , nicola , 15 , wrote in with the basic question , " how do i show him that i want more ? " the answer : tell him what you want .
or , just push his hand higher . von arx says many of the letters have not changed much over the years .
but recently she has seen more teenagers concerned that they wo n't get ahead in school because they are so distracted by lovesickness . she is often asked if the column is even necessary anymore .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.08.2006 strange bedfellows : radical leftists for bush großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-germans are against what they see as a newer form of fascists than neo-nazis among the german far-left , one subgroup called the anti-germans holds some contradictory views .
most call themselves communists , yet loudly proclaim their support for israel and george w. bush . when it comes to the anti-germans , the political big tent theory appears to have become fact : groups that generally ca n't bear to be in the same room sometimes unite for a common cause . that was on show recently in western berlin , where thousands had gathered to show their support for israel during the recent conflict with hezbollah militants in lebanon .
many of the demonstrators were members of berlin 's jewish community or the conservative christian democrats . however , there were some there who belonged to the far-left and sported all the accoutrements of those who are known as autonomen in germany - black clothing , buttons or patches with political slogans or insignia , and often scarves , sunglasses or baseball caps to make them harder to identify . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators often clash with police but this time they had n't come to disrupt the demonstration , shout out anti-zionist slogans or get into tussles with police , as they often do .
the group of anti-germans had actually organized the demonstration under the slogan " unconditional solidarity with israel , " one of the core positions of their movement . such a stance puts the group firmly at odds with the majority viewpoint of germany 's far-left movement , which since the 1970s has been overwhelmingly pro-palestinian and very critical of israeli policy .
completing the philosophical break is the support of many anti-germans for us president george w. bush , who for the traditional far left is anathema . " it has to do with george w. bush 's conception for a new middle east , which is essentially supported , " said rüdiger göbel , deputy editor-in-chief of junge welt , a left-wing daily based in berlin .
" the anti-germans are actually closer to the neo-conservatives in the united states . " fighting a " new fascism " to many observers , the anti-germans are a conundrum .
most consider themselves communists , but according to a study carried out by patrick hagen at the university of cologne , they " have abandoned almost all of the essentials of the communist movement and the left , such as the positive relations to the working class , anti-imperialism and anti-racism which has led to a deep split within the extra-parliamentary left . " the anti-german movement can be traced back to the fall of the berlin wall , where some on the far left demonstrated against reunification , warning that a stronger germany could result in a new militarism and even a " fourth reich . "
they based their slogan on the phrase often used in holocaust remembrance ceremonies : " never again . "
the anti-germans went further , rallying around " germany , never again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators at a anti-nazi rally as time went on , the group began to show more support for the united states .
in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of the destruction of dresden by the allies , the anti-germans praised the bombing of the civil population , since in their view , so many of them had supported the nazi regime . but the movement really got behind the stars and stripes after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , which they saw as anti-semitic and targeted at israel .
to them , it marked the rise of a new type of fascism .
this time is was n't from the far right , but from radical islam and it had to be fought .
the us , in their eyes , was the only one willing to fight it . " islamic terrorists and states such as syria and iran want to liquidate israel , " said hermann gremliza , publisher of the leftist magazine konkret and one of the leading figures in the anti-german movement , in an e-mail response .
" so -lrb- anti-germans -rrb- act according to the motto : the enemy of my enemy is my friend . " just after the war in iraq broke out in 2003 , the anti-german magazine bahamas wrote an editorial entitled " bush - the man of peace ! " whose side are they on ? these kinds of positions have put the group in sometimes violent opposition to the traditional far left .
when anti-germans show up at left-wing demonstrations with signs supporting american policy or israel , they are generally not welcomed warmly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would che have supported george w. bush ?
" whoever carries an israeli flag is insulted and spit upon , " gremliza said .
" but what do you expect , we 're in germany . " the traditional far left accuses the anti-germans of getting in bed with the bourgeoisie .
some writers in the anti-german camp even write occasionally for the online site of the newsmagazine der spiegel or even such bastions of conservatism as the daily die welt . observers say that means they have an influence beyond their actual numbers , which are estimated between 500 and 3,000 .
gremliza , however , said around 50,000 people read his magazine konkret . anti-german goals , he says , are to uncover what group members see as the hypocrisy of a german foreign policy that has been harmful to israel and helped the rise of a new " islamic " fascism , which they see as a direct descendent of the form practiced by the nazis . " germany wants an alliance with the islamic world - against the us , " he said , despite angela merkel 's close ties to her american counterpart .

why does n't she like me ?
what is a condom ?
generations of confused german teenagers have turned to dr. sommer for honesty - and explicit photos . sandra , 16 , looks up coyly from the pages of bravo , wearing a black choker and nothing else .
boyfriend elias , 18 , grins from the opposite page , also in his natural state . " tell me , why do you love each other ? " reads the headline .
and the young couple tells why - and exactly how . sell this in america , and risk prison time for child pornography . but in germany , this is nothing tawdry . it 's the country 's most popular teenage magazine , and it turns 50 on saturday . sandra and elias ' graphic spread is in the same issue as a free sheet of fake tattoos , a feature about harry potter , and an exclusive report on tokio hotel , the german boy band currently making girls swoon . a german institution since 1969 , dr. sommer combines no-holds-barred sex advice with full-frontal photos . it highlights a basic cultural divide between germany and many other countries - of how openly sex is discussed , especially among youth . " it is not pornography , " says bravo 's deputy editor , alex gernandt .
" it deals with naked people , but in a very sensitive way .
we try to portray young people to tell readers , ' you are not too fat , not too thin .
you are ok the way you are . ' " there are a lot less teenage pregnancies in germany in comparison to the united kingdom or the us , and i think bravo has its share in that success , " gernandt said . breaking taboos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was seduced at 14 , " kristijan says the current dr. sommer , eveline von arx , credits the column with germany 's free sexual attitudes . when it began in 1969 , " dr. sommer really broke taboos , and it was really spectacular to do something like that , " said von arx , who has been writing the column for three years .
" it 's not that spectacular anymore .
people are used to it .
everybody knows it . " each weekly issue of bravo now features photos of two teenagers , generally between 16 and 20 , in the nude , with interviews about their bodies and experiences . anyone under 18 , like sandra , must have his or her parents ' permission to appear . they are paid 400 euros -lrb- a little more than $ 500 -rrb- to pose , and many report the experience is a self-esteem boost , von arx said . weekly letters range from " my boyfriend is once again interested in his former girlfriend " to " everybody 's had sex , only i have n't . "
sample answer : " nowhere does it say that youth have to have sex by a certain time … talk to your boyfriend about it .
tell him how you feel . " " you can be sexy here " bravo 's web site even features explicit petting and positions photo galleries that would n't last a day in other countries . the magazine publishes its eastern european editions with little to no nudity .
but in germany , even teachers and religious leaders seem to welcome the column .
von arx has spoken in schools and was even invited as a youth expert to a big evangelical christian conference last year . gisela gille , chairman of germany 's society for the health of women , said bravo plays an important role in the sexual education of germany 's 12- to 15-year-olds , particularly the lesser educated .
gille said the advice satisfies basic curiosities , but that many teenagers read bravo only for a short time and stop when they become more experienced . tanja reddig , a 17-year-old berlin student , said that she read dr. sommer when she was 12 and 13 and did n't see what the fuss was over the nudity . " you can be sexy here and you do n't get any problems , " she said .
" in america , they ca n't show bodies .
they must hide something .
some teenagers do n't want to ask their parents things , so they could write a letter to dr. sommer . " started by popular demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's youth seem concerned with balancing love and work dr. sommer began during the sexual revolution of 1969 .
bravo was then a strictly entertainment magazine , but its young readers nonetheless kept writing letters about love and sex . so editors figured such a column would increase their readership , according to antje pfeffer of the berlin-based archive of youth culture -lrb- archiv der jugendkulturen -rrb- , which has published a book about bravo 's 50 year history . " dr. sommer immediately was greeted as too open , " pfeffer said . some parents glued the dr. sommer pages together so their teenagers could n't read the column , others banned it from the house .
some schools confiscated it , and in communist east germany , many clamored for smuggled copies . but from the start , the column took its mission quite seriously .
the first dr. sommer , martin goldstein , recalled in the berlin archive 's book that he and his team of social workers , psychologists , sociologists , political scientists , family counselors and parents would spend hours going through letters : i have fallen in love with a sweet young boy .
if he would kiss me , i would be happy for my entire life .
how can i get him to do it ?
i see him almost every day and i already know his name .
but do n't tell me that i should talk to him .
janne , 14 the boys in our village seem to have no interest in us , no matter what we do . we do not know how we can get their attention .
ina , renate , anne and beate , 15 and 16 the team tried to respond in an encouraging , non-judgemental way .
but often , they wondered whether the teenagers had anyone else they could confide in .
they were shocked at how many letters were sent in - sometimes 3,000 to 5,000 a month . " we believed it was because young people wanted to be listened to , " goldstein recalled . evolving topics soon , they were dealing with much thornier issues , such as a 1988 letter titled " my mum 's boyfriend sexually abused me . " by the end of the 1980s , dr. sommer had become more mainstream , and answers seemed freer .
for instance , nicola , 15 , wrote in with the basic question , " how do i show him that i want more ? " the answer : tell him what you want .
or , just push his hand higher . von arx says many of the letters have not changed much over the years .
but recently she has seen more teenagers concerned that they wo n't get ahead in school because they are so distracted by lovesickness . she is often asked if the column is even necessary anymore . " people think our society is very sexualized , and naked bodies and sex are everywhere , and young people should know everything , " she said .
" but they do n't know anything sometimes .

instead of raising taxes , however , it should reduce spending , says dw 's karl zawadzky . first the good news : germany managed to reduce its national deficit to 2.5 percent in the first half of this year .
the positive trend can be traced back to a broader economic upswing , which brought in increased tax revenues . the public deficit is n't likely to increase in the second half of 2006 , and germany may even finally be able to shed its stigma in the european union as the " stability pact rogue " - an image it had earned through several years of higher-than-permitted debt statistics .
the national deficit in the first half of 2005 was , for example , as high as 3.7 percent . according to figures released thursday by the federal statistical office , the national deficit in the first half of this year amounted to 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 35.8 billion -rrb- in real numbers , which is a good 12 billion euros less than during the same time frame last year . social security contributions , on the other hand , have remained stagnant due to only minimal changes in wages .
however , expenditures made by the government unemployment agencies this year dropped dramatically as a result of cutbacks . finance minister peer steinbrück , who bore the consequences of the political demise of his predecessor hans eichel , is reluctant to be too hasty in celebrating the success reports , lest he eat his words in just a few months ' time . tax hikes to maintain low deficit ? the government has emphasized that it will stick to its promise that , starting next year , germany 's national deficit will not exceed the maximum deficit agreed upon in the eu 's stability pact .
this contractual agreement stipulates that the deficit of all public budgets , including social security , may not exceed 3 percent of the country 's gross domestic product . thanks to positive market conditions in recent months and the higher tax revenues that resulted , germany wo n't violate the pact this year .
even a slight economic downturn will not prevent germany from meeting the deficit standard in the future . now for the not-so-good news : in order to keep the deficit within the limitations set by the stability pact , hefty tax hikes are necessary . at the beginning of 2007 , sales tax will be raised from 16 to 19 percent .
tax increases in other areas are planned as well , though they wo n't be quite as big as the sales tax hike . taken together , tax revenues are expected to increase by more than 20 billion euros per year , which will keep germany on the safe side as far as the stability pact criteria are concerned . cut spending instead of raising taxes however , burdening the taxpayers in order to meet eu deficit criteria is problematic . federal , state and local expenditures will continue to increase , even if only slightly .
market fluctuation aside , germany has a structural problem : germans pay more in tax and social contributions than those in other industrial countries . considerable reductions in spending - not another tax hike for the already burdened taxpayers - would be a better approach to trimming down the national deficit . karl zawadzky is deutsche welle 's chief business correspondent . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany up in arms over minister 's holiday comments germany 's finance minister has sparked outrage by suggesting germans should spend less on their annual holidays and instead put money aside for their old age .

instead of raising taxes , however , it should reduce spending , says dw 's karl zawadzky . first the good news : germany managed to reduce its national deficit to 2.5 percent in the first half of this year .
the positive trend can be traced back to a broader economic upswing , which brought in increased tax revenues . the public deficit is n't likely to increase in the second half of 2006 , and germany may even finally be able to shed its stigma in the european union as the " stability pact rogue " - an image it had earned through several years of higher-than-permitted debt statistics .
the national deficit in the first half of 2005 was , for example , as high as 3.7 percent . according to figures released thursday by the federal statistical office , the national deficit in the first half of this year amounted to 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 35.8 billion -rrb- in real numbers , which is a good 12 billion euros less than during the same time frame last year . social security contributions , on the other hand , have remained stagnant due to only minimal changes in wages .
however , expenditures made by the government unemployment agencies this year dropped dramatically as a result of cutbacks . finance minister peer steinbrück , who bore the consequences of the political demise of his predecessor hans eichel , is reluctant to be too hasty in celebrating the success reports , lest he eat his words in just a few months ' time . tax hikes to maintain low deficit ? the government has emphasized that it will stick to its promise that , starting next year , germany 's national deficit will not exceed the maximum deficit agreed upon in the eu 's stability pact .
this contractual agreement stipulates that the deficit of all public budgets , including social security , may not exceed 3 percent of the country 's gross domestic product . thanks to positive market conditions in recent months and the higher tax revenues that resulted , germany wo n't violate the pact this year .
even a slight economic downturn will not prevent germany from meeting the deficit standard in the future . now for the not-so-good news : in order to keep the deficit within the limitations set by the stability pact , hefty tax hikes are necessary . at the beginning of 2007 , sales tax will be raised from 16 to 19 percent .

most call themselves communists , yet loudly proclaim their support for israel and george w. bush . when it comes to the anti-germans , the political big tent theory appears to have become fact : groups that generally ca n't bear to be in the same room sometimes unite for a common cause . that was on show recently in western berlin , where thousands had gathered to show their support for israel during the recent conflict with hezbollah militants in lebanon .
many of the demonstrators were members of berlin 's jewish community or the conservative christian democrats . however , there were some there who belonged to the far-left and sported all the accoutrements of those who are known as autonomen in germany - black clothing , buttons or patches with political slogans or insignia , and often scarves , sunglasses or baseball caps to make them harder to identify . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators often clash with police but this time they had n't come to disrupt the demonstration , shout out anti-zionist slogans or get into tussles with police , as they often do .
the group of anti-germans had actually organized the demonstration under the slogan " unconditional solidarity with israel , " one of the core positions of their movement . such a stance puts the group firmly at odds with the majority viewpoint of germany 's far-left movement , which since the 1970s has been overwhelmingly pro-palestinian and very critical of israeli policy .
completing the philosophical break is the support of many anti-germans for us president george w. bush , who for the traditional far left is anathema . " it has to do with george w. bush 's conception for a new middle east , which is essentially supported , " said rüdiger göbel , deputy editor-in-chief of junge welt , a left-wing daily based in berlin .
" the anti-germans are actually closer to the neo-conservatives in the united states . " fighting a " new fascism " to many observers , the anti-germans are a conundrum .
most consider themselves communists , but according to a study carried out by patrick hagen at the university of cologne , they " have abandoned almost all of the essentials of the communist movement and the left , such as the positive relations to the working class , anti-imperialism and anti-racism which has led to a deep split within the extra-parliamentary left . " the anti-german movement can be traced back to the fall of the berlin wall , where some on the far left demonstrated against reunification , warning that a stronger germany could result in a new militarism and even a " fourth reich . "
they based their slogan on the phrase often used in holocaust remembrance ceremonies : " never again . "
the anti-germans went further , rallying around " germany , never again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators at a anti-nazi rally as time went on , the group began to show more support for the united states .
in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of the destruction of dresden by the allies , the anti-germans praised the bombing of the civil population , since in their view , so many of them had supported the nazi regime . but the movement really got behind the stars and stripes after the terrorist attacks of sept .

to them , it marked the rise of a new type of fascism .
this time is was n't from the far right , but from radical islam and it had to be fought .
the us , in their eyes , was the only one willing to fight it . " islamic terrorists and states such as syria and iran want to liquidate israel , " said hermann gremliza , publisher of the leftist magazine konkret and one of the leading figures in the anti-german movement , in an e-mail response .
" so -lrb- anti-germans -rrb- act according to the motto : the enemy of my enemy is my friend . " just after the war in iraq broke out in 2003 , the anti-german magazine bahamas wrote an editorial entitled " bush - the man of peace ! " whose side are they on ? these kinds of positions have put the group in sometimes violent opposition to the traditional far left .

" whoever carries an israeli flag is insulted and spit upon , " gremliza said .
" but what do you expect , we 're in germany . " the traditional far left accuses the anti-germans of getting in bed with the bourgeoisie .
some writers in the anti-german camp even write occasionally for the online site of the newsmagazine der spiegel or even such bastions of conservatism as the daily die welt . observers say that means they have an influence beyond their actual numbers , which are estimated between 500 and 3,000 .
gremliza , however , said around 50,000 people read his magazine konkret . anti-german goals , he says , are to uncover what group members see as the hypocrisy of a german foreign policy that has been harmful to israel and helped the rise of a new " islamic " fascism , which they see as a direct descendent of the form practiced by the nazis .

most call themselves communists , yet loudly proclaim their support for israel and george w. bush . when it comes to the anti-germans , the political big tent theory appears to have become fact : groups that generally ca n't bear to be in the same room sometimes unite for a common cause . that was on show recently in western berlin , where thousands had gathered to show their support for israel during the recent conflict with hezbollah militants in lebanon .
many of the demonstrators were members of berlin 's jewish community or the conservative christian democrats . however , there were some there who belonged to the far-left and sported all the accoutrements of those who are known as autonomen in germany - black clothing , buttons or patches with political slogans or insignia , and often scarves , sunglasses or baseball caps to make them harder to identify . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators often clash with police but this time they had n't come to disrupt the demonstration , shout out anti-zionist slogans or get into tussles with police , as they often do .
the group of anti-germans had actually organized the demonstration under the slogan " unconditional solidarity with israel , " one of the core positions of their movement . such a stance puts the group firmly at odds with the majority viewpoint of germany 's far-left movement , which since the 1970s has been overwhelmingly pro-palestinian and very critical of israeli policy .
completing the philosophical break is the support of many anti-germans for us president george w. bush , who for the traditional far left is anathema . " it has to do with george w. bush 's conception for a new middle east , which is essentially supported , " said rüdiger göbel , deputy editor-in-chief of junge welt , a left-wing daily based in berlin .
" the anti-germans are actually closer to the neo-conservatives in the united states . " fighting a " new fascism " to many observers , the anti-germans are a conundrum .
most consider themselves communists , but according to a study carried out by patrick hagen at the university of cologne , they " have abandoned almost all of the essentials of the communist movement and the left , such as the positive relations to the working class , anti-imperialism and anti-racism which has led to a deep split within the extra-parliamentary left . " the anti-german movement can be traced back to the fall of the berlin wall , where some on the far left demonstrated against reunification , warning that a stronger germany could result in a new militarism and even a " fourth reich . "
they based their slogan on the phrase often used in holocaust remembrance ceremonies : " never again . "
the anti-germans went further , rallying around " germany , never again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators at a anti-nazi rally as time went on , the group began to show more support for the united states .
in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of the destruction of dresden by the allies , the anti-germans praised the bombing of the civil population , since in their view , so many of them had supported the nazi regime . but the movement really got behind the stars and stripes after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , which they saw as anti-semitic and targeted at israel .
to them , it marked the rise of a new type of fascism .
this time is was n't from the far right , but from radical islam and it had to be fought .
the us , in their eyes , was the only one willing to fight it . " islamic terrorists and states such as syria and iran want to liquidate israel , " said hermann gremliza , publisher of the leftist magazine konkret and one of the leading figures in the anti-german movement , in an e-mail response .
" so -lrb- anti-germans -rrb- act according to the motto : the enemy of my enemy is my friend . " just after the war in iraq broke out in 2003 , the anti-german magazine bahamas wrote an editorial entitled " bush - the man of peace ! " whose side are they on ? these kinds of positions have put the group in sometimes violent opposition to the traditional far left .
when anti-germans show up at left-wing demonstrations with signs supporting american policy or israel , they are generally not welcomed warmly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would che have supported george w. bush ?
" whoever carries an israeli flag is insulted and spit upon , " gremliza said .
" but what do you expect , we 're in germany . " the traditional far left accuses the anti-germans of getting in bed with the bourgeoisie .
some writers in the anti-german camp even write occasionally for the online site of the newsmagazine der spiegel or even such bastions of conservatism as the daily die welt . observers say that means they have an influence beyond their actual numbers , which are estimated between 500 and 3,000 .
gremliza , however , said around 50,000 people read his magazine konkret . anti-german goals , he says , are to uncover what group members see as the hypocrisy of a german foreign policy that has been harmful to israel and helped the rise of a new " islamic " fascism , which they see as a direct descendent of the form practiced by the nazis . " germany wants an alliance with the islamic world - against the us , " he said , despite angela merkel 's close ties to her american counterpart .

a first french contingent of 49 engineers arrived on saturday . " i have decided to send two extra battalions into the field to expand our unifil contingent .
two thousand french soldiers will thus be placed under the un flag in lebanon , " french president chirac said in a televised address on thursday evening . each french battalion counts 800 soldiers .
four hundred french soldiers are already serving in the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- . us , israel and lebanon welcome deployment the french decision was hailed by israel and us president george w. bush " i applaud the decision of france , as well as the significant pledges from italy and our other important allies .
i encourage other nations to make contributions as well , " bush said in a statement released by the white house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac answered the call " the fact that the french have decided to send troops will bring in additional nations , " miri eisen , a senior policy advisory to israeli prime minister ehud olmert , told the bbc . lebanon 's prime minister also praised france saying that its decision to contribute 2,000 soldiers to un troops in lebanon will bolster european participation and help consolidate stability in the country . " undoubtedly , the french decision will help boost european participation , " fuad siniora said in a statement .
" in turn , this will help speed up the formation of the international force , which along with the lebanese army , will protect civilians and achieve security and stability , " he said . the deployment of the french troops " helps strengthen stability in lebanon and allows the country to regain its territories through an israeli withdrawal and the extension of state authority over all territories , " he said . french general to retain command - for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french troops arrived in lebanon on friday the united nations announced thursday that french general alain pellegrini would keep command over the operation to monitor the tenuous ceasefire between israel and the lebanese shiite militia hezbollah . pellegrini , currently in command of the united nations interim force in lebanon , will retain his post after the force undergoes a robust expansion under a un resolution , a un spokesman said friday . " general alain pellegrini leads unifil and he will continue to do so " with the " very strong support " of secretary general kofi annan , un spokesman stephane dujarric told reporters . both france and italy have offered to command unifil , which faces the daunting task of policing the ceasefire between israel and the lebanese shiite militia hezbollah . the appointment of a commander of a un peacekeeping force is the responsibility of the secretary general .
kofi annan , speaking from brussels friday where eu ministers are meeting to thrash out details of the bloc 's deployment strategy , said that he expected to be able to announce the force 's " leadership this afternoon . " unifil to enforce ceasefire alongside lebanese terms of the august 14 truce between israel and hezbollah fighters were laid out in un security council resolution 1701 , under which lebanon was " to secure its borders and other entry points to prevent the entry in lebanon without its consent of arms . " lebanese troops have since deployed along the syrian border in the north and east of the country , military sources said . a reinforced unifil could help intercept arms shipments to hezbollah , the militant shiite group that captured two israeli soldiers on july 12 , sparking a massive riposte and 34 days of heavy fighting . france and italy leading eu efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unifil will be boosted but will not make its target , it seems france was criticized last week after it said that just 200 extra soldiers would join unifil , which was set up 28 years ago as a toothless observer force but which the un resolution aims to revamp into a more robust presence of 15,000 soldiers . at the request of britain , israel , lebanon and the united states , italy stepped forward and offered to lead the force , pledging a reported 3,000 soldiers . spain was prepared to commit a battalion of between 700 and 800 troops to the un force , military sources were quoted as saying by a news report late thursday . greece , finland , latvia , sweden and poland have also indicated they could send soldiers , prompting european commission chief jose manuel barroso to say thursday he was " confident that europe will provide the necessary support to expand the unifil . " eu will fail to meet 15,000-troop target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nations already have un troops in lebanon eu leaders have spoken about contributing 4,000 troops to unifil .
however , even if eu leaders on friday pledge several thousand soldiers , unifil will still be far short of the 15,000 target . deployment plans were complicated however , with threats by syria to close its border in the event of such a move by the un . following talks in helsinki with syrian counterpart walid muallem , finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja said : " they will close the frontier to all traffic " if un troops were posted on the lebanese side . syrian president bashar al-assad had already warned that such a deployment would represent a " hostile " position with regard to his country . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy sending signal to eu , us with lebanon offer as the eu struggles to gather military contributions for lebanon , italy has said it would lead the peacekeeping mission .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.08.2006 fighting terrorism at the eu level großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol began focusing on anti-terror measures after the 9/11 attacks observers of the debate in germany on the pros and cons of a nation-wide anti-terror register say the question is when , not if , such a database will be created .
it 's expected to aid anti-terror measures at the eu-level . when germany 's anti-terror register finally comes into being , it wo n't just make things easier for german officials - it will also improve cooperation with the european police force , europol , which is already working on an eu-wide counter-terrorism database . at its headquarters in the hague , europol has computers where eu member states can save names and relevant details about terrorist suspects or witnesses .
additionally , the databanks contain information on organized crime , drug smuggling and human trafficking .
the computer system , tecs , can compare and analyze as many as a million data sets . the data is entered into the system directly by the 25 eu member states .
each country is represented by its own liaison officer , or elos , in the hague .
as a rule , only these liaison officers have access to the national databanks . if a member state wants to find out whether there is information in tecs on a terror suspect , europol puts together an information packet - a service that europol 's director , max-peter ratzel , is intent on putting first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol director max-peter ratzel " terrorism is , of course , very much in the foreground , because that 's where the biggest risks lie , " ratzel said .
" we have to do everything possible in order to identify and eliminate threats , so that we can offer member states the means to avoid danger .
we only need a few people to filter out the right information ; the member states are then responsible for acting on that information . " privacy advocates are critical though , about the fact that the member states can relatively freely feed data into tecs which is then consolidated into suspect profiles .
tecs saves the data for a period of at least three years . europol got its start in the mid-90s as an agency to fight drugs-related crime .
gradually , it 's grown into an institution with a staff of 500 whose main task is to organize information exchanges . other eu networks in addition to europol 's databanks , five of the largest eu states - france , britain , italy , spain and germany - share a computer network aimed at fighting terrorism .
seven states - france , spain , the netherlands , belgium , luxembourg , austria and germany - have also signed a pact to improve cross-border cooperation of their police forces when it comes to the arrest , search and trailing of suspects . but cross-border cooperation of police is by no means comprehensively regulated across the eu , and many states have misgivings .
eu commissioner for justice and security franco frattini has been pushing for stronger cooperation , and is hopeful progress will be made given the current threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following the foiled plot to blow up planes flying from britain to the us , germany is again focused on security for air and rail passengers " there is now , i think , a consensus among the member states that it 's important to really work together , " frattini said .
" we have to stay on the ball . " a directive by the eu 's interior ministry to retain internet and phone data to aid police investigations is , after the introduction of europe-wide arrest warrants , a necessary step , frattini said .
he is also working on other legislative measures to put on the table by the end of this year .
the eu would like to introduce tougher controls on the production and trade in explosives , for example .
it 's also looking into why and how muslim youths in europe are being radicalized . personal freedom still a concern frattini stresses that civil liberties should not be sacrificed in the drive for better protection from terrorists .
in this respect , he said , the united states with its far-reaching curtailments on telecommunications secrecy is no role model for the eu . " this is our political challenge , " frattini said . "
if terrorists force us to restrict our freedom , then the terrorists win .
we can never allow that to happen . " although much has been achieved when it comes to improving police cooperation at the european level , the eu 's anti-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries bemoans the fact that in some areas , progress has been too slow .
he said he is hopeful that eu interior ministers will eventually give up their opposition to majority-rules decisions at the european level . " there 's a lot of demand for the eu to help its member states more effectively , " de vries said .
" i hope that the discussion about a transition from unanimous to majority decisions will be a motivating factor to do more than we have in the past .

generations of confused german teenagers have turned to dr. sommer for honesty - and explicit photos . sandra , 16 , looks up coyly from the pages of bravo , wearing a black choker and nothing else .
boyfriend elias , 18 , grins from the opposite page , also in his natural state . " tell me , why do you love each other ? " reads the headline .
and the young couple tells why - and exactly how . sell this in america , and risk prison time for child pornography . but in germany , this is nothing tawdry . it 's the country 's most popular teenage magazine , and it turns 50 on saturday . sandra and elias ' graphic spread is in the same issue as a free sheet of fake tattoos , a feature about harry potter , and an exclusive report on tokio hotel , the german boy band currently making girls swoon . a german institution since 1969 , dr. sommer combines no-holds-barred sex advice with full-frontal photos . it highlights a basic cultural divide between germany and many other countries - of how openly sex is discussed , especially among youth . " it is not pornography , " says bravo 's deputy editor , alex gernandt .
" it deals with naked people , but in a very sensitive way .
we try to portray young people to tell readers , ' you are not too fat , not too thin .
you are ok the way you are . ' " there are a lot less teenage pregnancies in germany in comparison to the united kingdom or the us , and i think bravo has its share in that success , " gernandt said . breaking taboos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was seduced at 14 , " kristijan says the current dr. sommer , eveline von arx , credits the column with germany 's free sexual attitudes . when it began in 1969 , " dr. sommer really broke taboos , and it was really spectacular to do something like that , " said von arx , who has been writing the column for three years .
" it 's not that spectacular anymore .
people are used to it .
everybody knows it . " each weekly issue of bravo now features photos of two teenagers , generally between 16 and 20 , in the nude , with interviews about their bodies and experiences . anyone under 18 , like sandra , must have his or her parents ' permission to appear . they are paid 400 euros -lrb- a little more than $ 500 -rrb- to pose , and many report the experience is a self-esteem boost , von arx said . weekly letters range from " my boyfriend is once again interested in his former girlfriend " to " everybody 's had sex , only i have n't . "
sample answer : " nowhere does it say that youth have to have sex by a certain time … talk to your boyfriend about it .
tell him how you feel . " " you can be sexy here " bravo 's web site even features explicit petting and positions photo galleries that would n't last a day in other countries . the magazine publishes its eastern european editions with little to no nudity .
but in germany , even teachers and religious leaders seem to welcome the column .
von arx has spoken in schools and was even invited as a youth expert to a big evangelical christian conference last year . gisela gille , chairman of germany 's society for the health of women , said bravo plays an important role in the sexual education of germany 's 12- to 15-year-olds , particularly the lesser educated .
gille said the advice satisfies basic curiosities , but that many teenagers read bravo only for a short time and stop when they become more experienced . tanja reddig , a 17-year-old berlin student , said that she read dr. sommer when she was 12 and 13 and did n't see what the fuss was over the nudity . " you can be sexy here and you do n't get any problems , " she said .
" in america , they ca n't show bodies .
they must hide something .
some teenagers do n't want to ask their parents things , so they could write a letter to dr. sommer . " started by popular demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's youth seem concerned with balancing love and work dr. sommer began during the sexual revolution of 1969 .
bravo was then a strictly entertainment magazine , but its young readers nonetheless kept writing letters about love and sex . so editors figured such a column would increase their readership , according to antje pfeffer of the berlin-based archive of youth culture -lrb- archiv der jugendkulturen -rrb- , which has published a book about bravo 's 50 year history . " dr. sommer immediately was greeted as too open , " pfeffer said . some parents glued the dr. sommer pages together so their teenagers could n't read the column , others banned it from the house .
some schools confiscated it , and in communist east germany , many clamored for smuggled copies . but from the start , the column took its mission quite seriously .
the first dr. sommer , martin goldstein , recalled in the berlin archive 's book that he and his team of social workers , psychologists , sociologists , political scientists , family counselors and parents would spend hours going through letters : i have fallen in love with a sweet young boy .
if he would kiss me , i would be happy for my entire life .
how can i get him to do it ?
i see him almost every day and i already know his name .
but do n't tell me that i should talk to him .
janne , 14 the boys in our village seem to have no interest in us , no matter what we do . we do not know how we can get their attention .
ina , renate , anne and beate , 15 and 16 the team tried to respond in an encouraging , non-judgemental way .
but often , they wondered whether the teenagers had anyone else they could confide in .
they were shocked at how many letters were sent in - sometimes 3,000 to 5,000 a month . " we believed it was because young people wanted to be listened to , " goldstein recalled . evolving topics soon , they were dealing with much thornier issues , such as a 1988 letter titled " my mum 's boyfriend sexually abused me . " by the end of the 1980s , dr. sommer had become more mainstream , and answers seemed freer .
for instance , nicola , 15 , wrote in with the basic question , " how do i show him that i want more ? " the answer : tell him what you want .
or , just push his hand higher . von arx says many of the letters have not changed much over the years .
but recently she has seen more teenagers concerned that they wo n't get ahead in school because they are so distracted by lovesickness . she is often asked if the column is even necessary anymore . " people think our society is very sexualized , and naked bodies and sex are everywhere , and young people should know everything , " she said .

generations of confused german teenagers have turned to dr. sommer for honesty - and explicit photos . sandra , 16 , looks up coyly from the pages of bravo , wearing a black choker and nothing else .

and the young couple tells why - and exactly how . sell this in america , and risk prison time for child pornography . but in germany , this is nothing tawdry . it 's the country 's most popular teenage magazine , and it turns 50 on saturday . sandra and elias ' graphic spread is in the same issue as a free sheet of fake tattoos , a feature about harry potter , and an exclusive report on tokio hotel , the german boy band currently making girls swoon . a german institution since 1969 , dr. sommer combines no-holds-barred sex advice with full-frontal photos . it highlights a basic cultural divide between germany and many other countries - of how openly sex is discussed , especially among youth . " it is not pornography , " says bravo 's deputy editor , alex gernandt .
" it deals with naked people , but in a very sensitive way .
we try to portray young people to tell readers , ' you are not too fat , not too thin .

and the young couple tells why - and exactly how . sell this in america , and risk prison time for child pornography . but in germany , this is nothing tawdry . it 's the country 's most popular teenage magazine , and it turns 50 on saturday . sandra and elias ' graphic spread is in the same issue as a free sheet of fake tattoos , a feature about harry potter , and an exclusive report on tokio hotel , the german boy band currently making girls swoon . a german institution since 1969 , dr. sommer combines no-holds-barred sex advice with full-frontal photos . it highlights a basic cultural divide between germany and many other countries - of how openly sex is discussed , especially among youth . " it is not pornography , " says bravo 's deputy editor , alex gernandt .
" it deals with naked people , but in a very sensitive way .
we try to portray young people to tell readers , ' you are not too fat , not too thin .
you are ok the way you are . ' " there are a lot less teenage pregnancies in germany in comparison to the united kingdom or the us , and i think bravo has its share in that success , " gernandt said . breaking taboos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was seduced at 14 , " kristijan says the current dr. sommer , eveline von arx , credits the column with germany 's free sexual attitudes . when it began in 1969 , " dr. sommer really broke taboos , and it was really spectacular to do something like that , " said von arx , who has been writing the column for three years .
" it 's not that spectacular anymore .
people are used to it .
everybody knows it . " each weekly issue of bravo now features photos of two teenagers , generally between 16 and 20 , in the nude , with interviews about their bodies and experiences . anyone under 18 , like sandra , must have his or her parents ' permission to appear . they are paid 400 euros -lrb- a little more than $ 500 -rrb- to pose , and many report the experience is a self-esteem boost , von arx said . weekly letters range from " my boyfriend is once again interested in his former girlfriend " to " everybody 's had sex , only i have n't . "
sample answer : " nowhere does it say that youth have to have sex by a certain time … talk to your boyfriend about it .
tell him how you feel . " " you can be sexy here " bravo 's web site even features explicit petting and positions photo galleries that would n't last a day in other countries . the magazine publishes its eastern european editions with little to no nudity .
but in germany , even teachers and religious leaders seem to welcome the column .
von arx has spoken in schools and was even invited as a youth expert to a big evangelical christian conference last year . gisela gille , chairman of germany 's society for the health of women , said bravo plays an important role in the sexual education of germany 's 12- to 15-year-olds , particularly the lesser educated .
gille said the advice satisfies basic curiosities , but that many teenagers read bravo only for a short time and stop when they become more experienced . tanja reddig , a 17-year-old berlin student , said that she read dr. sommer when she was 12 and 13 and did n't see what the fuss was over the nudity . " you can be sexy here and you do n't get any problems , " she said .
" in america , they ca n't show bodies .
they must hide something .
some teenagers do n't want to ask their parents things , so they could write a letter to dr. sommer . " started by popular demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's youth seem concerned with balancing love and work dr. sommer began during the sexual revolution of 1969 .
bravo was then a strictly entertainment magazine , but its young readers nonetheless kept writing letters about love and sex . so editors figured such a column would increase their readership , according to antje pfeffer of the berlin-based archive of youth culture -lrb- archiv der jugendkulturen -rrb- , which has published a book about bravo 's 50 year history . " dr. sommer immediately was greeted as too open , " pfeffer said . some parents glued the dr. sommer pages together so their teenagers could n't read the column , others banned it from the house .
some schools confiscated it , and in communist east germany , many clamored for smuggled copies . but from the start , the column took its mission quite seriously .
the first dr. sommer , martin goldstein , recalled in the berlin archive 's book that he and his team of social workers , psychologists , sociologists , political scientists , family counselors and parents would spend hours going through letters : i have fallen in love with a sweet young boy .
if he would kiss me , i would be happy for my entire life .
how can i get him to do it ?
i see him almost every day and i already know his name .
but do n't tell me that i should talk to him .
janne , 14 the boys in our village seem to have no interest in us , no matter what we do . we do not know how we can get their attention .
ina , renate , anne and beate , 15 and 16 the team tried to respond in an encouraging , non-judgemental way .
but often , they wondered whether the teenagers had anyone else they could confide in .
they were shocked at how many letters were sent in - sometimes 3,000 to 5,000 a month . " we believed it was because young people wanted to be listened to , " goldstein recalled . evolving topics soon , they were dealing with much thornier issues , such as a 1988 letter titled " my mum 's boyfriend sexually abused me . " by the end of the 1980s , dr. sommer had become more mainstream , and answers seemed freer .
for instance , nicola , 15 , wrote in with the basic question , " how do i show him that i want more ? " the answer : tell him what you want .
or , just push his hand higher . von arx says many of the letters have not changed much over the years .
but recently she has seen more teenagers concerned that they wo n't get ahead in school because they are so distracted by lovesickness . she is often asked if the column is even necessary anymore . " people think our society is very sexualized , and naked bodies and sex are everywhere , and young people should know everything , " she said .
" but they do n't know anything sometimes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.08.2006 fighting terrorism at the eu level großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol began focusing on anti-terror measures after the 9/11 attacks observers of the debate in germany on the pros and cons of a nation-wide anti-terror register say the question is when , not if , such a database will be created .
it 's expected to aid anti-terror measures at the eu-level . when germany 's anti-terror register finally comes into being , it wo n't just make things easier for german officials - it will also improve cooperation with the european police force , europol , which is already working on an eu-wide counter-terrorism database . at its headquarters in the hague , europol has computers where eu member states can save names and relevant details about terrorist suspects or witnesses .
additionally , the databanks contain information on organized crime , drug smuggling and human trafficking .
the computer system , tecs , can compare and analyze as many as a million data sets . the data is entered into the system directly by the 25 eu member states .
each country is represented by its own liaison officer , or elos , in the hague .
as a rule , only these liaison officers have access to the national databanks . if a member state wants to find out whether there is information in tecs on a terror suspect , europol puts together an information packet - a service that europol 's director , max-peter ratzel , is intent on putting first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol director max-peter ratzel " terrorism is , of course , very much in the foreground , because that 's where the biggest risks lie , " ratzel said .
" we have to do everything possible in order to identify and eliminate threats , so that we can offer member states the means to avoid danger .
we only need a few people to filter out the right information ; the member states are then responsible for acting on that information . " privacy advocates are critical though , about the fact that the member states can relatively freely feed data into tecs which is then consolidated into suspect profiles .
tecs saves the data for a period of at least three years . europol got its start in the mid-90s as an agency to fight drugs-related crime .
gradually , it 's grown into an institution with a staff of 500 whose main task is to organize information exchanges . other eu networks in addition to europol 's databanks , five of the largest eu states - france , britain , italy , spain and germany - share a computer network aimed at fighting terrorism .
seven states - france , spain , the netherlands , belgium , luxembourg , austria and germany - have also signed a pact to improve cross-border cooperation of their police forces when it comes to the arrest , search and trailing of suspects . but cross-border cooperation of police is by no means comprehensively regulated across the eu , and many states have misgivings .
eu commissioner for justice and security franco frattini has been pushing for stronger cooperation , and is hopeful progress will be made given the current threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following the foiled plot to blow up planes flying from britain to the us , germany is again focused on security for air and rail passengers " there is now , i think , a consensus among the member states that it 's important to really work together , " frattini said .
" we have to stay on the ball . " a directive by the eu 's interior ministry to retain internet and phone data to aid police investigations is , after the introduction of europe-wide arrest warrants , a necessary step , frattini said .
he is also working on other legislative measures to put on the table by the end of this year .
the eu would like to introduce tougher controls on the production and trade in explosives , for example .
it 's also looking into why and how muslim youths in europe are being radicalized . personal freedom still a concern frattini stresses that civil liberties should not be sacrificed in the drive for better protection from terrorists .
in this respect , he said , the united states with its far-reaching curtailments on telecommunications secrecy is no role model for the eu . " this is our political challenge , " frattini said . "
if terrorists force us to restrict our freedom , then the terrorists win .
we can never allow that to happen . " although much has been achieved when it comes to improving police cooperation at the european level , the eu 's anti-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries bemoans the fact that in some areas , progress has been too slow .
he said he is hopeful that eu interior ministers will eventually give up their opposition to majority-rules decisions at the european level . " there 's a lot of demand for the eu to help its member states more effectively , " de vries said .
" i hope that the discussion about a transition from unanimous to majority decisions will be a motivating factor to do more than we have in the past .

a first french contingent of 49 engineers arrived on saturday . " i have decided to send two extra battalions into the field to expand our unifil contingent .
two thousand french soldiers will thus be placed under the un flag in lebanon , " french president chirac said in a televised address on thursday evening . each french battalion counts 800 soldiers .
four hundred french soldiers are already serving in the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- . us , israel and lebanon welcome deployment the french decision was hailed by israel and us president george w. bush " i applaud the decision of france , as well as the significant pledges from italy and our other important allies .
i encourage other nations to make contributions as well , " bush said in a statement released by the white house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac answered the call " the fact that the french have decided to send troops will bring in additional nations , " miri eisen , a senior policy advisory to israeli prime minister ehud olmert , told the bbc . lebanon 's prime minister also praised france saying that its decision to contribute 2,000 soldiers to un troops in lebanon will bolster european participation and help consolidate stability in the country . " undoubtedly , the french decision will help boost european participation , " fuad siniora said in a statement .
" in turn , this will help speed up the formation of the international force , which along with the lebanese army , will protect civilians and achieve security and stability , " he said . the deployment of the french troops " helps strengthen stability in lebanon and allows the country to regain its territories through an israeli withdrawal and the extension of state authority over all territories , " he said . french general to retain command - for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french troops arrived in lebanon on friday the united nations announced thursday that french general alain pellegrini would keep command over the operation to monitor the tenuous ceasefire between israel and the lebanese shiite militia hezbollah . pellegrini , currently in command of the united nations interim force in lebanon , will retain his post after the force undergoes a robust expansion under a un resolution , a un spokesman said friday . " general alain pellegrini leads unifil and he will continue to do so " with the " very strong support " of secretary general kofi annan , un spokesman stephane dujarric told reporters . both france and italy have offered to command unifil , which faces the daunting task of policing the ceasefire between israel and the lebanese shiite militia hezbollah . the appointment of a commander of a un peacekeeping force is the responsibility of the secretary general .
kofi annan , speaking from brussels friday where eu ministers are meeting to thrash out details of the bloc 's deployment strategy , said that he expected to be able to announce the force 's " leadership this afternoon . " unifil to enforce ceasefire alongside lebanese terms of the august 14 truce between israel and hezbollah fighters were laid out in un security council resolution 1701 , under which lebanon was " to secure its borders and other entry points to prevent the entry in lebanon without its consent of arms . " lebanese troops have since deployed along the syrian border in the north and east of the country , military sources said . a reinforced unifil could help intercept arms shipments to hezbollah , the militant shiite group that captured two israeli soldiers on july 12 , sparking a massive riposte and 34 days of heavy fighting . france and italy leading eu efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unifil will be boosted but will not make its target , it seems france was criticized last week after it said that just 200 extra soldiers would join unifil , which was set up 28 years ago as a toothless observer force but which the un resolution aims to revamp into a more robust presence of 15,000 soldiers . at the request of britain , israel , lebanon and the united states , italy stepped forward and offered to lead the force , pledging a reported 3,000 soldiers . spain was prepared to commit a battalion of between 700 and 800 troops to the un force , military sources were quoted as saying by a news report late thursday . greece , finland , latvia , sweden and poland have also indicated they could send soldiers , prompting european commission chief jose manuel barroso to say thursday he was " confident that europe will provide the necessary support to expand the unifil . " eu will fail to meet 15,000-troop target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nations already have un troops in lebanon eu leaders have spoken about contributing 4,000 troops to unifil .
however , even if eu leaders on friday pledge several thousand soldiers , unifil will still be far short of the 15,000 target . deployment plans were complicated however , with threats by syria to close its border in the event of such a move by the un . following talks in helsinki with syrian counterpart walid muallem , finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja said : " they will close the frontier to all traffic " if un troops were posted on the lebanese side . syrian president bashar al-assad had already warned that such a deployment would represent a " hostile " position with regard to his country . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy sending signal to eu , us with lebanon offer as the eu struggles to gather military contributions for lebanon , italy has said it would lead the peacekeeping mission .

why does n't she like me ?
what is a condom ?
generations of confused german teenagers have turned to dr. sommer for honesty - and explicit photos . sandra , 16 , looks up coyly from the pages of bravo , wearing a black choker and nothing else .
boyfriend elias , 18 , grins from the opposite page , also in his natural state . " tell me , why do you love each other ? " reads the headline .
and the young couple tells why - and exactly how . sell this in america , and risk prison time for child pornography . but in germany , this is nothing tawdry . it 's the country 's most popular teenage magazine , and it turns 50 on saturday . sandra and elias ' graphic spread is in the same issue as a free sheet of fake tattoos , a feature about harry potter , and an exclusive report on tokio hotel , the german boy band currently making girls swoon . a german institution since 1969 , dr. sommer combines no-holds-barred sex advice with full-frontal photos . it highlights a basic cultural divide between germany and many other countries - of how openly sex is discussed , especially among youth . " it is not pornography , " says bravo 's deputy editor , alex gernandt .
" it deals with naked people , but in a very sensitive way .
we try to portray young people to tell readers , ' you are not too fat , not too thin .
you are ok the way you are . ' " there are a lot less teenage pregnancies in germany in comparison to the united kingdom or the us , and i think bravo has its share in that success , " gernandt said . breaking taboos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was seduced at 14 , " kristijan says the current dr. sommer , eveline von arx , credits the column with germany 's free sexual attitudes . when it began in 1969 , " dr. sommer really broke taboos , and it was really spectacular to do something like that , " said von arx , who has been writing the column for three years .
" it 's not that spectacular anymore .
people are used to it .
everybody knows it . " each weekly issue of bravo now features photos of two teenagers , generally between 16 and 20 , in the nude , with interviews about their bodies and experiences . anyone under 18 , like sandra , must have his or her parents ' permission to appear . they are paid 400 euros -lrb- a little more than $ 500 -rrb- to pose , and many report the experience is a self-esteem boost , von arx said . weekly letters range from " my boyfriend is once again interested in his former girlfriend " to " everybody 's had sex , only i have n't . "
sample answer : " nowhere does it say that youth have to have sex by a certain time … talk to your boyfriend about it .
tell him how you feel . " " you can be sexy here " bravo 's web site even features explicit petting and positions photo galleries that would n't last a day in other countries . the magazine publishes its eastern european editions with little to no nudity .
but in germany , even teachers and religious leaders seem to welcome the column .
von arx has spoken in schools and was even invited as a youth expert to a big evangelical christian conference last year . gisela gille , chairman of germany 's society for the health of women , said bravo plays an important role in the sexual education of germany 's 12- to 15-year-olds , particularly the lesser educated .
gille said the advice satisfies basic curiosities , but that many teenagers read bravo only for a short time and stop when they become more experienced . tanja reddig , a 17-year-old berlin student , said that she read dr. sommer when she was 12 and 13 and did n't see what the fuss was over the nudity . " you can be sexy here and you do n't get any problems , " she said .
" in america , they ca n't show bodies .
they must hide something .
some teenagers do n't want to ask their parents things , so they could write a letter to dr. sommer . " started by popular demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's youth seem concerned with balancing love and work dr. sommer began during the sexual revolution of 1969 .
bravo was then a strictly entertainment magazine , but its young readers nonetheless kept writing letters about love and sex . so editors figured such a column would increase their readership , according to antje pfeffer of the berlin-based archive of youth culture -lrb- archiv der jugendkulturen -rrb- , which has published a book about bravo 's 50 year history . " dr. sommer immediately was greeted as too open , " pfeffer said . some parents glued the dr. sommer pages together so their teenagers could n't read the column , others banned it from the house .
some schools confiscated it , and in communist east germany , many clamored for smuggled copies . but from the start , the column took its mission quite seriously .
the first dr. sommer , martin goldstein , recalled in the berlin archive 's book that he and his team of social workers , psychologists , sociologists , political scientists , family counselors and parents would spend hours going through letters : i have fallen in love with a sweet young boy .
if he would kiss me , i would be happy for my entire life .
how can i get him to do it ?
i see him almost every day and i already know his name .
but do n't tell me that i should talk to him .
janne , 14 the boys in our village seem to have no interest in us , no matter what we do . we do not know how we can get their attention .
ina , renate , anne and beate , 15 and 16 the team tried to respond in an encouraging , non-judgemental way .
but often , they wondered whether the teenagers had anyone else they could confide in .
they were shocked at how many letters were sent in - sometimes 3,000 to 5,000 a month . " we believed it was because young people wanted to be listened to , " goldstein recalled . evolving topics soon , they were dealing with much thornier issues , such as a 1988 letter titled " my mum 's boyfriend sexually abused me . " by the end of the 1980s , dr. sommer had become more mainstream , and answers seemed freer .
for instance , nicola , 15 , wrote in with the basic question , " how do i show him that i want more ? " the answer : tell him what you want .
or , just push his hand higher . von arx says many of the letters have not changed much over the years .
but recently she has seen more teenagers concerned that they wo n't get ahead in school because they are so distracted by lovesickness . she is often asked if the column is even necessary anymore . " people think our society is very sexualized , and naked bodies and sex are everywhere , and young people should know everything , " she said .
" but they do n't know anything sometimes .

it 's expected to aid anti-terror measures at the eu-level . when germany 's anti-terror register finally comes into being , it wo n't just make things easier for german officials - it will also improve cooperation with the european police force , europol , which is already working on an eu-wide counter-terrorism database . at its headquarters in the hague , europol has computers where eu member states can save names and relevant details about terrorist suspects or witnesses .
additionally , the databanks contain information on organized crime , drug smuggling and human trafficking .
the computer system , tecs , can compare and analyze as many as a million data sets . the data is entered into the system directly by the 25 eu member states .
each country is represented by its own liaison officer , or elos , in the hague .
as a rule , only these liaison officers have access to the national databanks . if a member state wants to find out whether there is information in tecs on a terror suspect , europol puts together an information packet - a service that europol 's director , max-peter ratzel , is intent on putting first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol director max-peter ratzel " terrorism is , of course , very much in the foreground , because that 's where the biggest risks lie , " ratzel said .

" we have to stay on the ball . " a directive by the eu 's interior ministry to retain internet and phone data to aid police investigations is , after the introduction of europe-wide arrest warrants , a necessary step , frattini said .
he is also working on other legislative measures to put on the table by the end of this year .

it 's also looking into why and how muslim youths in europe are being radicalized . personal freedom still a concern frattini stresses that civil liberties should not be sacrificed in the drive for better protection from terrorists .
in this respect , he said , the united states with its far-reaching curtailments on telecommunications secrecy is no role model for the eu . " this is our political challenge , " frattini said . "

" " we may have a unique opportunity to transform the cessation of hostilities into a durable ceasefire , " he added in brussels . the pledges came after france , which currently commands unifil , committed itself late thursday to a total deployment of 2,000 soldiers . but french president jacques chirac , who was speaking separately friday in paris , said a level of 15,000 troops was " excessive " and it made " no sense " to have such a large contingent alongside the lebanese army in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some un peacekeepers from france are already on the ground in lebanon in brussels though , finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said the total european contribution would be " something between 5,600 and 6,900 " soldiers , as well as air and naval assets . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy put the eu deployment at " 6,500 to 7,000 soldiers on the ground , which means that the spinal column of the reinforced unifil will be european . " the force is crucial to shoring up un resolution 1701 , which on august 14 brought an end to the 34-day conflict in lebanon between israel and hezbollah militants . annan said bangladesh , malaysia and indonesia had offered to participate in unifil - though israel has opposed contributions from those muslim countries because of an absence of diplomatic relations . the un chief also proposed that france see out its current term as commander of the force , which expires at the end of january , after which italy would take over .
italy is expected to supply up to 3,000 soldiers , which would make it the biggest contributor to the force . french role and reversal france , though , played a key role diplomatically in revamping the force , having co-authored the un resolution with the united states .
it also enjoys close relations with lebanon , a former protectorate .
douste-blazy said france had " absolutely " no problem with the change of command . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac , right , and angela merkel during a press conference in paris on friday chirac 's announcement that he was sending 1,600 more troops to lebanon came after international criticism over his initial , emergency deployment of just 200 soldiers to join the 200 already in unifil . a vanguard of 170 french reinforcements arrived in lebanon on friday , making france the only country so far to have actually sent troops .
chirac said he agreed to send the extra two battalions after winning a robust mandate for unifil and guarantees the force would be able to cope if hostilities flare up again . " i wonder how it would have been judged if i had raced off like a mad dog without thinking or securing minimum guarantees , " he said in paris . he also questioned the goal of boosting the force to 15,000 soldiers , calling that " a totally excessive figure " given lebanon 's relatively small size . other eu contributors the announcement of the french reinforcements spurred some of the other eu countries into firming up previously vague promises to contribute . spain was said to be ready to send 1,000 to 1,200 soldiers , substantially more than the 800 initially cited in media reports . poland 's private television station tvn24 reported foreign minister anna fotyga as saying warsaw 's total contribution would be around 500 troops which includes 214 already serving with unifil . belgian foreign minister guy verhofstadt said his country would provide 300 soldiers by late september or early october , with the possibility of adding nearly 100 more later .
" peace in the middle east is an absolute necessity , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland 's foreign minister erkki tuomioja , right , and german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier finland pledged 250 soldiers . britain 's europe minister geoff hoon said that while his country 's military - heavily deployed in iraq and afghanistan - was too stretched to send ground troops , it might supply " specialized " units . other countries , notably greece and latvia , have also indicated they could send soldiers , but no details were provided friday . germany , wary of potential confrontations with israelis because of its nazi past , is prepared to offer naval units , not troops , as is sweden . the force is also to help lebanon halt arms smuggling to hezbollah over the border with syria , considered a main sponsor of the lebanese militia , if beirut requests . syria is concerned at the deployment of foreign troops in lebanon - from which it was forced to withdraw its soldiers last year under un pressure led by france - and has cut power supplies to its neighbor and warned it may close the border . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french troops arrive in lebanon as part of unifil deployment following an initial deployment of engineers , more french troops arrived in lebanon friday as part of the pledged 2,000-strong contingent which would form part of a un force to maintain the current ceasefire .

the source gave no further details . second suspect questioned in lebanon meanwhile , investigators are hoping that more of their questions about the plot will be answered following hamad 's interrogation , at which officials from germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- are present . " we 're confident that he will break his silence and that we 'll know much more later in the day , " bka president jörg ziercke told public broadcaster ard on friday morning . both hamad and el hajdib were identified on security camera footage dragging suitcases loaded with crudely made bombs onto trains in cologne . did they have help ? while investigators and political leaders have been pleased about the quick succession of arrests , big questions remain about the case , including whether the men were working alone or had the support of a terrorist network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziercke says it 's too early to say if the men belong to an international terrorist network ziercke said it is still too early to say if they belonged to an international network . " we assume that this concerns a terrorist group here in germany , which is also the view of the federal prosecutors , " he told german broadcaster n-tv . " we know that the suspects had accomplices .
at the moment we 're trying to determine whether this was an international network or if it was an autonomous terrorist group in germany . " german terror expert , elmar thevessen , has pointed out that hamad and el hajdib lived hundreds of miles apart , raising the question of how they were able to communicate and gain each other 's trust .
according to testimony from el hajdib , the two men first met in germany . " we know from jihad hamad , who gave himself up , that he only arrived in cologne in february of this year , just five months before the crime , " thevessen said .
" where did the contacts come from and how could he so quickly get himself set up to prepare an attack that almost succeeded ? " searches of hamad 's apartment have turned up damning evidence , including dna that matches that on the suitcases , as well as receipts for the gas canister and gas used in the failed plot . the plot has reminded germans that they are not immune to international terrorism .
wolfgang bosbach , a domestic policy expert for berlin 's conservative cdu / csu parliamentary group , has warned that there are an estimated 32,000 islamists in germany and some 3,000 of these were considered extremists .
that , he said , represents a " considerable threat potential for our country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.08.2006 opinion : deficit-sinner germany mending its ways großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany may manage this year to keep its deficit down to the level required by the eu stability pact , which underpins the euro .
instead of raising taxes , however , it should reduce spending , says dw 's karl zawadzky . first the good news : germany managed to reduce its national deficit to 2.5 percent in the first half of this year .
the positive trend can be traced back to a broader economic upswing , which brought in increased tax revenues . the public deficit is n't likely to increase in the second half of 2006 , and germany may even finally be able to shed its stigma in the european union as the " stability pact rogue " - an image it had earned through several years of higher-than-permitted debt statistics .
the national deficit in the first half of 2005 was , for example , as high as 3.7 percent . according to figures released thursday by the federal statistical office , the national deficit in the first half of this year amounted to 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 35.8 billion -rrb- in real numbers , which is a good 12 billion euros less than during the same time frame last year . social security contributions , on the other hand , have remained stagnant due to only minimal changes in wages .
however , expenditures made by the government unemployment agencies this year dropped dramatically as a result of cutbacks . finance minister peer steinbrück , who bore the consequences of the political demise of his predecessor hans eichel , is reluctant to be too hasty in celebrating the success reports , lest he eat his words in just a few months ' time . tax hikes to maintain low deficit ? the government has emphasized that it will stick to its promise that , starting next year , germany 's national deficit will not exceed the maximum deficit agreed upon in the eu 's stability pact .
this contractual agreement stipulates that the deficit of all public budgets , including social security , may not exceed 3 percent of the country 's gross domestic product . thanks to positive market conditions in recent months and the higher tax revenues that resulted , germany wo n't violate the pact this year .
even a slight economic downturn will not prevent germany from meeting the deficit standard in the future . now for the not-so-good news : in order to keep the deficit within the limitations set by the stability pact , hefty tax hikes are necessary . at the beginning of 2007 , sales tax will be raised from 16 to 19 percent .
tax increases in other areas are planned as well , though they wo n't be quite as big as the sales tax hike . taken together , tax revenues are expected to increase by more than 20 billion euros per year , which will keep germany on the safe side as far as the stability pact criteria are concerned . cut spending instead of raising taxes however , burdening the taxpayers in order to meet eu deficit criteria is problematic . federal , state and local expenditures will continue to increase , even if only slightly .
market fluctuation aside , germany has a structural problem : germans pay more in tax and social contributions than those in other industrial countries . considerable reductions in spending - not another tax hike for the already burdened taxpayers - would be a better approach to trimming down the national deficit . karl zawadzky is deutsche welle 's chief business correspondent . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany up in arms over minister 's holiday comments germany 's finance minister has sparked outrage by suggesting germans should spend less on their annual holidays and instead put money aside for their old age .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.08.2006 fighting terrorism at the eu level großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol began focusing on anti-terror measures after the 9/11 attacks observers of the debate in germany on the pros and cons of a nation-wide anti-terror register say the question is when , not if , such a database will be created .
it 's expected to aid anti-terror measures at the eu-level . when germany 's anti-terror register finally comes into being , it wo n't just make things easier for german officials - it will also improve cooperation with the european police force , europol , which is already working on an eu-wide counter-terrorism database . at its headquarters in the hague , europol has computers where eu member states can save names and relevant details about terrorist suspects or witnesses .
additionally , the databanks contain information on organized crime , drug smuggling and human trafficking .
the computer system , tecs , can compare and analyze as many as a million data sets . the data is entered into the system directly by the 25 eu member states .
each country is represented by its own liaison officer , or elos , in the hague .
as a rule , only these liaison officers have access to the national databanks . if a member state wants to find out whether there is information in tecs on a terror suspect , europol puts together an information packet - a service that europol 's director , max-peter ratzel , is intent on putting first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol director max-peter ratzel " terrorism is , of course , very much in the foreground , because that 's where the biggest risks lie , " ratzel said .
" we have to do everything possible in order to identify and eliminate threats , so that we can offer member states the means to avoid danger .
we only need a few people to filter out the right information ; the member states are then responsible for acting on that information . " privacy advocates are critical though , about the fact that the member states can relatively freely feed data into tecs which is then consolidated into suspect profiles .
tecs saves the data for a period of at least three years . europol got its start in the mid-90s as an agency to fight drugs-related crime .
gradually , it 's grown into an institution with a staff of 500 whose main task is to organize information exchanges . other eu networks in addition to europol 's databanks , five of the largest eu states - france , britain , italy , spain and germany - share a computer network aimed at fighting terrorism .
seven states - france , spain , the netherlands , belgium , luxembourg , austria and germany - have also signed a pact to improve cross-border cooperation of their police forces when it comes to the arrest , search and trailing of suspects . but cross-border cooperation of police is by no means comprehensively regulated across the eu , and many states have misgivings .
eu commissioner for justice and security franco frattini has been pushing for stronger cooperation , and is hopeful progress will be made given the current threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following the foiled plot to blow up planes flying from britain to the us , germany is again focused on security for air and rail passengers " there is now , i think , a consensus among the member states that it 's important to really work together , " frattini said .
" we have to stay on the ball . " a directive by the eu 's interior ministry to retain internet and phone data to aid police investigations is , after the introduction of europe-wide arrest warrants , a necessary step , frattini said .
he is also working on other legislative measures to put on the table by the end of this year .
the eu would like to introduce tougher controls on the production and trade in explosives , for example .
it 's also looking into why and how muslim youths in europe are being radicalized . personal freedom still a concern frattini stresses that civil liberties should not be sacrificed in the drive for better protection from terrorists .
in this respect , he said , the united states with its far-reaching curtailments on telecommunications secrecy is no role model for the eu . " this is our political challenge , " frattini said . "
if terrorists force us to restrict our freedom , then the terrorists win .
we can never allow that to happen . " although much has been achieved when it comes to improving police cooperation at the european level , the eu 's anti-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries bemoans the fact that in some areas , progress has been too slow .
he said he is hopeful that eu interior ministers will eventually give up their opposition to majority-rules decisions at the european level . " there 's a lot of demand for the eu to help its member states more effectively , " de vries said .
" i hope that the discussion about a transition from unanimous to majority decisions will be a motivating factor to do more than we have in the past .

a first french contingent of 49 engineers arrived on saturday . " i have decided to send two extra battalions into the field to expand our unifil contingent .
two thousand french soldiers will thus be placed under the un flag in lebanon , " french president chirac said in a televised address on thursday evening . each french battalion counts 800 soldiers .

i encourage other nations to make contributions as well , " bush said in a statement released by the white house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac answered the call " the fact that the french have decided to send troops will bring in additional nations , " miri eisen , a senior policy advisory to israeli prime minister ehud olmert , told the bbc . lebanon 's prime minister also praised france saying that its decision to contribute 2,000 soldiers to un troops in lebanon will bolster european participation and help consolidate stability in the country . " undoubtedly , the french decision will help boost european participation , " fuad siniora said in a statement .
" in turn , this will help speed up the formation of the international force , which along with the lebanese army , will protect civilians and achieve security and stability , " he said . the deployment of the french troops " helps strengthen stability in lebanon and allows the country to regain its territories through an israeli withdrawal and the extension of state authority over all territories , " he said . french general to retain command - for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french troops arrived in lebanon on friday the united nations announced thursday that french general alain pellegrini would keep command over the operation to monitor the tenuous ceasefire between israel and the lebanese shiite militia hezbollah . pellegrini , currently in command of the united nations interim force in lebanon , will retain his post after the force undergoes a robust expansion under a un resolution , a un spokesman said friday . " general alain pellegrini leads unifil and he will continue to do so " with the " very strong support " of secretary general kofi annan , un spokesman stephane dujarric told reporters . both france and italy have offered to command unifil , which faces the daunting task of policing the ceasefire between israel and the lebanese shiite militia hezbollah . the appointment of a commander of a un peacekeeping force is the responsibility of the secretary general .
kofi annan , speaking from brussels friday where eu ministers are meeting to thrash out details of the bloc 's deployment strategy , said that he expected to be able to announce the force 's " leadership this afternoon . " unifil to enforce ceasefire alongside lebanese terms of the august 14 truce between israel and hezbollah fighters were laid out in un security council resolution 1701 , under which lebanon was " to secure its borders and other entry points to prevent the entry in lebanon without its consent of arms . " lebanese troops have since deployed along the syrian border in the north and east of the country , military sources said . a reinforced unifil could help intercept arms shipments to hezbollah , the militant shiite group that captured two israeli soldiers on july 12 , sparking a massive riposte and 34 days of heavy fighting . france and italy leading eu efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unifil will be boosted but will not make its target , it seems france was criticized last week after it said that just 200 extra soldiers would join unifil , which was set up 28 years ago as a toothless observer force but which the un resolution aims to revamp into a more robust presence of 15,000 soldiers . at the request of britain , israel , lebanon and the united states , italy stepped forward and offered to lead the force , pledging a reported 3,000 soldiers . spain was prepared to commit a battalion of between 700 and 800 troops to the un force , military sources were quoted as saying by a news report late thursday . greece , finland , latvia , sweden and poland have also indicated they could send soldiers , prompting european commission chief jose manuel barroso to say thursday he was " confident that europe will provide the necessary support to expand the unifil .

kurnaz will not attend as he is with his family and needs time to adjust to his freedom , he said . " he will undergo medical treatment and will not be appearing in public , " docke said .
" mr kurnaz has been through hell . " earlier , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said an agreement on the release of kurnaz had come after the successful conclusion of long negotiations between the us and german governments . no proof of terrorist activity kurnaz , dubbed the " bremen taliban " after the northern german city where he lived , was arrested in pakistan in late 2001 , and taken to guantanamo bay in 2002 on suspicion of having fought for al qaeda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allegations of torture at guantanamo bay have prompted widespread protest from human rights organizations a us court found allegations of kurnaz 's involvement in terrorist activities to be untrue .
his release follows months of talks between the us and german governments .
chancellor angela merkel reportedly brought up the issue when she met with president george w. bush in stralsund last month . kurnaz said he suffered abuse including sexual humiliation , water torture and the desecration of islam at guantanamo . according to reports in der spiegel , berlin has refused us requests that kurnaz be put under constant surveillance and his passport confiscated .
however , he will not be free to completely return to his old life .
prosecutors in bremen intend to investigate kurnaz on suspicion of involvement in a criminal network .
experts close to the case say kurnaz 's detention at guantanamo was unlawful . us and german intelligence concluded as early as 2002 that kurnaz had no connection to al qaeda , the taliban or any terrorist threat , said baher azmy , a seton hall law school professor who has represented kurnaz since mid-2004 . " the government 's evidence against kurnaz has ranged from incredibly tangential to at times preposterous , " azmy said in a statement . " kurnaz 's case lays to shameful waste the government 's repeated assertions that guantanamo houses only hardened terrorists or persons captured on the battlefield , " azmy said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de release of german-born guantanamo prisoner expected soon top german politicians have been advocating his release for months .
now it looks like murat kurnaz from bremen will return home by the end of the month , after more than four years at guantanamo .
-lrb- aug .
21 , 2006 -rrb- " bremen taliban " release anticipated a turkish man living in bremen is expected to be allowed to return to germany from the us military base in guantanamo bay .
german authorities may have delayed his release by years , according to media reports .
-lrb- march 29 , 2006 -rrb- ' bremen taliban ' or victim of circumstance ?
a year ago , murat kurnaz left bremen to " see and experience the koran " in pakistan .
since then , he 's been locked up at guantanamo bay , suspected of fighting for the taliban .
but german investigators say there 's no proof .

" it 's a great draw for us .
our goal is to reach the quarter-finals .
it 's possible even if arsenal and porto will be favorites , " he said . a true competition of champions the money-spinning group stages of european soccer 's most prestigious competition also sees 2005 winners liverpool drawn with dutch champions psv eindhoven , bordeaux and turkey 's galatasaray in group c. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool won in dramatic style in 2005 spanish giants real madrid , nine-time european champions , are drawn in the same pool as five-time french champions lyon , as they were last year .

it 's expected to aid anti-terror measures at the eu-level . when germany 's anti-terror register finally comes into being , it wo n't just make things easier for german officials - it will also improve cooperation with the european police force , europol , which is already working on an eu-wide counter-terrorism database . at its headquarters in the hague , europol has computers where eu member states can save names and relevant details about terrorist suspects or witnesses .
additionally , the databanks contain information on organized crime , drug smuggling and human trafficking .
the computer system , tecs , can compare and analyze as many as a million data sets . the data is entered into the system directly by the 25 eu member states .
each country is represented by its own liaison officer , or elos , in the hague .
as a rule , only these liaison officers have access to the national databanks . if a member state wants to find out whether there is information in tecs on a terror suspect , europol puts together an information packet - a service that europol 's director , max-peter ratzel , is intent on putting first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol director max-peter ratzel " terrorism is , of course , very much in the foreground , because that 's where the biggest risks lie , " ratzel said .
" we have to do everything possible in order to identify and eliminate threats , so that we can offer member states the means to avoid danger .
we only need a few people to filter out the right information ; the member states are then responsible for acting on that information . " privacy advocates are critical though , about the fact that the member states can relatively freely feed data into tecs which is then consolidated into suspect profiles .
tecs saves the data for a period of at least three years . europol got its start in the mid-90s as an agency to fight drugs-related crime .
gradually , it 's grown into an institution with a staff of 500 whose main task is to organize information exchanges . other eu networks in addition to europol 's databanks , five of the largest eu states - france , britain , italy , spain and germany - share a computer network aimed at fighting terrorism .
seven states - france , spain , the netherlands , belgium , luxembourg , austria and germany - have also signed a pact to improve cross-border cooperation of their police forces when it comes to the arrest , search and trailing of suspects . but cross-border cooperation of police is by no means comprehensively regulated across the eu , and many states have misgivings .
eu commissioner for justice and security franco frattini has been pushing for stronger cooperation , and is hopeful progress will be made given the current threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following the foiled plot to blow up planes flying from britain to the us , germany is again focused on security for air and rail passengers " there is now , i think , a consensus among the member states that it 's important to really work together , " frattini said .
" we have to stay on the ball . " a directive by the eu 's interior ministry to retain internet and phone data to aid police investigations is , after the introduction of europe-wide arrest warrants , a necessary step , frattini said .
he is also working on other legislative measures to put on the table by the end of this year .
the eu would like to introduce tougher controls on the production and trade in explosives , for example .
it 's also looking into why and how muslim youths in europe are being radicalized . personal freedom still a concern frattini stresses that civil liberties should not be sacrificed in the drive for better protection from terrorists .
in this respect , he said , the united states with its far-reaching curtailments on telecommunications secrecy is no role model for the eu . " this is our political challenge , " frattini said . "
if terrorists force us to restrict our freedom , then the terrorists win .
we can never allow that to happen . " although much has been achieved when it comes to improving police cooperation at the european level , the eu 's anti-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries bemoans the fact that in some areas , progress has been too slow .
he said he is hopeful that eu interior ministers will eventually give up their opposition to majority-rules decisions at the european level . " there 's a lot of demand for the eu to help its member states more effectively , " de vries said .

instead of raising taxes , however , it should reduce spending , says dw 's karl zawadzky . first the good news : germany managed to reduce its national deficit to 2.5 percent in the first half of this year .
the positive trend can be traced back to a broader economic upswing , which brought in increased tax revenues . the public deficit is n't likely to increase in the second half of 2006 , and germany may even finally be able to shed its stigma in the european union as the " stability pact rogue " - an image it had earned through several years of higher-than-permitted debt statistics .
the national deficit in the first half of 2005 was , for example , as high as 3.7 percent . according to figures released thursday by the federal statistical office , the national deficit in the first half of this year amounted to 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 35.8 billion -rrb- in real numbers , which is a good 12 billion euros less than during the same time frame last year . social security contributions , on the other hand , have remained stagnant due to only minimal changes in wages .
however , expenditures made by the government unemployment agencies this year dropped dramatically as a result of cutbacks . finance minister peer steinbrück , who bore the consequences of the political demise of his predecessor hans eichel , is reluctant to be too hasty in celebrating the success reports , lest he eat his words in just a few months ' time . tax hikes to maintain low deficit ? the government has emphasized that it will stick to its promise that , starting next year , germany 's national deficit will not exceed the maximum deficit agreed upon in the eu 's stability pact .
this contractual agreement stipulates that the deficit of all public budgets , including social security , may not exceed 3 percent of the country 's gross domestic product . thanks to positive market conditions in recent months and the higher tax revenues that resulted , germany wo n't violate the pact this year .
even a slight economic downturn will not prevent germany from meeting the deficit standard in the future . now for the not-so-good news : in order to keep the deficit within the limitations set by the stability pact , hefty tax hikes are necessary . at the beginning of 2007 , sales tax will be raised from 16 to 19 percent .
tax increases in other areas are planned as well , though they wo n't be quite as big as the sales tax hike . taken together , tax revenues are expected to increase by more than 20 billion euros per year , which will keep germany on the safe side as far as the stability pact criteria are concerned . cut spending instead of raising taxes however , burdening the taxpayers in order to meet eu deficit criteria is problematic . federal , state and local expenditures will continue to increase , even if only slightly .
market fluctuation aside , germany has a structural problem : germans pay more in tax and social contributions than those in other industrial countries . considerable reductions in spending - not another tax hike for the already burdened taxpayers - would be a better approach to trimming down the national deficit . karl zawadzky is deutsche welle 's chief business correspondent . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany up in arms over minister 's holiday comments germany 's finance minister has sparked outrage by suggesting germans should spend less on their annual holidays and instead put money aside for their old age .

why does n't she like me ?
what is a condom ?
generations of confused german teenagers have turned to dr. sommer for honesty - and explicit photos . sandra , 16 , looks up coyly from the pages of bravo , wearing a black choker and nothing else .
boyfriend elias , 18 , grins from the opposite page , also in his natural state . " tell me , why do you love each other ? " reads the headline .
and the young couple tells why - and exactly how . sell this in america , and risk prison time for child pornography . but in germany , this is nothing tawdry . it 's the country 's most popular teenage magazine , and it turns 50 on saturday . sandra and elias ' graphic spread is in the same issue as a free sheet of fake tattoos , a feature about harry potter , and an exclusive report on tokio hotel , the german boy band currently making girls swoon . a german institution since 1969 , dr. sommer combines no-holds-barred sex advice with full-frontal photos . it highlights a basic cultural divide between germany and many other countries - of how openly sex is discussed , especially among youth . " it is not pornography , " says bravo 's deputy editor , alex gernandt .
" it deals with naked people , but in a very sensitive way .
we try to portray young people to tell readers , ' you are not too fat , not too thin .
you are ok the way you are . ' " there are a lot less teenage pregnancies in germany in comparison to the united kingdom or the us , and i think bravo has its share in that success , " gernandt said . breaking taboos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was seduced at 14 , " kristijan says the current dr. sommer , eveline von arx , credits the column with germany 's free sexual attitudes . when it began in 1969 , " dr. sommer really broke taboos , and it was really spectacular to do something like that , " said von arx , who has been writing the column for three years .
" it 's not that spectacular anymore .
people are used to it .
everybody knows it . " each weekly issue of bravo now features photos of two teenagers , generally between 16 and 20 , in the nude , with interviews about their bodies and experiences . anyone under 18 , like sandra , must have his or her parents ' permission to appear . they are paid 400 euros -lrb- a little more than $ 500 -rrb- to pose , and many report the experience is a self-esteem boost , von arx said . weekly letters range from " my boyfriend is once again interested in his former girlfriend " to " everybody 's had sex , only i have n't . "
sample answer : " nowhere does it say that youth have to have sex by a certain time … talk to your boyfriend about it .
tell him how you feel . " " you can be sexy here " bravo 's web site even features explicit petting and positions photo galleries that would n't last a day in other countries . the magazine publishes its eastern european editions with little to no nudity .
but in germany , even teachers and religious leaders seem to welcome the column .
von arx has spoken in schools and was even invited as a youth expert to a big evangelical christian conference last year . gisela gille , chairman of germany 's society for the health of women , said bravo plays an important role in the sexual education of germany 's 12- to 15-year-olds , particularly the lesser educated .
gille said the advice satisfies basic curiosities , but that many teenagers read bravo only for a short time and stop when they become more experienced . tanja reddig , a 17-year-old berlin student , said that she read dr. sommer when she was 12 and 13 and did n't see what the fuss was over the nudity . " you can be sexy here and you do n't get any problems , " she said .
" in america , they ca n't show bodies .
they must hide something .
some teenagers do n't want to ask their parents things , so they could write a letter to dr. sommer . " started by popular demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's youth seem concerned with balancing love and work dr. sommer began during the sexual revolution of 1969 .
bravo was then a strictly entertainment magazine , but its young readers nonetheless kept writing letters about love and sex . so editors figured such a column would increase their readership , according to antje pfeffer of the berlin-based archive of youth culture -lrb- archiv der jugendkulturen -rrb- , which has published a book about bravo 's 50 year history . " dr. sommer immediately was greeted as too open , " pfeffer said . some parents glued the dr. sommer pages together so their teenagers could n't read the column , others banned it from the house .
some schools confiscated it , and in communist east germany , many clamored for smuggled copies . but from the start , the column took its mission quite seriously .
the first dr. sommer , martin goldstein , recalled in the berlin archive 's book that he and his team of social workers , psychologists , sociologists , political scientists , family counselors and parents would spend hours going through letters : i have fallen in love with a sweet young boy .
if he would kiss me , i would be happy for my entire life .
how can i get him to do it ?
i see him almost every day and i already know his name .
but do n't tell me that i should talk to him .
janne , 14 the boys in our village seem to have no interest in us , no matter what we do . we do not know how we can get their attention .
ina , renate , anne and beate , 15 and 16 the team tried to respond in an encouraging , non-judgemental way .
but often , they wondered whether the teenagers had anyone else they could confide in .
they were shocked at how many letters were sent in - sometimes 3,000 to 5,000 a month . " we believed it was because young people wanted to be listened to , " goldstein recalled . evolving topics soon , they were dealing with much thornier issues , such as a 1988 letter titled " my mum 's boyfriend sexually abused me . " by the end of the 1980s , dr. sommer had become more mainstream , and answers seemed freer .
for instance , nicola , 15 , wrote in with the basic question , " how do i show him that i want more ? " the answer : tell him what you want .
or , just push his hand higher . von arx says many of the letters have not changed much over the years .
but recently she has seen more teenagers concerned that they wo n't get ahead in school because they are so distracted by lovesickness . she is often asked if the column is even necessary anymore . " people think our society is very sexualized , and naked bodies and sex are everywhere , and young people should know everything , " she said .
" but they do n't know anything sometimes .

many of the demonstrators were members of berlin 's jewish community or the conservative christian democrats . however , there were some there who belonged to the far-left and sported all the accoutrements of those who are known as autonomen in germany - black clothing , buttons or patches with political slogans or insignia , and often scarves , sunglasses or baseball caps to make them harder to identify . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators often clash with police but this time they had n't come to disrupt the demonstration , shout out anti-zionist slogans or get into tussles with police , as they often do .
the group of anti-germans had actually organized the demonstration under the slogan " unconditional solidarity with israel , " one of the core positions of their movement . such a stance puts the group firmly at odds with the majority viewpoint of germany 's far-left movement , which since the 1970s has been overwhelmingly pro-palestinian and very critical of israeli policy .

" the anti-german movement can be traced back to the fall of the berlin wall , where some on the far left demonstrated against reunification , warning that a stronger germany could result in a new militarism and even a " fourth reich . "
they based their slogan on the phrase often used in holocaust remembrance ceremonies : " never again . "
the anti-germans went further , rallying around " germany , never again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators at a anti-nazi rally as time went on , the group began to show more support for the united states .
in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of the destruction of dresden by the allies , the anti-germans praised the bombing of the civil population , since in their view , so many of them had supported the nazi regime . but the movement really got behind the stars and stripes after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , which they saw as anti-semitic and targeted at israel .
to them , it marked the rise of a new type of fascism .
this time is was n't from the far right , but from radical islam and it had to be fought .
the us , in their eyes , was the only one willing to fight it . " islamic terrorists and states such as syria and iran want to liquidate israel , " said hermann gremliza , publisher of the leftist magazine konkret and one of the leading figures in the anti-german movement , in an e-mail response .
" so -lrb- anti-germans -rrb- act according to the motto : the enemy of my enemy is my friend . " just after the war in iraq broke out in 2003 , the anti-german magazine bahamas wrote an editorial entitled " bush - the man of peace ! " whose side are they on ? these kinds of positions have put the group in sometimes violent opposition to the traditional far left .
when anti-germans show up at left-wing demonstrations with signs supporting american policy or israel , they are generally not welcomed warmly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would che have supported george w. bush ?
" whoever carries an israeli flag is insulted and spit upon , " gremliza said .
" but what do you expect , we 're in germany . " the traditional far left accuses the anti-germans of getting in bed with the bourgeoisie .
some writers in the anti-german camp even write occasionally for the online site of the newsmagazine der spiegel or even such bastions of conservatism as the daily die welt . observers say that means they have an influence beyond their actual numbers , which are estimated between 500 and 3,000 .
gremliza , however , said around 50,000 people read his magazine konkret . anti-german goals , he says , are to uncover what group members see as the hypocrisy of a german foreign policy that has been harmful to israel and helped the rise of a new " islamic " fascism , which they see as a direct descendent of the form practiced by the nazis . " germany wants an alliance with the islamic world - against the us , " he said , despite angela merkel 's close ties to her american counterpart .

why does n't she like me ?
what is a condom ?
generations of confused german teenagers have turned to dr. sommer for honesty - and explicit photos . sandra , 16 , looks up coyly from the pages of bravo , wearing a black choker and nothing else .
boyfriend elias , 18 , grins from the opposite page , also in his natural state . " tell me , why do you love each other ? " reads the headline .
and the young couple tells why - and exactly how . sell this in america , and risk prison time for child pornography . but in germany , this is nothing tawdry . it 's the country 's most popular teenage magazine , and it turns 50 on saturday . sandra and elias ' graphic spread is in the same issue as a free sheet of fake tattoos , a feature about harry potter , and an exclusive report on tokio hotel , the german boy band currently making girls swoon . a german institution since 1969 , dr. sommer combines no-holds-barred sex advice with full-frontal photos . it highlights a basic cultural divide between germany and many other countries - of how openly sex is discussed , especially among youth . " it is not pornography , " says bravo 's deputy editor , alex gernandt .
" it deals with naked people , but in a very sensitive way .
we try to portray young people to tell readers , ' you are not too fat , not too thin .
you are ok the way you are . ' " there are a lot less teenage pregnancies in germany in comparison to the united kingdom or the us , and i think bravo has its share in that success , " gernandt said . breaking taboos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was seduced at 14 , " kristijan says the current dr. sommer , eveline von arx , credits the column with germany 's free sexual attitudes . when it began in 1969 , " dr. sommer really broke taboos , and it was really spectacular to do something like that , " said von arx , who has been writing the column for three years .
" it 's not that spectacular anymore .
people are used to it .
everybody knows it . " each weekly issue of bravo now features photos of two teenagers , generally between 16 and 20 , in the nude , with interviews about their bodies and experiences . anyone under 18 , like sandra , must have his or her parents ' permission to appear . they are paid 400 euros -lrb- a little more than $ 500 -rrb- to pose , and many report the experience is a self-esteem boost , von arx said . weekly letters range from " my boyfriend is once again interested in his former girlfriend " to " everybody 's had sex , only i have n't . "
sample answer : " nowhere does it say that youth have to have sex by a certain time … talk to your boyfriend about it .
tell him how you feel . " " you can be sexy here " bravo 's web site even features explicit petting and positions photo galleries that would n't last a day in other countries . the magazine publishes its eastern european editions with little to no nudity .
but in germany , even teachers and religious leaders seem to welcome the column .
von arx has spoken in schools and was even invited as a youth expert to a big evangelical christian conference last year . gisela gille , chairman of germany 's society for the health of women , said bravo plays an important role in the sexual education of germany 's 12- to 15-year-olds , particularly the lesser educated .
gille said the advice satisfies basic curiosities , but that many teenagers read bravo only for a short time and stop when they become more experienced . tanja reddig , a 17-year-old berlin student , said that she read dr. sommer when she was 12 and 13 and did n't see what the fuss was over the nudity . " you can be sexy here and you do n't get any problems , " she said .
" in america , they ca n't show bodies .
they must hide something .
some teenagers do n't want to ask their parents things , so they could write a letter to dr. sommer . " started by popular demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's youth seem concerned with balancing love and work dr. sommer began during the sexual revolution of 1969 .
bravo was then a strictly entertainment magazine , but its young readers nonetheless kept writing letters about love and sex . so editors figured such a column would increase their readership , according to antje pfeffer of the berlin-based archive of youth culture -lrb- archiv der jugendkulturen -rrb- , which has published a book about bravo 's 50 year history . " dr. sommer immediately was greeted as too open , " pfeffer said . some parents glued the dr. sommer pages together so their teenagers could n't read the column , others banned it from the house .
some schools confiscated it , and in communist east germany , many clamored for smuggled copies . but from the start , the column took its mission quite seriously .
the first dr. sommer , martin goldstein , recalled in the berlin archive 's book that he and his team of social workers , psychologists , sociologists , political scientists , family counselors and parents would spend hours going through letters : i have fallen in love with a sweet young boy .
if he would kiss me , i would be happy for my entire life .
how can i get him to do it ?
i see him almost every day and i already know his name .
but do n't tell me that i should talk to him .
janne , 14 the boys in our village seem to have no interest in us , no matter what we do . we do not know how we can get their attention .
ina , renate , anne and beate , 15 and 16 the team tried to respond in an encouraging , non-judgemental way .
but often , they wondered whether the teenagers had anyone else they could confide in .
they were shocked at how many letters were sent in - sometimes 3,000 to 5,000 a month . " we believed it was because young people wanted to be listened to , " goldstein recalled . evolving topics soon , they were dealing with much thornier issues , such as a 1988 letter titled " my mum 's boyfriend sexually abused me . " by the end of the 1980s , dr. sommer had become more mainstream , and answers seemed freer .
for instance , nicola , 15 , wrote in with the basic question , " how do i show him that i want more ? " the answer : tell him what you want .
or , just push his hand higher . von arx says many of the letters have not changed much over the years .
but recently she has seen more teenagers concerned that they wo n't get ahead in school because they are so distracted by lovesickness . she is often asked if the column is even necessary anymore . " people think our society is very sexualized , and naked bodies and sex are everywhere , and young people should know everything , " she said .

generations of confused german teenagers have turned to dr. sommer for honesty - and explicit photos . sandra , 16 , looks up coyly from the pages of bravo , wearing a black choker and nothing else .
boyfriend elias , 18 , grins from the opposite page , also in his natural state . " tell me , why do you love each other ? " reads the headline .
and the young couple tells why - and exactly how . sell this in america , and risk prison time for child pornography . but in germany , this is nothing tawdry . it 's the country 's most popular teenage magazine , and it turns 50 on saturday . sandra and elias ' graphic spread is in the same issue as a free sheet of fake tattoos , a feature about harry potter , and an exclusive report on tokio hotel , the german boy band currently making girls swoon . a german institution since 1969 , dr. sommer combines no-holds-barred sex advice with full-frontal photos . it highlights a basic cultural divide between germany and many other countries - of how openly sex is discussed , especially among youth . " it is not pornography , " says bravo 's deputy editor , alex gernandt .
" it deals with naked people , but in a very sensitive way .
we try to portray young people to tell readers , ' you are not too fat , not too thin .
you are ok the way you are . ' " there are a lot less teenage pregnancies in germany in comparison to the united kingdom or the us , and i think bravo has its share in that success , " gernandt said . breaking taboos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i was seduced at 14 , " kristijan says the current dr. sommer , eveline von arx , credits the column with germany 's free sexual attitudes . when it began in 1969 , " dr. sommer really broke taboos , and it was really spectacular to do something like that , " said von arx , who has been writing the column for three years .
" it 's not that spectacular anymore .
people are used to it .
everybody knows it . " each weekly issue of bravo now features photos of two teenagers , generally between 16 and 20 , in the nude , with interviews about their bodies and experiences . anyone under 18 , like sandra , must have his or her parents ' permission to appear . they are paid 400 euros -lrb- a little more than $ 500 -rrb- to pose , and many report the experience is a self-esteem boost , von arx said . weekly letters range from " my boyfriend is once again interested in his former girlfriend " to " everybody 's had sex , only i have n't . "
sample answer : " nowhere does it say that youth have to have sex by a certain time … talk to your boyfriend about it .
tell him how you feel . " " you can be sexy here " bravo 's web site even features explicit petting and positions photo galleries that would n't last a day in other countries . the magazine publishes its eastern european editions with little to no nudity .
but in germany , even teachers and religious leaders seem to welcome the column .
von arx has spoken in schools and was even invited as a youth expert to a big evangelical christian conference last year . gisela gille , chairman of germany 's society for the health of women , said bravo plays an important role in the sexual education of germany 's 12- to 15-year-olds , particularly the lesser educated .
gille said the advice satisfies basic curiosities , but that many teenagers read bravo only for a short time and stop when they become more experienced . tanja reddig , a 17-year-old berlin student , said that she read dr. sommer when she was 12 and 13 and did n't see what the fuss was over the nudity . " you can be sexy here and you do n't get any problems , " she said .
" in america , they ca n't show bodies .
they must hide something .
some teenagers do n't want to ask their parents things , so they could write a letter to dr. sommer . " started by popular demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today 's youth seem concerned with balancing love and work dr. sommer began during the sexual revolution of 1969 .
bravo was then a strictly entertainment magazine , but its young readers nonetheless kept writing letters about love and sex . so editors figured such a column would increase their readership , according to antje pfeffer of the berlin-based archive of youth culture -lrb- archiv der jugendkulturen -rrb- , which has published a book about bravo 's 50 year history . " dr. sommer immediately was greeted as too open , " pfeffer said . some parents glued the dr. sommer pages together so their teenagers could n't read the column , others banned it from the house .
some schools confiscated it , and in communist east germany , many clamored for smuggled copies . but from the start , the column took its mission quite seriously .
the first dr. sommer , martin goldstein , recalled in the berlin archive 's book that he and his team of social workers , psychologists , sociologists , political scientists , family counselors and parents would spend hours going through letters : i have fallen in love with a sweet young boy .
if he would kiss me , i would be happy for my entire life .
how can i get him to do it ?
i see him almost every day and i already know his name .
but do n't tell me that i should talk to him .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.08.2006 strange bedfellows : radical leftists for bush großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-germans are against what they see as a newer form of fascists than neo-nazis among the german far-left , one subgroup called the anti-germans holds some contradictory views .
most call themselves communists , yet loudly proclaim their support for israel and george w. bush . when it comes to the anti-germans , the political big tent theory appears to have become fact : groups that generally ca n't bear to be in the same room sometimes unite for a common cause . that was on show recently in western berlin , where thousands had gathered to show their support for israel during the recent conflict with hezbollah militants in lebanon .
many of the demonstrators were members of berlin 's jewish community or the conservative christian democrats . however , there were some there who belonged to the far-left and sported all the accoutrements of those who are known as autonomen in germany - black clothing , buttons or patches with political slogans or insignia , and often scarves , sunglasses or baseball caps to make them harder to identify . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators often clash with police but this time they had n't come to disrupt the demonstration , shout out anti-zionist slogans or get into tussles with police , as they often do .
the group of anti-germans had actually organized the demonstration under the slogan " unconditional solidarity with israel , " one of the core positions of their movement . such a stance puts the group firmly at odds with the majority viewpoint of germany 's far-left movement , which since the 1970s has been overwhelmingly pro-palestinian and very critical of israeli policy .
completing the philosophical break is the support of many anti-germans for us president george w. bush , who for the traditional far left is anathema . " it has to do with george w. bush 's conception for a new middle east , which is essentially supported , " said rüdiger göbel , deputy editor-in-chief of junge welt , a left-wing daily based in berlin .
" the anti-germans are actually closer to the neo-conservatives in the united states . " fighting a " new fascism " to many observers , the anti-germans are a conundrum .
most consider themselves communists , but according to a study carried out by patrick hagen at the university of cologne , they " have abandoned almost all of the essentials of the communist movement and the left , such as the positive relations to the working class , anti-imperialism and anti-racism which has led to a deep split within the extra-parliamentary left . " the anti-german movement can be traced back to the fall of the berlin wall , where some on the far left demonstrated against reunification , warning that a stronger germany could result in a new militarism and even a " fourth reich . "
they based their slogan on the phrase often used in holocaust remembrance ceremonies : " never again . "
the anti-germans went further , rallying around " germany , never again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators at a anti-nazi rally as time went on , the group began to show more support for the united states .
in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of the destruction of dresden by the allies , the anti-germans praised the bombing of the civil population , since in their view , so many of them had supported the nazi regime . but the movement really got behind the stars and stripes after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , which they saw as anti-semitic and targeted at israel .
to them , it marked the rise of a new type of fascism .
this time is was n't from the far right , but from radical islam and it had to be fought .
the us , in their eyes , was the only one willing to fight it . " islamic terrorists and states such as syria and iran want to liquidate israel , " said hermann gremliza , publisher of the leftist magazine konkret and one of the leading figures in the anti-german movement , in an e-mail response .
" so -lrb- anti-germans -rrb- act according to the motto : the enemy of my enemy is my friend . " just after the war in iraq broke out in 2003 , the anti-german magazine bahamas wrote an editorial entitled " bush - the man of peace ! " whose side are they on ? these kinds of positions have put the group in sometimes violent opposition to the traditional far left .
when anti-germans show up at left-wing demonstrations with signs supporting american policy or israel , they are generally not welcomed warmly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would che have supported george w. bush ?
" whoever carries an israeli flag is insulted and spit upon , " gremliza said .
" but what do you expect , we 're in germany . " the traditional far left accuses the anti-germans of getting in bed with the bourgeoisie .
some writers in the anti-german camp even write occasionally for the online site of the newsmagazine der spiegel or even such bastions of conservatism as the daily die welt . observers say that means they have an influence beyond their actual numbers , which are estimated between 500 and 3,000 .
gremliza , however , said around 50,000 people read his magazine konkret . anti-german goals , he says , are to uncover what group members see as the hypocrisy of a german foreign policy that has been harmful to israel and helped the rise of a new " islamic " fascism , which they see as a direct descendent of the form practiced by the nazis . " germany wants an alliance with the islamic world - against the us , " he said , despite angela merkel 's close ties to her american counterpart .
" and no one notices , except the occasional commentator in the new york times and the anti-germans . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sheds the spirit of ' 68 with the country turning away from the red-green government and poised for a new political departure , dw-world spoke to green party politician hans-christian ströbele about the legacy of the late ' 60s .

most call themselves communists , yet loudly proclaim their support for israel and george w. bush . when it comes to the anti-germans , the political big tent theory appears to have become fact : groups that generally ca n't bear to be in the same room sometimes unite for a common cause . that was on show recently in western berlin , where thousands had gathered to show their support for israel during the recent conflict with hezbollah militants in lebanon .
many of the demonstrators were members of berlin 's jewish community or the conservative christian democrats . however , there were some there who belonged to the far-left and sported all the accoutrements of those who are known as autonomen in germany - black clothing , buttons or patches with political slogans or insignia , and often scarves , sunglasses or baseball caps to make them harder to identify . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators often clash with police but this time they had n't come to disrupt the demonstration , shout out anti-zionist slogans or get into tussles with police , as they often do .
the group of anti-germans had actually organized the demonstration under the slogan " unconditional solidarity with israel , " one of the core positions of their movement . such a stance puts the group firmly at odds with the majority viewpoint of germany 's far-left movement , which since the 1970s has been overwhelmingly pro-palestinian and very critical of israeli policy .
completing the philosophical break is the support of many anti-germans for us president george w. bush , who for the traditional far left is anathema . " it has to do with george w. bush 's conception for a new middle east , which is essentially supported , " said rüdiger göbel , deputy editor-in-chief of junge welt , a left-wing daily based in berlin .
" the anti-germans are actually closer to the neo-conservatives in the united states . " fighting a " new fascism " to many observers , the anti-germans are a conundrum .
most consider themselves communists , but according to a study carried out by patrick hagen at the university of cologne , they " have abandoned almost all of the essentials of the communist movement and the left , such as the positive relations to the working class , anti-imperialism and anti-racism which has led to a deep split within the extra-parliamentary left . " the anti-german movement can be traced back to the fall of the berlin wall , where some on the far left demonstrated against reunification , warning that a stronger germany could result in a new militarism and even a " fourth reich . "
they based their slogan on the phrase often used in holocaust remembrance ceremonies : " never again . "
the anti-germans went further , rallying around " germany , never again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators at a anti-nazi rally as time went on , the group began to show more support for the united states .
in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of the destruction of dresden by the allies , the anti-germans praised the bombing of the civil population , since in their view , so many of them had supported the nazi regime . but the movement really got behind the stars and stripes after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , which they saw as anti-semitic and targeted at israel .
to them , it marked the rise of a new type of fascism .
this time is was n't from the far right , but from radical islam and it had to be fought .
the us , in their eyes , was the only one willing to fight it . " islamic terrorists and states such as syria and iran want to liquidate israel , " said hermann gremliza , publisher of the leftist magazine konkret and one of the leading figures in the anti-german movement , in an e-mail response .
" so -lrb- anti-germans -rrb- act according to the motto : the enemy of my enemy is my friend . " just after the war in iraq broke out in 2003 , the anti-german magazine bahamas wrote an editorial entitled " bush - the man of peace ! " whose side are they on ? these kinds of positions have put the group in sometimes violent opposition to the traditional far left .
when anti-germans show up at left-wing demonstrations with signs supporting american policy or israel , they are generally not welcomed warmly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would che have supported george w. bush ?
" whoever carries an israeli flag is insulted and spit upon , " gremliza said .
" but what do you expect , we 're in germany . " the traditional far left accuses the anti-germans of getting in bed with the bourgeoisie .
some writers in the anti-german camp even write occasionally for the online site of the newsmagazine der spiegel or even such bastions of conservatism as the daily die welt . observers say that means they have an influence beyond their actual numbers , which are estimated between 500 and 3,000 .
gremliza , however , said around 50,000 people read his magazine konkret . anti-german goals , he says , are to uncover what group members see as the hypocrisy of a german foreign policy that has been harmful to israel and helped the rise of a new " islamic " fascism , which they see as a direct descendent of the form practiced by the nazis . " germany wants an alliance with the islamic world - against the us , " he said , despite angela merkel 's close ties to her american counterpart .

the source gave no further details . second suspect questioned in lebanon meanwhile , investigators are hoping that more of their questions about the plot will be answered following hamad 's interrogation , at which officials from germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- are present . " we 're confident that he will break his silence and that we 'll know much more later in the day , " bka president jörg ziercke told public broadcaster ard on friday morning . both hamad and el hajdib were identified on security camera footage dragging suitcases loaded with crudely made bombs onto trains in cologne . did they have help ? while investigators and political leaders have been pleased about the quick succession of arrests , big questions remain about the case , including whether the men were working alone or had the support of a terrorist network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziercke says it 's too early to say if the men belong to an international terrorist network ziercke said it is still too early to say if they belonged to an international network . " we assume that this concerns a terrorist group here in germany , which is also the view of the federal prosecutors , " he told german broadcaster n-tv . " we know that the suspects had accomplices .
at the moment we 're trying to determine whether this was an international network or if it was an autonomous terrorist group in germany . " german terror expert , elmar thevessen , has pointed out that hamad and el hajdib lived hundreds of miles apart , raising the question of how they were able to communicate and gain each other 's trust .
according to testimony from el hajdib , the two men first met in germany . " we know from jihad hamad , who gave himself up , that he only arrived in cologne in february of this year , just five months before the crime , " thevessen said .
" where did the contacts come from and how could he so quickly get himself set up to prepare an attack that almost succeeded ? " searches of hamad 's apartment have turned up damning evidence , including dna that matches that on the suitcases , as well as receipts for the gas canister and gas used in the failed plot . the plot has reminded germans that they are not immune to international terrorism .
wolfgang bosbach , a domestic policy expert for berlin 's conservative cdu / csu parliamentary group , has warned that there are an estimated 32,000 islamists in germany and some 3,000 of these were considered extremists .
that , he said , represents a " considerable threat potential for our country .

" it does not state what we expect - namely ' we are suspending uranium enrichment , coming to the negotiating table and will speak about the opportunities and possibilities for iran . '
that is unfortunately not the case , " merkel said in a television interview . " the decisive sentence is missing and this needs to be addressed . " germany is part of the sextet that offered the package of incentives to tehran to stop nuclear fuel work , along with the united states , britain , france , russia and china . on friday , france also said that the iranian response fell short .
however , french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said it was important to avoid an escalation of the conflict with iran . " for the moment it is not satisfactory , " he told rtl radio .
" but the worst thing would be to escalate into a confrontation with iran on the one hand , and the muslim world with iran , and the west .
that would be the clash of the civilizations that france today is practically alone in trying to avoid . " on tuesday , iran offered to start serious talks over its nuclear program but there was no sign that it had agreed to a united nations security council demand that it freeze uranium by aug .
31 or face the prospect of sanctions . academics offer details of iranian response iran is seeking time guarantees on getting benefits - such as light-water reactors - with its response to the international offer , according to a report published on the internet by two iranian academics , one of whom has close ties to the government . " iran wants firm guarantees on the proposed offers of nuclear assistance , such as the sale of light water reactors to iran , as well as a secured nuclear fuel supply , " abbas maleki and kevah afrasiabi said on the agenceglobal.com web site . they said iran 's response was moderate in tone and encouraged the western powers to engage it rather than rush to sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some powers favor continuing diplomatic efforts rather than resorting to sanctions maleki , director of the international institute for caspian studies in tehran , and afrasiabi , a political scientist who has also taught in tehran , added that if there is a move towards sanctions after aug .
31 " despite the positive dimensions of iran 's offer , the stage will be set for a full-scale international crisis . " russia : no need to discuss sanctions on friday , russia said that international concerns over iran 's nuclear program did not warrant any discussion of sanctions at the moment .

" it does not state what we expect - namely ' we are suspending uranium enrichment , coming to the negotiating table and will speak about the opportunities and possibilities for iran . '
that is unfortunately not the case , " merkel said in a television interview . " the decisive sentence is missing and this needs to be addressed . " germany is part of the sextet that offered the package of incentives to tehran to stop nuclear fuel work , along with the united states , britain , france , russia and china . on friday , france also said that the iranian response fell short .
however , french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said it was important to avoid an escalation of the conflict with iran . " for the moment it is not satisfactory , " he told rtl radio .
" but the worst thing would be to escalate into a confrontation with iran on the one hand , and the muslim world with iran , and the west .
that would be the clash of the civilizations that france today is practically alone in trying to avoid . " on tuesday , iran offered to start serious talks over its nuclear program but there was no sign that it had agreed to a united nations security council demand that it freeze uranium by aug .

" russia : no need to discuss sanctions on friday , russia said that international concerns over iran 's nuclear program did not warrant any discussion of sanctions at the moment . " i know of no instances in world practice and previous experience in which sanctions have achieved their aim and proved effective , " russian defense minister sergei ivanov said .
" russia stands for further political and diplomatic efforts to settle the issue . " the us state department said on thursday that there was still time for iran to comply with the aug .
31 deadline . " we obviously encourage iran to make the right choice , " said state department spokesman gonzalo gallegos .
" if iran does n't comply , the resolution makes very clear that the un security council will then adopt appropriate measures under article 41 , chapter 7 -lrb- of the un charter -rrb- providing for sanctions .

instead of raising taxes , however , it should reduce spending , says dw 's karl zawadzky . first the good news : germany managed to reduce its national deficit to 2.5 percent in the first half of this year .
the positive trend can be traced back to a broader economic upswing , which brought in increased tax revenues . the public deficit is n't likely to increase in the second half of 2006 , and germany may even finally be able to shed its stigma in the european union as the " stability pact rogue " - an image it had earned through several years of higher-than-permitted debt statistics .
the national deficit in the first half of 2005 was , for example , as high as 3.7 percent . according to figures released thursday by the federal statistical office , the national deficit in the first half of this year amounted to 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 35.8 billion -rrb- in real numbers , which is a good 12 billion euros less than during the same time frame last year . social security contributions , on the other hand , have remained stagnant due to only minimal changes in wages .
however , expenditures made by the government unemployment agencies this year dropped dramatically as a result of cutbacks . finance minister peer steinbrück , who bore the consequences of the political demise of his predecessor hans eichel , is reluctant to be too hasty in celebrating the success reports , lest he eat his words in just a few months ' time . tax hikes to maintain low deficit ? the government has emphasized that it will stick to its promise that , starting next year , germany 's national deficit will not exceed the maximum deficit agreed upon in the eu 's stability pact .
this contractual agreement stipulates that the deficit of all public budgets , including social security , may not exceed 3 percent of the country 's gross domestic product . thanks to positive market conditions in recent months and the higher tax revenues that resulted , germany wo n't violate the pact this year .
even a slight economic downturn will not prevent germany from meeting the deficit standard in the future . now for the not-so-good news : in order to keep the deficit within the limitations set by the stability pact , hefty tax hikes are necessary . at the beginning of 2007 , sales tax will be raised from 16 to 19 percent .
tax increases in other areas are planned as well , though they wo n't be quite as big as the sales tax hike . taken together , tax revenues are expected to increase by more than 20 billion euros per year , which will keep germany on the safe side as far as the stability pact criteria are concerned . cut spending instead of raising taxes however , burdening the taxpayers in order to meet eu deficit criteria is problematic . federal , state and local expenditures will continue to increase , even if only slightly .
market fluctuation aside , germany has a structural problem : germans pay more in tax and social contributions than those in other industrial countries . considerable reductions in spending - not another tax hike for the already burdened taxpayers - would be a better approach to trimming down the national deficit . karl zawadzky is deutsche welle 's chief business correspondent . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany up in arms over minister 's holiday comments germany 's finance minister has sparked outrage by suggesting germans should spend less on their annual holidays and instead put money aside for their old age .

" " we may have a unique opportunity to transform the cessation of hostilities into a durable ceasefire , " he added in brussels . the pledges came after france , which currently commands unifil , committed itself late thursday to a total deployment of 2,000 soldiers . but french president jacques chirac , who was speaking separately friday in paris , said a level of 15,000 troops was " excessive " and it made " no sense " to have such a large contingent alongside the lebanese army in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some un peacekeepers from france are already on the ground in lebanon in brussels though , finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said the total european contribution would be " something between 5,600 and 6,900 " soldiers , as well as air and naval assets . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy put the eu deployment at " 6,500 to 7,000 soldiers on the ground , which means that the spinal column of the reinforced unifil will be european . " the force is crucial to shoring up un resolution 1701 , which on august 14 brought an end to the 34-day conflict in lebanon between israel and hezbollah militants . annan said bangladesh , malaysia and indonesia had offered to participate in unifil - though israel has opposed contributions from those muslim countries because of an absence of diplomatic relations . the un chief also proposed that france see out its current term as commander of the force , which expires at the end of january , after which italy would take over .
italy is expected to supply up to 3,000 soldiers , which would make it the biggest contributor to the force . french role and reversal france , though , played a key role diplomatically in revamping the force , having co-authored the un resolution with the united states .
it also enjoys close relations with lebanon , a former protectorate .
douste-blazy said france had " absolutely " no problem with the change of command . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac , right , and angela merkel during a press conference in paris on friday chirac 's announcement that he was sending 1,600 more troops to lebanon came after international criticism over his initial , emergency deployment of just 200 soldiers to join the 200 already in unifil . a vanguard of 170 french reinforcements arrived in lebanon on friday , making france the only country so far to have actually sent troops .
chirac said he agreed to send the extra two battalions after winning a robust mandate for unifil and guarantees the force would be able to cope if hostilities flare up again . " i wonder how it would have been judged if i had raced off like a mad dog without thinking or securing minimum guarantees , " he said in paris . he also questioned the goal of boosting the force to 15,000 soldiers , calling that " a totally excessive figure " given lebanon 's relatively small size . other eu contributors the announcement of the french reinforcements spurred some of the other eu countries into firming up previously vague promises to contribute . spain was said to be ready to send 1,000 to 1,200 soldiers , substantially more than the 800 initially cited in media reports . poland 's private television station tvn24 reported foreign minister anna fotyga as saying warsaw 's total contribution would be around 500 troops which includes 214 already serving with unifil . belgian foreign minister guy verhofstadt said his country would provide 300 soldiers by late september or early october , with the possibility of adding nearly 100 more later .
" peace in the middle east is an absolute necessity , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland 's foreign minister erkki tuomioja , right , and german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier finland pledged 250 soldiers . britain 's europe minister geoff hoon said that while his country 's military - heavily deployed in iraq and afghanistan - was too stretched to send ground troops , it might supply " specialized " units . other countries , notably greece and latvia , have also indicated they could send soldiers , but no details were provided friday . germany , wary of potential confrontations with israelis because of its nazi past , is prepared to offer naval units , not troops , as is sweden . the force is also to help lebanon halt arms smuggling to hezbollah over the border with syria , considered a main sponsor of the lebanese militia , if beirut requests . syria is concerned at the deployment of foreign troops in lebanon - from which it was forced to withdraw its soldiers last year under un pressure led by france - and has cut power supplies to its neighbor and warned it may close the border . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french troops arrive in lebanon as part of unifil deployment following an initial deployment of engineers , more french troops arrived in lebanon friday as part of the pledged 2,000-strong contingent which would form part of a un force to maintain the current ceasefire .

the source gave no further details . second suspect questioned in lebanon meanwhile , investigators are hoping that more of their questions about the plot will be answered following hamad 's interrogation , at which officials from germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- are present . " we 're confident that he will break his silence and that we 'll know much more later in the day , " bka president jörg ziercke told public broadcaster ard on friday morning . both hamad and el hajdib were identified on security camera footage dragging suitcases loaded with crudely made bombs onto trains in cologne . did they have help ? while investigators and political leaders have been pleased about the quick succession of arrests , big questions remain about the case , including whether the men were working alone or had the support of a terrorist network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziercke says it 's too early to say if the men belong to an international terrorist network ziercke said it is still too early to say if they belonged to an international network . " we assume that this concerns a terrorist group here in germany , which is also the view of the federal prosecutors , " he told german broadcaster n-tv . " we know that the suspects had accomplices .
at the moment we 're trying to determine whether this was an international network or if it was an autonomous terrorist group in germany . " german terror expert , elmar thevessen , has pointed out that hamad and el hajdib lived hundreds of miles apart , raising the question of how they were able to communicate and gain each other 's trust .
according to testimony from el hajdib , the two men first met in germany . " we know from jihad hamad , who gave himself up , that he only arrived in cologne in february of this year , just five months before the crime , " thevessen said .
" where did the contacts come from and how could he so quickly get himself set up to prepare an attack that almost succeeded ? " searches of hamad 's apartment have turned up damning evidence , including dna that matches that on the suitcases , as well as receipts for the gas canister and gas used in the failed plot . the plot has reminded germans that they are not immune to international terrorism .
wolfgang bosbach , a domestic policy expert for berlin 's conservative cdu / csu parliamentary group , has warned that there are an estimated 32,000 islamists in germany and some 3,000 of these were considered extremists .
that , he said , represents a " considerable threat potential for our country .

" we 're confident that he will break his silence and that we 'll know much more later in the day , " bka president jörg ziercke told public broadcaster ard on friday morning . both hamad and el hajdib were identified on security camera footage dragging suitcases loaded with crudely made bombs onto trains in cologne . did they have help ? while investigators and political leaders have been pleased about the quick succession of arrests , big questions remain about the case , including whether the men were working alone or had the support of a terrorist network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziercke says it 's too early to say if the men belong to an international terrorist network ziercke said it is still too early to say if they belonged to an international network . " we assume that this concerns a terrorist group here in germany , which is also the view of the federal prosecutors , " he told german broadcaster n-tv . " we know that the suspects had accomplices .
at the moment we 're trying to determine whether this was an international network or if it was an autonomous terrorist group in germany . " german terror expert , elmar thevessen , has pointed out that hamad and el hajdib lived hundreds of miles apart , raising the question of how they were able to communicate and gain each other 's trust .
according to testimony from el hajdib , the two men first met in germany . " we know from jihad hamad , who gave himself up , that he only arrived in cologne in february of this year , just five months before the crime , " thevessen said .
" where did the contacts come from and how could he so quickly get himself set up to prepare an attack that almost succeeded ? " searches of hamad 's apartment have turned up damning evidence , including dna that matches that on the suitcases , as well as receipts for the gas canister and gas used in the failed plot . the plot has reminded germans that they are not immune to international terrorism .
wolfgang bosbach , a domestic policy expert for berlin 's conservative cdu / csu parliamentary group , has warned that there are an estimated 32,000 islamists in germany and some 3,000 of these were considered extremists .
that , he said , represents a " considerable threat potential for our country .

most call themselves communists , yet loudly proclaim their support for israel and george w. bush . when it comes to the anti-germans , the political big tent theory appears to have become fact : groups that generally ca n't bear to be in the same room sometimes unite for a common cause . that was on show recently in western berlin , where thousands had gathered to show their support for israel during the recent conflict with hezbollah militants in lebanon .
many of the demonstrators were members of berlin 's jewish community or the conservative christian democrats . however , there were some there who belonged to the far-left and sported all the accoutrements of those who are known as autonomen in germany - black clothing , buttons or patches with political slogans or insignia , and often scarves , sunglasses or baseball caps to make them harder to identify . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators often clash with police but this time they had n't come to disrupt the demonstration , shout out anti-zionist slogans or get into tussles with police , as they often do .
the group of anti-germans had actually organized the demonstration under the slogan " unconditional solidarity with israel , " one of the core positions of their movement . such a stance puts the group firmly at odds with the majority viewpoint of germany 's far-left movement , which since the 1970s has been overwhelmingly pro-palestinian and very critical of israeli policy .
completing the philosophical break is the support of many anti-germans for us president george w. bush , who for the traditional far left is anathema . " it has to do with george w. bush 's conception for a new middle east , which is essentially supported , " said rüdiger göbel , deputy editor-in-chief of junge welt , a left-wing daily based in berlin .
" the anti-germans are actually closer to the neo-conservatives in the united states . " fighting a " new fascism " to many observers , the anti-germans are a conundrum .
most consider themselves communists , but according to a study carried out by patrick hagen at the university of cologne , they " have abandoned almost all of the essentials of the communist movement and the left , such as the positive relations to the working class , anti-imperialism and anti-racism which has led to a deep split within the extra-parliamentary left . " the anti-german movement can be traced back to the fall of the berlin wall , where some on the far left demonstrated against reunification , warning that a stronger germany could result in a new militarism and even a " fourth reich . "
they based their slogan on the phrase often used in holocaust remembrance ceremonies : " never again . "
the anti-germans went further , rallying around " germany , never again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-left demonstrators at a anti-nazi rally as time went on , the group began to show more support for the united states .
in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of the destruction of dresden by the allies , the anti-germans praised the bombing of the civil population , since in their view , so many of them had supported the nazi regime . but the movement really got behind the stars and stripes after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , which they saw as anti-semitic and targeted at israel .
to them , it marked the rise of a new type of fascism .
this time is was n't from the far right , but from radical islam and it had to be fought .
the us , in their eyes , was the only one willing to fight it . " islamic terrorists and states such as syria and iran want to liquidate israel , " said hermann gremliza , publisher of the leftist magazine konkret and one of the leading figures in the anti-german movement , in an e-mail response .
" so -lrb- anti-germans -rrb- act according to the motto : the enemy of my enemy is my friend . " just after the war in iraq broke out in 2003 , the anti-german magazine bahamas wrote an editorial entitled " bush - the man of peace ! " whose side are they on ? these kinds of positions have put the group in sometimes violent opposition to the traditional far left .
when anti-germans show up at left-wing demonstrations with signs supporting american policy or israel , they are generally not welcomed warmly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would che have supported george w. bush ?
" whoever carries an israeli flag is insulted and spit upon , " gremliza said .
" but what do you expect , we 're in germany . " the traditional far left accuses the anti-germans of getting in bed with the bourgeoisie .
some writers in the anti-german camp even write occasionally for the online site of the newsmagazine der spiegel or even such bastions of conservatism as the daily die welt . observers say that means they have an influence beyond their actual numbers , which are estimated between 500 and 3,000 .
gremliza , however , said around 50,000 people read his magazine konkret . anti-german goals , he says , are to uncover what group members see as the hypocrisy of a german foreign policy that has been harmful to israel and helped the rise of a new " islamic " fascism , which they see as a direct descendent of the form practiced by the nazis . " germany wants an alliance with the islamic world - against the us , " he said , despite angela merkel 's close ties to her american counterpart .
" and no one notices , except the occasional commentator in the new york times and the anti-germans .

scientists from 17 nations examined 125,000 studies involving 561 species .
spring was beginning on average six to eight days earlier than it did 30 years ago , the researchers said .
in regions such as spain , which saw the greatest increases in temperatures , the season began up to two weeks earlier .
the findings were based on what was described as the world 's largest study of changes in recurring natural events , such as when plants flowered .
the team of researchers also found that the onset of autumn has been delayed by an average of three days over the same period .
feeling the heat the study , published in the journal global change biology , shows changes to the continent 's climate were shifting the timing of the seasons , the scientists said .
one of the paper 's lead authors , tim sparks from the uk 's centre for ecology and hydrology -lrb- ceh -rrb- , said the findings did not go as far as pointing the finger of blame at human-induced climate change .
" we ca n't tell that from our study but experts have already shown that there is a discernable human influence on the current climate warming . "
but dr sparks said it did show that there was a direct link between rising temperatures and changes to plant and animal behaviour .
" we need to look at change over very large areas and we need to examine as many species groups as possible because there has been some mild criticism that people have cherry-picked the results they presented .
if you have species that are dependent on each other changing at different rates , that could just break down the food web dr tim sparks , report 's author send us your comments " we have gone for the most complete coverage possible that we could in europe to try to see if there was still this effect , " he said .
" it is very conclusive that there is . "
the team examined 125,000 observational series of 542 plants and 19 animal species in 21 european countries from 1971 to 2000 .
the results showed that 78 % of all leafing , flowering and fruiting records were happening earlier in the year , while only 3 % were significantly delayed .
dr sparks said horse chestnut trees , which grow all over the continent , were particularly good indicators .
" it is a good example because it is easy to identify , and it has distinctive phases of leafing , flowering and producing conkers . "
he hoped the findings would now focus attention on the potential consequences of changes to the behaviour of plants and animals .
" if you have species that are dependent on each other changing at different rates , that could just break down the food web .
" for example , caterpillars feed on oak trees , and birds feed on the caterpillars .
unless these species remain synchronised , there could be problems for any one or more of those elements of the food web . "

scientists from 17 nations examined 125,000 studies involving 561 species .
spring was beginning on average six to eight days earlier than it did 30 years ago , the researchers said .
in regions such as spain , which saw the greatest increases in temperatures , the season began up to two weeks earlier .
the findings were based on what was described as the world 's largest study of changes in recurring natural events , such as when plants flowered .
the team of researchers also found that the onset of autumn has been delayed by an average of three days over the same period .
feeling the heat the study , published in the journal global change biology , shows changes to the continent 's climate were shifting the timing of the seasons , the scientists said .
one of the paper 's lead authors , tim sparks from the uk 's centre for ecology and hydrology -lrb- ceh -rrb- , said the findings did not go as far as pointing the finger of blame at human-induced climate change .
" we ca n't tell that from our study but experts have already shown that there is a discernable human influence on the current climate warming . "
but dr sparks said it did show that there was a direct link between rising temperatures and changes to plant and animal behaviour .
" we need to look at change over very large areas and we need to examine as many species groups as possible because there has been some mild criticism that people have cherry-picked the results they presented . "
if you have species that are dependent on each other changing at different rates , that could just break down the food web " dr tim sparks , report 's author send us your comments " we have gone for the most complete coverage possible that we could in europe to try to see if there was still this effect , " he said .
" it is very conclusive that there is . "
the team examined 125,000 observational series of 542 plants and 19 animal species in 21 european countries from 1971 to 2000 .
the results showed that 78 % of all leafing , flowering and fruiting records were happening earlier in the year , while only 3 % were significantly delayed .
dr sparks said horse chestnut trees , which grow all over the continent , were particularly good indicators .
" it is a good example because it is easy to identify , and it has distinctive phases of leafing , flowering and producing conkers . "
he hoped the findings would now focus attention on the potential consequences of changes to the behaviour of plants and animals .
" if you have species that are dependent on each other changing at different rates , that could just break down the food web .
" for example , caterpillars feed on oak trees , and birds feed on the caterpillars .
unless these species remain synchronised , there could be problems for any one or more of those elements of the food web . "

dr andrew sutherland , a medical advisor on everest expeditions , says unofficial figures show 15 people died in 2006 .
the death rate has remained at one death for every 10 successful attempts to climb everest for many years , the british medical journal report states .
dr sutherland says poor understanding of the effects of altitude is to blame .
the longer you stay up there , in the death zone , the greater the chance you have of dying dr andew sutherland it is 53 years since edmund hillary and sherpa tenzing norgay became the first people to conquer everest .
dr sutherland , an oxford-based surgeon , says there is now be a better understanding of the need for acclimatisation , the kind of climbing equipment which is required and established routes for people to climb .
that meant there should be fewer deaths he said .
but that is not the case .
while most deaths are caused by injuries and exhaustion , there is also a large proportion of climbers who die from altitude related illness .
high altitude cerebral oedema -lrb- hace -rrb- and high altitude pulmonary oedema -lrb- hape -rrb- are both forms of altitude sickness which cause a potentially fatal build up of fluid in the brain or lungs .
' altitude ability ' dr sutherland , who climbed the north side of everest this year on the everestmax expedition , said he was shocked by the amount of altitude related illness and the relative lack of knowledge of the dangers among people attempting everest .
" from being there , i saw there were a lot of people with considerable mountaineering experience , but who were fairly naive in some ways about the extreme altitudes they were going to face . "
dr sutherland said the common belief that the deaths were largely among inexperienced climbers who pay large sums of money to climb the mountain .
but he said those people tended to have very experienced guides which meant they were at less risk than independent climbers .
but dr sutherland added : " in my view , climbers are not climbing beyond their ability but instead beyond their altitude ability .
" unfortunately it is difficult to get experience of what it is like climbing above camp 3 -lrb- 8,300 metres -rrb- without climbing everest .
" climbers invariably do not know what their ability above 8,300 metres is going to be like .
" the longer you stay up there , in the death zone , the greater the chance you have of dying . "
' right to climb ' he said climbers needed to check that they were not climbing too slowly - a sign something is wrong - and turn back if need be .
the slowest safe rate is around 100 metres every one to one-and-a-half hours .
if progress is any slower than that , people should abort their attempt .
but he said people 's egos meant they often did not listen to their bodies .
" with the summit in sight this advice is too often ignored . "
dr charles clarke , a neurologist and head of the british mountaineering council , said mountaineering had inherent dangers which climbers needed to take precautions against .
" anybody who wants to can climb everest .
we respect people 's right to do that .
" but no one can say ' i was n't told about the medical risks ' .
people have got to be fully aware of that . "

dr andrew sutherland , a medical advisor on everest expeditions , says unofficial figures show 15 people died in 2006 .
the death rate has remained at one death for every 10 successful attempts to climb everest for many years , the british medical journal report states .
dr sutherland says poor understanding of the effects of altitude is to blame .
the longer you stay up there , in the death zone , the greater the chance you have of dying dr andew sutherland it is 53 years since edmund hillary and sherpa tenzing norgay became the first people to conquer everest .
dr sutherland , an oxford-based surgeon , says there is now be a better understanding of the need for acclimatisation , the kind of climbing equipment which is required and established routes for people to climb .
that meant there should be fewer deaths he said .
but that is not the case .
while most deaths are caused by injuries and exhaustion , there is also a large proportion of climbers who die from altitude related illness .
high altitude cerebral oedema -lrb- hace -rrb- and high altitude pulmonary oedema -lrb- hape -rrb- are both forms of altitude sickness which cause a potentially fatal build up of fluid in the brain or lungs .
' altitude ability ' dr sutherland , who climbed the north side of everest this year on the everestmax expedition , said he was shocked by the amount of altitude related illness and the relative lack of knowledge of the dangers among people attempting everest .
" from being there , i saw there were a lot of people with considerable mountaineering experience , but who were fairly naive in some ways about the extreme altitudes they were going to face . "
dr sutherland said the common belief that the deaths were largely among inexperienced climbers who pay large sums of money to climb the mountain .
but he said those people tended to have very experienced guides which meant they were at less risk than independent climbers .
but dr sutherland added : " in my view , climbers are not climbing beyond their ability but instead beyond their altitude ability .
" unfortunately it is difficult to get experience of what it is like climbing above camp 3 -lrb- 8,300 metres -rrb- without climbing everest .
" climbers invariably do not know what their ability above 8,300 metres is going to be like .
" the longer you stay up there , in the death zone , the greater the chance you have of dying . "
' right to climb ' he said climbers needed to check that they were not climbing too slowly - a sign something is wrong - and turn back if need be .
the slowest safe rate is around 100 metres every one to one-and-a-half hours .
if progress is any slower than that , people should abort their attempt .
but he said people 's egos meant they often did not listen to their bodies .
" with the summit in sight this advice is too often ignored . "
dr charles clarke , a neurologist and head of the british mountaineering council , said mountaineering had inherent dangers which climbers needed to take precautions against .
" anybody who wants to can climb everest .
we respect people 's right to do that .
" but no one can say ' i was n't told about the medical risks ' .
people have got to be fully aware of that . "

imera power says the cable , running between caernarfon in gwynedd and arklow in county wicklow , could provide electricity for both countries .
it says that in the short term it would be likely to be used to address ireland 's energy shortage .
the idea for a cable dates back to the 1970s .
imera is applying to the uk energy regulator ofgem for a licence .
the company hopes the 150km -lrb- 93mile -rrb- electricity link could be commissioned by 2008 and up and running by 2009 .
the cost is estimated at 200m euros -lrb- £ 135m -rrb- which imera say would be met through private funding , infrastructure funds and eu finance .
' either direction ' the company says the cable , called an interconnector , could enhance security of supply on both sides of the irish sea but said it will initially address a current energy shortfall in ireland .
rory o 'neill , chief executive of imera power , said the irish sea cable could carry electricity both ways between ireland and wales .
he said : " the cable is being designed so it can both import and export and depending on market conditions in either the uk market or irish market it can flow in either direction .
" in the short term it is likely to be importing into the irish market . "
mr o 'neill said the cable could benefit parts of the north wales economy , particularly anglesey aluminium , which faces potential difficulty sourcing cheap energy when the nearby wylfa nuclear power station closes in 2010 .
he said : " this would be another opportunity for anglesey aluminium to take electricity either from ireland , or with increased security of supply in the north wales region , it will offer that particular company some additional choice when it comes to making decisions in the future with regard to their energy purchases . "
he added that the project would have minimal environmental impact on north wales .

the rac has written to tony blair , asking him to get personally involved after a series of u-turns and delay .
the motoring foundation favours putting the a303 through a 1.3-mile tunnel , bored into the wiltshire countryside .
the scheme was recommended after a public inquiry , but was put on hold by the department for transport when its costs rose to £ 510m .
in his letter to mr blair , rac foundation chairman david holmes said : " only you have the authority to cut through departmental inertia and get some action . "
' backwards step ' a long-awaited visitor centre and rail link for the ancient site can not go ahead until the government has sanctioned the road improvements .
mr holmes added : " because the cost estimate for the scheme rose to £ 510m , the department for transport insisted on re-examining some of the options which the public inquiry ruled out .
" this is a backwards step , as any of these alternatives would have to be the subject of further consultation and full public inquiries .
none could start for a decade or more . "
paul holmes mp , liberal democrat spokesperson for arts and heritage said : " i believe that only the published scheme of a 2.1km short-bored tunnel offers a practical solution without causing further damage to the archaeological remains .
" this scheme will prevent traffic damaging the stones and will allow visitors to see the monument without the blight of a major road running across the site .
" it is time for the government to make its mind up and back the scheme . "

frequently their intended is a fellow spotlight hogger , giving the paparazzi plenty of scope for pictures and gossip in the traditionally news-parched summer months .
this summer has already witnessed the nuptials of nicole kidman to country star keith urban and actress pamela anderson to kid rock .
media reports suggest tom cruise and katie holmes , brad pitt and angelina jolie and lost stars dominic monaghan and evangeline lilly are all poised to walk up the aisle .
but first up , it 's preston and chantelle ...
preston & chantelle houghton became the first non-celebrity to win celebrity big brother rumoured to be getting married over the bank holiday weekend , ordinary boys singer samuel preston met chantelle houghton when she was posing as a fake pop star on channel 4 's celebrity big brother .
the former model , who recently turned 23 , went on to win the show in january - but it is her relationship with preston , 24 , which has kept her in the spotlight .
within three months of meeting on the reality tv show , the pair were engaged .
" i just want to marry him , " said houghton in april , adding that she was on " cloud nine " .
cynics have questioned the whirlwind romance between the solidly middle-class preston and the celebrity-obsessed essex girl .
reports of rows over the scale of the nuptials - reportedly a tug-of-war between a jordan-style extravaganza favoured by chantelle and a more private affair - were firmly quelled by a spokeswoman in june .
the singer insists chantelle is his " soulmate " .
" i could never be bored with her and that 's what you look for in a wife . "
tom & katie the pair were accused of using their relationship for publicity purposes hollywood history does not tell us where film star tom cruise , 44 , met actress katie holmes , 27 , but news of their relationship first emerged in april 2005 .
cruise , who was previously married to nicole kidman and mimi rogers , had been single for a year following his split from penelope cruz , while holmes had recently called off her engagement to american pie star chris klein .
despite surprise at the 16-year age gap , the pair became engaged two months later in paris , with cruise gushing : " today is a magnificent day for me , i 'm engaged to a magnificent woman . "
for her part , holmes told the press she had dreamed of marrying cruise as a teenager when his poster hung on her wall .
but wedding plans were put on hold ahead of the birth of their daughter suri , born in april .
initial reports suggested the couple would marry this july , but holmes has barely been seen in public since the birth - and there have been no official sightings of the baby .
celebrity magazines have suggested suri 's seclusion has been urged by the church of scientology , to which cruise fervently subscribes .
but for this publicity-driven couple , it is unlikely a photo opportunity like a wedding will be missed .
dominic & evangeline monaghan has reportedly been teaching lilly british slang lord of the rings star dominic monaghan , 29 , met evangeline lilly , 27 , while filming the hit television series lost in hawaii .
the little-known canadian actress shot to fame as the show 's leading lady kate austen , but the months away from her home cost her marriage to hockey player murray hone .
shortly afterwards , living among the close-knit cast on location in hawaii , lilly reportedly fell in love with monaghan .
" with him i feel at peace and fulfilled , " she told the news of the world in may this year .
" i could n't be happier .
he 's my favourite person in the whole world . "
the pair are both dedicated to environmental causes and have a taste for adventure .
she speaks fluent french , while monaghan , born in berlin , speaks fluent german .
no official engagement has been announced , but rumours of an impending wedding persist .
" it is still rumoured .
dom is a really spectacular person .
and i 'd rather leave it at that , " she told glamour magazine earlier this month .
brad & angelina pitt still owns production company plan b with ex-wife jennifer aniston events have moved rapidly since hollywood stars angelina jolie and brad pitt became a couple after appearing in mr and mrs smith last year .
jolie , who initially denied reports of a romance told marie claire magazine in spring 2005 : " i think the next man i get involved with would have to become mad 's father , and that 's a high bar as far as i 'm concerned .
" i 'm not anticipating that coming any time soon . "
following pitt 's split from wife jennifer aniston , the actor has become father to jolie 's three children , including adopted children maddox and zahara .
the couple celebrated the birth of their baby daughter shiloh nouvel in namibia in may .
but since their return to california , gossip columns have been rife with tales of rows - suggesting family life is taking its toll .
earlier this month , pitt 's grandmother betty russell , 83 , was quoted as saying he would not remarry until he was convinced that the marriage would work .
" he is a sensitive soul who just wants to make sure he can keep his promise this time around , " ms russell reportedly told star magazine .
olivier & kylie minogue will begin touring again later this year in australia pop star kylie minogue has been dating french film star olivier martinez since 2003 , but the relationship appears to have strengthened during minogue 's recent recovery from breast cancer .
the 38-year-old singer , whose previous relationships included the late michael hutchence , was diagnosed with cancer last may .
after initial surgery in her hometown melbourne , minogue chose to undergo chemotherapy in paris , where boyfriend martinez lives .
prior to her illness , martinez 's track record as a ladies ' man had given minogue some cause for concern .
but the 40-year-old actor , whose leading ladies have included angelina jolie and former girlfriend juliette binoche , has been by her side throughout her treatment .
earlier this year he posted personal pictures of the couple on holiday in italy .
reports of their engagement have so far been denied , but minogue sister , dannii , told the mirror newspaper in april that olivier would be " more than ideal as a brother-in-law " .
" he has been incredible .
he makes kylie so happy - the happiest i 've seen her , " she said .
for kylie , who has spoken openly about her desire to have a family , a solid marriage like that of her parents remains " a great thing to aspire to " .

on thursday , experts approved a definition of a planet that demoted pluto to a lesser category of object .
but the lead scientist on nasa 's robotic mission to pluto has lambasted the ruling , calling it " embarrassing " .
and the chair of the committee set up to oversee agreement on a definition implied that the vote had effectively been " hijacked " .
i have nothing but ridicule for this decision alan stern , southwest research institute the new solar system the vote took place at the international astronomical union 's -lrb- iau -rrb- 10-day general assembly in prague .
the iau has been the official naming body for astronomy since 1919 .
only 424 astronomers who remained in prague for the last day of the meeting took part .
an initial proposal by the iau to add three new planets to the solar system - the asteroid ceres , pluto 's moon charon and the distant world known as 2003 ub313 - met with considerable opposition at the meeting .
days of heated debate followed during which four separate proposals were tabled .
eventually , the scientists adopted historic guidelines that see pluto relegated to a secondary category of " dwarf planets " .
drawing the line dr alan stern , who leads the us space agency 's new horizons mission to pluto and did not vote in prague , told bbc news : " it 's an awful definition ; it 's sloppy science and it would never pass peer review - for two reasons .
pluto was discovered in 1930 by the american clyde tombaugh " firstly , it is impossible and contrived to put a dividing line between dwarf planets and planets .
it 's as if we declared people not people for some arbitrary reason , like ' they tend to live in groups ' .
" secondly , the actual definition is even worse , because it 's inconsistent . "
one of the three criteria for planethood states that a planet must have " cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit " .
the largest objects in the solar system will either collect together material in their path or fling it out of the way with a gravitational swipe .
pluto was disqualified because its highly elliptical orbit overlaps with that of neptune .
but dr stern pointed out that earth , mars , jupiter and neptune have also not fully cleared their orbital zones .
earth orbits with 10,000 near-earth asteroids .
jupiter , meanwhile , is accompanied by 100,000 trojan asteroids on its orbital path .
these rocks are all essentially chunks of rubble left over from the formation of the solar system more than four billion years ago .
" if neptune had cleared its zone , pluto would n't be there , " he added .
stern said like-minded astronomers had begun a petition to get pluto reinstated .
car bumper stickers compelling motorists to " honk if pluto is still a planet " have gone on sale over the internet and e-mails circulating about the decision have been describing the iau as the " irrelevant astronomical union " .
' inconvenient arrangements ' owen gingerich chaired the iau 's planet definition committee and helped draft an initial proposal raising the number of planets from nine to 12 .
the harvard professor emeritus blamed the outcome in large part on a " revolt " by dynamicists - astronomers who study the motion and gravitational effects of celestial objects .
pluto - a ' demoted planet ' named after underworld god average of 5.9bn km to sun orbits sun every 248 years diameter of 2,360km has at least three moons rotates every 6.8 days gravity about 6 % of earth 's surface temperature -233c us probe -lrb- above -rrb- visits in 2015 " in our initial proposal we took the definition of a planet that the planetary geologists would like .
the dynamicists felt terribly insulted that we had not consulted with them to get their views .
somehow , there were enough of them to raise a big hue and cry , " professor gingerich said .
" their revolt raised enough of a fuss to destroy the scientific integrity and subtlety of the -lsb- earlier -rsb- resolution . "
he added : " there were 2,700 astronomers in prague during that 10-day period .
but only 10 % of them voted this afternoon .
those who disagreed and were determined to block the other resolution showed up in larger numbers than those who felt ' oh well , this is just one of those things the iau is working on ' . "
e-voting professor gingerich , who had to return home to the us and therefore could not vote himself , said he would like to see electronic ballots introduced in future .
alan stern agreed : " i was not allowed to vote because i was not in a room in prague on thursday 24th .
of 10,000 astronomers , 4 % were in that room - you ca n't even claim consensus .
" if everyone had to travel to washington dc every time we wanted to vote for president , we would have very different results because no one would vote .
in today 's world that is idiotic .
i have nothing but ridicule for this decision . "
he added that he could not see the resolution standing for very long and did not plan to change any of the astronomy textbook he was currently writing .
but other astronomers were happy to see pluto cast from the official roster of planets .
professor iwan williams , the iau 's president of planetary systems science , commented : " pluto has lots and lots of friends ; we 're not so keen to have pluto and all his friends in the club because it gets crowded .
" by the end of the decade , we would have had 100 planets , and i think people would have said ' my goodness , what a mess they made back in 2006 ' . "
shaking hands robin catchpole , of the institute of astronomy in cambridge , uk , said : " my own personal opinion was to leave things as they were .
i met clyde tombaugh , who discovered pluto , and thought , it 's nice to shake hands with someone who discovered a planet .
mike brown 's discovery precipitated the pluto crisis " but since the iau brought out the first draft resolution , i was rather against that because i thought it was going to be very confusing .
so the best of the alternatives was to keep the eight planets as they are , and then demote pluto .
i think this is a far superior solution . "
the need for a strict definition was deemed necessary after new telescope technologies began to reveal far-off objects that rivalled pluto in size .
the critical blow for pluto came with the discovery three years ago of an object currently designated 2003 ub313 .
discovered by mike brown and colleagues at the california institute of technology , 2003 ub313 has been lauded by some as the " 10th planet " .
measurements by the hubble space telescope show it to have a diameter of 3,000km -lrb- 1,864 miles -rrb- , a few hundred km more than pluto .
2003 ub313 will now join pluto in the dwarf planet category .
mike brown seemed happy with pluto 's demotion .
" eight is enough , " he told the associated press , jokingly adding : " i may go down in history as the guy who killed pluto . "

on thursday , experts approved a definition of a planet that demoted pluto to a lesser category of object .
but the lead scientist on nasa 's robotic mission to pluto has lambasted the ruling , calling it " embarrassing " .
and the chair of the committee set up to oversee agreement on a definition implied that the vote had effectively been " hijacked " .
i have nothing but ridicule for this decision alan stern , southwest research institute the new solar system the vote took place at the international astronomical union 's -lrb- iau -rrb- 10-day general assembly in prague .
the iau has been the official naming body for astronomy since 1919 .
only 424 astronomers who remained in prague for the last day of the meeting took part .
an initial proposal by the iau to add three new planets to the solar system - the asteroid ceres , pluto 's moon charon and the distant world known as 2003 ub313 - met with considerable opposition at the meeting .
days of heated debate followed during which four separate proposals were tabled .
eventually , the scientists adopted historic guidelines that see pluto relegated to a secondary category of " dwarf planets " .
drawing the line dr alan stern , who leads the us space agency 's new horizons mission to pluto and did not vote in prague , told bbc news : " it 's an awful definition ; it 's sloppy science and it would never pass peer review - for two reasons .
pluto was discovered in 1930 by the american clyde tombaugh " firstly , it is impossible and contrived to put a dividing line between dwarf planets and planets .
it 's as if we declared people not people for some arbitrary reason , like ' they tend to live in groups ' .
" secondly , the actual definition is even worse , because it 's inconsistent . "
one of the three criteria for planethood states that a planet must have " cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit " .
the largest objects in the solar system will either collect together material in their path or fling it out of the way with a gravitational swipe .
pluto was disqualified because its highly elliptical orbit overlaps with that of neptune .
but dr stern pointed out that earth , mars , jupiter and neptune have also not fully cleared their orbital zones .
earth orbits with 10,000 near-earth asteroids .
jupiter , meanwhile , is accompanied by 100,000 trojan asteroids on its orbital path .
these rocks are all essentially chunks of rubble left over from the formation of the solar system more than four billion years ago .
" if neptune had cleared its zone , pluto would n't be there , " he added .
stern said like-minded astronomers had begun a petition to get pluto reinstated .
car bumper stickers compelling motorists to " honk if pluto is still a planet " have gone on sale over the internet and e-mails circulating about the decision have been describing the iau as the " irrelevant astronomical union " .
' inconvenient arrangements ' owen gingerich chaired the iau 's planet definition committee and helped draft an initial proposal raising the number of planets from nine to 12 .
the harvard professor emeritus blamed the outcome in large part on a " revolt " by dynamicists - astronomers who study the motion and gravitational effects of celestial objects .
pluto - a ' demoted planet ' named after underworld god average of 5.9bn km to sun orbits sun every 248 years diameter of 2,360km has at least three moons rotates every 6.8 days gravity about 6 % of earth 's surface temperature -233c us probe -lrb- above -rrb- visits in 2015 " in our initial proposal we took the definition of a planet that the planetary geologists would like .
the dynamicists felt terribly insulted that we had not consulted with them to get their views .
somehow , there were enough of them to raise a big hue and cry , " professor gingerich said .
" their revolt raised enough of a fuss to destroy the scientific integrity and subtlety of the -lsb- earlier -rsb- resolution . "
he added : " there were 2,700 astronomers in prague during that 10-day period .
but only 10 % of them voted this afternoon .
those who disagreed and were determined to block the other resolution showed up in larger numbers than those who felt ' oh well , this is just one of those things the iau is working on ' . "
e-voting professor gingerich , who had to return home to the us and therefore could not vote himself , said he would like to see electronic ballots introduced in future .
alan stern agreed : " i was not allowed to vote because i was not in a room in prague on thursday 24th .
of 10,000 astronomers , 4 % were in that room - you ca n't even claim consensus .
" if everyone had to travel to washington dc every time we wanted to vote for president , we would have very different results because no one would vote .
in today 's world that is idiotic .
i have nothing but ridicule for this decision . "
he added that he could not see the resolution standing for very long and did not plan to change any of the astronomy textbook he was currently writing .
but other astronomers were happy to see pluto cast from the official roster of planets .
professor iwan williams , the iau 's president of planetary systems science , commented : " pluto has lots and lots of friends ; we 're not so keen to have pluto and all his friends in the club because it gets crowded .
" by the end of the decade , we would have had 100 planets , and i think people would have said ' my goodness , what a mess they made back in 2006 ' . "
shaking hands robin catchpole , of the institute of astronomy in cambridge , uk , said : " my own personal opinion was to leave things as they were .
i met clyde tombaugh , who discovered pluto , and thought , it 's nice to shake hands with someone who discovered a planet .
mike brown 's discovery precipitated the pluto crisis " but since the iau brought out the first draft resolution , i was rather against that because i thought it was going to be very confusing .
so the best of the alternatives was to keep the eight planets as they are , and then demote pluto .
i think this is a far superior solution . "
the need for a strict definition was deemed necessary after new telescope technologies began to reveal far-off objects that rivalled pluto in size .
the critical blow for pluto came with the discovery three years ago of an object currently designated 2003 ub313 .
discovered by mike brown and colleagues at the california institute of technology , 2003 ub313 has been lauded by some as the " 10th planet " .
measurements by the hubble space telescope show it to have a diameter of 3,000km -lrb- 1,864 miles -rrb- , a few hundred km more than pluto .
2003 ub313 will now join pluto in the dwarf planet category .
mike brown seemed happy with pluto 's demotion .
" eight is enough , " he told the associated press , jokingly adding : " i may go down in history as the guy who killed pluto . "

frequently their intended is a fellow spotlight hogger , giving the paparazzi plenty of scope for pictures and gossip in the traditionally news-parched summer months .
this summer has already witnessed the nuptials of nicole kidman to country star keith urban and actress pamela anderson to kid rock .
media reports suggest tom cruise and katie holmes , brad pitt and angelina jolie and lost stars dominic monaghan and evangeline lilly are all poised to walk up the aisle .
but first up , it 's preston and chantelle ...
preston & chantelle rumoured to be getting married over the bank holiday weekend , ordinary boys singer samuel preston met chantelle houghton when she was posing as a fake pop star on channel 4 's celebrity big brother .
the former model , who recently turned 23 , went on to win the show in january - but it is her relationship with preston , 24 , which has kept her in the spotlight .
within three months of meeting on the reality tv show , the pair were engaged .
" i just want to marry him , " said houghton in april , adding that she was on " cloud nine " .
cynics have questioned the whirlwind romance between the solidly middle-class preston and the celebrity-obsessed essex girl .
reports of rows over the scale of the nuptials - reportedly a tug-of-war between a jordan-style extravaganza favoured by chantelle and a more private affair - were firmly quelled by a spokeswoman in june .
the singer insists chantelle is his " soulmate " .
" i could never be bored with her and that 's what you look for in a wife . "
tom & katie hollywood history does not tell us where film star tom cruise , 44 , met actress katie holmes , 27 , but news of their relationship first emerged in april 2005 .
cruise , who was previously married to nicole kidman and mimi rogers , had been single for a year following his split from penelope cruz , while holmes had recently called off her engagement to american pie star chris klein .
despite surprise at the 16-year age gap , the pair became engaged two months later in paris , with cruise gushing : " today is a magnificent day for me , i 'm engaged to a magnificent woman . "
for her part , holmes told the press she had dreamed of marrying cruise as a teenager when his poster hung on her wall .
but wedding plans were put on hold ahead of the birth of their daughter suri , born in april .
initial reports suggested the couple would marry this july , but holmes has barely been seen in public since the birth - and there have been no official sightings of the baby .
celebrity magazines have suggested suri 's seclusion has been urged by the church of scientology , to which cruise fervently subscribes .
but for this publicity-driven couple , it is unlikely a photo opportunity like a wedding will be missed .
dominic & evangeline lord of the rings star dominic monaghan , 29 , met evangeline lilly , 27 , while filming the hit television series lost in hawaii .
the little-known canadian actress shot to fame as the show 's leading lady kate austen , but the months away from her home cost her marriage to hockey player murray hone .
shortly afterwards , living among the close-knit cast on location in hawaii , lilly reportedly fell in love with monaghan .
" with him i feel at peace and fulfilled , " she told the news of the world in may this year .
" i could n't be happier .
he 's my favourite person in the whole world . "
the pair are both dedicated to environmental causes and have a taste for adventure .
she speaks fluent french , while monaghan , born in berlin , speaks fluent german .
no official engagement has been announced , but rumours of an impending wedding persist .
" it is still rumoured .
dom is a really spectacular person .
and i 'd rather leave it at that , " she told glamour magazine earlier this month .
brad & angelina events have moved rapidly since hollywood stars angelina jolie and brad pitt became a couple after appearing in mr and mrs smith last year .
jolie , who initially denied reports of a romance told marie claire magazine in spring 2005 : " i think the next man i get involved with would have to become mad 's father , and that 's a high bar as far as i 'm concerned .
" i 'm not anticipating that coming any time soon . "
following pitt 's split from wife jennifer aniston , the actor has become father to jolie 's three children , including adopted children maddox and zahara .
the couple celebrated the birth of their baby daughter shiloh nouvel in namibia in may .
but since their return to california , gossip columns have been rife with tales of rows - suggesting family life is taking its toll .
earlier this month , pitt 's grandmother betty russell , 83 , was quoted as saying he would not remarry until he was convinced that the marriage would work .
" he is a sensitive soul who just wants to make sure he can keep his promise this time around , " ms russell reportedly told star magazine .
olivier & kylie pop star kylie minogue has been dating french film star olivier martinez since 2003 , but the relationship appears to have strengthened during minogue 's recent recovery from breast cancer .
the 38-year-old singer , whose previous relationships included the late michael hutchence , was diagnosed with cancer last may .
after initial surgery in her hometown melbourne , minogue chose to undergo chemotherapy in paris , where boyfriend martinez lives .
prior to her illness , martinez 's track record as a ladies ' man had given minogue some cause for concern .
but the 40-year-old actor , whose leading ladies have included angelina jolie and former girlfriend juliette binoche , has been by her side throughout her treatment .
earlier this year he posted personal pictures of the couple on holiday in italy .
reports of their engagement have so far been denied , but minogue sister , dannii , told the mirror newspaper in april that olivier would be " more than ideal as a brother-in-law " .
" he has been incredible .
he makes kylie so happy - the happiest i 've seen her , " she said .
for kylie , who has spoken openly about her desire to have a family , a solid marriage like that of her parents remains " a great thing to aspire to " .

bbc news -pipe- science / nature -pipe- pluto vote ' hijacked ' in revolt bbc news / science / nature graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- friday , 25 august 2006 , 07:31 gmt 08:31 uk pluto vote ' hijacked ' in revolt by paul rincon science reporter , bbc news a fierce backlash has begun against the decision by astronomers to strip pluto of its status as a planet .
on thursday , experts approved a definition of a planet that demoted pluto to a lesser category of object .
but the lead scientist on nasa 's robotic mission to pluto has lambasted the ruling , calling it " embarrassing " .
and the chair of the committee set up to oversee agreement on a definition implied that the vote had effectively been " hijacked " . "
i have nothing but ridicule for this decision " alan stern , southwest research institute the vote took place at the international astronomical union 's -lrb- iau -rrb- 10-day general assembly in prague .
the iau has been the official naming body for astronomy since 1919 .
only 424 astronomers who remained in prague for the last day of the meeting took part .
an initial proposal by the iau to add three new planets to the solar system - the asteroid ceres , pluto 's moon charon and the distant world known as 2003 ub313 - met with considerable opposition at the meeting .
days of heated debate followed during which four separate proposals were tabled .
eventually , the scientists adopted historic guidelines that see pluto relegated to a secondary category of " dwarf planets " .
drawing the line dr alan stern , who leads the us space agency 's new horizons mission to pluto and did not vote in prague , told bbc news : " it 's an awful definition ; it 's sloppy science and it would never pass peer review - for two reasons .
" firstly , it is impossible and contrived to put a dividing line between dwarf planets and planets .
it 's as if we declared people not people for some arbitrary reason , like ' they tend to live in groups ' .
" secondly , the actual definition is even worse , because it 's inconsistent . "
one of the three criteria for planethood states that a planet must have " cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit " .
the largest objects in the solar system will either collect together material in their path or fling it out of the way with a gravitational swipe .
pluto was disqualified because its highly elliptical orbit overlaps with that of neptune .
but dr stern pointed out that earth , mars , jupiter and neptune have also not fully cleared their orbital zones .
earth orbits with 10,000 near-earth asteroids .
jupiter , meanwhile , is accompanied by 100,000 trojan asteroids on its orbital path .
these rocks are all essentially chunks of rubble left over from the formation of the solar system more than four billion years ago .
" if neptune had cleared its zone , pluto would n't be there , " he added .
stern said like-minded astronomers had begun a petition to get pluto reinstated .
car bumper stickers compelling motorists to " honk if pluto is still a planet " have gone on sale over the internet and e-mails circulating about the decision have been describing the iau as the " irrelevant astronomical union " .
' inconvenient arrangements ' owen gingerich chaired the iau 's planet definition committee and helped draft an initial proposal raising the number of planets from nine to 12 .
the harvard professor emeritus blamed the outcome in large part on a " revolt " by dynamicists - astronomers who study the motion and gravitational effects of celestial objects .
pluto - a ' demoted planet ' named after underworld god average of 5.9bn km to sun orbits sun every 248 years diameter of 2,360km has at least three moons rotates every 6.8 days gravity about 6 % of earth 's surface temperature -233c us probe -lrb- above -rrb- visits in 2015 " in our initial proposal we took the definition of a planet that the planetary geologists would like .
the dynamicists felt terribly insulted that we had not consulted with them to get their views .
somehow , there were enough of them to raise a big hue and cry , " professor gingerich said .
" their revolt raised enough of a fuss to destroy the scientific integrity and subtlety of the -lsb- earlier -rsb- resolution . "
he added : " there were 2,700 astronomers in prague during that 10-day period .
but only 10 % of them voted this afternoon .
those who disagreed and were determined to block the other resolution showed up in larger numbers than those who felt ' oh well , this is just one of those things the iau is working on ' . "
e-voting professor gingerich , who had to return home to the us and therefore could not vote himself , said he would like to see electronic ballots introduced in future .
alan stern agreed : " i was not allowed to vote because i was not in a room in prague on thursday 24th .
of 10,000 astronomers , 4 % were in that room - you ca n't even claim consensus .
" if everyone had to travel to washington dc every time we wanted to vote for president , we would have very different results because no one would vote .
in today 's world that is idiotic .
i have nothing but ridicule for this decision . "
he added that he could not see the resolution standing for very long and did not plan to change any of the astronomy textbook he was currently writing .
but other astronomers were happy to see pluto cast from the official roster of planets .
professor iwan williams , the iau 's president of planetary systems science , commented : " pluto has lots and lots of friends ; we 're not so keen to have pluto and all his friends in the club because it gets crowded .
" by the end of the decade , we would have had 100 planets , and i think people would have said ' my goodness , what a mess they made back in 2006 ' . "
shaking hands robin catchpole , of the institute of astronomy in cambridge , uk , said : " my own personal opinion was to leave things as they were .
i met clyde tombaugh , who discovered pluto , and thought , it 's nice to shake hands with someone who discovered a planet .
" but since the iau brought out the first draft resolution , i was rather against that because i thought it was going to be very confusing .
so the best of the alternatives was to keep the eight planets as they are , and then demote pluto .
i think this is a far superior solution . "
the need for a strict definition was deemed necessary after new telescope technologies began to reveal far-off objects that rivalled pluto in size .
the critical blow for pluto came with the discovery three years ago of an object currently designated 2003 ub313 .
discovered by mike brown and colleagues at the california institute of technology , 2003 ub313 has been lauded by some as the " 10th planet " .
measurements by the hubble space telescope show it to have a diameter of 3,000km -lrb- 1,864 miles -rrb- , a few hundred km more than pluto .
2003 ub313 will now join pluto in the dwarf planet category .
mike brown seemed happy with pluto 's demotion .
" eight is enough , " he told the associated press , jokingly adding : " i may go down in history as the guy who killed pluto . "

the consumer price index rose 0.3 % on the 2005 figure , suggesting a healthy level of inflation has been reached .
the sample of products the index is calculated against was altered recently to reflect changing spending patterns .
it has more hi-tech items , including flat-screen tvs and dvd recorders , as well as conveyor belt sushi .
deflation defeated ?
some economists said the evidence of price rises was more confirmation that japan was winning its seven-year battle against deflation - a trend of falling prices that hits profits and wages and discourages spending and investment .
the core price index , which excludes fresh food , rose by a less than expected 0.2 % .
but with energy costs excluded as well , the index actually fell 0.3 % in july - supplying ammunition to those who are still worried about falling prices .
japan 's main weapon against deflation has been its zero-interest rate policy , which it held for six years until raising it to 0.25 % in july after a string of reports suggested prices were rising and the economy was growing .
the central bank has held its key interest rate at 0.25 % this month , and said it would only increase rates gradually .
" i think we will have to wait until next year before the cpi -lrb- core price index -rrb- excluding food and energy starts rising , " said takahide kiuchi , chief economist at nomura securities .
" it 's clear that we do n't really have to worry about rising prices yet , and i imagine that it will be difficult for the bank of japan to raise rates again this year . "

in addition , the list of nominees has been widely criticised for seemingly ignoring some of the most popular shows on tv .
blue-ribbon panel " they 're strange , " says rob salem , tv critic for the toronto star .
" the general problem with emmy voting , even more so than the oscars , is that it tends to become more about the status quo . "
in an attempt to shake up the awards , the academy of television arts & sciences adopted a new system to select the nominees .
ellen burstyn 's nod for a 15-second performance has been criticised previously the academy 's general membership determined the runners and riders in the main categories .
this year , a blue-ribbon panel of tv insiders viewed episodes submitted by prospective nominees and drew up the shortlist .
it resulted in a list that surprised many critics .
" there are some odd things that pop up there , " says roger catlin , tv writer with the hartford courant newspaper .
last year 's two major winners , lost -lrb- best drama -rrb- and desperate housewives -lrb- best comedy -rrb- , were both snubbed .
" some critics say there might have been a fall-off in their quality but how could they fall off that much from one year to the next ? " asks mr catlin .
the sopranos stars james gandolfini and edie falco were ignored in the best actor and actress categories , in a season that some critics believe was one of the best for the mafia drama .
the most surprising nomination was for a 15-second appearance by ellen burstyn in the hbo drama mrs harris .
' deeply flawed ' the role , which involved reciting three sentences of dialogue , won the veteran actress a nod for best supporting actress in a mini-series or tv movie .
it has been cited as an example of emmy voters going for familiarity over merit .
" the nomination is the talk of the tv industry for what it reveals about the deeply flawed process by which emmy nominees are chosen - if you can call that a process , " writes adam buckman in the new york post .
the list of nominees also features a number of shows that have already ended their run on us television , such as six feet under with nine nominations and the west wing , which bagged six nods .
" i 've always been shocked by the emmy awards every time i 've got nominated , but this one is really bitter-sweet because it 's a wonderful tribute to the show , " says the west wing 's allison janney , who is up for best actress in a drama .
dame helen mirren leads the british charge for her role as elizabeth i " they really honoured all these shows that are going off the air - it was quite lovely actually . "
but many people in the tv industry would prefer the emmys to be more forward-looking than reflective .
" the academy is very slow to recognise innovative , inventive programming , as much as it 's being critically raved about , as much as people may be watching it and investing in it emotionally , " says mr salem .
grey 's anatomy and 24 dominate the list of popular shows up for awards .
a host of british stars are in the running , including dame helen mirren for the mini-series elizabeth i , sir ben kingsley for mrs harris and kate winslet and patrick stewart for playing themselves in the sitcom extras .
ricky gervais and stephen merchant are nominated for writing extras .
a surprising omission is hugh laurie , despite receiving a golden globe earlier this year for his portrayal of a cranky doctor in house .

around 250 workers have been made redundant at the plant , which produced an average of 200,000 tonnes of steel rails each year .
friday 's closure is being blamed on demand for 108m-long tracks , which can not be made at the site .
production is being moved to scunthorpe .
it marks the end of more than 130 years of steel production in workington .
the plant can not be expanded to produce 108m rails - the industry standard length , equivalent to 118 yards - because it is positioned between the sea and the rail line running along the cumbrian coast , according to corus .
site redevelopment phil dobson , the plant 's works operations manager , said : " basically the site is in the wrong direction .
it goes from the sea to the rail tracks and it needs to be the other way round to make 108m rails .
" i 'm sure corus would have built them here with the skills people have in workington if we could have put a 108m rail in , but we ca n't .
" we 've had to best utilise our other plants in corus - hence the scunthorpe plant was chosen to build the rail . "
