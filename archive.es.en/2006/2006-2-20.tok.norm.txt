" this irresponsible film does not encourage integration but sows hate and mistrust against the west , " stoiber told the bild am sonntag newspaper in a reference to the film 's popularity among germany 's large turkish immigrant community . " i urge the cinema owners in germany to pull this racist and anti-western hate film immediately , " he said , adding that " eu candidate turkey should take a clear stand .

"
the men were held for two days , their heads bagged , before being released without explanation . the incident dealt a severe and lasting blow to relations between turkey and the united states , long-time nato allies . " the turks want to see this film to a certain extent because it 's a kind of repayment on the screen for the ignominy that all muslims - whether they are believers or not - perceive in iraq , " said acclaimed turkish-german writer feridun zaimoglu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : necati sasmaz plays the turkish secret agent at the center of the movie the film features a " rambo " -like turkish intelligence officer who exacts revenge for the episode , and depicts sadistic violence against innocent iraqi civilians at the hands of the us troops . the gis are also seen running a trade in organs extracted from prisoners at baghdad 's notorious abu ghraib prison under the guidance of a jewish us military doctor for rich buyers in new york , london and tel aviv .

" the news is full of hundreds of iraqis being killed every day - there 's none of that in the movie .
it presents the situation as it is , with the americans who want to seize all power in the region . " " there is a bit of fiction , " conceded 28-year-old soldier alperen , who also withheld his surname , " but it 's very close to reality .

meanwhile new cases of h5n1 infection in italy , france and india raise the threat of a global pandemic . deadly bird flu was detected for the first time on the german mainland , bringing the total number of cases in the country to 61 , animal health experts said sunday . the friedrich-löffler institute for animal health said two new cases of the h5n1 virus that can be fatal to humans were detected in a buzzard and a gull found dead in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-pomerania .
earlier sunday , 18 new cases of h5n1 were confirmed on the baltic island of rügen , also part of the state . german chancellor angela merkel on sunday surveyed measures taken to combat bird flu on rügen , as army disinfection experts deployed to curb the spread of the virus .
" the situation is serious , " she said after meeting with local crisis teams working to contain the outbreak . she said that if the situation worsened , " the federal government will be present with all the means at its disposal . " ministers rush to stem the wave of infection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture minister seehofer -lrb- left -rrb- and till backhaus face the press mecklenburg-pomerania 's agriculture minister , till backhaus , said the 18 new cases on rügen included swans , cormorants , geese and a buzzard .
he said the state would begin slaughtering domestic fowl including chickens and ducks sunday as a precaution to prevent a broader outbreak of the virus .
backhaus declined to say how many birds would be killed . meanwhile 19 bundeswehr army specialists were sent to rügen to disinfect vehicles and people who may have come in contact with the virus , a defense ministry spokesman said .
all vehicles and bicycles leaving the island had their tires decontaminated in special disinfectant baths .
pedestrians were told to have their shoes disinfected . the island is popular with tourists and has been inundated with reporters since the outbreak earlier this month , which experts said increased the risk of the virus being carried .
" the problem is that journalists get very close to the dead animals and also film the collection of cadavers , " the president of the friedrich löffler institute for animal health , thomas mettenleiter , said .
" then the camera teams go with their contaminated equipment and clothing directly where the birds are .
that is completely irresponsible and exactly what we have been trying to prevent . " germany has confirmed three cases of the highly pathogenic strain of the h5n1 virus and was awaiting confirmation of another 10 from a european union approved laboratory in england . emergency measures urged as lock-down takes hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is rushing to get enough tamiflu for 20 percent of the population health minister ulla schmidt called on germany 's 16 states to ensure that anti-viral medications such as tamiflu and relenza are available for 20 percent of the population . germany has begun enforcing an order to keep all poultry indoors , joining the netherlands , slovenia , denmark , france , greece , luxembourg and sweden in doing so . more infected birds were found in italy and france .
in india seven people were under observation with symptoms of the disease . in italy , the institute of animal health in the northeastern city of padua announced the virus had been detected in a total of 16 birds in the country . h5n1 was also confirmed in tuzla and navodari on the shores of the black sea in romania , bringing to 33 the number of sites where it has been found nationwide , a veterinary official said .
samples from the latest romanian cases were sent to the eu reference laboratory to establish whether it was the highly pathogenic form of the h5n1 virus . nearly 35,000 birds will be culled from monday morning in romania , a top official for the constanta region , danut culetu , told mediafax news agency france faces economic implications as bird flu arrives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 virsu was found in a dead wild duck prompting panic in france french authorities vowed to spare no effort in containing avian influenza after the country became the sixth in the european union , and the most westerly , to be hit by the virus . europe 's top producer and the world 's fourth-largest exporter of poultry , france confirmed that h5n1 had been identified in a wild duck found dead in the central-eastern ain region . french health minister xavier bertrand stressed that the dead duck was an isolated case , although food authorities said tests were continuing on some 15 birds found dead in various parts of the country . " there will be no financial or economic obstacle in preparing france in the face of these risks , " he said on europe 1 radio , as the country 's main farmers ' union called for more state help in tackling the threat . the plight of eu poultry producers , faced with plummeting sales , will be discussed by agriculture ministers monday .
sales are down by 70 percent in italy , 40 to 50 percent in greece and 15 percent in france . but in brussels officials held out little hope in the short term .
" we 're sympathetic but there is very little we , from the european budget , can actually do , " a european commission spokesman said . virus spreading through europe and beyond bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is putting up buffer zones but the virus knows no borders the other eu member states so far to have detected the h5n1 virus are austria , greece , and slovenia .
there have also been cases in bulgaria , croatia , ukraine and russia .
britain , too , said the risk of bird flu there was " more likely " following the french case . " it 's not inevitable , but it is clear , obviously , that it 's more likely than it was when it was further away , " agriculture minister ben bradshaw said . in india , seven people were under observation while up to half a million birds were being slaughtered sunday after the presence of h5n1 was confirmed .

" three key european ambassadors stepped up pressure on us authorities over the weekend , after a report by un human rights experts called for the camp at guantanamo bay in cuba to be shut as soon as possible . " the sooner it is closed the better it will be for the image of the united states , not only as a military and political -lrb- power -rrb- but also as a moral leader in the world , " german ambassador wolfgang ischinger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a maximum security cell at camp delta in guantanamo france 's envoy , jean-david levitte , told cnn television that " guantanamo is an embarrassment , and so it has to be solved one way or the other . " and british ambassador sir david manning reaffirmed prime minister tony blair 's comment last week that the us camp for detainees seized in the global offensive launched after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks was " an anomaly . " commission recommends closing " we understand the context .
you 've lost a lot of people , " said manning .
" it 's difficult to find the right line to draw between your duties as a government for security and safeguarding liberty , but it is clearly an anomaly , and it needs to be dealt with . " the camp at guantanamo has some 500 inmates , most of whom have never been charged .
controversial since its establishment , it re-emerged into the international spotlight after a group of human rights experts commissioned to write a report on the camp said some practices at guantanamo were tantamount to torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general annan : camp closure sooner or later un secretary general kofi annan distanced the united nations from the report , which was commissioned by the un but carried out by independent human-rights experts .
at the same time , he clearly supported its message , saying that " sooner or later , " guantanamo would have to be closed . he added that he hoped a decision would be made quickly . " this is not a report from the un or the un secretary general , " annan clarified in a statement in new york . agreement on ' basic points ' he said he did n't agree with everything in the report .
" but the basic point - that one can not detain individuals in perpetuity , and that charges have to be brought against them and be given a chance to explain themselves , prosecuted , charged or released - i think is something that is common under any legal system . " according to annan , the us is walking a fine line with its guantanamo dealings .
" the basic premise is , we have to be particularly careful to keep a balance between effective anti-terror measures , and individual freedom and human rights , " he warned . lost balance this balance seems to have been lost in guantanamo , and the geneva conventions are not being respected .
therefore , he said , " i think sooner or later , guantanamo will need to be closed .
the us government has to decide this .
and i hope they do it as quickly as possible .

" three key european ambassadors stepped up pressure on us authorities over the weekend , after a report by un human rights experts called for the camp at guantanamo bay in cuba to be shut as soon as possible . " the sooner it is closed the better it will be for the image of the united states , not only as a military and political -lrb- power -rrb- but also as a moral leader in the world , " german ambassador wolfgang ischinger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a maximum security cell at camp delta in guantanamo france 's envoy , jean-david levitte , told cnn television that " guantanamo is an embarrassment , and so it has to be solved one way or the other . " and british ambassador sir david manning reaffirmed prime minister tony blair 's comment last week that the us camp for detainees seized in the global offensive launched after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks was " an anomaly . " commission recommends closing " we understand the context .
you 've lost a lot of people , " said manning .
" it 's difficult to find the right line to draw between your duties as a government for security and safeguarding liberty , but it is clearly an anomaly , and it needs to be dealt with . " the camp at guantanamo has some 500 inmates , most of whom have never been charged .

at the same time , he clearly supported its message , saying that " sooner or later , " guantanamo would have to be closed . he added that he hoped a decision would be made quickly . " this is not a report from the un or the un secretary general , " annan clarified in a statement in new york . agreement on ' basic points ' he said he did n't agree with everything in the report .
" but the basic point - that one can not detain individuals in perpetuity , and that charges have to be brought against them and be given a chance to explain themselves , prosecuted , charged or released - i think is something that is common under any legal system . " according to annan , the us is walking a fine line with its guantanamo dealings .
" the basic premise is , we have to be particularly careful to keep a balance between effective anti-terror measures , and individual freedom and human rights , " he warned . lost balance this balance seems to have been lost in guantanamo , and the geneva conventions are not being respected .
therefore , he said , " i think sooner or later , guantanamo will need to be closed .
the us government has to decide this .
and i hope they do it as quickly as possible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2006 modest beginning for kosovo talks expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to ethnic strife , kosovo is plagued by unemployment , corruption and poverty for the first time since the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian delegations will sit down together at the negotiating table .
the talks are bound to prove challenging for both sides . six and a half years after the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian representatives will meet for the first time in vienna on monday , feb .
20 , to discuss a key issue for both sides of the ethnic divide - decentralization and local self-government .
these talks are seen by many as a necessary prelude to the future talks on kosovo 's final status . " decentralization is a key question for kosovo , but especially for the minorities .
it will determine the competences of local self-government as well as the rights and responsibilities of the minorities , " said sören jessen-petersen , special representative of the un secretary general and head of the united nations mission in kosovo . " but one thing has to be clear : we 're talking about a decentralization , not partition of kosovo , " he said . international tug of war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un special envoy martti ahtisaari is aware of the difficulties that lie ahead the preparations for direct talks between serbian and kosovar delegations have been going on for months .
marti ahtisaari , the experienced finnish diplomat and un special envoy for the future status process for kosovo , is well aware that neither of the two parties has so far shown willingness to compromise . " this is a meeting , at which we 're starting from scratch by looking at the problems that need to be solved , " said ahtisaari . yet the position of the kosovo albanians , who are rooting for independence , is fundamentally incompatible with the position of the serbian government in belgrade , which insists that kosovo remains a part of serbia . " we insist on the formula : more than autonomy , less than independence , " said serbian foreign minister vuk draskovic . " that means two things : first of all , the protection of the serbian minority in kosovo and metohija and of the churches and monasteries in accordance with european standards .
and , secondly , preserving the current state border between serbia , albania and macedonia , " draskovic said . uncertain prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian foreign minister draskovic rejects the idea of a fully independent kosovo it is rather doubtful whether draskovic will be able to achieve his goal .
the legal position of the region is ambivalent .
in socialist yugoslavia , kosovo was - together with the northern province of vojvodina - an administrative exception . it was declared as an autonomous province of the republic of serbia , yet it had a special constitutional status within the federal state .
kosovo had the same institutions like the six federal republics of yugoslavia : a parliament of its own , a government with its own jurisdiction , as well as full representation in the central institutions of the federal state . serbian president slobodan milosevic abolished kosovo 's autonomy in 1989 and introduced a brutal police regime in the province , which consequently led to the break-up of yugoslavia .
slovenia and croatia declared independence under the pressure of milosevic 's violent repression in kosovo .
bosnia and herzegovina and macedonia followed the same path in 1991 . escalation of violence the kosovo parliament went underground after the province 's autonomy had been revoked .
by 1997 , the province was ruled in parallel by the serbian central government and the underground state dominated by ethnic albanians .
the kosovo albanians were led by ibrahim rugova , who hoped to lead the province to independence through non-violent resistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato cruise missiles and warplanes attacked yugoslavia on march 24 , 1999 but rugova was not able to control the escalation of violence .
his peaceful strategy failed in 1998 with the outbreak of an armed conflict between the growing kosovo liberation army -lrb- uck -rrb- and the serbian troops . with the experience of the horror that the wars in croatia and bosnia brought upon the balkans , nato forces intervened in march 1999 .
after three months of air strikes against serbia , milosevic was forced to sign the rambouillet accord and accept the presence of the nato peacekeeping troops in the region . the international community took account of kosovo 's complicated legal situation by pronouncing in the un-resolution 1244 that kosovo was a part of yugoslavia .
this resolution , which formed the basis of the rambouillet accord , however , did not make references to serbia . proponents of independence optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatmir sejdiu succeeded ibrahim rugova as kosovo 's president after the session of the un security council on feb .
14 , fatmir sejdiu , rugova 's successor as kosovo 's president , was optimistic that the international community would fulfil the wishes of the kosovar majority . " i welcome the engagement of all members of the security council . independence is a realistic option , which is also the will of the people of kosovo , " sejdiu said . these days , however , kosovo is not the only worry of the serbian government .
the union of serbia and montenegro , the last country to claim itself as a legal successor to yugoslavia , is on the verge of a break-up .
on feb .
25 , the montenegrin parliament will hold an extraordinary session about organizing a referendum on independence . if the parliament approves the referendum , it could take place as early as may 14 , in parallel to the elections in montenegro .

in paris , a charity group linked to the far right is under fire for serving pork soup to the homeless .
critics say the government should ban the program as the choice of food discriminates against muslims and jews . every thursday night a handful of volunteers equipped with a trunk of hot food meet up in a poor district of paris to feed the needy .
they kick off with red wine served from a cask on the roof of a car , and an appetizer of dried sausage .
that is followed with bowls of steaming hot soup , traditionally known as a " repas gaulois " or gallic dinner , cheese and dessert . anne lucien-brun , a retiree , has been volunteering with the group , solidarity for the french -lrb- sdf -rrb- for the past year .
" i am here to serve soup to the homeless , to the people who are let down by our society , and to those who accept eating soup with pork in it , " she said .
although sdf has links to a fringe far-right political group , lucien-brun says that rather than being politically motivated , the work she does is about defending french traditions . " we are in france , in europe .
we cook with pork , we have soup with pork and we do n't see why our country should be banned from doing something that is our tradition , " lucien-brun said . calls for a ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pork belongs to the traditional french menu the government does n't actually prohibit pork dinners , but some city officials would like to see that happen .
paris city hall is managed by a coalition of socialists and greens who say the meals are discriminatory and xenophobic because they 're designed to exclude observant muslims who do n't eat pork . although the police say there 's no law against distributing soup to the homeless , they shut down weekly dinners twice in december on the grounds that they were creating a public disturbance .
the volunteers say such action amounts to police harassment and prevents them from providing a much-needed service to anyone who wants to take advantage of it . kalif kamaté , a homeless muslim from mali says he prefers not to eat pork , but that these days he ca n't afford to be choosy .
similar pork dinners have been organized in nice , nantes and strasbourg , where they were also banned for a time last month . using soup to spread a message ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beggars , they say , ca n't be choosers although they have since resumed , an anti-racism group is working to outlaw the initiative nationwide .
mouloud aounit is president of the " movement against racism and for friendship between people . "
he says the pork soup kitchens go against the very concept of solidarity . " these extremist groups are using the soup kitchen to spread their message of hate and contempt towards muslims .
we just ca n't accept this form of solidarity based on discrimination . " but the sdf volunteers insist that they do not discriminate , and that anyone can eat their soup .
kamaté confirms that to be true .
" at first i was told it was a private party .
then i asked the woman in charge and she allowed me to eat and drink with the others .
it really helped me out because i 'm homeless too and i face the same problems as the others . " safe environment one such other person is michel bewulf , a 37-year-old who has been living on the streets for two years , ever since he got divorced and lost his job .
he enjoys the thursday night four-course spread .
" i like to come here because it 's friendly .
it 's also very secure , " he said .
" people offer me jackets , trousers , socks , sometimes money and food . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standing in line for soup bewulf says other soup kitchens , where there are hundreds of people and not enough food , can be dangerous , and adds that some church groups proselytize while they serve .
by contrast , he says the volunteers at the gallic dinners do n't bring up their political ideas and few of those who show up for their weekly serving of pork soup seem to care about the controversy it has stirred .
ultimately they are just happy to be fed and to share a meal in a pleasant atmosphere , where they do n't have to fight for their food or be on their guard . helen seeney -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe chilled to the bone by arctic freeze sub-zero temperatures in europe claimed more victims and set energy consumption records wednesday as the killer chill spread its icy tendrils further across the continent .

the talks are bound to prove challenging for both sides . six and a half years after the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian representatives will meet for the first time in vienna on monday , feb .
20 , to discuss a key issue for both sides of the ethnic divide - decentralization and local self-government .
these talks are seen by many as a necessary prelude to the future talks on kosovo 's final status . " decentralization is a key question for kosovo , but especially for the minorities .
it will determine the competences of local self-government as well as the rights and responsibilities of the minorities , " said sören jessen-petersen , special representative of the un secretary general and head of the united nations mission in kosovo . " but one thing has to be clear : we 're talking about a decentralization , not partition of kosovo , " he said . international tug of war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un special envoy martti ahtisaari is aware of the difficulties that lie ahead the preparations for direct talks between serbian and kosovar delegations have been going on for months .
marti ahtisaari , the experienced finnish diplomat and un special envoy for the future status process for kosovo , is well aware that neither of the two parties has so far shown willingness to compromise . " this is a meeting , at which we 're starting from scratch by looking at the problems that need to be solved , " said ahtisaari . yet the position of the kosovo albanians , who are rooting for independence , is fundamentally incompatible with the position of the serbian government in belgrade , which insists that kosovo remains a part of serbia . " we insist on the formula : more than autonomy , less than independence , " said serbian foreign minister vuk draskovic . " that means two things : first of all , the protection of the serbian minority in kosovo and metohija and of the churches and monasteries in accordance with european standards .
and , secondly , preserving the current state border between serbia , albania and macedonia , " draskovic said . uncertain prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian foreign minister draskovic rejects the idea of a fully independent kosovo it is rather doubtful whether draskovic will be able to achieve his goal .
the legal position of the region is ambivalent .
in socialist yugoslavia , kosovo was - together with the northern province of vojvodina - an administrative exception . it was declared as an autonomous province of the republic of serbia , yet it had a special constitutional status within the federal state .
kosovo had the same institutions like the six federal republics of yugoslavia : a parliament of its own , a government with its own jurisdiction , as well as full representation in the central institutions of the federal state . serbian president slobodan milosevic abolished kosovo 's autonomy in 1989 and introduced a brutal police regime in the province , which consequently led to the break-up of yugoslavia .
slovenia and croatia declared independence under the pressure of milosevic 's violent repression in kosovo .
bosnia and herzegovina and macedonia followed the same path in 1991 . escalation of violence the kosovo parliament went underground after the province 's autonomy had been revoked .
by 1997 , the province was ruled in parallel by the serbian central government and the underground state dominated by ethnic albanians .
the kosovo albanians were led by ibrahim rugova , who hoped to lead the province to independence through non-violent resistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato cruise missiles and warplanes attacked yugoslavia on march 24 , 1999 but rugova was not able to control the escalation of violence .
his peaceful strategy failed in 1998 with the outbreak of an armed conflict between the growing kosovo liberation army -lrb- uck -rrb- and the serbian troops . with the experience of the horror that the wars in croatia and bosnia brought upon the balkans , nato forces intervened in march 1999 .
after three months of air strikes against serbia , milosevic was forced to sign the rambouillet accord and accept the presence of the nato peacekeeping troops in the region . the international community took account of kosovo 's complicated legal situation by pronouncing in the un-resolution 1244 that kosovo was a part of yugoslavia .
this resolution , which formed the basis of the rambouillet accord , however , did not make references to serbia . proponents of independence optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatmir sejdiu succeeded ibrahim rugova as kosovo 's president after the session of the un security council on feb .
14 , fatmir sejdiu , rugova 's successor as kosovo 's president , was optimistic that the international community would fulfil the wishes of the kosovar majority . " i welcome the engagement of all members of the security council . independence is a realistic option , which is also the will of the people of kosovo , " sejdiu said . these days , however , kosovo is not the only worry of the serbian government .
the union of serbia and montenegro , the last country to claim itself as a legal successor to yugoslavia , is on the verge of a break-up .
on feb .
25 , the montenegrin parliament will hold an extraordinary session about organizing a referendum on independence . if the parliament approves the referendum , it could take place as early as may 14 , in parallel to the elections in montenegro .

the legal position of the region is ambivalent .
in socialist yugoslavia , kosovo was - together with the northern province of vojvodina - an administrative exception . it was declared as an autonomous province of the republic of serbia , yet it had a special constitutional status within the federal state .
kosovo had the same institutions like the six federal republics of yugoslavia : a parliament of its own , a government with its own jurisdiction , as well as full representation in the central institutions of the federal state . serbian president slobodan milosevic abolished kosovo 's autonomy in 1989 and introduced a brutal police regime in the province , which consequently led to the break-up of yugoslavia .
slovenia and croatia declared independence under the pressure of milosevic 's violent repression in kosovo .
bosnia and herzegovina and macedonia followed the same path in 1991 . escalation of violence the kosovo parliament went underground after the province 's autonomy had been revoked .
by 1997 , the province was ruled in parallel by the serbian central government and the underground state dominated by ethnic albanians .
the kosovo albanians were led by ibrahim rugova , who hoped to lead the province to independence through non-violent resistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato cruise missiles and warplanes attacked yugoslavia on march 24 , 1999 but rugova was not able to control the escalation of violence .

after three months of air strikes against serbia , milosevic was forced to sign the rambouillet accord and accept the presence of the nato peacekeeping troops in the region . the international community took account of kosovo 's complicated legal situation by pronouncing in the un-resolution 1244 that kosovo was a part of yugoslavia .

in paris , a charity group linked to the far right is under fire for serving pork soup to the homeless .
critics say the government should ban the program as the choice of food discriminates against muslims and jews . every thursday night a handful of volunteers equipped with a trunk of hot food meet up in a poor district of paris to feed the needy .
they kick off with red wine served from a cask on the roof of a car , and an appetizer of dried sausage .
that is followed with bowls of steaming hot soup , traditionally known as a " repas gaulois " or gallic dinner , cheese and dessert . anne lucien-brun , a retiree , has been volunteering with the group , solidarity for the french -lrb- sdf -rrb- for the past year .
" i am here to serve soup to the homeless , to the people who are let down by our society , and to those who accept eating soup with pork in it , " she said .
although sdf has links to a fringe far-right political group , lucien-brun says that rather than being politically motivated , the work she does is about defending french traditions . " we are in france , in europe .
we cook with pork , we have soup with pork and we do n't see why our country should be banned from doing something that is our tradition , " lucien-brun said . calls for a ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pork belongs to the traditional french menu the government does n't actually prohibit pork dinners , but some city officials would like to see that happen .
paris city hall is managed by a coalition of socialists and greens who say the meals are discriminatory and xenophobic because they 're designed to exclude observant muslims who do n't eat pork . although the police say there 's no law against distributing soup to the homeless , they shut down weekly dinners twice in december on the grounds that they were creating a public disturbance .
the volunteers say such action amounts to police harassment and prevents them from providing a much-needed service to anyone who wants to take advantage of it . kalif kamaté , a homeless muslim from mali says he prefers not to eat pork , but that these days he ca n't afford to be choosy .
similar pork dinners have been organized in nice , nantes and strasbourg , where they were also banned for a time last month . using soup to spread a message ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beggars , they say , ca n't be choosers although they have since resumed , an anti-racism group is working to outlaw the initiative nationwide .
mouloud aounit is president of the " movement against racism and for friendship between people . "
he says the pork soup kitchens go against the very concept of solidarity . " these extremist groups are using the soup kitchen to spread their message of hate and contempt towards muslims .
we just ca n't accept this form of solidarity based on discrimination . " but the sdf volunteers insist that they do not discriminate , and that anyone can eat their soup .
kamaté confirms that to be true .
" at first i was told it was a private party .
then i asked the woman in charge and she allowed me to eat and drink with the others .
it really helped me out because i 'm homeless too and i face the same problems as the others . " safe environment one such other person is michel bewulf , a 37-year-old who has been living on the streets for two years , ever since he got divorced and lost his job .
he enjoys the thursday night four-course spread .
" i like to come here because it 's friendly .
it 's also very secure , " he said .
" people offer me jackets , trousers , socks , sometimes money and food . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standing in line for soup bewulf says other soup kitchens , where there are hundreds of people and not enough food , can be dangerous , and adds that some church groups proselytize while they serve .
by contrast , he says the volunteers at the gallic dinners do n't bring up their political ideas and few of those who show up for their weekly serving of pork soup seem to care about the controversy it has stirred .
ultimately they are just happy to be fed and to share a meal in a pleasant atmosphere , where they do n't have to fight for their food or be on their guard . helen seeney -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe chilled to the bone by arctic freeze sub-zero temperatures in europe claimed more victims and set energy consumption records wednesday as the killer chill spread its icy tendrils further across the continent .

" three key european ambassadors stepped up pressure on us authorities over the weekend , after a report by un human rights experts called for the camp at guantanamo bay in cuba to be shut as soon as possible . " the sooner it is closed the better it will be for the image of the united states , not only as a military and political -lrb- power -rrb- but also as a moral leader in the world , " german ambassador wolfgang ischinger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a maximum security cell at camp delta in guantanamo france 's envoy , jean-david levitte , told cnn television that " guantanamo is an embarrassment , and so it has to be solved one way or the other .

11 , 2001 attacks was " an anomaly . " commission recommends closing " we understand the context .
you 've lost a lot of people , " said manning .
" it 's difficult to find the right line to draw between your duties as a government for security and safeguarding liberty , but it is clearly an anomaly , and it needs to be dealt with . " the camp at guantanamo has some 500 inmates , most of whom have never been charged .
controversial since its establishment , it re-emerged into the international spotlight after a group of human rights experts commissioned to write a report on the camp said some practices at guantanamo were tantamount to torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general annan : camp closure sooner or later un secretary general kofi annan distanced the united nations from the report , which was commissioned by the un but carried out by independent human-rights experts .

" this is not a report from the un or the un secretary general , " annan clarified in a statement in new york . agreement on ' basic points ' he said he did n't agree with everything in the report .
" but the basic point - that one can not detain individuals in perpetuity , and that charges have to be brought against them and be given a chance to explain themselves , prosecuted , charged or released - i think is something that is common under any legal system . " according to annan , the us is walking a fine line with its guantanamo dealings .
" the basic premise is , we have to be particularly careful to keep a balance between effective anti-terror measures , and individual freedom and human rights , " he warned . lost balance this balance seems to have been lost in guantanamo , and the geneva conventions are not being respected .
therefore , he said , " i think sooner or later , guantanamo will need to be closed .
the us government has to decide this .

earlier , he had acknowledged that the auschwitz gas chambers had existed . during the one-day trial , irving had pleaded guilty to a charge from 1989 of denying the holocaust , which in austria is a crime , but said he no longer held that view . " i acknowledge my guilt on this charge , " he told judge peter liebetreu . irving said that he now realized his statement that " there were no gas chambers in auschwitz -lrb- was -rrb- false . " he had earlier told reporters upon entering the court in central vienna in handcuffs that it was " ridiculous for me to be standing here on trial for something i expressed 17 years ago . " i am not a holocaust denier , " he added .
" my views have changed .
history is a constantly growing tree . ...

" asked about the holocaust , he said : " i would call it the jewish tragedy in world war ii " and that millions of jews had died . accurate research ? irving , whose handcuffs were removed as the trial began , insisted on the accuracy of his historical research as liebetreu bombarded him with questions about holocaust denials he had made in the past and what he thought now . the 67-year-old said he had changed his mind since 1989 after discovering documents , some of them from adolf eichmann who organized the nazi genocide of the jews , while on a trip to argentina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wreath lies on the tracks leading to the gas chamber and crematorium at auschwitz but irving insisted on the logic of some of his past statements , such as saying the fact 100,000 people survived auschwitz was a sign the gas chambers did not exist , even if he now regretted the formulation . under questioning from prosecutor michael klackl , irving denied that his statement about the gas chambers was tantamount to denying the holocaust . " that was no holocaust denial , that was only -lrb- a statement -rrb- about a part of the -lrb- holocaust -rrb- history , " irving said . klackl later told reporters : " we know about david irving , that he always tries to arrange every evidence and find many reasons why you should take his argument in the right way .

" the right-wing historian was arrested in november after a routine check on a highway in austria . the warrant for his arrest was issued by a vienna court in 1989 after he allegedly denied at meetings in austria that the nazi regime used gas chambers in concentration camps . irving was on trial for also saying that the november 1938 kristallnacht pogrom against the jews was not the work of the nazis but " unknown " people who had dressed up as storm troopers , and that adolf hitler had in fact protected the jews . ba n n ed from livi n g i n germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irving now says the nazis systematically murdered jews irving has become notorious worldwide for attempting to establish , despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary , that hitler was not party to the holocaust , that there were no gas chambers in auschwitz , and that the number of jews killed by the nazis was greatly exaggerated . he has been condemned by the courts several times , notably in britain and germany , and last year he was refused entry to new zealand .
he is reportedly also banned from residing in australia , canada , italy and south africa as well as germany . irving sparked widespread outrage with his book " hitler 's war " in 1977 , in which he claimed the nazi dictator did not know about the mass killings of jews until 1943 and that he never ordered the holocaust .

" the right-wing historian was arrested in november after a routine check on a highway in austria . the warrant for his arrest was issued by a vienna court in 1989 after he allegedly denied at meetings in austria that the nazi regime used gas chambers in concentration camps . irving was on trial for also saying that the november 1938 kristallnacht pogrom against the jews was not the work of the nazis but " unknown " people who had dressed up as storm troopers , and that adolf hitler had in fact protected the jews . ba n n ed from livi n g i n germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irving now says the nazis systematically murdered jews irving has become notorious worldwide for attempting to establish , despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary , that hitler was not party to the holocaust , that there were no gas chambers in auschwitz , and that the number of jews killed by the nazis was greatly exaggerated . he has been condemned by the courts several times , notably in britain and germany , and last year he was refused entry to new zealand .
he is reportedly also banned from residing in australia , canada , italy and south africa as well as germany . irving sparked widespread outrage with his book " hitler 's war " in 1977 , in which he claimed the nazi dictator did not know about the mass killings of jews until 1943 and that he never ordered the holocaust .

what will be the outcome ?
germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .
as high-level talks on monday failed to reach agreement , union leader frank bsirske settled in for a long haul . in all , it is the largest strike germany has seen in 14 years , with more than 30,000 civil servants - including trash collectors , kindergarten teachers , nurses and government officials - stopping work across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes among trash collectors has led to garbage hills like this one in lower saxony prior to a crucial high-level meeting between unions and public service representatives , key negotiators gave no clear signals that the talks would be fruitful .
state leaders have formed a united front in favor of increasing civil service work hours from 38.5 to 40 hours , while the union has said it is committed to preventing this .
at the head of services trade union ver.di is frank bsirske .
ver.di was created five years ago when five smaller unions joined forces , and bsirske 's gift has been the ability to unify his union 's various membership streams into a single , powerful organization .
at stake : a union 's reputation as the 54-year-old union organizer sees it , the current fight is about more than just jobs and money for its members .
it will decide whether germany 's approximately three million civil servants will have equal pay and working conditions on the local , state and federal level .
more importantly , the results of the strike show whether ver.di - one of the world 's largest trade unions - is capable of supporting its members in the face of opposition from public employers .
like virtually all german unions , ver.di has seen its membership rolls decline recently .
it is clear that the fight over the work week will be a decisive one for bsirske and the unions alike .
up to now , everything has gone well for the unions - the strike has enjoyed more than 50 percent approval among the public - but the honeymoon may not last .
if employers remain inflexible , goodwill may well begin to drop off .
' fight for prestige ' a loss for ver.di in this case could mean a reassessment of the value of unions in german society .
" ver.di is fighting for its prestige and its influence on the political stage , " berlin union researcher hans-peter müller told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di members took to the streets for bsirske , the battle will be a complex one ; the strikes are essentially defensive moves against the state and local governments , which are wrangling over details of wage agreements and work hours .
a defensive strike is unusual for germany 's civil servants , and it is a new experience for bsirske .
the last widespread work conflict , 14 years ago , saw some 400,000 workers hit the streets , and public services in the country suffered greatly .
as a result , when bsirske was coming up the union ranks , the mere threat of a strike was enough to bring parties to the table .
not afraid of conflict but bsirske does n't shy away from conflict .
as head of personnel for the city of hanover , he had to cut some 1,000 jobs . " as someone with three decades of union work , and who also had personnel responsibilities in a large organization , i not only learned how to communicate , but how to deal with conflict , " he said .
" but i think these abilities are expected in a union leader .
he needs to be able to find common solutions with employers , and when nothing else works , he has to be able to get into conflicts .
if the membership wants it . "
politics in the blood ?
bsirske studied political science , and even today he is a political person . the son of a volkswagen works council head , he joined the social democratic party at age 15 , and later represented the greens in hanover .
he is the only union leader who is a member of the greens . " i think a union that represents such a wide array of jobs and careers is well served by someone with a slightly unusual background , " he said . with so much riding on the outcome of the strikes , union members can only help bsirske is right . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german public sector strike expands germany 's public sector is facing large scale industrial action for the first time in more than a decade .

what will be the outcome ?
germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .
as high-level talks on monday failed to reach agreement , union leader frank bsirske settled in for a long haul . in all , it is the largest strike germany has seen in 14 years , with more than 30,000 civil servants - including trash collectors , kindergarten teachers , nurses and government officials - stopping work across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes among trash collectors has led to garbage hills like this one in lower saxony prior to a crucial high-level meeting between unions and public service representatives , key negotiators gave no clear signals that the talks would be fruitful .
state leaders have formed a united front in favor of increasing civil service work hours from 38.5 to 40 hours , while the union has said it is committed to preventing this .
at the head of services trade union ver.di is frank bsirske .
ver.di was created five years ago when five smaller unions joined forces , and bsirske 's gift has been the ability to unify his union 's various membership streams into a single , powerful organization .
at stake : a union 's reputation as the 54-year-old union organizer sees it , the current fight is about more than just jobs and money for its members .
it will decide whether germany 's approximately three million civil servants will have equal pay and working conditions on the local , state and federal level .
more importantly , the results of the strike show whether ver.di - one of the world 's largest trade unions - is capable of supporting its members in the face of opposition from public employers .
like virtually all german unions , ver.di has seen its membership rolls decline recently .
it is clear that the fight over the work week will be a decisive one for bsirske and the unions alike .
up to now , everything has gone well for the unions - the strike has enjoyed more than 50 percent approval among the public - but the honeymoon may not last .
if employers remain inflexible , goodwill may well begin to drop off .
' fight for prestige ' a loss for ver.di in this case could mean a reassessment of the value of unions in german society .
" ver.di is fighting for its prestige and its influence on the political stage , " berlin union researcher hans-peter müller told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di members took to the streets for bsirske , the battle will be a complex one ; the strikes are essentially defensive moves against the state and local governments , which are wrangling over details of wage agreements and work hours .
a defensive strike is unusual for germany 's civil servants , and it is a new experience for bsirske .
the last widespread work conflict , 14 years ago , saw some 400,000 workers hit the streets , and public services in the country suffered greatly .
as a result , when bsirske was coming up the union ranks , the mere threat of a strike was enough to bring parties to the table .
not afraid of conflict but bsirske does n't shy away from conflict .
as head of personnel for the city of hanover , he had to cut some 1,000 jobs . " as someone with three decades of union work , and who also had personnel responsibilities in a large organization , i not only learned how to communicate , but how to deal with conflict , " he said .
" but i think these abilities are expected in a union leader .
he needs to be able to find common solutions with employers , and when nothing else works , he has to be able to get into conflicts .
if the membership wants it . "
politics in the blood ?
bsirske studied political science , and even today he is a political person . the son of a volkswagen works council head , he joined the social democratic party at age 15 , and later represented the greens in hanover .
he is the only union leader who is a member of the greens . " i think a union that represents such a wide array of jobs and careers is well served by someone with a slightly unusual background , " he said . with so much riding on the outcome of the strikes , union members can only help bsirske is right . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german public sector strike expands germany 's public sector is facing large scale industrial action for the first time in more than a decade .

earlier , he had acknowledged that the auschwitz gas chambers had existed . during the one-day trial , irving had pleaded guilty to a charge from 1989 of denying the holocaust , which in austria is a crime , but said he no longer held that view . " i acknowledge my guilt on this charge , " he told judge peter liebetreu . irving said that he now realized his statement that " there were no gas chambers in auschwitz -lrb- was -rrb- false . " he had earlier told reporters upon entering the court in central vienna in handcuffs that it was " ridiculous for me to be standing here on trial for something i expressed 17 years ago . " i am not a holocaust denier , " he added .
" my views have changed .
history is a constantly growing tree . ...
the more documents are available , the more you learn , and i have learned a lot since 1989 . " asked about the holocaust , he said : " i would call it the jewish tragedy in world war ii " and that millions of jews had died . accurate research ? irving , whose handcuffs were removed as the trial began , insisted on the accuracy of his historical research as liebetreu bombarded him with questions about holocaust denials he had made in the past and what he thought now . the 67-year-old said he had changed his mind since 1989 after discovering documents , some of them from adolf eichmann who organized the nazi genocide of the jews , while on a trip to argentina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wreath lies on the tracks leading to the gas chamber and crematorium at auschwitz but irving insisted on the logic of some of his past statements , such as saying the fact 100,000 people survived auschwitz was a sign the gas chambers did not exist , even if he now regretted the formulation . under questioning from prosecutor michael klackl , irving denied that his statement about the gas chambers was tantamount to denying the holocaust . " that was no holocaust denial , that was only -lrb- a statement -rrb- about a part of the -lrb- holocaust -rrb- history , " irving said . klackl later told reporters : " we know about david irving , that he always tries to arrange every evidence and find many reasons why you should take his argument in the right way .

" the right-wing historian was arrested in november after a routine check on a highway in austria . the warrant for his arrest was issued by a vienna court in 1989 after he allegedly denied at meetings in austria that the nazi regime used gas chambers in concentration camps . irving was on trial for also saying that the november 1938 kristallnacht pogrom against the jews was not the work of the nazis but " unknown " people who had dressed up as storm troopers , and that adolf hitler had in fact protected the jews . ba n n ed from livi n g i n germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irving now says the nazis systematically murdered jews irving has become notorious worldwide for attempting to establish , despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary , that hitler was not party to the holocaust , that there were no gas chambers in auschwitz , and that the number of jews killed by the nazis was greatly exaggerated . he has been condemned by the courts several times , notably in britain and germany , and last year he was refused entry to new zealand .
he is reportedly also banned from residing in australia , canada , italy and south africa as well as germany . irving sparked widespread outrage with his book " hitler 's war " in 1977 , in which he claimed the nazi dictator did not know about the mass killings of jews until 1943 and that he never ordered the holocaust .
he carried a copy of that book when he entered court monday . in 2000 , he lost a high-profile libel case in london against us historian deborah lipstadt after she called him a holocaust denier . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany condemns proposed iranian holocaust conference the iranian government 's announcement that it plans to hold a conference on the holocaust with notorious deniers as guests has caused outrage in germany .

earlier , he had acknowledged that the auschwitz gas chambers had existed . during the one-day trial , irving had pleaded guilty to a charge from 1989 of denying the holocaust , which in austria is a crime , but said he no longer held that view . " i acknowledge my guilt on this charge , " he told judge peter liebetreu . irving said that he now realized his statement that " there were no gas chambers in auschwitz -lrb- was -rrb- false . " he had earlier told reporters upon entering the court in central vienna in handcuffs that it was " ridiculous for me to be standing here on trial for something i expressed 17 years ago . " i am not a holocaust denier , " he added .
" my views have changed .
history is a constantly growing tree . ...
the more documents are available , the more you learn , and i have learned a lot since 1989 . " asked about the holocaust , he said : " i would call it the jewish tragedy in world war ii " and that millions of jews had died . accurate research ? irving , whose handcuffs were removed as the trial began , insisted on the accuracy of his historical research as liebetreu bombarded him with questions about holocaust denials he had made in the past and what he thought now . the 67-year-old said he had changed his mind since 1989 after discovering documents , some of them from adolf eichmann who organized the nazi genocide of the jews , while on a trip to argentina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wreath lies on the tracks leading to the gas chamber and crematorium at auschwitz but irving insisted on the logic of some of his past statements , such as saying the fact 100,000 people survived auschwitz was a sign the gas chambers did not exist , even if he now regretted the formulation . under questioning from prosecutor michael klackl , irving denied that his statement about the gas chambers was tantamount to denying the holocaust . " that was no holocaust denial , that was only -lrb- a statement -rrb- about a part of the -lrb- holocaust -rrb- history , " irving said . klackl later told reporters : " we know about david irving , that he always tries to arrange every evidence and find many reasons why you should take his argument in the right way . " irvi n g faced up to 10 years i n priso n irving , 67 , faced up to 10 years in jail under an austrian law that prosecutes those who " deny the genocide by the national socialists or other national socialist crimes against humanity . " the right-wing historian was arrested in november after a routine check on a highway in austria . the warrant for his arrest was issued by a vienna court in 1989 after he allegedly denied at meetings in austria that the nazi regime used gas chambers in concentration camps . irving was on trial for also saying that the november 1938 kristallnacht pogrom against the jews was not the work of the nazis but " unknown " people who had dressed up as storm troopers , and that adolf hitler had in fact protected the jews . ba n n ed from livi n g i n germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irving now says the nazis systematically murdered jews irving has become notorious worldwide for attempting to establish , despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary , that hitler was not party to the holocaust , that there were no gas chambers in auschwitz , and that the number of jews killed by the nazis was greatly exaggerated . he has been condemned by the courts several times , notably in britain and germany , and last year he was refused entry to new zealand .
he is reportedly also banned from residing in australia , canada , italy and south africa as well as germany . irving sparked widespread outrage with his book " hitler 's war " in 1977 , in which he claimed the nazi dictator did not know about the mass killings of jews until 1943 and that he never ordered the holocaust .
he carried a copy of that book when he entered court monday . in 2000 , he lost a high-profile libel case in london against us historian deborah lipstadt after she called him a holocaust denier . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany condemns proposed iranian holocaust conference the iranian government 's announcement that it plans to hold a conference on the holocaust with notorious deniers as guests has caused outrage in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2006 modest beginning for kosovo talks expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to ethnic strife , kosovo is plagued by unemployment , corruption and poverty for the first time since the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian delegations will sit down together at the negotiating table .
the talks are bound to prove challenging for both sides . six and a half years after the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian representatives will meet for the first time in vienna on monday , feb .
20 , to discuss a key issue for both sides of the ethnic divide - decentralization and local self-government .
these talks are seen by many as a necessary prelude to the future talks on kosovo 's final status . " decentralization is a key question for kosovo , but especially for the minorities .
it will determine the competences of local self-government as well as the rights and responsibilities of the minorities , " said sören jessen-petersen , special representative of the un secretary general and head of the united nations mission in kosovo . " but one thing has to be clear : we 're talking about a decentralization , not partition of kosovo , " he said . international tug of war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un special envoy martti ahtisaari is aware of the difficulties that lie ahead the preparations for direct talks between serbian and kosovar delegations have been going on for months .
marti ahtisaari , the experienced finnish diplomat and un special envoy for the future status process for kosovo , is well aware that neither of the two parties has so far shown willingness to compromise . " this is a meeting , at which we 're starting from scratch by looking at the problems that need to be solved , " said ahtisaari . yet the position of the kosovo albanians , who are rooting for independence , is fundamentally incompatible with the position of the serbian government in belgrade , which insists that kosovo remains a part of serbia . " we insist on the formula : more than autonomy , less than independence , " said serbian foreign minister vuk draskovic . " that means two things : first of all , the protection of the serbian minority in kosovo and metohija and of the churches and monasteries in accordance with european standards .
and , secondly , preserving the current state border between serbia , albania and macedonia , " draskovic said . uncertain prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian foreign minister draskovic rejects the idea of a fully independent kosovo it is rather doubtful whether draskovic will be able to achieve his goal .
the legal position of the region is ambivalent .
in socialist yugoslavia , kosovo was - together with the northern province of vojvodina - an administrative exception . it was declared as an autonomous province of the republic of serbia , yet it had a special constitutional status within the federal state .
kosovo had the same institutions like the six federal republics of yugoslavia : a parliament of its own , a government with its own jurisdiction , as well as full representation in the central institutions of the federal state . serbian president slobodan milosevic abolished kosovo 's autonomy in 1989 and introduced a brutal police regime in the province , which consequently led to the break-up of yugoslavia .
slovenia and croatia declared independence under the pressure of milosevic 's violent repression in kosovo .
bosnia and herzegovina and macedonia followed the same path in 1991 . escalation of violence the kosovo parliament went underground after the province 's autonomy had been revoked .
by 1997 , the province was ruled in parallel by the serbian central government and the underground state dominated by ethnic albanians .
the kosovo albanians were led by ibrahim rugova , who hoped to lead the province to independence through non-violent resistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato cruise missiles and warplanes attacked yugoslavia on march 24 , 1999 but rugova was not able to control the escalation of violence .

after three months of air strikes against serbia , milosevic was forced to sign the rambouillet accord and accept the presence of the nato peacekeeping troops in the region . the international community took account of kosovo 's complicated legal situation by pronouncing in the un-resolution 1244 that kosovo was a part of yugoslavia .

the talks are bound to prove challenging for both sides . six and a half years after the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian representatives will meet for the first time in vienna on monday , feb .
20 , to discuss a key issue for both sides of the ethnic divide - decentralization and local self-government .
these talks are seen by many as a necessary prelude to the future talks on kosovo 's final status . " decentralization is a key question for kosovo , but especially for the minorities .
it will determine the competences of local self-government as well as the rights and responsibilities of the minorities , " said sören jessen-petersen , special representative of the un secretary general and head of the united nations mission in kosovo . " but one thing has to be clear : we 're talking about a decentralization , not partition of kosovo , " he said . international tug of war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un special envoy martti ahtisaari is aware of the difficulties that lie ahead the preparations for direct talks between serbian and kosovar delegations have been going on for months .
marti ahtisaari , the experienced finnish diplomat and un special envoy for the future status process for kosovo , is well aware that neither of the two parties has so far shown willingness to compromise . " this is a meeting , at which we 're starting from scratch by looking at the problems that need to be solved , " said ahtisaari . yet the position of the kosovo albanians , who are rooting for independence , is fundamentally incompatible with the position of the serbian government in belgrade , which insists that kosovo remains a part of serbia . " we insist on the formula : more than autonomy , less than independence , " said serbian foreign minister vuk draskovic . " that means two things : first of all , the protection of the serbian minority in kosovo and metohija and of the churches and monasteries in accordance with european standards .
and , secondly , preserving the current state border between serbia , albania and macedonia , " draskovic said . uncertain prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian foreign minister draskovic rejects the idea of a fully independent kosovo it is rather doubtful whether draskovic will be able to achieve his goal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2006 modest beginning for kosovo talks expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to ethnic strife , kosovo is plagued by unemployment , corruption and poverty for the first time since the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian delegations will sit down together at the negotiating table .
the talks are bound to prove challenging for both sides . six and a half years after the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian representatives will meet for the first time in vienna on monday , feb .
20 , to discuss a key issue for both sides of the ethnic divide - decentralization and local self-government .
these talks are seen by many as a necessary prelude to the future talks on kosovo 's final status . " decentralization is a key question for kosovo , but especially for the minorities .
it will determine the competences of local self-government as well as the rights and responsibilities of the minorities , " said sören jessen-petersen , special representative of the un secretary general and head of the united nations mission in kosovo . " but one thing has to be clear : we 're talking about a decentralization , not partition of kosovo , " he said . international tug of war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un special envoy martti ahtisaari is aware of the difficulties that lie ahead the preparations for direct talks between serbian and kosovar delegations have been going on for months .
marti ahtisaari , the experienced finnish diplomat and un special envoy for the future status process for kosovo , is well aware that neither of the two parties has so far shown willingness to compromise . " this is a meeting , at which we 're starting from scratch by looking at the problems that need to be solved , " said ahtisaari . yet the position of the kosovo albanians , who are rooting for independence , is fundamentally incompatible with the position of the serbian government in belgrade , which insists that kosovo remains a part of serbia . " we insist on the formula : more than autonomy , less than independence , " said serbian foreign minister vuk draskovic . " that means two things : first of all , the protection of the serbian minority in kosovo and metohija and of the churches and monasteries in accordance with european standards .
and , secondly , preserving the current state border between serbia , albania and macedonia , " draskovic said . uncertain prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian foreign minister draskovic rejects the idea of a fully independent kosovo it is rather doubtful whether draskovic will be able to achieve his goal .
the legal position of the region is ambivalent .
in socialist yugoslavia , kosovo was - together with the northern province of vojvodina - an administrative exception . it was declared as an autonomous province of the republic of serbia , yet it had a special constitutional status within the federal state .
kosovo had the same institutions like the six federal republics of yugoslavia : a parliament of its own , a government with its own jurisdiction , as well as full representation in the central institutions of the federal state . serbian president slobodan milosevic abolished kosovo 's autonomy in 1989 and introduced a brutal police regime in the province , which consequently led to the break-up of yugoslavia .
slovenia and croatia declared independence under the pressure of milosevic 's violent repression in kosovo .
bosnia and herzegovina and macedonia followed the same path in 1991 . escalation of violence the kosovo parliament went underground after the province 's autonomy had been revoked .
by 1997 , the province was ruled in parallel by the serbian central government and the underground state dominated by ethnic albanians .
the kosovo albanians were led by ibrahim rugova , who hoped to lead the province to independence through non-violent resistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato cruise missiles and warplanes attacked yugoslavia on march 24 , 1999 but rugova was not able to control the escalation of violence .
his peaceful strategy failed in 1998 with the outbreak of an armed conflict between the growing kosovo liberation army -lrb- uck -rrb- and the serbian troops . with the experience of the horror that the wars in croatia and bosnia brought upon the balkans , nato forces intervened in march 1999 .
after three months of air strikes against serbia , milosevic was forced to sign the rambouillet accord and accept the presence of the nato peacekeeping troops in the region . the international community took account of kosovo 's complicated legal situation by pronouncing in the un-resolution 1244 that kosovo was a part of yugoslavia .
this resolution , which formed the basis of the rambouillet accord , however , did not make references to serbia . proponents of independence optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatmir sejdiu succeeded ibrahim rugova as kosovo 's president after the session of the un security council on feb .
14 , fatmir sejdiu , rugova 's successor as kosovo 's president , was optimistic that the international community would fulfil the wishes of the kosovar majority . " i welcome the engagement of all members of the security council . independence is a realistic option , which is also the will of the people of kosovo , " sejdiu said . these days , however , kosovo is not the only worry of the serbian government .
the union of serbia and montenegro , the last country to claim itself as a legal successor to yugoslavia , is on the verge of a break-up .
on feb .
25 , the montenegrin parliament will hold an extraordinary session about organizing a referendum on independence . if the parliament approves the referendum , it could take place as early as may 14 , in parallel to the elections in montenegro .
and if montenegro and serbia part their ways , it is hard to expect that the international community will force kosovo to be reunited with serbia . an impossible compromise ? the status of kosovo may therefore be decided by the international community against the wishes of belgrade .
it may additionally frustrate the serbian minority in kosovo , which grew increasingly concerned after the outbreak of ethnic violence in march 2004 , which - despite the presence of the international peacekeeping troops in the region - left 28 people killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , displaced from their homes . before the final status of kosovo is decided , the security council will insist that the minorities in kosovo , and especially the serbs , receive full and comprehensive minority rights and that they are represented in the country 's institutions .
the practical implementation and safeguarding of these rights could become the core of a conditional independence under international observation . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , un call for unity in kosovo after rugova 's death eu foreign policy chief javier solana called on the leaders of kosovo to show " unity and responsibility " following the death saturday of the province 's president , ibrahim rugova .

in paris , a charity group linked to the far right is under fire for serving pork soup to the homeless .
critics say the government should ban the program as the choice of food discriminates against muslims and jews . every thursday night a handful of volunteers equipped with a trunk of hot food meet up in a poor district of paris to feed the needy .
they kick off with red wine served from a cask on the roof of a car , and an appetizer of dried sausage .
that is followed with bowls of steaming hot soup , traditionally known as a " repas gaulois " or gallic dinner , cheese and dessert . anne lucien-brun , a retiree , has been volunteering with the group , solidarity for the french -lrb- sdf -rrb- for the past year .
" i am here to serve soup to the homeless , to the people who are let down by our society , and to those who accept eating soup with pork in it , " she said .
although sdf has links to a fringe far-right political group , lucien-brun says that rather than being politically motivated , the work she does is about defending french traditions . " we are in france , in europe .
we cook with pork , we have soup with pork and we do n't see why our country should be banned from doing something that is our tradition , " lucien-brun said . calls for a ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pork belongs to the traditional french menu the government does n't actually prohibit pork dinners , but some city officials would like to see that happen .
paris city hall is managed by a coalition of socialists and greens who say the meals are discriminatory and xenophobic because they 're designed to exclude observant muslims who do n't eat pork . although the police say there 's no law against distributing soup to the homeless , they shut down weekly dinners twice in december on the grounds that they were creating a public disturbance .
the volunteers say such action amounts to police harassment and prevents them from providing a much-needed service to anyone who wants to take advantage of it . kalif kamaté , a homeless muslim from mali says he prefers not to eat pork , but that these days he ca n't afford to be choosy .

he says the pork soup kitchens go against the very concept of solidarity . " these extremist groups are using the soup kitchen to spread their message of hate and contempt towards muslims .

kamaté confirms that to be true .

in paris , a charity group linked to the far right is under fire for serving pork soup to the homeless .
critics say the government should ban the program as the choice of food discriminates against muslims and jews . every thursday night a handful of volunteers equipped with a trunk of hot food meet up in a poor district of paris to feed the needy .
they kick off with red wine served from a cask on the roof of a car , and an appetizer of dried sausage .
that is followed with bowls of steaming hot soup , traditionally known as a " repas gaulois " or gallic dinner , cheese and dessert . anne lucien-brun , a retiree , has been volunteering with the group , solidarity for the french -lrb- sdf -rrb- for the past year .
" i am here to serve soup to the homeless , to the people who are let down by our society , and to those who accept eating soup with pork in it , " she said .
although sdf has links to a fringe far-right political group , lucien-brun says that rather than being politically motivated , the work she does is about defending french traditions . " we are in france , in europe .
we cook with pork , we have soup with pork and we do n't see why our country should be banned from doing something that is our tradition , " lucien-brun said . calls for a ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pork belongs to the traditional french menu the government does n't actually prohibit pork dinners , but some city officials would like to see that happen .
paris city hall is managed by a coalition of socialists and greens who say the meals are discriminatory and xenophobic because they 're designed to exclude observant muslims who do n't eat pork . although the police say there 's no law against distributing soup to the homeless , they shut down weekly dinners twice in december on the grounds that they were creating a public disturbance .
the volunteers say such action amounts to police harassment and prevents them from providing a much-needed service to anyone who wants to take advantage of it . kalif kamaté , a homeless muslim from mali says he prefers not to eat pork , but that these days he ca n't afford to be choosy .

he says the pork soup kitchens go against the very concept of solidarity . " these extremist groups are using the soup kitchen to spread their message of hate and contempt towards muslims .
we just ca n't accept this form of solidarity based on discrimination . " but the sdf volunteers insist that they do not discriminate , and that anyone can eat their soup .
kamaté confirms that to be true .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2006 modest beginning for kosovo talks expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to ethnic strife , kosovo is plagued by unemployment , corruption and poverty for the first time since the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian delegations will sit down together at the negotiating table .
the talks are bound to prove challenging for both sides . six and a half years after the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian representatives will meet for the first time in vienna on monday , feb .
20 , to discuss a key issue for both sides of the ethnic divide - decentralization and local self-government .
these talks are seen by many as a necessary prelude to the future talks on kosovo 's final status . " decentralization is a key question for kosovo , but especially for the minorities .
it will determine the competences of local self-government as well as the rights and responsibilities of the minorities , " said sören jessen-petersen , special representative of the un secretary general and head of the united nations mission in kosovo . " but one thing has to be clear : we 're talking about a decentralization , not partition of kosovo , " he said . international tug of war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un special envoy martti ahtisaari is aware of the difficulties that lie ahead the preparations for direct talks between serbian and kosovar delegations have been going on for months .
marti ahtisaari , the experienced finnish diplomat and un special envoy for the future status process for kosovo , is well aware that neither of the two parties has so far shown willingness to compromise . " this is a meeting , at which we 're starting from scratch by looking at the problems that need to be solved , " said ahtisaari . yet the position of the kosovo albanians , who are rooting for independence , is fundamentally incompatible with the position of the serbian government in belgrade , which insists that kosovo remains a part of serbia . " we insist on the formula : more than autonomy , less than independence , " said serbian foreign minister vuk draskovic . " that means two things : first of all , the protection of the serbian minority in kosovo and metohija and of the churches and monasteries in accordance with european standards .
and , secondly , preserving the current state border between serbia , albania and macedonia , " draskovic said . uncertain prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian foreign minister draskovic rejects the idea of a fully independent kosovo it is rather doubtful whether draskovic will be able to achieve his goal .
the legal position of the region is ambivalent .
in socialist yugoslavia , kosovo was - together with the northern province of vojvodina - an administrative exception . it was declared as an autonomous province of the republic of serbia , yet it had a special constitutional status within the federal state .
kosovo had the same institutions like the six federal republics of yugoslavia : a parliament of its own , a government with its own jurisdiction , as well as full representation in the central institutions of the federal state . serbian president slobodan milosevic abolished kosovo 's autonomy in 1989 and introduced a brutal police regime in the province , which consequently led to the break-up of yugoslavia .
slovenia and croatia declared independence under the pressure of milosevic 's violent repression in kosovo .
bosnia and herzegovina and macedonia followed the same path in 1991 . escalation of violence the kosovo parliament went underground after the province 's autonomy had been revoked .
by 1997 , the province was ruled in parallel by the serbian central government and the underground state dominated by ethnic albanians .
the kosovo albanians were led by ibrahim rugova , who hoped to lead the province to independence through non-violent resistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato cruise missiles and warplanes attacked yugoslavia on march 24 , 1999 but rugova was not able to control the escalation of violence .
his peaceful strategy failed in 1998 with the outbreak of an armed conflict between the growing kosovo liberation army -lrb- uck -rrb- and the serbian troops . with the experience of the horror that the wars in croatia and bosnia brought upon the balkans , nato forces intervened in march 1999 .
after three months of air strikes against serbia , milosevic was forced to sign the rambouillet accord and accept the presence of the nato peacekeeping troops in the region . the international community took account of kosovo 's complicated legal situation by pronouncing in the un-resolution 1244 that kosovo was a part of yugoslavia .
this resolution , which formed the basis of the rambouillet accord , however , did not make references to serbia . proponents of independence optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatmir sejdiu succeeded ibrahim rugova as kosovo 's president after the session of the un security council on feb .
14 , fatmir sejdiu , rugova 's successor as kosovo 's president , was optimistic that the international community would fulfil the wishes of the kosovar majority . " i welcome the engagement of all members of the security council . independence is a realistic option , which is also the will of the people of kosovo , " sejdiu said . these days , however , kosovo is not the only worry of the serbian government .
the union of serbia and montenegro , the last country to claim itself as a legal successor to yugoslavia , is on the verge of a break-up .
on feb .
25 , the montenegrin parliament will hold an extraordinary session about organizing a referendum on independence . if the parliament approves the referendum , it could take place as early as may 14 , in parallel to the elections in montenegro .
and if montenegro and serbia part their ways , it is hard to expect that the international community will force kosovo to be reunited with serbia . an impossible compromise ? the status of kosovo may therefore be decided by the international community against the wishes of belgrade .
it may additionally frustrate the serbian minority in kosovo , which grew increasingly concerned after the outbreak of ethnic violence in march 2004 , which - despite the presence of the international peacekeeping troops in the region - left 28 people killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , displaced from their homes . before the final status of kosovo is decided , the security council will insist that the minorities in kosovo , and especially the serbs , receive full and comprehensive minority rights and that they are represented in the country 's institutions .
the practical implementation and safeguarding of these rights could become the core of a conditional independence under international observation . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , un call for unity in kosovo after rugova 's death eu foreign policy chief javier solana called on the leaders of kosovo to show " unity and responsibility " following the death saturday of the province 's president , ibrahim rugova .

9 , ernst zündel , a holocaust denier , faces a german court on charges of inciting racial hatred and defaming the dead .
the case shows that while germany guarantees freedom of expression , there are limits . according to prosecutors , ernst zündel is one of the " most active " holocaust deniers today .
he began distributing nazi and neo-nazi propaganda in the 1970s and has written several books praising adolf hitler and the nazi regime .
since 1995 , he has been associated with a web site that carries his name and is one of biggest online repositories of holocaust-denial propaganda . but zündel , who was born in germany 's black forest region , was only able to engage in such activities because he was living outside of his native county , in canada and the united states . although freedom of the press and of expression is written into german law , the country is generally more wary of free speech than the us , where zündel 's dissemination of racist literature and refutation of the holocaust - while distasteful to most - was perfectly legal . in germany , however , it was not .
zündel was deported to his native country in march 2005 after a long legal battle with the canadian government .

9 , ernst zündel , a holocaust denier , faces a german court on charges of inciting racial hatred and defaming the dead .
the case shows that while germany guarantees freedom of expression , there are limits . according to prosecutors , ernst zündel is one of the " most active " holocaust deniers today .
he began distributing nazi and neo-nazi propaganda in the 1970s and has written several books praising adolf hitler and the nazi regime .
since 1995 , he has been associated with a web site that carries his name and is one of biggest online repositories of holocaust-denial propaganda . but zündel , who was born in germany 's black forest region , was only able to engage in such activities because he was living outside of his native county , in canada and the united states . although freedom of the press and of expression is written into german law , the country is generally more wary of free speech than the us , where zündel 's dissemination of racist literature and refutation of the holocaust - while distasteful to most - was perfectly legal . in germany , however , it was not .
zündel was deported to his native country in march 2005 after a long legal battle with the canadian government .
he found himself immediately under arrest and up against the german justice system .
if the 66-year-old is found guilty by a court in mannheim of incitement to racial hatred , libel and defamation of the memory of the dead , he faces up to five years in prison . constitutional rights and constraints article 5 of germany 's constitution , or basic law , enshrines the right of freedom of speech and of the press . " everyone has the right to freely express and disseminate their opinions orally , in writing or visually and to obtain information from generally accessible sources without hindrance , " states paragraph one of the law .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's " basic law " but the next paragraph puts certain limits on that freedom , which were deemed necessary when the basic law was proclaimed in 1949 , just four years after the end of world war ii and the downfall of the nazi dictatorship . " these rights are subject to limitations embodied in the provisions of general legislation , statutory provisions for the protection of young persons and the citizen 's right to personal respect , " reads the second paragraph . german law therefore constrains press freedom , said udo branahl , a professor of media law at the university of dortmund . " the penal law code says holocaust denial is a punishable offense , " he said .
" that ban limits press freedom and overrides the right to free expression in the mass media . " germany is not the only european country to make holocaust denial a crime .
france , italy and austria have similar statutes on the books . criminal abroad , tried in germany so while in the us and canada , zündel could freely present his " evidence " that the gas chambers and crematoria of the third reich did not exist , in germany , he was committing a crime that he would be tried for , even though it was not committed on german soil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german courts have considered the severity of holocaust in weighing free speech against individual rights the country 's federal constitutional court confirmed in 1994 that holocaust revisionism is not protected speech . " in weighing the importance of free speech against that of individual rights , courts must consider on the one hand the severity of the offense caused by holocaust denial to the jewish population in light of the suffering inflicted upon it by germany , " the court wrote at the time .
" this court has consistently protected the personal honor of those defamed above the right of others to make patently false statements . " in the united states , where a broader definition of the freedom of expression has traditionally been considered one of the country 's most foundations , this limitation on expression is often met with disapproval . " i disapprove of what you say , but i will defend to the death your right to say it , " goes a citation from voltaire that 's often quoted . " i 've spoken with a lot of americans , and they do n't understand us , " said wolfgang wippermann , a professor at the freie university in berlin who studies nazism and right-wing extremism .

9 , ernst zündel , a holocaust denier , faces a german court on charges of inciting racial hatred and defaming the dead .
the case shows that while germany guarantees freedom of expression , there are limits . according to prosecutors , ernst zündel is one of the " most active " holocaust deniers today .
he began distributing nazi and neo-nazi propaganda in the 1970s and has written several books praising adolf hitler and the nazi regime .
since 1995 , he has been associated with a web site that carries his name and is one of biggest online repositories of holocaust-denial propaganda . but zündel , who was born in germany 's black forest region , was only able to engage in such activities because he was living outside of his native county , in canada and the united states . although freedom of the press and of expression is written into german law , the country is generally more wary of free speech than the us , where zündel 's dissemination of racist literature and refutation of the holocaust - while distasteful to most - was perfectly legal . in germany , however , it was not .
zündel was deported to his native country in march 2005 after a long legal battle with the canadian government .
he found himself immediately under arrest and up against the german justice system .
if the 66-year-old is found guilty by a court in mannheim of incitement to racial hatred , libel and defamation of the memory of the dead , he faces up to five years in prison . constitutional rights and constraints article 5 of germany 's constitution , or basic law , enshrines the right of freedom of speech and of the press . " everyone has the right to freely express and disseminate their opinions orally , in writing or visually and to obtain information from generally accessible sources without hindrance , " states paragraph one of the law .

" these rights are subject to limitations embodied in the provisions of general legislation , statutory provisions for the protection of young persons and the citizen 's right to personal respect , " reads the second paragraph . german law therefore constrains press freedom , said udo branahl , a professor of media law at the university of dortmund . " the penal law code says holocaust denial is a punishable offense , " he said .
" that ban limits press freedom and overrides the right to free expression in the mass media . " germany is not the only european country to make holocaust denial a crime .
france , italy and austria have similar statutes on the books . criminal abroad , tried in germany so while in the us and canada , zündel could freely present his " evidence " that the gas chambers and crematoria of the third reich did not exist , in germany , he was committing a crime that he would be tried for , even though it was not committed on german soil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german courts have considered the severity of holocaust in weighing free speech against individual rights the country 's federal constitutional court confirmed in 1994 that holocaust revisionism is not protected speech . " in weighing the importance of free speech against that of individual rights , courts must consider on the one hand the severity of the offense caused by holocaust denial to the jewish population in light of the suffering inflicted upon it by germany , " the court wrote at the time .
" this court has consistently protected the personal honor of those defamed above the right of others to make patently false statements . " in the united states , where a broader definition of the freedom of expression has traditionally been considered one of the country 's most foundations , this limitation on expression is often met with disapproval .

if the 66-year-old is found guilty by a court in mannheim of incitement to racial hatred , libel and defamation of the memory of the dead , he faces up to five years in prison . constitutional rights and constraints article 5 of germany 's constitution , or basic law , enshrines the right of freedom of speech and of the press . " everyone has the right to freely express and disseminate their opinions orally , in writing or visually and to obtain information from generally accessible sources without hindrance , " states paragraph one of the law .
" freedom of the press and freedom of reporting through audiovisual media shall be guaranteed .
there shall be no censorship . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's " basic law " but the next paragraph puts certain limits on that freedom , which were deemed necessary when the basic law was proclaimed in 1949 , just four years after the end of world war ii and the downfall of the nazi dictatorship . " these rights are subject to limitations embodied in the provisions of general legislation , statutory provisions for the protection of young persons and the citizen 's right to personal respect , " reads the second paragraph . german law therefore constrains press freedom , said udo branahl , a professor of media law at the university of dortmund . " the penal law code says holocaust denial is a punishable offense , " he said .
" that ban limits press freedom and overrides the right to free expression in the mass media . " germany is not the only european country to make holocaust denial a crime .
france , italy and austria have similar statutes on the books . criminal abroad , tried in germany so while in the us and canada , zündel could freely present his " evidence " that the gas chambers and crematoria of the third reich did not exist , in germany , he was committing a crime that he would be tried for , even though it was not committed on german soil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german courts have considered the severity of holocaust in weighing free speech against individual rights the country 's federal constitutional court confirmed in 1994 that holocaust revisionism is not protected speech . " in weighing the importance of free speech against that of individual rights , courts must consider on the one hand the severity of the offense caused by holocaust denial to the jewish population in light of the suffering inflicted upon it by germany , " the court wrote at the time .
" this court has consistently protected the personal honor of those defamed above the right of others to make patently false statements . " in the united states , where a broader definition of the freedom of expression has traditionally been considered one of the country 's most foundations , this limitation on expression is often met with disapproval . " i disapprove of what you say , but i will defend to the death your right to say it , " goes a citation from voltaire that 's often quoted . " i 've spoken with a lot of americans , and they do n't understand us , " said wolfgang wippermann , a professor at the freie university in berlin who studies nazism and right-wing extremism .
" i tell them , ' in your country , drug dealers also go to prison ; these holocaust deniers are like drug dealers , but dealing in mental poison ' .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.02.2006 germans look to talks amid drawn-out strike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bsirske led the civil servants into battle .
what will be the outcome ?
germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .
as high-level talks on monday failed to reach agreement , union leader frank bsirske settled in for a long haul . in all , it is the largest strike germany has seen in 14 years , with more than 30,000 civil servants - including trash collectors , kindergarten teachers , nurses and government officials - stopping work across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes among trash collectors has led to garbage hills like this one in lower saxony prior to a crucial high-level meeting between unions and public service representatives , key negotiators gave no clear signals that the talks would be fruitful .
state leaders have formed a united front in favor of increasing civil service work hours from 38.5 to 40 hours , while the union has said it is committed to preventing this .
at the head of services trade union ver.di is frank bsirske .
ver.di was created five years ago when five smaller unions joined forces , and bsirske 's gift has been the ability to unify his union 's various membership streams into a single , powerful organization .
at stake : a union 's reputation as the 54-year-old union organizer sees it , the current fight is about more than just jobs and money for its members .
it will decide whether germany 's approximately three million civil servants will have equal pay and working conditions on the local , state and federal level .
more importantly , the results of the strike show whether ver.di - one of the world 's largest trade unions - is capable of supporting its members in the face of opposition from public employers .
like virtually all german unions , ver.di has seen its membership rolls decline recently .
it is clear that the fight over the work week will be a decisive one for bsirske and the unions alike .
up to now , everything has gone well for the unions - the strike has enjoyed more than 50 percent approval among the public - but the honeymoon may not last .
if employers remain inflexible , goodwill may well begin to drop off .
' fight for prestige ' a loss for ver.di in this case could mean a reassessment of the value of unions in german society .
" ver.di is fighting for its prestige and its influence on the political stage , " berlin union researcher hans-peter müller told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di members took to the streets for bsirske , the battle will be a complex one ; the strikes are essentially defensive moves against the state and local governments , which are wrangling over details of wage agreements and work hours .
a defensive strike is unusual for germany 's civil servants , and it is a new experience for bsirske .
the last widespread work conflict , 14 years ago , saw some 400,000 workers hit the streets , and public services in the country suffered greatly .
as a result , when bsirske was coming up the union ranks , the mere threat of a strike was enough to bring parties to the table .
not afraid of conflict but bsirske does n't shy away from conflict .
as head of personnel for the city of hanover , he had to cut some 1,000 jobs . " as someone with three decades of union work , and who also had personnel responsibilities in a large organization , i not only learned how to communicate , but how to deal with conflict , " he said .
" but i think these abilities are expected in a union leader .
he needs to be able to find common solutions with employers , and when nothing else works , he has to be able to get into conflicts .
if the membership wants it . "
politics in the blood ?
bsirske studied political science , and even today he is a political person . the son of a volkswagen works council head , he joined the social democratic party at age 15 , and later represented the greens in hanover .
he is the only union leader who is a member of the greens . " i think a union that represents such a wide array of jobs and careers is well served by someone with a slightly unusual background , " he said . with so much riding on the outcome of the strikes , union members can only help bsirske is right . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german public sector strike expands germany 's public sector is facing large scale industrial action for the first time in more than a decade .

what will be the outcome ?
germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .
as high-level talks on monday failed to reach agreement , union leader frank bsirske settled in for a long haul . in all , it is the largest strike germany has seen in 14 years , with more than 30,000 civil servants - including trash collectors , kindergarten teachers , nurses and government officials - stopping work across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes among trash collectors has led to garbage hills like this one in lower saxony prior to a crucial high-level meeting between unions and public service representatives , key negotiators gave no clear signals that the talks would be fruitful .
state leaders have formed a united front in favor of increasing civil service work hours from 38.5 to 40 hours , while the union has said it is committed to preventing this .
at the head of services trade union ver.di is frank bsirske .
ver.di was created five years ago when five smaller unions joined forces , and bsirske 's gift has been the ability to unify his union 's various membership streams into a single , powerful organization .
at stake : a union 's reputation as the 54-year-old union organizer sees it , the current fight is about more than just jobs and money for its members .
it will decide whether germany 's approximately three million civil servants will have equal pay and working conditions on the local , state and federal level .
more importantly , the results of the strike show whether ver.di - one of the world 's largest trade unions - is capable of supporting its members in the face of opposition from public employers .
like virtually all german unions , ver.di has seen its membership rolls decline recently .
it is clear that the fight over the work week will be a decisive one for bsirske and the unions alike .
up to now , everything has gone well for the unions - the strike has enjoyed more than 50 percent approval among the public - but the honeymoon may not last .
if employers remain inflexible , goodwill may well begin to drop off .
' fight for prestige ' a loss for ver.di in this case could mean a reassessment of the value of unions in german society .
" ver.di is fighting for its prestige and its influence on the political stage , " berlin union researcher hans-peter müller told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di members took to the streets for bsirske , the battle will be a complex one ; the strikes are essentially defensive moves against the state and local governments , which are wrangling over details of wage agreements and work hours .
a defensive strike is unusual for germany 's civil servants , and it is a new experience for bsirske .
the last widespread work conflict , 14 years ago , saw some 400,000 workers hit the streets , and public services in the country suffered greatly .
as a result , when bsirske was coming up the union ranks , the mere threat of a strike was enough to bring parties to the table .
not afraid of conflict but bsirske does n't shy away from conflict .
as head of personnel for the city of hanover , he had to cut some 1,000 jobs . " as someone with three decades of union work , and who also had personnel responsibilities in a large organization , i not only learned how to communicate , but how to deal with conflict , " he said .
" but i think these abilities are expected in a union leader .
he needs to be able to find common solutions with employers , and when nothing else works , he has to be able to get into conflicts .
if the membership wants it . "
politics in the blood ?
bsirske studied political science , and even today he is a political person . the son of a volkswagen works council head , he joined the social democratic party at age 15 , and later represented the greens in hanover .
he is the only union leader who is a member of the greens . " i think a union that represents such a wide array of jobs and careers is well served by someone with a slightly unusual background , " he said . with so much riding on the outcome of the strikes , union members can only help bsirske is right . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german public sector strike expands germany 's public sector is facing large scale industrial action for the first time in more than a decade .

earlier , he had acknowledged that the auschwitz gas chambers had existed . during the one-day trial , irving had pleaded guilty to a charge from 1989 of denying the holocaust , which in austria is a crime , but said he no longer held that view . " i acknowledge my guilt on this charge , " he told judge peter liebetreu . irving said that he now realized his statement that " there were no gas chambers in auschwitz -lrb- was -rrb- false . " he had earlier told reporters upon entering the court in central vienna in handcuffs that it was " ridiculous for me to be standing here on trial for something i expressed 17 years ago . " i am not a holocaust denier , " he added .
" my views have changed .
history is a constantly growing tree . ...
the more documents are available , the more you learn , and i have learned a lot since 1989 . " asked about the holocaust , he said : " i would call it the jewish tragedy in world war ii " and that millions of jews had died . accurate research ? irving , whose handcuffs were removed as the trial began , insisted on the accuracy of his historical research as liebetreu bombarded him with questions about holocaust denials he had made in the past and what he thought now . the 67-year-old said he had changed his mind since 1989 after discovering documents , some of them from adolf eichmann who organized the nazi genocide of the jews , while on a trip to argentina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wreath lies on the tracks leading to the gas chamber and crematorium at auschwitz but irving insisted on the logic of some of his past statements , such as saying the fact 100,000 people survived auschwitz was a sign the gas chambers did not exist , even if he now regretted the formulation . under questioning from prosecutor michael klackl , irving denied that his statement about the gas chambers was tantamount to denying the holocaust . " that was no holocaust denial , that was only -lrb- a statement -rrb- about a part of the -lrb- holocaust -rrb- history , " irving said . klackl later told reporters : " we know about david irving , that he always tries to arrange every evidence and find many reasons why you should take his argument in the right way . " irvi n g faced up to 10 years i n priso n irving , 67 , faced up to 10 years in jail under an austrian law that prosecutes those who " deny the genocide by the national socialists or other national socialist crimes against humanity . " the right-wing historian was arrested in november after a routine check on a highway in austria . the warrant for his arrest was issued by a vienna court in 1989 after he allegedly denied at meetings in austria that the nazi regime used gas chambers in concentration camps . irving was on trial for also saying that the november 1938 kristallnacht pogrom against the jews was not the work of the nazis but " unknown " people who had dressed up as storm troopers , and that adolf hitler had in fact protected the jews . ba n n ed from livi n g i n germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irving now says the nazis systematically murdered jews irving has become notorious worldwide for attempting to establish , despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary , that hitler was not party to the holocaust , that there were no gas chambers in auschwitz , and that the number of jews killed by the nazis was greatly exaggerated . he has been condemned by the courts several times , notably in britain and germany , and last year he was refused entry to new zealand .
he is reportedly also banned from residing in australia , canada , italy and south africa as well as germany . irving sparked widespread outrage with his book " hitler 's war " in 1977 , in which he claimed the nazi dictator did not know about the mass killings of jews until 1943 and that he never ordered the holocaust .
he carried a copy of that book when he entered court monday . in 2000 , he lost a high-profile libel case in london against us historian deborah lipstadt after she called him a holocaust denier . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany condemns proposed iranian holocaust conference the iranian government 's announcement that it plans to hold a conference on the holocaust with notorious deniers as guests has caused outrage in germany .

meanwhile new cases of h5n1 infection in italy , france and india raise the threat of a global pandemic . deadly bird flu was detected for the first time on the german mainland , bringing the total number of cases in the country to 61 , animal health experts said sunday . the friedrich-löffler institute for animal health said two new cases of the h5n1 virus that can be fatal to humans were detected in a buzzard and a gull found dead in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-pomerania .
earlier sunday , 18 new cases of h5n1 were confirmed on the baltic island of rügen , also part of the state . german chancellor angela merkel on sunday surveyed measures taken to combat bird flu on rügen , as army disinfection experts deployed to curb the spread of the virus .
" the situation is serious , " she said after meeting with local crisis teams working to contain the outbreak . she said that if the situation worsened , " the federal government will be present with all the means at its disposal . " ministers rush to stem the wave of infection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture minister seehofer -lrb- left -rrb- and till backhaus face the press mecklenburg-pomerania 's agriculture minister , till backhaus , said the 18 new cases on rügen included swans , cormorants , geese and a buzzard .
he said the state would begin slaughtering domestic fowl including chickens and ducks sunday as a precaution to prevent a broader outbreak of the virus .
backhaus declined to say how many birds would be killed . meanwhile 19 bundeswehr army specialists were sent to rügen to disinfect vehicles and people who may have come in contact with the virus , a defense ministry spokesman said .
all vehicles and bicycles leaving the island had their tires decontaminated in special disinfectant baths .
pedestrians were told to have their shoes disinfected . the island is popular with tourists and has been inundated with reporters since the outbreak earlier this month , which experts said increased the risk of the virus being carried .
" the problem is that journalists get very close to the dead animals and also film the collection of cadavers , " the president of the friedrich löffler institute for animal health , thomas mettenleiter , said .
" then the camera teams go with their contaminated equipment and clothing directly where the birds are .
that is completely irresponsible and exactly what we have been trying to prevent . " germany has confirmed three cases of the highly pathogenic strain of the h5n1 virus and was awaiting confirmation of another 10 from a european union approved laboratory in england . emergency measures urged as lock-down takes hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is rushing to get enough tamiflu for 20 percent of the population health minister ulla schmidt called on germany 's 16 states to ensure that anti-viral medications such as tamiflu and relenza are available for 20 percent of the population . germany has begun enforcing an order to keep all poultry indoors , joining the netherlands , slovenia , denmark , france , greece , luxembourg and sweden in doing so . more infected birds were found in italy and france .
in india seven people were under observation with symptoms of the disease . in italy , the institute of animal health in the northeastern city of padua announced the virus had been detected in a total of 16 birds in the country . h5n1 was also confirmed in tuzla and navodari on the shores of the black sea in romania , bringing to 33 the number of sites where it has been found nationwide , a veterinary official said .
samples from the latest romanian cases were sent to the eu reference laboratory to establish whether it was the highly pathogenic form of the h5n1 virus . nearly 35,000 birds will be culled from monday morning in romania , a top official for the constanta region , danut culetu , told mediafax news agency france faces economic implications as bird flu arrives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 virsu was found in a dead wild duck prompting panic in france french authorities vowed to spare no effort in containing avian influenza after the country became the sixth in the european union , and the most westerly , to be hit by the virus . europe 's top producer and the world 's fourth-largest exporter of poultry , france confirmed that h5n1 had been identified in a wild duck found dead in the central-eastern ain region . french health minister xavier bertrand stressed that the dead duck was an isolated case , although food authorities said tests were continuing on some 15 birds found dead in various parts of the country . " there will be no financial or economic obstacle in preparing france in the face of these risks , " he said on europe 1 radio , as the country 's main farmers ' union called for more state help in tackling the threat . the plight of eu poultry producers , faced with plummeting sales , will be discussed by agriculture ministers monday .
sales are down by 70 percent in italy , 40 to 50 percent in greece and 15 percent in france . but in brussels officials held out little hope in the short term .
" we 're sympathetic but there is very little we , from the european budget , can actually do , " a european commission spokesman said . virus spreading through europe and beyond bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is putting up buffer zones but the virus knows no borders the other eu member states so far to have detected the h5n1 virus are austria , greece , and slovenia .
there have also been cases in bulgaria , croatia , ukraine and russia .
britain , too , said the risk of bird flu there was " more likely " following the french case . " it 's not inevitable , but it is clear , obviously , that it 's more likely than it was when it was further away , " agriculture minister ben bradshaw said . in india , seven people were under observation while up to half a million birds were being slaughtered sunday after the presence of h5n1 was confirmed .
but fears that the virus caused the death of a farmer in the western gujarat state proved unfounded . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german chancellor alarmed by bird flu chancellor angela merkel has expressed alarm over the rapid spread of bird fu on the baltic island of rügen .

what will be the outcome ?
germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .
as high-level talks on monday failed to reach agreement , union leader frank bsirske settled in for a long haul . in all , it is the largest strike germany has seen in 14 years , with more than 30,000 civil servants - including trash collectors , kindergarten teachers , nurses and government officials - stopping work across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes among trash collectors has led to garbage hills like this one in lower saxony prior to a crucial high-level meeting between unions and public service representatives , key negotiators gave no clear signals that the talks would be fruitful .
state leaders have formed a united front in favor of increasing civil service work hours from 38.5 to 40 hours , while the union has said it is committed to preventing this .
at the head of services trade union ver.di is frank bsirske .
ver.di was created five years ago when five smaller unions joined forces , and bsirske 's gift has been the ability to unify his union 's various membership streams into a single , powerful organization .
at stake : a union 's reputation as the 54-year-old union organizer sees it , the current fight is about more than just jobs and money for its members .
it will decide whether germany 's approximately three million civil servants will have equal pay and working conditions on the local , state and federal level .
more importantly , the results of the strike show whether ver.di - one of the world 's largest trade unions - is capable of supporting its members in the face of opposition from public employers .
like virtually all german unions , ver.di has seen its membership rolls decline recently .
it is clear that the fight over the work week will be a decisive one for bsirske and the unions alike .
up to now , everything has gone well for the unions - the strike has enjoyed more than 50 percent approval among the public - but the honeymoon may not last .
if employers remain inflexible , goodwill may well begin to drop off .
' fight for prestige ' a loss for ver.di in this case could mean a reassessment of the value of unions in german society .
" ver.di is fighting for its prestige and its influence on the political stage , " berlin union researcher hans-peter müller told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di members took to the streets for bsirske , the battle will be a complex one ; the strikes are essentially defensive moves against the state and local governments , which are wrangling over details of wage agreements and work hours .
a defensive strike is unusual for germany 's civil servants , and it is a new experience for bsirske .
the last widespread work conflict , 14 years ago , saw some 400,000 workers hit the streets , and public services in the country suffered greatly .
as a result , when bsirske was coming up the union ranks , the mere threat of a strike was enough to bring parties to the table .
not afraid of conflict but bsirske does n't shy away from conflict .
as head of personnel for the city of hanover , he had to cut some 1,000 jobs . " as someone with three decades of union work , and who also had personnel responsibilities in a large organization , i not only learned how to communicate , but how to deal with conflict , " he said .
" but i think these abilities are expected in a union leader .
he needs to be able to find common solutions with employers , and when nothing else works , he has to be able to get into conflicts .
if the membership wants it . "
politics in the blood ?
bsirske studied political science , and even today he is a political person . the son of a volkswagen works council head , he joined the social democratic party at age 15 , and later represented the greens in hanover .
he is the only union leader who is a member of the greens . " i think a union that represents such a wide array of jobs and careers is well served by someone with a slightly unusual background , " he said . with so much riding on the outcome of the strikes , union members can only help bsirske is right . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german public sector strike expands germany 's public sector is facing large scale industrial action for the first time in more than a decade .

earlier , he had acknowledged that the auschwitz gas chambers had existed . during the one-day trial , irving had pleaded guilty to a charge from 1989 of denying the holocaust , which in austria is a crime , but said he no longer held that view . " i acknowledge my guilt on this charge , " he told judge peter liebetreu . irving said that he now realized his statement that " there were no gas chambers in auschwitz -lrb- was -rrb- false . " he had earlier told reporters upon entering the court in central vienna in handcuffs that it was " ridiculous for me to be standing here on trial for something i expressed 17 years ago . " i am not a holocaust denier , " he added .

" asked about the holocaust , he said : " i would call it the jewish tragedy in world war ii " and that millions of jews had died . accurate research ? irving , whose handcuffs were removed as the trial began , insisted on the accuracy of his historical research as liebetreu bombarded him with questions about holocaust denials he had made in the past and what he thought now . the 67-year-old said he had changed his mind since 1989 after discovering documents , some of them from adolf eichmann who organized the nazi genocide of the jews , while on a trip to argentina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wreath lies on the tracks leading to the gas chamber and crematorium at auschwitz but irving insisted on the logic of some of his past statements , such as saying the fact 100,000 people survived auschwitz was a sign the gas chambers did not exist , even if he now regretted the formulation . under questioning from prosecutor michael klackl , irving denied that his statement about the gas chambers was tantamount to denying the holocaust . " that was no holocaust denial , that was only -lrb- a statement -rrb- about a part of the -lrb- holocaust -rrb- history , " irving said . klackl later told reporters : " we know about david irving , that he always tries to arrange every evidence and find many reasons why you should take his argument in the right way .

he is reportedly also banned from residing in australia , canada , italy and south africa as well as germany . irving sparked widespread outrage with his book " hitler 's war " in 1977 , in which he claimed the nazi dictator did not know about the mass killings of jews until 1943 and that he never ordered the holocaust .

what will be the outcome ?
germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .
as high-level talks on monday failed to reach agreement , union leader frank bsirske settled in for a long haul . in all , it is the largest strike germany has seen in 14 years , with more than 30,000 civil servants - including trash collectors , kindergarten teachers , nurses and government officials - stopping work across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes among trash collectors has led to garbage hills like this one in lower saxony prior to a crucial high-level meeting between unions and public service representatives , key negotiators gave no clear signals that the talks would be fruitful .
state leaders have formed a united front in favor of increasing civil service work hours from 38.5 to 40 hours , while the union has said it is committed to preventing this .
at the head of services trade union ver.di is frank bsirske .
ver.di was created five years ago when five smaller unions joined forces , and bsirske 's gift has been the ability to unify his union 's various membership streams into a single , powerful organization .
at stake : a union 's reputation as the 54-year-old union organizer sees it , the current fight is about more than just jobs and money for its members .
it will decide whether germany 's approximately three million civil servants will have equal pay and working conditions on the local , state and federal level .
more importantly , the results of the strike show whether ver.di - one of the world 's largest trade unions - is capable of supporting its members in the face of opposition from public employers .
like virtually all german unions , ver.di has seen its membership rolls decline recently .
it is clear that the fight over the work week will be a decisive one for bsirske and the unions alike .
up to now , everything has gone well for the unions - the strike has enjoyed more than 50 percent approval among the public - but the honeymoon may not last .
if employers remain inflexible , goodwill may well begin to drop off .
' fight for prestige ' a loss for ver.di in this case could mean a reassessment of the value of unions in german society .
" ver.di is fighting for its prestige and its influence on the political stage , " berlin union researcher hans-peter müller told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di members took to the streets for bsirske , the battle will be a complex one ; the strikes are essentially defensive moves against the state and local governments , which are wrangling over details of wage agreements and work hours .
a defensive strike is unusual for germany 's civil servants , and it is a new experience for bsirske .
the last widespread work conflict , 14 years ago , saw some 400,000 workers hit the streets , and public services in the country suffered greatly .
as a result , when bsirske was coming up the union ranks , the mere threat of a strike was enough to bring parties to the table .
not afraid of conflict but bsirske does n't shy away from conflict .
as head of personnel for the city of hanover , he had to cut some 1,000 jobs . " as someone with three decades of union work , and who also had personnel responsibilities in a large organization , i not only learned how to communicate , but how to deal with conflict , " he said .
" but i think these abilities are expected in a union leader .
he needs to be able to find common solutions with employers , and when nothing else works , he has to be able to get into conflicts .
if the membership wants it . "
politics in the blood ?
bsirske studied political science , and even today he is a political person . the son of a volkswagen works council head , he joined the social democratic party at age 15 , and later represented the greens in hanover .
he is the only union leader who is a member of the greens . " i think a union that represents such a wide array of jobs and careers is well served by someone with a slightly unusual background , " he said . with so much riding on the outcome of the strikes , union members can only help bsirske is right . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german public sector strike expands germany 's public sector is facing large scale industrial action for the first time in more than a decade .

earlier , he had acknowledged that the auschwitz gas chambers had existed . during the one-day trial , irving had pleaded guilty to a charge from 1989 of denying the holocaust , which in austria is a crime , but said he no longer held that view . " i acknowledge my guilt on this charge , " he told judge peter liebetreu . irving said that he now realized his statement that " there were no gas chambers in auschwitz -lrb- was -rrb- false . " he had earlier told reporters upon entering the court in central vienna in handcuffs that it was " ridiculous for me to be standing here on trial for something i expressed 17 years ago .

" that was no holocaust denial , that was only -lrb- a statement -rrb- about a part of the -lrb- holocaust -rrb- history , " irving said . klackl later told reporters : " we know about david irving , that he always tries to arrange every evidence and find many reasons why you should take his argument in the right way .

he is reportedly also banned from residing in australia , canada , italy and south africa as well as germany . irving sparked widespread outrage with his book " hitler 's war " in 1977 , in which he claimed the nazi dictator did not know about the mass killings of jews until 1943 and that he never ordered the holocaust .

the military jets are meanwhile aiding in the search from above . " the main goal is to stop the spread to domestic animals , " a government spokeswoman said . the h5n1 virus , which is potentially fatal to humans , was also for the first time detected on the mainland in the northeast state of mecklenburg-western pomerania .
two districts of the state declared a state of emergency , a measure which allows the army to be deployed there if required . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german military specialists have begun disinfecting vehicles agriculture minister horst seehofer said ahead of a meeting with his eu counterparts in brussels that the army had been called in because it was important to find and collect the dead birds as soon as possible . scavenging birds feeding on the carcasses of infected animals could spread the virus further , he added .
agriculture ministers from germany 's 16 regional states were to meet on thursday to coordinate efforts to prevent the virus from spreading . fre n ch prepare for more cases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dead duck found in france has tested positive for h5n1 elsewhere in europe , officials also scrambled to deal with the bird flu outbreak .

earlier , he had acknowledged that the auschwitz gas chambers had existed . during the one-day trial , irving had pleaded guilty to a charge from 1989 of denying the holocaust , which in austria is a crime , but said he no longer held that view . " i acknowledge my guilt on this charge , " he told judge peter liebetreu . irving said that he now realized his statement that " there were no gas chambers in auschwitz -lrb- was -rrb- false . " he had earlier told reporters upon entering the court in central vienna in handcuffs that it was " ridiculous for me to be standing here on trial for something i expressed 17 years ago . " i am not a holocaust denier , " he added .
" my views have changed .
history is a constantly growing tree . ...
the more documents are available , the more you learn , and i have learned a lot since 1989 . " asked about the holocaust , he said : " i would call it the jewish tragedy in world war ii " and that millions of jews had died . accurate research ? irving , whose handcuffs were removed as the trial began , insisted on the accuracy of his historical research as liebetreu bombarded him with questions about holocaust denials he had made in the past and what he thought now . the 67-year-old said he had changed his mind since 1989 after discovering documents , some of them from adolf eichmann who organized the nazi genocide of the jews , while on a trip to argentina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wreath lies on the tracks leading to the gas chamber and crematorium at auschwitz but irving insisted on the logic of some of his past statements , such as saying the fact 100,000 people survived auschwitz was a sign the gas chambers did not exist , even if he now regretted the formulation . under questioning from prosecutor michael klackl , irving denied that his statement about the gas chambers was tantamount to denying the holocaust . " that was no holocaust denial , that was only -lrb- a statement -rrb- about a part of the -lrb- holocaust -rrb- history , " irving said . klackl later told reporters : " we know about david irving , that he always tries to arrange every evidence and find many reasons why you should take his argument in the right way . " irvi n g faced up to 10 years i n priso n irving , 67 , faced up to 10 years in jail under an austrian law that prosecutes those who " deny the genocide by the national socialists or other national socialist crimes against humanity . " the right-wing historian was arrested in november after a routine check on a highway in austria . the warrant for his arrest was issued by a vienna court in 1989 after he allegedly denied at meetings in austria that the nazi regime used gas chambers in concentration camps . irving was on trial for also saying that the november 1938 kristallnacht pogrom against the jews was not the work of the nazis but " unknown " people who had dressed up as storm troopers , and that adolf hitler had in fact protected the jews . ba n n ed from livi n g i n germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irving now says the nazis systematically murdered jews irving has become notorious worldwide for attempting to establish , despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary , that hitler was not party to the holocaust , that there were no gas chambers in auschwitz , and that the number of jews killed by the nazis was greatly exaggerated . he has been condemned by the courts several times , notably in britain and germany , and last year he was refused entry to new zealand .
he is reportedly also banned from residing in australia , canada , italy and south africa as well as germany . irving sparked widespread outrage with his book " hitler 's war " in 1977 , in which he claimed the nazi dictator did not know about the mass killings of jews until 1943 and that he never ordered the holocaust .
he carried a copy of that book when he entered court monday . in 2000 , he lost a high-profile libel case in london against us historian deborah lipstadt after she called him a holocaust denier . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany condemns proposed iranian holocaust conference the iranian government 's announcement that it plans to hold a conference on the holocaust with notorious deniers as guests has caused outrage in germany .

in paris , a charity group linked to the far right is under fire for serving pork soup to the homeless .
critics say the government should ban the program as the choice of food discriminates against muslims and jews . every thursday night a handful of volunteers equipped with a trunk of hot food meet up in a poor district of paris to feed the needy .
they kick off with red wine served from a cask on the roof of a car , and an appetizer of dried sausage .
that is followed with bowls of steaming hot soup , traditionally known as a " repas gaulois " or gallic dinner , cheese and dessert . anne lucien-brun , a retiree , has been volunteering with the group , solidarity for the french -lrb- sdf -rrb- for the past year .
" i am here to serve soup to the homeless , to the people who are let down by our society , and to those who accept eating soup with pork in it , " she said .
although sdf has links to a fringe far-right political group , lucien-brun says that rather than being politically motivated , the work she does is about defending french traditions . " we are in france , in europe .
we cook with pork , we have soup with pork and we do n't see why our country should be banned from doing something that is our tradition , " lucien-brun said . calls for a ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pork belongs to the traditional french menu the government does n't actually prohibit pork dinners , but some city officials would like to see that happen .
paris city hall is managed by a coalition of socialists and greens who say the meals are discriminatory and xenophobic because they 're designed to exclude observant muslims who do n't eat pork . although the police say there 's no law against distributing soup to the homeless , they shut down weekly dinners twice in december on the grounds that they were creating a public disturbance .
the volunteers say such action amounts to police harassment and prevents them from providing a much-needed service to anyone who wants to take advantage of it . kalif kamaté , a homeless muslim from mali says he prefers not to eat pork , but that these days he ca n't afford to be choosy .
similar pork dinners have been organized in nice , nantes and strasbourg , where they were also banned for a time last month . using soup to spread a message ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beggars , they say , ca n't be choosers although they have since resumed , an anti-racism group is working to outlaw the initiative nationwide .
mouloud aounit is president of the " movement against racism and for friendship between people . "
he says the pork soup kitchens go against the very concept of solidarity . " these extremist groups are using the soup kitchen to spread their message of hate and contempt towards muslims .
we just ca n't accept this form of solidarity based on discrimination . " but the sdf volunteers insist that they do not discriminate , and that anyone can eat their soup .
kamaté confirms that to be true .
" at first i was told it was a private party .
then i asked the woman in charge and she allowed me to eat and drink with the others .
it really helped me out because i 'm homeless too and i face the same problems as the others . " safe environment one such other person is michel bewulf , a 37-year-old who has been living on the streets for two years , ever since he got divorced and lost his job .
he enjoys the thursday night four-course spread .
" i like to come here because it 's friendly .
it 's also very secure , " he said .
" people offer me jackets , trousers , socks , sometimes money and food . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standing in line for soup bewulf says other soup kitchens , where there are hundreds of people and not enough food , can be dangerous , and adds that some church groups proselytize while they serve .
by contrast , he says the volunteers at the gallic dinners do n't bring up their political ideas and few of those who show up for their weekly serving of pork soup seem to care about the controversy it has stirred .
ultimately they are just happy to be fed and to share a meal in a pleasant atmosphere , where they do n't have to fight for their food or be on their guard . helen seeney -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe chilled to the bone by arctic freeze sub-zero temperatures in europe claimed more victims and set energy consumption records wednesday as the killer chill spread its icy tendrils further across the continent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2006 modest beginning for kosovo talks expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to ethnic strife , kosovo is plagued by unemployment , corruption and poverty for the first time since the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian delegations will sit down together at the negotiating table .
the talks are bound to prove challenging for both sides . six and a half years after the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian representatives will meet for the first time in vienna on monday , feb .
20 , to discuss a key issue for both sides of the ethnic divide - decentralization and local self-government .
these talks are seen by many as a necessary prelude to the future talks on kosovo 's final status . " decentralization is a key question for kosovo , but especially for the minorities .
it will determine the competences of local self-government as well as the rights and responsibilities of the minorities , " said sören jessen-petersen , special representative of the un secretary general and head of the united nations mission in kosovo . " but one thing has to be clear : we 're talking about a decentralization , not partition of kosovo , " he said . international tug of war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un special envoy martti ahtisaari is aware of the difficulties that lie ahead the preparations for direct talks between serbian and kosovar delegations have been going on for months .
marti ahtisaari , the experienced finnish diplomat and un special envoy for the future status process for kosovo , is well aware that neither of the two parties has so far shown willingness to compromise . " this is a meeting , at which we 're starting from scratch by looking at the problems that need to be solved , " said ahtisaari . yet the position of the kosovo albanians , who are rooting for independence , is fundamentally incompatible with the position of the serbian government in belgrade , which insists that kosovo remains a part of serbia . " we insist on the formula : more than autonomy , less than independence , " said serbian foreign minister vuk draskovic . " that means two things : first of all , the protection of the serbian minority in kosovo and metohija and of the churches and monasteries in accordance with european standards .
and , secondly , preserving the current state border between serbia , albania and macedonia , " draskovic said . uncertain prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian foreign minister draskovic rejects the idea of a fully independent kosovo it is rather doubtful whether draskovic will be able to achieve his goal .
the legal position of the region is ambivalent .
in socialist yugoslavia , kosovo was - together with the northern province of vojvodina - an administrative exception . it was declared as an autonomous province of the republic of serbia , yet it had a special constitutional status within the federal state .
kosovo had the same institutions like the six federal republics of yugoslavia : a parliament of its own , a government with its own jurisdiction , as well as full representation in the central institutions of the federal state . serbian president slobodan milosevic abolished kosovo 's autonomy in 1989 and introduced a brutal police regime in the province , which consequently led to the break-up of yugoslavia .
slovenia and croatia declared independence under the pressure of milosevic 's violent repression in kosovo .
bosnia and herzegovina and macedonia followed the same path in 1991 . escalation of violence the kosovo parliament went underground after the province 's autonomy had been revoked .
by 1997 , the province was ruled in parallel by the serbian central government and the underground state dominated by ethnic albanians .
the kosovo albanians were led by ibrahim rugova , who hoped to lead the province to independence through non-violent resistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato cruise missiles and warplanes attacked yugoslavia on march 24 , 1999 but rugova was not able to control the escalation of violence .
his peaceful strategy failed in 1998 with the outbreak of an armed conflict between the growing kosovo liberation army -lrb- uck -rrb- and the serbian troops . with the experience of the horror that the wars in croatia and bosnia brought upon the balkans , nato forces intervened in march 1999 .
after three months of air strikes against serbia , milosevic was forced to sign the rambouillet accord and accept the presence of the nato peacekeeping troops in the region . the international community took account of kosovo 's complicated legal situation by pronouncing in the un-resolution 1244 that kosovo was a part of yugoslavia .
this resolution , which formed the basis of the rambouillet accord , however , did not make references to serbia . proponents of independence optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatmir sejdiu succeeded ibrahim rugova as kosovo 's president after the session of the un security council on feb .
14 , fatmir sejdiu , rugova 's successor as kosovo 's president , was optimistic that the international community would fulfil the wishes of the kosovar majority . " i welcome the engagement of all members of the security council . independence is a realistic option , which is also the will of the people of kosovo , " sejdiu said . these days , however , kosovo is not the only worry of the serbian government .
the union of serbia and montenegro , the last country to claim itself as a legal successor to yugoslavia , is on the verge of a break-up .
on feb .
25 , the montenegrin parliament will hold an extraordinary session about organizing a referendum on independence . if the parliament approves the referendum , it could take place as early as may 14 , in parallel to the elections in montenegro .
and if montenegro and serbia part their ways , it is hard to expect that the international community will force kosovo to be reunited with serbia . an impossible compromise ? the status of kosovo may therefore be decided by the international community against the wishes of belgrade .
it may additionally frustrate the serbian minority in kosovo , which grew increasingly concerned after the outbreak of ethnic violence in march 2004 , which - despite the presence of the international peacekeeping troops in the region - left 28 people killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , displaced from their homes . before the final status of kosovo is decided , the security council will insist that the minorities in kosovo , and especially the serbs , receive full and comprehensive minority rights and that they are represented in the country 's institutions .
the practical implementation and safeguarding of these rights could become the core of a conditional independence under international observation . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , un call for unity in kosovo after rugova 's death eu foreign policy chief javier solana called on the leaders of kosovo to show " unity and responsibility " following the death saturday of the province 's president , ibrahim rugova .

he began distributing nazi and neo-nazi propaganda in the 1970s and has written several books praising adolf hitler and the nazi regime .
since 1995 , he has been associated with a web site that carries his name and is one of biggest online repositories of holocaust-denial propaganda . but zündel , who was born in germany 's black forest region , was only able to engage in such activities because he was living outside of his native county , in canada and the united states . although freedom of the press and of expression is written into german law , the country is generally more wary of free speech than the us , where zündel 's dissemination of racist literature and refutation of the holocaust - while distasteful to most - was perfectly legal . in germany , however , it was not .

in paris , a charity group linked to the far right is under fire for serving pork soup to the homeless .
critics say the government should ban the program as the choice of food discriminates against muslims and jews . every thursday night a handful of volunteers equipped with a trunk of hot food meet up in a poor district of paris to feed the needy .
they kick off with red wine served from a cask on the roof of a car , and an appetizer of dried sausage .
that is followed with bowls of steaming hot soup , traditionally known as a " repas gaulois " or gallic dinner , cheese and dessert . anne lucien-brun , a retiree , has been volunteering with the group , solidarity for the french -lrb- sdf -rrb- for the past year .
" i am here to serve soup to the homeless , to the people who are let down by our society , and to those who accept eating soup with pork in it , " she said .
although sdf has links to a fringe far-right political group , lucien-brun says that rather than being politically motivated , the work she does is about defending french traditions . " we are in france , in europe .
we cook with pork , we have soup with pork and we do n't see why our country should be banned from doing something that is our tradition , " lucien-brun said . calls for a ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pork belongs to the traditional french menu the government does n't actually prohibit pork dinners , but some city officials would like to see that happen .
paris city hall is managed by a coalition of socialists and greens who say the meals are discriminatory and xenophobic because they 're designed to exclude observant muslims who do n't eat pork . although the police say there 's no law against distributing soup to the homeless , they shut down weekly dinners twice in december on the grounds that they were creating a public disturbance .
the volunteers say such action amounts to police harassment and prevents them from providing a much-needed service to anyone who wants to take advantage of it . kalif kamaté , a homeless muslim from mali says he prefers not to eat pork , but that these days he ca n't afford to be choosy .
similar pork dinners have been organized in nice , nantes and strasbourg , where they were also banned for a time last month . using soup to spread a message ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beggars , they say , ca n't be choosers although they have since resumed , an anti-racism group is working to outlaw the initiative nationwide .
mouloud aounit is president of the " movement against racism and for friendship between people . "
he says the pork soup kitchens go against the very concept of solidarity . " these extremist groups are using the soup kitchen to spread their message of hate and contempt towards muslims .
we just ca n't accept this form of solidarity based on discrimination . " but the sdf volunteers insist that they do not discriminate , and that anyone can eat their soup .
kamaté confirms that to be true .
" at first i was told it was a private party .
then i asked the woman in charge and she allowed me to eat and drink with the others .
it really helped me out because i 'm homeless too and i face the same problems as the others . " safe environment one such other person is michel bewulf , a 37-year-old who has been living on the streets for two years , ever since he got divorced and lost his job .
he enjoys the thursday night four-course spread .
" i like to come here because it 's friendly .
it 's also very secure , " he said .
" people offer me jackets , trousers , socks , sometimes money and food . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standing in line for soup bewulf says other soup kitchens , where there are hundreds of people and not enough food , can be dangerous , and adds that some church groups proselytize while they serve .
by contrast , he says the volunteers at the gallic dinners do n't bring up their political ideas and few of those who show up for their weekly serving of pork soup seem to care about the controversy it has stirred .
ultimately they are just happy to be fed and to share a meal in a pleasant atmosphere , where they do n't have to fight for their food or be on their guard . helen seeney -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe chilled to the bone by arctic freeze sub-zero temperatures in europe claimed more victims and set energy consumption records wednesday as the killer chill spread its icy tendrils further across the continent .

the talks are bound to prove challenging for both sides . six and a half years after the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian representatives will meet for the first time in vienna on monday , feb .
20 , to discuss a key issue for both sides of the ethnic divide - decentralization and local self-government .
these talks are seen by many as a necessary prelude to the future talks on kosovo 's final status . " decentralization is a key question for kosovo , but especially for the minorities .
it will determine the competences of local self-government as well as the rights and responsibilities of the minorities , " said sören jessen-petersen , special representative of the un secretary general and head of the united nations mission in kosovo . " but one thing has to be clear : we 're talking about a decentralization , not partition of kosovo , " he said . international tug of war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un special envoy martti ahtisaari is aware of the difficulties that lie ahead the preparations for direct talks between serbian and kosovar delegations have been going on for months .
marti ahtisaari , the experienced finnish diplomat and un special envoy for the future status process for kosovo , is well aware that neither of the two parties has so far shown willingness to compromise . " this is a meeting , at which we 're starting from scratch by looking at the problems that need to be solved , " said ahtisaari . yet the position of the kosovo albanians , who are rooting for independence , is fundamentally incompatible with the position of the serbian government in belgrade , which insists that kosovo remains a part of serbia . " we insist on the formula : more than autonomy , less than independence , " said serbian foreign minister vuk draskovic . " that means two things : first of all , the protection of the serbian minority in kosovo and metohija and of the churches and monasteries in accordance with european standards .
and , secondly , preserving the current state border between serbia , albania and macedonia , " draskovic said . uncertain prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian foreign minister draskovic rejects the idea of a fully independent kosovo it is rather doubtful whether draskovic will be able to achieve his goal .
the legal position of the region is ambivalent .
in socialist yugoslavia , kosovo was - together with the northern province of vojvodina - an administrative exception . it was declared as an autonomous province of the republic of serbia , yet it had a special constitutional status within the federal state .
kosovo had the same institutions like the six federal republics of yugoslavia : a parliament of its own , a government with its own jurisdiction , as well as full representation in the central institutions of the federal state . serbian president slobodan milosevic abolished kosovo 's autonomy in 1989 and introduced a brutal police regime in the province , which consequently led to the break-up of yugoslavia .
slovenia and croatia declared independence under the pressure of milosevic 's violent repression in kosovo .
bosnia and herzegovina and macedonia followed the same path in 1991 . escalation of violence the kosovo parliament went underground after the province 's autonomy had been revoked .
by 1997 , the province was ruled in parallel by the serbian central government and the underground state dominated by ethnic albanians .
the kosovo albanians were led by ibrahim rugova , who hoped to lead the province to independence through non-violent resistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato cruise missiles and warplanes attacked yugoslavia on march 24 , 1999 but rugova was not able to control the escalation of violence .
his peaceful strategy failed in 1998 with the outbreak of an armed conflict between the growing kosovo liberation army -lrb- uck -rrb- and the serbian troops . with the experience of the horror that the wars in croatia and bosnia brought upon the balkans , nato forces intervened in march 1999 .
after three months of air strikes against serbia , milosevic was forced to sign the rambouillet accord and accept the presence of the nato peacekeeping troops in the region . the international community took account of kosovo 's complicated legal situation by pronouncing in the un-resolution 1244 that kosovo was a part of yugoslavia .
this resolution , which formed the basis of the rambouillet accord , however , did not make references to serbia . proponents of independence optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatmir sejdiu succeeded ibrahim rugova as kosovo 's president after the session of the un security council on feb .
14 , fatmir sejdiu , rugova 's successor as kosovo 's president , was optimistic that the international community would fulfil the wishes of the kosovar majority . " i welcome the engagement of all members of the security council . independence is a realistic option , which is also the will of the people of kosovo , " sejdiu said . these days , however , kosovo is not the only worry of the serbian government .
the union of serbia and montenegro , the last country to claim itself as a legal successor to yugoslavia , is on the verge of a break-up .
on feb .
25 , the montenegrin parliament will hold an extraordinary session about organizing a referendum on independence . if the parliament approves the referendum , it could take place as early as may 14 , in parallel to the elections in montenegro .
and if montenegro and serbia part their ways , it is hard to expect that the international community will force kosovo to be reunited with serbia . an impossible compromise ? the status of kosovo may therefore be decided by the international community against the wishes of belgrade .
it may additionally frustrate the serbian minority in kosovo , which grew increasingly concerned after the outbreak of ethnic violence in march 2004 , which - despite the presence of the international peacekeeping troops in the region - left 28 people killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , displaced from their homes . before the final status of kosovo is decided , the security council will insist that the minorities in kosovo , and especially the serbs , receive full and comprehensive minority rights and that they are represented in the country 's institutions .

and if montenegro and serbia part their ways , it is hard to expect that the international community will force kosovo to be reunited with serbia . an impossible compromise ? the status of kosovo may therefore be decided by the international community against the wishes of belgrade .
it may additionally frustrate the serbian minority in kosovo , which grew increasingly concerned after the outbreak of ethnic violence in march 2004 , which - despite the presence of the international peacekeeping troops in the region - left 28 people killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , displaced from their homes . before the final status of kosovo is decided , the security council will insist that the minorities in kosovo , and especially the serbs , receive full and comprehensive minority rights and that they are represented in the country 's institutions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2006 modest beginning for kosovo talks expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to ethnic strife , kosovo is plagued by unemployment , corruption and poverty for the first time since the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian delegations will sit down together at the negotiating table .
the talks are bound to prove challenging for both sides . six and a half years after the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian representatives will meet for the first time in vienna on monday , feb .
20 , to discuss a key issue for both sides of the ethnic divide - decentralization and local self-government .
these talks are seen by many as a necessary prelude to the future talks on kosovo 's final status . " decentralization is a key question for kosovo , but especially for the minorities .
it will determine the competences of local self-government as well as the rights and responsibilities of the minorities , " said sören jessen-petersen , special representative of the un secretary general and head of the united nations mission in kosovo . " but one thing has to be clear : we 're talking about a decentralization , not partition of kosovo , " he said . international tug of war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un special envoy martti ahtisaari is aware of the difficulties that lie ahead the preparations for direct talks between serbian and kosovar delegations have been going on for months .
marti ahtisaari , the experienced finnish diplomat and un special envoy for the future status process for kosovo , is well aware that neither of the two parties has so far shown willingness to compromise . " this is a meeting , at which we 're starting from scratch by looking at the problems that need to be solved , " said ahtisaari . yet the position of the kosovo albanians , who are rooting for independence , is fundamentally incompatible with the position of the serbian government in belgrade , which insists that kosovo remains a part of serbia . " we insist on the formula : more than autonomy , less than independence , " said serbian foreign minister vuk draskovic . " that means two things : first of all , the protection of the serbian minority in kosovo and metohija and of the churches and monasteries in accordance with european standards .
and , secondly , preserving the current state border between serbia , albania and macedonia , " draskovic said . uncertain prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian foreign minister draskovic rejects the idea of a fully independent kosovo it is rather doubtful whether draskovic will be able to achieve his goal .
the legal position of the region is ambivalent .
in socialist yugoslavia , kosovo was - together with the northern province of vojvodina - an administrative exception . it was declared as an autonomous province of the republic of serbia , yet it had a special constitutional status within the federal state .
kosovo had the same institutions like the six federal republics of yugoslavia : a parliament of its own , a government with its own jurisdiction , as well as full representation in the central institutions of the federal state . serbian president slobodan milosevic abolished kosovo 's autonomy in 1989 and introduced a brutal police regime in the province , which consequently led to the break-up of yugoslavia .
slovenia and croatia declared independence under the pressure of milosevic 's violent repression in kosovo .
bosnia and herzegovina and macedonia followed the same path in 1991 . escalation of violence the kosovo parliament went underground after the province 's autonomy had been revoked .
by 1997 , the province was ruled in parallel by the serbian central government and the underground state dominated by ethnic albanians .
the kosovo albanians were led by ibrahim rugova , who hoped to lead the province to independence through non-violent resistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato cruise missiles and warplanes attacked yugoslavia on march 24 , 1999 but rugova was not able to control the escalation of violence .
his peaceful strategy failed in 1998 with the outbreak of an armed conflict between the growing kosovo liberation army -lrb- uck -rrb- and the serbian troops . with the experience of the horror that the wars in croatia and bosnia brought upon the balkans , nato forces intervened in march 1999 .
after three months of air strikes against serbia , milosevic was forced to sign the rambouillet accord and accept the presence of the nato peacekeeping troops in the region . the international community took account of kosovo 's complicated legal situation by pronouncing in the un-resolution 1244 that kosovo was a part of yugoslavia .
this resolution , which formed the basis of the rambouillet accord , however , did not make references to serbia . proponents of independence optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatmir sejdiu succeeded ibrahim rugova as kosovo 's president after the session of the un security council on feb .
14 , fatmir sejdiu , rugova 's successor as kosovo 's president , was optimistic that the international community would fulfil the wishes of the kosovar majority . " i welcome the engagement of all members of the security council . independence is a realistic option , which is also the will of the people of kosovo , " sejdiu said . these days , however , kosovo is not the only worry of the serbian government .

9 , ernst zündel , a holocaust denier , faces a german court on charges of inciting racial hatred and defaming the dead .
the case shows that while germany guarantees freedom of expression , there are limits . according to prosecutors , ernst zündel is one of the " most active " holocaust deniers today .
he began distributing nazi and neo-nazi propaganda in the 1970s and has written several books praising adolf hitler and the nazi regime .
since 1995 , he has been associated with a web site that carries his name and is one of biggest online repositories of holocaust-denial propaganda . but zündel , who was born in germany 's black forest region , was only able to engage in such activities because he was living outside of his native county , in canada and the united states . although freedom of the press and of expression is written into german law , the country is generally more wary of free speech than the us , where zündel 's dissemination of racist literature and refutation of the holocaust - while distasteful to most - was perfectly legal . in germany , however , it was not .
zündel was deported to his native country in march 2005 after a long legal battle with the canadian government .

in paris , a charity group linked to the far right is under fire for serving pork soup to the homeless .
critics say the government should ban the program as the choice of food discriminates against muslims and jews . every thursday night a handful of volunteers equipped with a trunk of hot food meet up in a poor district of paris to feed the needy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2006 modest beginning for kosovo talks expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to ethnic strife , kosovo is plagued by unemployment , corruption and poverty for the first time since the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian delegations will sit down together at the negotiating table .
the talks are bound to prove challenging for both sides . six and a half years after the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian representatives will meet for the first time in vienna on monday , feb .
20 , to discuss a key issue for both sides of the ethnic divide - decentralization and local self-government .
these talks are seen by many as a necessary prelude to the future talks on kosovo 's final status . " decentralization is a key question for kosovo , but especially for the minorities .
it will determine the competences of local self-government as well as the rights and responsibilities of the minorities , " said sören jessen-petersen , special representative of the un secretary general and head of the united nations mission in kosovo . " but one thing has to be clear : we 're talking about a decentralization , not partition of kosovo , " he said . international tug of war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un special envoy martti ahtisaari is aware of the difficulties that lie ahead the preparations for direct talks between serbian and kosovar delegations have been going on for months .
marti ahtisaari , the experienced finnish diplomat and un special envoy for the future status process for kosovo , is well aware that neither of the two parties has so far shown willingness to compromise . " this is a meeting , at which we 're starting from scratch by looking at the problems that need to be solved , " said ahtisaari . yet the position of the kosovo albanians , who are rooting for independence , is fundamentally incompatible with the position of the serbian government in belgrade , which insists that kosovo remains a part of serbia . " we insist on the formula : more than autonomy , less than independence , " said serbian foreign minister vuk draskovic . " that means two things : first of all , the protection of the serbian minority in kosovo and metohija and of the churches and monasteries in accordance with european standards .
and , secondly , preserving the current state border between serbia , albania and macedonia , " draskovic said . uncertain prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian foreign minister draskovic rejects the idea of a fully independent kosovo it is rather doubtful whether draskovic will be able to achieve his goal .
the legal position of the region is ambivalent .
in socialist yugoslavia , kosovo was - together with the northern province of vojvodina - an administrative exception . it was declared as an autonomous province of the republic of serbia , yet it had a special constitutional status within the federal state .
kosovo had the same institutions like the six federal republics of yugoslavia : a parliament of its own , a government with its own jurisdiction , as well as full representation in the central institutions of the federal state . serbian president slobodan milosevic abolished kosovo 's autonomy in 1989 and introduced a brutal police regime in the province , which consequently led to the break-up of yugoslavia .
slovenia and croatia declared independence under the pressure of milosevic 's violent repression in kosovo .
bosnia and herzegovina and macedonia followed the same path in 1991 . escalation of violence the kosovo parliament went underground after the province 's autonomy had been revoked .
by 1997 , the province was ruled in parallel by the serbian central government and the underground state dominated by ethnic albanians .
the kosovo albanians were led by ibrahim rugova , who hoped to lead the province to independence through non-violent resistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato cruise missiles and warplanes attacked yugoslavia on march 24 , 1999 but rugova was not able to control the escalation of violence .
his peaceful strategy failed in 1998 with the outbreak of an armed conflict between the growing kosovo liberation army -lrb- uck -rrb- and the serbian troops . with the experience of the horror that the wars in croatia and bosnia brought upon the balkans , nato forces intervened in march 1999 .
after three months of air strikes against serbia , milosevic was forced to sign the rambouillet accord and accept the presence of the nato peacekeeping troops in the region . the international community took account of kosovo 's complicated legal situation by pronouncing in the un-resolution 1244 that kosovo was a part of yugoslavia .
this resolution , which formed the basis of the rambouillet accord , however , did not make references to serbia . proponents of independence optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatmir sejdiu succeeded ibrahim rugova as kosovo 's president after the session of the un security council on feb .
14 , fatmir sejdiu , rugova 's successor as kosovo 's president , was optimistic that the international community would fulfil the wishes of the kosovar majority . " i welcome the engagement of all members of the security council . independence is a realistic option , which is also the will of the people of kosovo , " sejdiu said . these days , however , kosovo is not the only worry of the serbian government .
the union of serbia and montenegro , the last country to claim itself as a legal successor to yugoslavia , is on the verge of a break-up .
on feb .
25 , the montenegrin parliament will hold an extraordinary session about organizing a referendum on independence . if the parliament approves the referendum , it could take place as early as may 14 , in parallel to the elections in montenegro .
and if montenegro and serbia part their ways , it is hard to expect that the international community will force kosovo to be reunited with serbia . an impossible compromise ? the status of kosovo may therefore be decided by the international community against the wishes of belgrade .
it may additionally frustrate the serbian minority in kosovo , which grew increasingly concerned after the outbreak of ethnic violence in march 2004 , which - despite the presence of the international peacekeeping troops in the region - left 28 people killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , displaced from their homes . before the final status of kosovo is decided , the security council will insist that the minorities in kosovo , and especially the serbs , receive full and comprehensive minority rights and that they are represented in the country 's institutions .
the practical implementation and safeguarding of these rights could become the core of a conditional independence under international observation . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , un call for unity in kosovo after rugova 's death eu foreign policy chief javier solana called on the leaders of kosovo to show " unity and responsibility " following the death saturday of the province 's president , ibrahim rugova .

bosnia and herzegovina and macedonia followed the same path in 1991 . escalation of violence the kosovo parliament went underground after the province 's autonomy had been revoked .
by 1997 , the province was ruled in parallel by the serbian central government and the underground state dominated by ethnic albanians .

the talks are bound to prove challenging for both sides . six and a half years after the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian representatives will meet for the first time in vienna on monday , feb .
20 , to discuss a key issue for both sides of the ethnic divide - decentralization and local self-government .
these talks are seen by many as a necessary prelude to the future talks on kosovo 's final status . " decentralization is a key question for kosovo , but especially for the minorities .
it will determine the competences of local self-government as well as the rights and responsibilities of the minorities , " said sören jessen-petersen , special representative of the un secretary general and head of the united nations mission in kosovo . " but one thing has to be clear : we 're talking about a decentralization , not partition of kosovo , " he said . international tug of war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un special envoy martti ahtisaari is aware of the difficulties that lie ahead the preparations for direct talks between serbian and kosovar delegations have been going on for months .
marti ahtisaari , the experienced finnish diplomat and un special envoy for the future status process for kosovo , is well aware that neither of the two parties has so far shown willingness to compromise . " this is a meeting , at which we 're starting from scratch by looking at the problems that need to be solved , " said ahtisaari . yet the position of the kosovo albanians , who are rooting for independence , is fundamentally incompatible with the position of the serbian government in belgrade , which insists that kosovo remains a part of serbia . " we insist on the formula : more than autonomy , less than independence , " said serbian foreign minister vuk draskovic . " that means two things : first of all , the protection of the serbian minority in kosovo and metohija and of the churches and monasteries in accordance with european standards .
and , secondly , preserving the current state border between serbia , albania and macedonia , " draskovic said . uncertain prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian foreign minister draskovic rejects the idea of a fully independent kosovo it is rather doubtful whether draskovic will be able to achieve his goal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2006 modest beginning for kosovo talks expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to ethnic strife , kosovo is plagued by unemployment , corruption and poverty for the first time since the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian delegations will sit down together at the negotiating table .
the talks are bound to prove challenging for both sides . six and a half years after the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian representatives will meet for the first time in vienna on monday , feb .
20 , to discuss a key issue for both sides of the ethnic divide - decentralization and local self-government .
these talks are seen by many as a necessary prelude to the future talks on kosovo 's final status . " decentralization is a key question for kosovo , but especially for the minorities .
it will determine the competences of local self-government as well as the rights and responsibilities of the minorities , " said sören jessen-petersen , special representative of the un secretary general and head of the united nations mission in kosovo . " but one thing has to be clear : we 're talking about a decentralization , not partition of kosovo , " he said . international tug of war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un special envoy martti ahtisaari is aware of the difficulties that lie ahead the preparations for direct talks between serbian and kosovar delegations have been going on for months .
marti ahtisaari , the experienced finnish diplomat and un special envoy for the future status process for kosovo , is well aware that neither of the two parties has so far shown willingness to compromise . " this is a meeting , at which we 're starting from scratch by looking at the problems that need to be solved , " said ahtisaari . yet the position of the kosovo albanians , who are rooting for independence , is fundamentally incompatible with the position of the serbian government in belgrade , which insists that kosovo remains a part of serbia . " we insist on the formula : more than autonomy , less than independence , " said serbian foreign minister vuk draskovic . " that means two things : first of all , the protection of the serbian minority in kosovo and metohija and of the churches and monasteries in accordance with european standards .
and , secondly , preserving the current state border between serbia , albania and macedonia , " draskovic said . uncertain prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian foreign minister draskovic rejects the idea of a fully independent kosovo it is rather doubtful whether draskovic will be able to achieve his goal .
the legal position of the region is ambivalent .
in socialist yugoslavia , kosovo was - together with the northern province of vojvodina - an administrative exception . it was declared as an autonomous province of the republic of serbia , yet it had a special constitutional status within the federal state .
kosovo had the same institutions like the six federal republics of yugoslavia : a parliament of its own , a government with its own jurisdiction , as well as full representation in the central institutions of the federal state . serbian president slobodan milosevic abolished kosovo 's autonomy in 1989 and introduced a brutal police regime in the province , which consequently led to the break-up of yugoslavia .
slovenia and croatia declared independence under the pressure of milosevic 's violent repression in kosovo .
bosnia and herzegovina and macedonia followed the same path in 1991 . escalation of violence the kosovo parliament went underground after the province 's autonomy had been revoked .
by 1997 , the province was ruled in parallel by the serbian central government and the underground state dominated by ethnic albanians .
the kosovo albanians were led by ibrahim rugova , who hoped to lead the province to independence through non-violent resistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato cruise missiles and warplanes attacked yugoslavia on march 24 , 1999 but rugova was not able to control the escalation of violence .
his peaceful strategy failed in 1998 with the outbreak of an armed conflict between the growing kosovo liberation army -lrb- uck -rrb- and the serbian troops . with the experience of the horror that the wars in croatia and bosnia brought upon the balkans , nato forces intervened in march 1999 .
after three months of air strikes against serbia , milosevic was forced to sign the rambouillet accord and accept the presence of the nato peacekeeping troops in the region . the international community took account of kosovo 's complicated legal situation by pronouncing in the un-resolution 1244 that kosovo was a part of yugoslavia .
this resolution , which formed the basis of the rambouillet accord , however , did not make references to serbia . proponents of independence optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatmir sejdiu succeeded ibrahim rugova as kosovo 's president after the session of the un security council on feb .
14 , fatmir sejdiu , rugova 's successor as kosovo 's president , was optimistic that the international community would fulfil the wishes of the kosovar majority . " i welcome the engagement of all members of the security council . independence is a realistic option , which is also the will of the people of kosovo , " sejdiu said . these days , however , kosovo is not the only worry of the serbian government .
the union of serbia and montenegro , the last country to claim itself as a legal successor to yugoslavia , is on the verge of a break-up .
on feb .
25 , the montenegrin parliament will hold an extraordinary session about organizing a referendum on independence . if the parliament approves the referendum , it could take place as early as may 14 , in parallel to the elections in montenegro .
and if montenegro and serbia part their ways , it is hard to expect that the international community will force kosovo to be reunited with serbia . an impossible compromise ? the status of kosovo may therefore be decided by the international community against the wishes of belgrade .
it may additionally frustrate the serbian minority in kosovo , which grew increasingly concerned after the outbreak of ethnic violence in march 2004 , which - despite the presence of the international peacekeeping troops in the region - left 28 people killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , displaced from their homes . before the final status of kosovo is decided , the security council will insist that the minorities in kosovo , and especially the serbs , receive full and comprehensive minority rights and that they are represented in the country 's institutions .
the practical implementation and safeguarding of these rights could become the core of a conditional independence under international observation . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , un call for unity in kosovo after rugova 's death eu foreign policy chief javier solana called on the leaders of kosovo to show " unity and responsibility " following the death saturday of the province 's president , ibrahim rugova .

in paris , a charity group linked to the far right is under fire for serving pork soup to the homeless .
critics say the government should ban the program as the choice of food discriminates against muslims and jews . every thursday night a handful of volunteers equipped with a trunk of hot food meet up in a poor district of paris to feed the needy .
they kick off with red wine served from a cask on the roof of a car , and an appetizer of dried sausage .
that is followed with bowls of steaming hot soup , traditionally known as a " repas gaulois " or gallic dinner , cheese and dessert . anne lucien-brun , a retiree , has been volunteering with the group , solidarity for the french -lrb- sdf -rrb- for the past year .
" i am here to serve soup to the homeless , to the people who are let down by our society , and to those who accept eating soup with pork in it , " she said .
although sdf has links to a fringe far-right political group , lucien-brun says that rather than being politically motivated , the work she does is about defending french traditions . " we are in france , in europe .

paris city hall is managed by a coalition of socialists and greens who say the meals are discriminatory and xenophobic because they 're designed to exclude observant muslims who do n't eat pork . although the police say there 's no law against distributing soup to the homeless , they shut down weekly dinners twice in december on the grounds that they were creating a public disturbance .
the volunteers say such action amounts to police harassment and prevents them from providing a much-needed service to anyone who wants to take advantage of it . kalif kamaté , a homeless muslim from mali says he prefers not to eat pork , but that these days he ca n't afford to be choosy .

kamaté confirms that to be true .

in paris , a charity group linked to the far right is under fire for serving pork soup to the homeless .
critics say the government should ban the program as the choice of food discriminates against muslims and jews . every thursday night a handful of volunteers equipped with a trunk of hot food meet up in a poor district of paris to feed the needy .
they kick off with red wine served from a cask on the roof of a car , and an appetizer of dried sausage .
that is followed with bowls of steaming hot soup , traditionally known as a " repas gaulois " or gallic dinner , cheese and dessert . anne lucien-brun , a retiree , has been volunteering with the group , solidarity for the french -lrb- sdf -rrb- for the past year .
" i am here to serve soup to the homeless , to the people who are let down by our society , and to those who accept eating soup with pork in it , " she said .
although sdf has links to a fringe far-right political group , lucien-brun says that rather than being politically motivated , the work she does is about defending french traditions . " we are in france , in europe .

the volunteers say such action amounts to police harassment and prevents them from providing a much-needed service to anyone who wants to take advantage of it . kalif kamaté , a homeless muslim from mali says he prefers not to eat pork , but that these days he ca n't afford to be choosy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2006 modest beginning for kosovo talks expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to ethnic strife , kosovo is plagued by unemployment , corruption and poverty for the first time since the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian delegations will sit down together at the negotiating table .
the talks are bound to prove challenging for both sides . six and a half years after the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian representatives will meet for the first time in vienna on monday , feb .
20 , to discuss a key issue for both sides of the ethnic divide - decentralization and local self-government .
these talks are seen by many as a necessary prelude to the future talks on kosovo 's final status . " decentralization is a key question for kosovo , but especially for the minorities .
it will determine the competences of local self-government as well as the rights and responsibilities of the minorities , " said sören jessen-petersen , special representative of the un secretary general and head of the united nations mission in kosovo . " but one thing has to be clear : we 're talking about a decentralization , not partition of kosovo , " he said . international tug of war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un special envoy martti ahtisaari is aware of the difficulties that lie ahead the preparations for direct talks between serbian and kosovar delegations have been going on for months .
marti ahtisaari , the experienced finnish diplomat and un special envoy for the future status process for kosovo , is well aware that neither of the two parties has so far shown willingness to compromise . " this is a meeting , at which we 're starting from scratch by looking at the problems that need to be solved , " said ahtisaari . yet the position of the kosovo albanians , who are rooting for independence , is fundamentally incompatible with the position of the serbian government in belgrade , which insists that kosovo remains a part of serbia . " we insist on the formula : more than autonomy , less than independence , " said serbian foreign minister vuk draskovic . " that means two things : first of all , the protection of the serbian minority in kosovo and metohija and of the churches and monasteries in accordance with european standards .
and , secondly , preserving the current state border between serbia , albania and macedonia , " draskovic said . uncertain prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian foreign minister draskovic rejects the idea of a fully independent kosovo it is rather doubtful whether draskovic will be able to achieve his goal .
the legal position of the region is ambivalent .
in socialist yugoslavia , kosovo was - together with the northern province of vojvodina - an administrative exception . it was declared as an autonomous province of the republic of serbia , yet it had a special constitutional status within the federal state .
kosovo had the same institutions like the six federal republics of yugoslavia : a parliament of its own , a government with its own jurisdiction , as well as full representation in the central institutions of the federal state . serbian president slobodan milosevic abolished kosovo 's autonomy in 1989 and introduced a brutal police regime in the province , which consequently led to the break-up of yugoslavia .
slovenia and croatia declared independence under the pressure of milosevic 's violent repression in kosovo .
bosnia and herzegovina and macedonia followed the same path in 1991 . escalation of violence the kosovo parliament went underground after the province 's autonomy had been revoked .
by 1997 , the province was ruled in parallel by the serbian central government and the underground state dominated by ethnic albanians .
the kosovo albanians were led by ibrahim rugova , who hoped to lead the province to independence through non-violent resistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato cruise missiles and warplanes attacked yugoslavia on march 24 , 1999 but rugova was not able to control the escalation of violence .
his peaceful strategy failed in 1998 with the outbreak of an armed conflict between the growing kosovo liberation army -lrb- uck -rrb- and the serbian troops . with the experience of the horror that the wars in croatia and bosnia brought upon the balkans , nato forces intervened in march 1999 .
after three months of air strikes against serbia , milosevic was forced to sign the rambouillet accord and accept the presence of the nato peacekeeping troops in the region . the international community took account of kosovo 's complicated legal situation by pronouncing in the un-resolution 1244 that kosovo was a part of yugoslavia .
this resolution , which formed the basis of the rambouillet accord , however , did not make references to serbia . proponents of independence optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatmir sejdiu succeeded ibrahim rugova as kosovo 's president after the session of the un security council on feb .
14 , fatmir sejdiu , rugova 's successor as kosovo 's president , was optimistic that the international community would fulfil the wishes of the kosovar majority . " i welcome the engagement of all members of the security council . independence is a realistic option , which is also the will of the people of kosovo , " sejdiu said . these days , however , kosovo is not the only worry of the serbian government .
the union of serbia and montenegro , the last country to claim itself as a legal successor to yugoslavia , is on the verge of a break-up .
on feb .
25 , the montenegrin parliament will hold an extraordinary session about organizing a referendum on independence . if the parliament approves the referendum , it could take place as early as may 14 , in parallel to the elections in montenegro .
and if montenegro and serbia part their ways , it is hard to expect that the international community will force kosovo to be reunited with serbia . an impossible compromise ? the status of kosovo may therefore be decided by the international community against the wishes of belgrade .
it may additionally frustrate the serbian minority in kosovo , which grew increasingly concerned after the outbreak of ethnic violence in march 2004 , which - despite the presence of the international peacekeeping troops in the region - left 28 people killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , displaced from their homes . before the final status of kosovo is decided , the security council will insist that the minorities in kosovo , and especially the serbs , receive full and comprehensive minority rights and that they are represented in the country 's institutions .
the practical implementation and safeguarding of these rights could become the core of a conditional independence under international observation . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , un call for unity in kosovo after rugova 's death eu foreign policy chief javier solana called on the leaders of kosovo to show " unity and responsibility " following the death saturday of the province 's president , ibrahim rugova .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.02.2006 germans look to talks amid drawn-out strike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bsirske led the civil servants into battle .
what will be the outcome ?
germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .
as high-level talks on monday failed to reach agreement , union leader frank bsirske settled in for a long haul . in all , it is the largest strike germany has seen in 14 years , with more than 30,000 civil servants - including trash collectors , kindergarten teachers , nurses and government officials - stopping work across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes among trash collectors has led to garbage hills like this one in lower saxony prior to a crucial high-level meeting between unions and public service representatives , key negotiators gave no clear signals that the talks would be fruitful .
state leaders have formed a united front in favor of increasing civil service work hours from 38.5 to 40 hours , while the union has said it is committed to preventing this .
at the head of services trade union ver.di is frank bsirske .
ver.di was created five years ago when five smaller unions joined forces , and bsirske 's gift has been the ability to unify his union 's various membership streams into a single , powerful organization .
at stake : a union 's reputation as the 54-year-old union organizer sees it , the current fight is about more than just jobs and money for its members .
it will decide whether germany 's approximately three million civil servants will have equal pay and working conditions on the local , state and federal level .
more importantly , the results of the strike show whether ver.di - one of the world 's largest trade unions - is capable of supporting its members in the face of opposition from public employers .
like virtually all german unions , ver.di has seen its membership rolls decline recently .
it is clear that the fight over the work week will be a decisive one for bsirske and the unions alike .
up to now , everything has gone well for the unions - the strike has enjoyed more than 50 percent approval among the public - but the honeymoon may not last .
if employers remain inflexible , goodwill may well begin to drop off .
' fight for prestige ' a loss for ver.di in this case could mean a reassessment of the value of unions in german society .
" ver.di is fighting for its prestige and its influence on the political stage , " berlin union researcher hans-peter müller told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di members took to the streets for bsirske , the battle will be a complex one ; the strikes are essentially defensive moves against the state and local governments , which are wrangling over details of wage agreements and work hours .
a defensive strike is unusual for germany 's civil servants , and it is a new experience for bsirske .
the last widespread work conflict , 14 years ago , saw some 400,000 workers hit the streets , and public services in the country suffered greatly .
as a result , when bsirske was coming up the union ranks , the mere threat of a strike was enough to bring parties to the table .
not afraid of conflict but bsirske does n't shy away from conflict .
as head of personnel for the city of hanover , he had to cut some 1,000 jobs . " as someone with three decades of union work , and who also had personnel responsibilities in a large organization , i not only learned how to communicate , but how to deal with conflict , " he said .
" but i think these abilities are expected in a union leader .
he needs to be able to find common solutions with employers , and when nothing else works , he has to be able to get into conflicts .
if the membership wants it . "
politics in the blood ?
bsirske studied political science , and even today he is a political person . the son of a volkswagen works council head , he joined the social democratic party at age 15 , and later represented the greens in hanover .
he is the only union leader who is a member of the greens . " i think a union that represents such a wide array of jobs and careers is well served by someone with a slightly unusual background , " he said . with so much riding on the outcome of the strikes , union members can only help bsirske is right . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german public sector strike expands germany 's public sector is facing large scale industrial action for the first time in more than a decade .

what will be the outcome ?
germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .
as high-level talks on monday failed to reach agreement , union leader frank bsirske settled in for a long haul . in all , it is the largest strike germany has seen in 14 years , with more than 30,000 civil servants - including trash collectors , kindergarten teachers , nurses and government officials - stopping work across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes among trash collectors has led to garbage hills like this one in lower saxony prior to a crucial high-level meeting between unions and public service representatives , key negotiators gave no clear signals that the talks would be fruitful .
state leaders have formed a united front in favor of increasing civil service work hours from 38.5 to 40 hours , while the union has said it is committed to preventing this .
at the head of services trade union ver.di is frank bsirske .
ver.di was created five years ago when five smaller unions joined forces , and bsirske 's gift has been the ability to unify his union 's various membership streams into a single , powerful organization .
at stake : a union 's reputation as the 54-year-old union organizer sees it , the current fight is about more than just jobs and money for its members .
it will decide whether germany 's approximately three million civil servants will have equal pay and working conditions on the local , state and federal level .
more importantly , the results of the strike show whether ver.di - one of the world 's largest trade unions - is capable of supporting its members in the face of opposition from public employers .
like virtually all german unions , ver.di has seen its membership rolls decline recently .
it is clear that the fight over the work week will be a decisive one for bsirske and the unions alike .
up to now , everything has gone well for the unions - the strike has enjoyed more than 50 percent approval among the public - but the honeymoon may not last .
if employers remain inflexible , goodwill may well begin to drop off .
' fight for prestige ' a loss for ver.di in this case could mean a reassessment of the value of unions in german society .
" ver.di is fighting for its prestige and its influence on the political stage , " berlin union researcher hans-peter müller told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di members took to the streets for bsirske , the battle will be a complex one ; the strikes are essentially defensive moves against the state and local governments , which are wrangling over details of wage agreements and work hours .
a defensive strike is unusual for germany 's civil servants , and it is a new experience for bsirske .

what will be the outcome ?
germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .
as high-level talks on monday failed to reach agreement , union leader frank bsirske settled in for a long haul . in all , it is the largest strike germany has seen in 14 years , with more than 30,000 civil servants - including trash collectors , kindergarten teachers , nurses and government officials - stopping work across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes among trash collectors has led to garbage hills like this one in lower saxony prior to a crucial high-level meeting between unions and public service representatives , key negotiators gave no clear signals that the talks would be fruitful .
state leaders have formed a united front in favor of increasing civil service work hours from 38.5 to 40 hours , while the union has said it is committed to preventing this .
at the head of services trade union ver.di is frank bsirske .
ver.di was created five years ago when five smaller unions joined forces , and bsirske 's gift has been the ability to unify his union 's various membership streams into a single , powerful organization .
at stake : a union 's reputation as the 54-year-old union organizer sees it , the current fight is about more than just jobs and money for its members .
it will decide whether germany 's approximately three million civil servants will have equal pay and working conditions on the local , state and federal level .
more importantly , the results of the strike show whether ver.di - one of the world 's largest trade unions - is capable of supporting its members in the face of opposition from public employers .
like virtually all german unions , ver.di has seen its membership rolls decline recently .
it is clear that the fight over the work week will be a decisive one for bsirske and the unions alike .
up to now , everything has gone well for the unions - the strike has enjoyed more than 50 percent approval among the public - but the honeymoon may not last .
if employers remain inflexible , goodwill may well begin to drop off .
' fight for prestige ' a loss for ver.di in this case could mean a reassessment of the value of unions in german society .
" ver.di is fighting for its prestige and its influence on the political stage , " berlin union researcher hans-peter müller told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di members took to the streets for bsirske , the battle will be a complex one ; the strikes are essentially defensive moves against the state and local governments , which are wrangling over details of wage agreements and work hours .
a defensive strike is unusual for germany 's civil servants , and it is a new experience for bsirske .
the last widespread work conflict , 14 years ago , saw some 400,000 workers hit the streets , and public services in the country suffered greatly .
as a result , when bsirske was coming up the union ranks , the mere threat of a strike was enough to bring parties to the table .
not afraid of conflict but bsirske does n't shy away from conflict .
as head of personnel for the city of hanover , he had to cut some 1,000 jobs . " as someone with three decades of union work , and who also had personnel responsibilities in a large organization , i not only learned how to communicate , but how to deal with conflict , " he said .
" but i think these abilities are expected in a union leader .
he needs to be able to find common solutions with employers , and when nothing else works , he has to be able to get into conflicts .
if the membership wants it . "
politics in the blood ?
bsirske studied political science , and even today he is a political person . the son of a volkswagen works council head , he joined the social democratic party at age 15 , and later represented the greens in hanover .
he is the only union leader who is a member of the greens . " i think a union that represents such a wide array of jobs and careers is well served by someone with a slightly unusual background , " he said . with so much riding on the outcome of the strikes , union members can only help bsirske is right . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german public sector strike expands germany 's public sector is facing large scale industrial action for the first time in more than a decade .

meanwhile new cases of h5n1 infection in italy , france and india raise the threat of a global pandemic . deadly bird flu was detected for the first time on the german mainland , bringing the total number of cases in the country to 61 , animal health experts said sunday . the friedrich-löffler institute for animal health said two new cases of the h5n1 virus that can be fatal to humans were detected in a buzzard and a gull found dead in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-pomerania .
earlier sunday , 18 new cases of h5n1 were confirmed on the baltic island of rügen , also part of the state . german chancellor angela merkel on sunday surveyed measures taken to combat bird flu on rügen , as army disinfection experts deployed to curb the spread of the virus .
" the situation is serious , " she said after meeting with local crisis teams working to contain the outbreak . she said that if the situation worsened , " the federal government will be present with all the means at its disposal . " ministers rush to stem the wave of infection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture minister seehofer -lrb- left -rrb- and till backhaus face the press mecklenburg-pomerania 's agriculture minister , till backhaus , said the 18 new cases on rügen included swans , cormorants , geese and a buzzard .
he said the state would begin slaughtering domestic fowl including chickens and ducks sunday as a precaution to prevent a broader outbreak of the virus .
backhaus declined to say how many birds would be killed . meanwhile 19 bundeswehr army specialists were sent to rügen to disinfect vehicles and people who may have come in contact with the virus , a defense ministry spokesman said .
all vehicles and bicycles leaving the island had their tires decontaminated in special disinfectant baths .
pedestrians were told to have their shoes disinfected . the island is popular with tourists and has been inundated with reporters since the outbreak earlier this month , which experts said increased the risk of the virus being carried .
" the problem is that journalists get very close to the dead animals and also film the collection of cadavers , " the president of the friedrich löffler institute for animal health , thomas mettenleiter , said .
" then the camera teams go with their contaminated equipment and clothing directly where the birds are .
that is completely irresponsible and exactly what we have been trying to prevent . " germany has confirmed three cases of the highly pathogenic strain of the h5n1 virus and was awaiting confirmation of another 10 from a european union approved laboratory in england . emergency measures urged as lock-down takes hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is rushing to get enough tamiflu for 20 percent of the population health minister ulla schmidt called on germany 's 16 states to ensure that anti-viral medications such as tamiflu and relenza are available for 20 percent of the population . germany has begun enforcing an order to keep all poultry indoors , joining the netherlands , slovenia , denmark , france , greece , luxembourg and sweden in doing so . more infected birds were found in italy and france .
in india seven people were under observation with symptoms of the disease . in italy , the institute of animal health in the northeastern city of padua announced the virus had been detected in a total of 16 birds in the country . h5n1 was also confirmed in tuzla and navodari on the shores of the black sea in romania , bringing to 33 the number of sites where it has been found nationwide , a veterinary official said .
samples from the latest romanian cases were sent to the eu reference laboratory to establish whether it was the highly pathogenic form of the h5n1 virus . nearly 35,000 birds will be culled from monday morning in romania , a top official for the constanta region , danut culetu , told mediafax news agency france faces economic implications as bird flu arrives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 virsu was found in a dead wild duck prompting panic in france french authorities vowed to spare no effort in containing avian influenza after the country became the sixth in the european union , and the most westerly , to be hit by the virus . europe 's top producer and the world 's fourth-largest exporter of poultry , france confirmed that h5n1 had been identified in a wild duck found dead in the central-eastern ain region . french health minister xavier bertrand stressed that the dead duck was an isolated case , although food authorities said tests were continuing on some 15 birds found dead in various parts of the country . " there will be no financial or economic obstacle in preparing france in the face of these risks , " he said on europe 1 radio , as the country 's main farmers ' union called for more state help in tackling the threat . the plight of eu poultry producers , faced with plummeting sales , will be discussed by agriculture ministers monday .
sales are down by 70 percent in italy , 40 to 50 percent in greece and 15 percent in france . but in brussels officials held out little hope in the short term .
" we 're sympathetic but there is very little we , from the european budget , can actually do , " a european commission spokesman said . virus spreading through europe and beyond bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is putting up buffer zones but the virus knows no borders the other eu member states so far to have detected the h5n1 virus are austria , greece , and slovenia .
there have also been cases in bulgaria , croatia , ukraine and russia .
britain , too , said the risk of bird flu there was " more likely " following the french case . " it 's not inevitable , but it is clear , obviously , that it 's more likely than it was when it was further away , " agriculture minister ben bradshaw said . in india , seven people were under observation while up to half a million birds were being slaughtered sunday after the presence of h5n1 was confirmed .
but fears that the virus caused the death of a farmer in the western gujarat state proved unfounded . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german chancellor alarmed by bird flu chancellor angela merkel has expressed alarm over the rapid spread of bird fu on the baltic island of rügen .

earlier , he had acknowledged that the auschwitz gas chambers had existed . during the one-day trial , irving had pleaded guilty to a charge from 1989 of denying the holocaust , which in austria is a crime , but said he no longer held that view . " i acknowledge my guilt on this charge , " he told judge peter liebetreu . irving said that he now realized his statement that " there were no gas chambers in auschwitz -lrb- was -rrb- false . " he had earlier told reporters upon entering the court in central vienna in handcuffs that it was " ridiculous for me to be standing here on trial for something i expressed 17 years ago . " i am not a holocaust denier , " he added .
" my views have changed .

" asked about the holocaust , he said : " i would call it the jewish tragedy in world war ii " and that millions of jews had died . accurate research ? irving , whose handcuffs were removed as the trial began , insisted on the accuracy of his historical research as liebetreu bombarded him with questions about holocaust denials he had made in the past and what he thought now . the 67-year-old said he had changed his mind since 1989 after discovering documents , some of them from adolf eichmann who organized the nazi genocide of the jews , while on a trip to argentina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wreath lies on the tracks leading to the gas chamber and crematorium at auschwitz but irving insisted on the logic of some of his past statements , such as saying the fact 100,000 people survived auschwitz was a sign the gas chambers did not exist , even if he now regretted the formulation . under questioning from prosecutor michael klackl , irving denied that his statement about the gas chambers was tantamount to denying the holocaust . " that was no holocaust denial , that was only -lrb- a statement -rrb- about a part of the -lrb- holocaust -rrb- history , " irving said . klackl later told reporters : " we know about david irving , that he always tries to arrange every evidence and find many reasons why you should take his argument in the right way .

" the right-wing historian was arrested in november after a routine check on a highway in austria . the warrant for his arrest was issued by a vienna court in 1989 after he allegedly denied at meetings in austria that the nazi regime used gas chambers in concentration camps . irving was on trial for also saying that the november 1938 kristallnacht pogrom against the jews was not the work of the nazis but " unknown " people who had dressed up as storm troopers , and that adolf hitler had in fact protected the jews . ba n n ed from livi n g i n germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irving now says the nazis systematically murdered jews irving has become notorious worldwide for attempting to establish , despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary , that hitler was not party to the holocaust , that there were no gas chambers in auschwitz , and that the number of jews killed by the nazis was greatly exaggerated . he has been condemned by the courts several times , notably in britain and germany , and last year he was refused entry to new zealand .
he is reportedly also banned from residing in australia , canada , italy and south africa as well as germany . irving sparked widespread outrage with his book " hitler 's war " in 1977 , in which he claimed the nazi dictator did not know about the mass killings of jews until 1943 and that he never ordered the holocaust .

the military jets are meanwhile aiding in the search from above . " the main goal is to stop the spread to domestic animals , " a government spokeswoman said . the h5n1 virus , which is potentially fatal to humans , was also for the first time detected on the mainland in the northeast state of mecklenburg-western pomerania .
two districts of the state declared a state of emergency , a measure which allows the army to be deployed there if required . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german military specialists have begun disinfecting vehicles agriculture minister horst seehofer said ahead of a meeting with his eu counterparts in brussels that the army had been called in because it was important to find and collect the dead birds as soon as possible . scavenging birds feeding on the carcasses of infected animals could spread the virus further , he added .
agriculture ministers from germany 's 16 regional states were to meet on thursday to coordinate efforts to prevent the virus from spreading . fre n ch prepare for more cases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dead duck found in france has tested positive for h5n1 elsewhere in europe , officials also scrambled to deal with the bird flu outbreak .

" there is a strong chance that we will find very shortly in france , as in germany , many more cases of wild birds infected by the h5n1 virus , " the health ministry said . france is the sixth country in the european union to confirm a case of the virus . europe battles to calm fears european farm ministers tried monday to calm consumer fears that bird flu would spread to poultry .
while no poultry has been struck by the disease in the european union , meat sales in the industry have plunged 70 percent in italy , at least 40 percent in greece , 15 percent in france and 10 percent in portugal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're safe to eat , eu officials say " we must not give in to panic , " said austrian agriculture minister josef proell , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" the disease remains confined to wild birds . " while the virus has infected chickens on the eu 's doorstep in ukraine , romania and bulgaria , the outbreaks in italy , france , greece , austria , germany and slovenia have only hit wild birds like swans and ducks . " there is no reason for european citizens not to consume poultry meat and poultry products , " eu health commissioner markos kyprianou added .
" we have to keep in mind that we are talking about an animal disease .
it 's not a human disease .

in paris , a charity group linked to the far right is under fire for serving pork soup to the homeless .
critics say the government should ban the program as the choice of food discriminates against muslims and jews . every thursday night a handful of volunteers equipped with a trunk of hot food meet up in a poor district of paris to feed the needy .
they kick off with red wine served from a cask on the roof of a car , and an appetizer of dried sausage .

" i am here to serve soup to the homeless , to the people who are let down by our society , and to those who accept eating soup with pork in it , " she said .
although sdf has links to a fringe far-right political group , lucien-brun says that rather than being politically motivated , the work she does is about defending french traditions . " we are in france , in europe .

the volunteers say such action amounts to police harassment and prevents them from providing a much-needed service to anyone who wants to take advantage of it . kalif kamaté , a homeless muslim from mali says he prefers not to eat pork , but that these days he ca n't afford to be choosy .

in paris , a charity group linked to the far right is under fire for serving pork soup to the homeless .
critics say the government should ban the program as the choice of food discriminates against muslims and jews . every thursday night a handful of volunteers equipped with a trunk of hot food meet up in a poor district of paris to feed the needy .

" i am here to serve soup to the homeless , to the people who are let down by our society , and to those who accept eating soup with pork in it , " she said .
although sdf has links to a fringe far-right political group , lucien-brun says that rather than being politically motivated , the work she does is about defending french traditions . " we are in france , in europe .

the military jets are meanwhile aiding in the search from above . " the main goal is to stop the spread to domestic animals , " a government spokeswoman said . the h5n1 virus , which is potentially fatal to humans , was also for the first time detected on the mainland in the northeast state of mecklenburg-western pomerania .
two districts of the state declared a state of emergency , a measure which allows the army to be deployed there if required . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german military specialists have begun disinfecting vehicles agriculture minister horst seehofer said ahead of a meeting with his eu counterparts in brussels that the army had been called in because it was important to find and collect the dead birds as soon as possible . scavenging birds feeding on the carcasses of infected animals could spread the virus further , he added .

while no poultry has been struck by the disease in the european union , meat sales in the industry have plunged 70 percent in italy , at least 40 percent in greece , 15 percent in france and 10 percent in portugal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're safe to eat , eu officials say " we must not give in to panic , " said austrian agriculture minister josef proell , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" the disease remains confined to wild birds . " while the virus has infected chickens on the eu 's doorstep in ukraine , romania and bulgaria , the outbreaks in italy , france , greece , austria , germany and slovenia have only hit wild birds like swans and ducks . " there is no reason for european citizens not to consume poultry meat and poultry products , " eu health commissioner markos kyprianou added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2006 modest beginning for kosovo talks expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to ethnic strife , kosovo is plagued by unemployment , corruption and poverty for the first time since the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian delegations will sit down together at the negotiating table .
the talks are bound to prove challenging for both sides . six and a half years after the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian representatives will meet for the first time in vienna on monday , feb .
20 , to discuss a key issue for both sides of the ethnic divide - decentralization and local self-government .
these talks are seen by many as a necessary prelude to the future talks on kosovo 's final status . " decentralization is a key question for kosovo , but especially for the minorities .
it will determine the competences of local self-government as well as the rights and responsibilities of the minorities , " said sören jessen-petersen , special representative of the un secretary general and head of the united nations mission in kosovo . " but one thing has to be clear : we 're talking about a decentralization , not partition of kosovo , " he said . international tug of war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un special envoy martti ahtisaari is aware of the difficulties that lie ahead the preparations for direct talks between serbian and kosovar delegations have been going on for months .
marti ahtisaari , the experienced finnish diplomat and un special envoy for the future status process for kosovo , is well aware that neither of the two parties has so far shown willingness to compromise . " this is a meeting , at which we 're starting from scratch by looking at the problems that need to be solved , " said ahtisaari . yet the position of the kosovo albanians , who are rooting for independence , is fundamentally incompatible with the position of the serbian government in belgrade , which insists that kosovo remains a part of serbia . " we insist on the formula : more than autonomy , less than independence , " said serbian foreign minister vuk draskovic . " that means two things : first of all , the protection of the serbian minority in kosovo and metohija and of the churches and monasteries in accordance with european standards .
and , secondly , preserving the current state border between serbia , albania and macedonia , " draskovic said . uncertain prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian foreign minister draskovic rejects the idea of a fully independent kosovo it is rather doubtful whether draskovic will be able to achieve his goal .
the legal position of the region is ambivalent .
in socialist yugoslavia , kosovo was - together with the northern province of vojvodina - an administrative exception . it was declared as an autonomous province of the republic of serbia , yet it had a special constitutional status within the federal state .
kosovo had the same institutions like the six federal republics of yugoslavia : a parliament of its own , a government with its own jurisdiction , as well as full representation in the central institutions of the federal state . serbian president slobodan milosevic abolished kosovo 's autonomy in 1989 and introduced a brutal police regime in the province , which consequently led to the break-up of yugoslavia .
slovenia and croatia declared independence under the pressure of milosevic 's violent repression in kosovo .
bosnia and herzegovina and macedonia followed the same path in 1991 . escalation of violence the kosovo parliament went underground after the province 's autonomy had been revoked .
by 1997 , the province was ruled in parallel by the serbian central government and the underground state dominated by ethnic albanians .
the kosovo albanians were led by ibrahim rugova , who hoped to lead the province to independence through non-violent resistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato cruise missiles and warplanes attacked yugoslavia on march 24 , 1999 but rugova was not able to control the escalation of violence .
his peaceful strategy failed in 1998 with the outbreak of an armed conflict between the growing kosovo liberation army -lrb- uck -rrb- and the serbian troops . with the experience of the horror that the wars in croatia and bosnia brought upon the balkans , nato forces intervened in march 1999 .
after three months of air strikes against serbia , milosevic was forced to sign the rambouillet accord and accept the presence of the nato peacekeeping troops in the region . the international community took account of kosovo 's complicated legal situation by pronouncing in the un-resolution 1244 that kosovo was a part of yugoslavia .
this resolution , which formed the basis of the rambouillet accord , however , did not make references to serbia . proponents of independence optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatmir sejdiu succeeded ibrahim rugova as kosovo 's president after the session of the un security council on feb .
14 , fatmir sejdiu , rugova 's successor as kosovo 's president , was optimistic that the international community would fulfil the wishes of the kosovar majority . " i welcome the engagement of all members of the security council . independence is a realistic option , which is also the will of the people of kosovo , " sejdiu said . these days , however , kosovo is not the only worry of the serbian government .
the union of serbia and montenegro , the last country to claim itself as a legal successor to yugoslavia , is on the verge of a break-up .
on feb .
25 , the montenegrin parliament will hold an extraordinary session about organizing a referendum on independence . if the parliament approves the referendum , it could take place as early as may 14 , in parallel to the elections in montenegro .
and if montenegro and serbia part their ways , it is hard to expect that the international community will force kosovo to be reunited with serbia . an impossible compromise ? the status of kosovo may therefore be decided by the international community against the wishes of belgrade .
it may additionally frustrate the serbian minority in kosovo , which grew increasingly concerned after the outbreak of ethnic violence in march 2004 , which - despite the presence of the international peacekeeping troops in the region - left 28 people killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , displaced from their homes . before the final status of kosovo is decided , the security council will insist that the minorities in kosovo , and especially the serbs , receive full and comprehensive minority rights and that they are represented in the country 's institutions .
the practical implementation and safeguarding of these rights could become the core of a conditional independence under international observation . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , un call for unity in kosovo after rugova 's death eu foreign policy chief javier solana called on the leaders of kosovo to show " unity and responsibility " following the death saturday of the province 's president , ibrahim rugova .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2006 modest beginning for kosovo talks expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to ethnic strife , kosovo is plagued by unemployment , corruption and poverty for the first time since the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian delegations will sit down together at the negotiating table .
the talks are bound to prove challenging for both sides . six and a half years after the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian representatives will meet for the first time in vienna on monday , feb .
20 , to discuss a key issue for both sides of the ethnic divide - decentralization and local self-government .
these talks are seen by many as a necessary prelude to the future talks on kosovo 's final status . " decentralization is a key question for kosovo , but especially for the minorities .
it will determine the competences of local self-government as well as the rights and responsibilities of the minorities , " said sören jessen-petersen , special representative of the un secretary general and head of the united nations mission in kosovo . " but one thing has to be clear : we 're talking about a decentralization , not partition of kosovo , " he said . international tug of war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un special envoy martti ahtisaari is aware of the difficulties that lie ahead the preparations for direct talks between serbian and kosovar delegations have been going on for months .
marti ahtisaari , the experienced finnish diplomat and un special envoy for the future status process for kosovo , is well aware that neither of the two parties has so far shown willingness to compromise . " this is a meeting , at which we 're starting from scratch by looking at the problems that need to be solved , " said ahtisaari . yet the position of the kosovo albanians , who are rooting for independence , is fundamentally incompatible with the position of the serbian government in belgrade , which insists that kosovo remains a part of serbia . " we insist on the formula : more than autonomy , less than independence , " said serbian foreign minister vuk draskovic . " that means two things : first of all , the protection of the serbian minority in kosovo and metohija and of the churches and monasteries in accordance with european standards .
and , secondly , preserving the current state border between serbia , albania and macedonia , " draskovic said . uncertain prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian foreign minister draskovic rejects the idea of a fully independent kosovo it is rather doubtful whether draskovic will be able to achieve his goal .
the legal position of the region is ambivalent .
in socialist yugoslavia , kosovo was - together with the northern province of vojvodina - an administrative exception . it was declared as an autonomous province of the republic of serbia , yet it had a special constitutional status within the federal state .
kosovo had the same institutions like the six federal republics of yugoslavia : a parliament of its own , a government with its own jurisdiction , as well as full representation in the central institutions of the federal state . serbian president slobodan milosevic abolished kosovo 's autonomy in 1989 and introduced a brutal police regime in the province , which consequently led to the break-up of yugoslavia .
slovenia and croatia declared independence under the pressure of milosevic 's violent repression in kosovo .
bosnia and herzegovina and macedonia followed the same path in 1991 . escalation of violence the kosovo parliament went underground after the province 's autonomy had been revoked .
by 1997 , the province was ruled in parallel by the serbian central government and the underground state dominated by ethnic albanians .
the kosovo albanians were led by ibrahim rugova , who hoped to lead the province to independence through non-violent resistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato cruise missiles and warplanes attacked yugoslavia on march 24 , 1999 but rugova was not able to control the escalation of violence .
his peaceful strategy failed in 1998 with the outbreak of an armed conflict between the growing kosovo liberation army -lrb- uck -rrb- and the serbian troops . with the experience of the horror that the wars in croatia and bosnia brought upon the balkans , nato forces intervened in march 1999 .
after three months of air strikes against serbia , milosevic was forced to sign the rambouillet accord and accept the presence of the nato peacekeeping troops in the region . the international community took account of kosovo 's complicated legal situation by pronouncing in the un-resolution 1244 that kosovo was a part of yugoslavia .
this resolution , which formed the basis of the rambouillet accord , however , did not make references to serbia . proponents of independence optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatmir sejdiu succeeded ibrahim rugova as kosovo 's president after the session of the un security council on feb .
14 , fatmir sejdiu , rugova 's successor as kosovo 's president , was optimistic that the international community would fulfil the wishes of the kosovar majority . " i welcome the engagement of all members of the security council . independence is a realistic option , which is also the will of the people of kosovo , " sejdiu said . these days , however , kosovo is not the only worry of the serbian government .
the union of serbia and montenegro , the last country to claim itself as a legal successor to yugoslavia , is on the verge of a break-up .
on feb .
25 , the montenegrin parliament will hold an extraordinary session about organizing a referendum on independence . if the parliament approves the referendum , it could take place as early as may 14 , in parallel to the elections in montenegro .
and if montenegro and serbia part their ways , it is hard to expect that the international community will force kosovo to be reunited with serbia . an impossible compromise ? the status of kosovo may therefore be decided by the international community against the wishes of belgrade .
it may additionally frustrate the serbian minority in kosovo , which grew increasingly concerned after the outbreak of ethnic violence in march 2004 , which - despite the presence of the international peacekeeping troops in the region - left 28 people killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , displaced from their homes . before the final status of kosovo is decided , the security council will insist that the minorities in kosovo , and especially the serbs , receive full and comprehensive minority rights and that they are represented in the country 's institutions .
the practical implementation and safeguarding of these rights could become the core of a conditional independence under international observation . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , un call for unity in kosovo after rugova 's death eu foreign policy chief javier solana called on the leaders of kosovo to show " unity and responsibility " following the death saturday of the province 's president , ibrahim rugova .

meanwhile new cases of h5n1 infection in italy , france and india raise the threat of a global pandemic . deadly bird flu was detected for the first time on the german mainland , bringing the total number of cases in the country to 61 , animal health experts said sunday . the friedrich-löffler institute for animal health said two new cases of the h5n1 virus that can be fatal to humans were detected in a buzzard and a gull found dead in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-pomerania .
earlier sunday , 18 new cases of h5n1 were confirmed on the baltic island of rügen , also part of the state . german chancellor angela merkel on sunday surveyed measures taken to combat bird flu on rügen , as army disinfection experts deployed to curb the spread of the virus .
" the situation is serious , " she said after meeting with local crisis teams working to contain the outbreak . she said that if the situation worsened , " the federal government will be present with all the means at its disposal . " ministers rush to stem the wave of infection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture minister seehofer -lrb- left -rrb- and till backhaus face the press mecklenburg-pomerania 's agriculture minister , till backhaus , said the 18 new cases on rügen included swans , cormorants , geese and a buzzard .
he said the state would begin slaughtering domestic fowl including chickens and ducks sunday as a precaution to prevent a broader outbreak of the virus .
backhaus declined to say how many birds would be killed . meanwhile 19 bundeswehr army specialists were sent to rügen to disinfect vehicles and people who may have come in contact with the virus , a defense ministry spokesman said .
all vehicles and bicycles leaving the island had their tires decontaminated in special disinfectant baths .
pedestrians were told to have their shoes disinfected . the island is popular with tourists and has been inundated with reporters since the outbreak earlier this month , which experts said increased the risk of the virus being carried .
" the problem is that journalists get very close to the dead animals and also film the collection of cadavers , " the president of the friedrich löffler institute for animal health , thomas mettenleiter , said .
" then the camera teams go with their contaminated equipment and clothing directly where the birds are .

" three key european ambassadors stepped up pressure on us authorities over the weekend , after a report by un human rights experts called for the camp at guantanamo bay in cuba to be shut as soon as possible . " the sooner it is closed the better it will be for the image of the united states , not only as a military and political -lrb- power -rrb- but also as a moral leader in the world , " german ambassador wolfgang ischinger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a maximum security cell at camp delta in guantanamo france 's envoy , jean-david levitte , told cnn television that " guantanamo is an embarrassment , and so it has to be solved one way or the other . " and british ambassador sir david manning reaffirmed prime minister tony blair 's comment last week that the us camp for detainees seized in the global offensive launched after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks was " an anomaly . " commission recommends closing " we understand the context .
you 've lost a lot of people , " said manning .
" it 's difficult to find the right line to draw between your duties as a government for security and safeguarding liberty , but it is clearly an anomaly , and it needs to be dealt with . " the camp at guantanamo has some 500 inmates , most of whom have never been charged .
controversial since its establishment , it re-emerged into the international spotlight after a group of human rights experts commissioned to write a report on the camp said some practices at guantanamo were tantamount to torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general annan : camp closure sooner or later un secretary general kofi annan distanced the united nations from the report , which was commissioned by the un but carried out by independent human-rights experts .
at the same time , he clearly supported its message , saying that " sooner or later , " guantanamo would have to be closed . he added that he hoped a decision would be made quickly . " this is not a report from the un or the un secretary general , " annan clarified in a statement in new york . agreement on ' basic points ' he said he did n't agree with everything in the report .
" but the basic point - that one can not detain individuals in perpetuity , and that charges have to be brought against them and be given a chance to explain themselves , prosecuted , charged or released - i think is something that is common under any legal system . " according to annan , the us is walking a fine line with its guantanamo dealings .
" the basic premise is , we have to be particularly careful to keep a balance between effective anti-terror measures , and individual freedom and human rights , " he warned . lost balance this balance seems to have been lost in guantanamo , and the geneva conventions are not being respected .
therefore , he said , " i think sooner or later , guantanamo will need to be closed .
the us government has to decide this .
and i hope they do it as quickly as possible .

" three key european ambassadors stepped up pressure on us authorities over the weekend , after a report by un human rights experts called for the camp at guantanamo bay in cuba to be shut as soon as possible . " the sooner it is closed the better it will be for the image of the united states , not only as a military and political -lrb- power -rrb- but also as a moral leader in the world , " german ambassador wolfgang ischinger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a maximum security cell at camp delta in guantanamo france 's envoy , jean-david levitte , told cnn television that " guantanamo is an embarrassment , and so it has to be solved one way or the other . " and british ambassador sir david manning reaffirmed prime minister tony blair 's comment last week that the us camp for detainees seized in the global offensive launched after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks was " an anomaly . " commission recommends closing " we understand the context .
you 've lost a lot of people , " said manning .
" it 's difficult to find the right line to draw between your duties as a government for security and safeguarding liberty , but it is clearly an anomaly , and it needs to be dealt with . " the camp at guantanamo has some 500 inmates , most of whom have never been charged .
controversial since its establishment , it re-emerged into the international spotlight after a group of human rights experts commissioned to write a report on the camp said some practices at guantanamo were tantamount to torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general annan : camp closure sooner or later un secretary general kofi annan distanced the united nations from the report , which was commissioned by the un but carried out by independent human-rights experts .
at the same time , he clearly supported its message , saying that " sooner or later , " guantanamo would have to be closed . he added that he hoped a decision would be made quickly . " this is not a report from the un or the un secretary general , " annan clarified in a statement in new york . agreement on ' basic points ' he said he did n't agree with everything in the report .
" but the basic point - that one can not detain individuals in perpetuity , and that charges have to be brought against them and be given a chance to explain themselves , prosecuted , charged or released - i think is something that is common under any legal system . " according to annan , the us is walking a fine line with its guantanamo dealings .
" the basic premise is , we have to be particularly careful to keep a balance between effective anti-terror measures , and individual freedom and human rights , " he warned . lost balance this balance seems to have been lost in guantanamo , and the geneva conventions are not being respected .
therefore , he said , " i think sooner or later , guantanamo will need to be closed .
the us government has to decide this .
and i hope they do it as quickly as possible .

what will be the outcome ?
germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .
as high-level talks on monday failed to reach agreement , union leader frank bsirske settled in for a long haul . in all , it is the largest strike germany has seen in 14 years , with more than 30,000 civil servants - including trash collectors , kindergarten teachers , nurses and government officials - stopping work across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes among trash collectors has led to garbage hills like this one in lower saxony prior to a crucial high-level meeting between unions and public service representatives , key negotiators gave no clear signals that the talks would be fruitful .
state leaders have formed a united front in favor of increasing civil service work hours from 38.5 to 40 hours , while the union has said it is committed to preventing this .
at the head of services trade union ver.di is frank bsirske .
ver.di was created five years ago when five smaller unions joined forces , and bsirske 's gift has been the ability to unify his union 's various membership streams into a single , powerful organization .
at stake : a union 's reputation as the 54-year-old union organizer sees it , the current fight is about more than just jobs and money for its members .
it will decide whether germany 's approximately three million civil servants will have equal pay and working conditions on the local , state and federal level .
more importantly , the results of the strike show whether ver.di - one of the world 's largest trade unions - is capable of supporting its members in the face of opposition from public employers .
like virtually all german unions , ver.di has seen its membership rolls decline recently .
it is clear that the fight over the work week will be a decisive one for bsirske and the unions alike .
up to now , everything has gone well for the unions - the strike has enjoyed more than 50 percent approval among the public - but the honeymoon may not last .
if employers remain inflexible , goodwill may well begin to drop off .
' fight for prestige ' a loss for ver.di in this case could mean a reassessment of the value of unions in german society .
" ver.di is fighting for its prestige and its influence on the political stage , " berlin union researcher hans-peter müller told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di members took to the streets for bsirske , the battle will be a complex one ; the strikes are essentially defensive moves against the state and local governments , which are wrangling over details of wage agreements and work hours .
a defensive strike is unusual for germany 's civil servants , and it is a new experience for bsirske .
the last widespread work conflict , 14 years ago , saw some 400,000 workers hit the streets , and public services in the country suffered greatly .
as a result , when bsirske was coming up the union ranks , the mere threat of a strike was enough to bring parties to the table .
not afraid of conflict but bsirske does n't shy away from conflict .
as head of personnel for the city of hanover , he had to cut some 1,000 jobs . " as someone with three decades of union work , and who also had personnel responsibilities in a large organization , i not only learned how to communicate , but how to deal with conflict , " he said .
" but i think these abilities are expected in a union leader .
he needs to be able to find common solutions with employers , and when nothing else works , he has to be able to get into conflicts .
if the membership wants it . "
politics in the blood ?
bsirske studied political science , and even today he is a political person . the son of a volkswagen works council head , he joined the social democratic party at age 15 , and later represented the greens in hanover .
he is the only union leader who is a member of the greens . " i think a union that represents such a wide array of jobs and careers is well served by someone with a slightly unusual background , " he said . with so much riding on the outcome of the strikes , union members can only help bsirske is right . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german public sector strike expands germany 's public sector is facing large scale industrial action for the first time in more than a decade .

state leaders have formed a united front in favor of increasing civil service work hours from 38.5 to 40 hours , while the union has said it is committed to preventing this .
at the head of services trade union ver.di is frank bsirske .
ver.di was created five years ago when five smaller unions joined forces , and bsirske 's gift has been the ability to unify his union 's various membership streams into a single , powerful organization .
at stake : a union 's reputation as the 54-year-old union organizer sees it , the current fight is about more than just jobs and money for its members .
it will decide whether germany 's approximately three million civil servants will have equal pay and working conditions on the local , state and federal level .
more importantly , the results of the strike show whether ver.di - one of the world 's largest trade unions - is capable of supporting its members in the face of opposition from public employers .
like virtually all german unions , ver.di has seen its membership rolls decline recently .
it is clear that the fight over the work week will be a decisive one for bsirske and the unions alike .
up to now , everything has gone well for the unions - the strike has enjoyed more than 50 percent approval among the public - but the honeymoon may not last .
if employers remain inflexible , goodwill may well begin to drop off .
' fight for prestige ' a loss for ver.di in this case could mean a reassessment of the value of unions in german society .
" ver.di is fighting for its prestige and its influence on the political stage , " berlin union researcher hans-peter müller told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di members took to the streets for bsirske , the battle will be a complex one ; the strikes are essentially defensive moves against the state and local governments , which are wrangling over details of wage agreements and work hours .
a defensive strike is unusual for germany 's civil servants , and it is a new experience for bsirske .
the last widespread work conflict , 14 years ago , saw some 400,000 workers hit the streets , and public services in the country suffered greatly .
as a result , when bsirske was coming up the union ranks , the mere threat of a strike was enough to bring parties to the table .
not afraid of conflict but bsirske does n't shy away from conflict .
as head of personnel for the city of hanover , he had to cut some 1,000 jobs . " as someone with three decades of union work , and who also had personnel responsibilities in a large organization , i not only learned how to communicate , but how to deal with conflict , " he said .
" but i think these abilities are expected in a union leader .
he needs to be able to find common solutions with employers , and when nothing else works , he has to be able to get into conflicts .
if the membership wants it . "
politics in the blood ?
bsirske studied political science , and even today he is a political person . the son of a volkswagen works council head , he joined the social democratic party at age 15 , and later represented the greens in hanover .
he is the only union leader who is a member of the greens . " i think a union that represents such a wide array of jobs and careers is well served by someone with a slightly unusual background , " he said . with so much riding on the outcome of the strikes , union members can only help bsirske is right . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german public sector strike expands germany 's public sector is facing large scale industrial action for the first time in more than a decade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2006 modest beginning for kosovo talks expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to ethnic strife , kosovo is plagued by unemployment , corruption and poverty for the first time since the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian delegations will sit down together at the negotiating table .
the talks are bound to prove challenging for both sides . six and a half years after the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian representatives will meet for the first time in vienna on monday , feb .
20 , to discuss a key issue for both sides of the ethnic divide - decentralization and local self-government .
these talks are seen by many as a necessary prelude to the future talks on kosovo 's final status . " decentralization is a key question for kosovo , but especially for the minorities .
it will determine the competences of local self-government as well as the rights and responsibilities of the minorities , " said sören jessen-petersen , special representative of the un secretary general and head of the united nations mission in kosovo . " but one thing has to be clear : we 're talking about a decentralization , not partition of kosovo , " he said . international tug of war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un special envoy martti ahtisaari is aware of the difficulties that lie ahead the preparations for direct talks between serbian and kosovar delegations have been going on for months .
marti ahtisaari , the experienced finnish diplomat and un special envoy for the future status process for kosovo , is well aware that neither of the two parties has so far shown willingness to compromise . " this is a meeting , at which we 're starting from scratch by looking at the problems that need to be solved , " said ahtisaari . yet the position of the kosovo albanians , who are rooting for independence , is fundamentally incompatible with the position of the serbian government in belgrade , which insists that kosovo remains a part of serbia . " we insist on the formula : more than autonomy , less than independence , " said serbian foreign minister vuk draskovic . " that means two things : first of all , the protection of the serbian minority in kosovo and metohija and of the churches and monasteries in accordance with european standards .
and , secondly , preserving the current state border between serbia , albania and macedonia , " draskovic said . uncertain prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian foreign minister draskovic rejects the idea of a fully independent kosovo it is rather doubtful whether draskovic will be able to achieve his goal .
the legal position of the region is ambivalent .
in socialist yugoslavia , kosovo was - together with the northern province of vojvodina - an administrative exception . it was declared as an autonomous province of the republic of serbia , yet it had a special constitutional status within the federal state .
kosovo had the same institutions like the six federal republics of yugoslavia : a parliament of its own , a government with its own jurisdiction , as well as full representation in the central institutions of the federal state . serbian president slobodan milosevic abolished kosovo 's autonomy in 1989 and introduced a brutal police regime in the province , which consequently led to the break-up of yugoslavia .
slovenia and croatia declared independence under the pressure of milosevic 's violent repression in kosovo .
bosnia and herzegovina and macedonia followed the same path in 1991 . escalation of violence the kosovo parliament went underground after the province 's autonomy had been revoked .

after three months of air strikes against serbia , milosevic was forced to sign the rambouillet accord and accept the presence of the nato peacekeeping troops in the region . the international community took account of kosovo 's complicated legal situation by pronouncing in the un-resolution 1244 that kosovo was a part of yugoslavia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2006 modest beginning for kosovo talks expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to ethnic strife , kosovo is plagued by unemployment , corruption and poverty for the first time since the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian delegations will sit down together at the negotiating table .
the talks are bound to prove challenging for both sides . six and a half years after the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian representatives will meet for the first time in vienna on monday , feb .
20 , to discuss a key issue for both sides of the ethnic divide - decentralization and local self-government .
these talks are seen by many as a necessary prelude to the future talks on kosovo 's final status . " decentralization is a key question for kosovo , but especially for the minorities .
it will determine the competences of local self-government as well as the rights and responsibilities of the minorities , " said sören jessen-petersen , special representative of the un secretary general and head of the united nations mission in kosovo . " but one thing has to be clear : we 're talking about a decentralization , not partition of kosovo , " he said . international tug of war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un special envoy martti ahtisaari is aware of the difficulties that lie ahead the preparations for direct talks between serbian and kosovar delegations have been going on for months .
marti ahtisaari , the experienced finnish diplomat and un special envoy for the future status process for kosovo , is well aware that neither of the two parties has so far shown willingness to compromise . " this is a meeting , at which we 're starting from scratch by looking at the problems that need to be solved , " said ahtisaari . yet the position of the kosovo albanians , who are rooting for independence , is fundamentally incompatible with the position of the serbian government in belgrade , which insists that kosovo remains a part of serbia . " we insist on the formula : more than autonomy , less than independence , " said serbian foreign minister vuk draskovic . " that means two things : first of all , the protection of the serbian minority in kosovo and metohija and of the churches and monasteries in accordance with european standards .
and , secondly , preserving the current state border between serbia , albania and macedonia , " draskovic said . uncertain prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian foreign minister draskovic rejects the idea of a fully independent kosovo it is rather doubtful whether draskovic will be able to achieve his goal .
the legal position of the region is ambivalent .
in socialist yugoslavia , kosovo was - together with the northern province of vojvodina - an administrative exception . it was declared as an autonomous province of the republic of serbia , yet it had a special constitutional status within the federal state .
kosovo had the same institutions like the six federal republics of yugoslavia : a parliament of its own , a government with its own jurisdiction , as well as full representation in the central institutions of the federal state . serbian president slobodan milosevic abolished kosovo 's autonomy in 1989 and introduced a brutal police regime in the province , which consequently led to the break-up of yugoslavia .
slovenia and croatia declared independence under the pressure of milosevic 's violent repression in kosovo .
bosnia and herzegovina and macedonia followed the same path in 1991 . escalation of violence the kosovo parliament went underground after the province 's autonomy had been revoked .
by 1997 , the province was ruled in parallel by the serbian central government and the underground state dominated by ethnic albanians .
the kosovo albanians were led by ibrahim rugova , who hoped to lead the province to independence through non-violent resistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato cruise missiles and warplanes attacked yugoslavia on march 24 , 1999 but rugova was not able to control the escalation of violence .

" i acknowledge my guilt on this charge , " he told judge peter liebetreu . irving said that he now realized his statement that " there were no gas chambers in auschwitz -lrb- was -rrb- false .

he is reportedly also banned from residing in australia , canada , italy and south africa as well as germany . irving sparked widespread outrage with his book " hitler 's war " in 1977 , in which he claimed the nazi dictator did not know about the mass killings of jews until 1943 and that he never ordered the holocaust .

" i acknowledge my guilt on this charge , " he told judge peter liebetreu . irving said that he now realized his statement that " there were no gas chambers in auschwitz -lrb- was -rrb- false . " he had earlier told reporters upon entering the court in central vienna in handcuffs that it was " ridiculous for me to be standing here on trial for something i expressed 17 years ago . " i am not a holocaust denier , " he added .
" my views have changed .
history is a constantly growing tree . ...
the more documents are available , the more you learn , and i have learned a lot since 1989 . " asked about the holocaust , he said : " i would call it the jewish tragedy in world war ii " and that millions of jews had died . accurate research ? irving , whose handcuffs were removed as the trial began , insisted on the accuracy of his historical research as liebetreu bombarded him with questions about holocaust denials he had made in the past and what he thought now . the 67-year-old said he had changed his mind since 1989 after discovering documents , some of them from adolf eichmann who organized the nazi genocide of the jews , while on a trip to argentina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wreath lies on the tracks leading to the gas chamber and crematorium at auschwitz but irving insisted on the logic of some of his past statements , such as saying the fact 100,000 people survived auschwitz was a sign the gas chambers did not exist , even if he now regretted the formulation . under questioning from prosecutor michael klackl , irving denied that his statement about the gas chambers was tantamount to denying the holocaust . " that was no holocaust denial , that was only -lrb- a statement -rrb- about a part of the -lrb- holocaust -rrb- history , " irving said . klackl later told reporters : " we know about david irving , that he always tries to arrange every evidence and find many reasons why you should take his argument in the right way . " irvi n g faced up to 10 years i n priso n irving , 67 , faced up to 10 years in jail under an austrian law that prosecutes those who " deny the genocide by the national socialists or other national socialist crimes against humanity . " the right-wing historian was arrested in november after a routine check on a highway in austria . the warrant for his arrest was issued by a vienna court in 1989 after he allegedly denied at meetings in austria that the nazi regime used gas chambers in concentration camps . irving was on trial for also saying that the november 1938 kristallnacht pogrom against the jews was not the work of the nazis but " unknown " people who had dressed up as storm troopers , and that adolf hitler had in fact protected the jews . ba n n ed from livi n g i n germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irving now says the nazis systematically murdered jews irving has become notorious worldwide for attempting to establish , despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary , that hitler was not party to the holocaust , that there were no gas chambers in auschwitz , and that the number of jews killed by the nazis was greatly exaggerated . he has been condemned by the courts several times , notably in britain and germany , and last year he was refused entry to new zealand .
he is reportedly also banned from residing in australia , canada , italy and south africa as well as germany . irving sparked widespread outrage with his book " hitler 's war " in 1977 , in which he claimed the nazi dictator did not know about the mass killings of jews until 1943 and that he never ordered the holocaust .
he carried a copy of that book when he entered court monday . in 2000 , he lost a high-profile libel case in london against us historian deborah lipstadt after she called him a holocaust denier . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany condemns proposed iranian holocaust conference the iranian government 's announcement that it plans to hold a conference on the holocaust with notorious deniers as guests has caused outrage in germany .

9 , ernst zündel , a holocaust denier , faces a german court on charges of inciting racial hatred and defaming the dead .
the case shows that while germany guarantees freedom of expression , there are limits . according to prosecutors , ernst zündel is one of the " most active " holocaust deniers today .
he began distributing nazi and neo-nazi propaganda in the 1970s and has written several books praising adolf hitler and the nazi regime .
since 1995 , he has been associated with a web site that carries his name and is one of biggest online repositories of holocaust-denial propaganda . but zündel , who was born in germany 's black forest region , was only able to engage in such activities because he was living outside of his native county , in canada and the united states . although freedom of the press and of expression is written into german law , the country is generally more wary of free speech than the us , where zündel 's dissemination of racist literature and refutation of the holocaust - while distasteful to most - was perfectly legal . in germany , however , it was not .
zündel was deported to his native country in march 2005 after a long legal battle with the canadian government .
he found himself immediately under arrest and up against the german justice system .

9 , ernst zündel , a holocaust denier , faces a german court on charges of inciting racial hatred and defaming the dead .
the case shows that while germany guarantees freedom of expression , there are limits . according to prosecutors , ernst zündel is one of the " most active " holocaust deniers today .
he began distributing nazi and neo-nazi propaganda in the 1970s and has written several books praising adolf hitler and the nazi regime .
since 1995 , he has been associated with a web site that carries his name and is one of biggest online repositories of holocaust-denial propaganda . but zündel , who was born in germany 's black forest region , was only able to engage in such activities because he was living outside of his native county , in canada and the united states . although freedom of the press and of expression is written into german law , the country is generally more wary of free speech than the us , where zündel 's dissemination of racist literature and refutation of the holocaust - while distasteful to most - was perfectly legal . in germany , however , it was not .
zündel was deported to his native country in march 2005 after a long legal battle with the canadian government .
he found himself immediately under arrest and up against the german justice system .
if the 66-year-old is found guilty by a court in mannheim of incitement to racial hatred , libel and defamation of the memory of the dead , he faces up to five years in prison . constitutional rights and constraints article 5 of germany 's constitution , or basic law , enshrines the right of freedom of speech and of the press .

9 , ernst zündel , a holocaust denier , faces a german court on charges of inciting racial hatred and defaming the dead .
the case shows that while germany guarantees freedom of expression , there are limits . according to prosecutors , ernst zündel is one of the " most active " holocaust deniers today .
he began distributing nazi and neo-nazi propaganda in the 1970s and has written several books praising adolf hitler and the nazi regime .
since 1995 , he has been associated with a web site that carries his name and is one of biggest online repositories of holocaust-denial propaganda . but zündel , who was born in germany 's black forest region , was only able to engage in such activities because he was living outside of his native county , in canada and the united states . although freedom of the press and of expression is written into german law , the country is generally more wary of free speech than the us , where zündel 's dissemination of racist literature and refutation of the holocaust - while distasteful to most - was perfectly legal . in germany , however , it was not .
zündel was deported to his native country in march 2005 after a long legal battle with the canadian government .
he found himself immediately under arrest and up against the german justice system .
if the 66-year-old is found guilty by a court in mannheim of incitement to racial hatred , libel and defamation of the memory of the dead , he faces up to five years in prison . constitutional rights and constraints article 5 of germany 's constitution , or basic law , enshrines the right of freedom of speech and of the press . " everyone has the right to freely express and disseminate their opinions orally , in writing or visually and to obtain information from generally accessible sources without hindrance , " states paragraph one of the law .

" these rights are subject to limitations embodied in the provisions of general legislation , statutory provisions for the protection of young persons and the citizen 's right to personal respect , " reads the second paragraph . german law therefore constrains press freedom , said udo branahl , a professor of media law at the university of dortmund .

" that ban limits press freedom and overrides the right to free expression in the mass media . " germany is not the only european country to make holocaust denial a crime .

9 , ernst zündel , a holocaust denier , faces a german court on charges of inciting racial hatred and defaming the dead .
the case shows that while germany guarantees freedom of expression , there are limits . according to prosecutors , ernst zündel is one of the " most active " holocaust deniers today .
he began distributing nazi and neo-nazi propaganda in the 1970s and has written several books praising adolf hitler and the nazi regime .
since 1995 , he has been associated with a web site that carries his name and is one of biggest online repositories of holocaust-denial propaganda . but zündel , who was born in germany 's black forest region , was only able to engage in such activities because he was living outside of his native county , in canada and the united states . although freedom of the press and of expression is written into german law , the country is generally more wary of free speech than the us , where zündel 's dissemination of racist literature and refutation of the holocaust - while distasteful to most - was perfectly legal . in germany , however , it was not .
zündel was deported to his native country in march 2005 after a long legal battle with the canadian government .
he found himself immediately under arrest and up against the german justice system .
if the 66-year-old is found guilty by a court in mannheim of incitement to racial hatred , libel and defamation of the memory of the dead , he faces up to five years in prison . constitutional rights and constraints article 5 of germany 's constitution , or basic law , enshrines the right of freedom of speech and of the press . " everyone has the right to freely express and disseminate their opinions orally , in writing or visually and to obtain information from generally accessible sources without hindrance , " states paragraph one of the law .
" freedom of the press and freedom of reporting through audiovisual media shall be guaranteed .
there shall be no censorship . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's " basic law " but the next paragraph puts certain limits on that freedom , which were deemed necessary when the basic law was proclaimed in 1949 , just four years after the end of world war ii and the downfall of the nazi dictatorship . " these rights are subject to limitations embodied in the provisions of general legislation , statutory provisions for the protection of young persons and the citizen 's right to personal respect , " reads the second paragraph . german law therefore constrains press freedom , said udo branahl , a professor of media law at the university of dortmund . " the penal law code says holocaust denial is a punishable offense , " he said .
" that ban limits press freedom and overrides the right to free expression in the mass media . " germany is not the only european country to make holocaust denial a crime .
france , italy and austria have similar statutes on the books . criminal abroad , tried in germany so while in the us and canada , zündel could freely present his " evidence " that the gas chambers and crematoria of the third reich did not exist , in germany , he was committing a crime that he would be tried for , even though it was not committed on german soil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german courts have considered the severity of holocaust in weighing free speech against individual rights the country 's federal constitutional court confirmed in 1994 that holocaust revisionism is not protected speech . " in weighing the importance of free speech against that of individual rights , courts must consider on the one hand the severity of the offense caused by holocaust denial to the jewish population in light of the suffering inflicted upon it by germany , " the court wrote at the time .
" this court has consistently protected the personal honor of those defamed above the right of others to make patently false statements . " in the united states , where a broader definition of the freedom of expression has traditionally been considered one of the country 's most foundations , this limitation on expression is often met with disapproval . " i disapprove of what you say , but i will defend to the death your right to say it , " goes a citation from voltaire that 's often quoted . " i 've spoken with a lot of americans , and they do n't understand us , " said wolfgang wippermann , a professor at the freie university in berlin who studies nazism and right-wing extremism .
" i tell them , ' in your country , drug dealers also go to prison ; these holocaust deniers are like drug dealers , but dealing in mental poison ' .

earlier , he had acknowledged that the auschwitz gas chambers had existed . during the one-day trial , irving had pleaded guilty to a charge from 1989 of denying the holocaust , which in austria is a crime , but said he no longer held that view . " i acknowledge my guilt on this charge , " he told judge peter liebetreu . irving said that he now realized his statement that " there were no gas chambers in auschwitz -lrb- was -rrb- false . " he had earlier told reporters upon entering the court in central vienna in handcuffs that it was " ridiculous for me to be standing here on trial for something i expressed 17 years ago . " i am not a holocaust denier , " he added .
" my views have changed .
history is a constantly growing tree . ...
the more documents are available , the more you learn , and i have learned a lot since 1989 . " asked about the holocaust , he said : " i would call it the jewish tragedy in world war ii " and that millions of jews had died . accurate research ? irving , whose handcuffs were removed as the trial began , insisted on the accuracy of his historical research as liebetreu bombarded him with questions about holocaust denials he had made in the past and what he thought now . the 67-year-old said he had changed his mind since 1989 after discovering documents , some of them from adolf eichmann who organized the nazi genocide of the jews , while on a trip to argentina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wreath lies on the tracks leading to the gas chamber and crematorium at auschwitz but irving insisted on the logic of some of his past statements , such as saying the fact 100,000 people survived auschwitz was a sign the gas chambers did not exist , even if he now regretted the formulation . under questioning from prosecutor michael klackl , irving denied that his statement about the gas chambers was tantamount to denying the holocaust . " that was no holocaust denial , that was only -lrb- a statement -rrb- about a part of the -lrb- holocaust -rrb- history , " irving said . klackl later told reporters : " we know about david irving , that he always tries to arrange every evidence and find many reasons why you should take his argument in the right way . " irvi n g faced up to 10 years i n priso n irving , 67 , faced up to 10 years in jail under an austrian law that prosecutes those who " deny the genocide by the national socialists or other national socialist crimes against humanity . " the right-wing historian was arrested in november after a routine check on a highway in austria . the warrant for his arrest was issued by a vienna court in 1989 after he allegedly denied at meetings in austria that the nazi regime used gas chambers in concentration camps . irving was on trial for also saying that the november 1938 kristallnacht pogrom against the jews was not the work of the nazis but " unknown " people who had dressed up as storm troopers , and that adolf hitler had in fact protected the jews . ba n n ed from livi n g i n germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irving now says the nazis systematically murdered jews irving has become notorious worldwide for attempting to establish , despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary , that hitler was not party to the holocaust , that there were no gas chambers in auschwitz , and that the number of jews killed by the nazis was greatly exaggerated . he has been condemned by the courts several times , notably in britain and germany , and last year he was refused entry to new zealand .
he is reportedly also banned from residing in australia , canada , italy and south africa as well as germany . irving sparked widespread outrage with his book " hitler 's war " in 1977 , in which he claimed the nazi dictator did not know about the mass killings of jews until 1943 and that he never ordered the holocaust .
he carried a copy of that book when he entered court monday . in 2000 , he lost a high-profile libel case in london against us historian deborah lipstadt after she called him a holocaust denier . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany condemns proposed iranian holocaust conference the iranian government 's announcement that it plans to hold a conference on the holocaust with notorious deniers as guests has caused outrage in germany .

what will be the outcome ?
germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .
as high-level talks on monday failed to reach agreement , union leader frank bsirske settled in for a long haul . in all , it is the largest strike germany has seen in 14 years , with more than 30,000 civil servants - including trash collectors , kindergarten teachers , nurses and government officials - stopping work across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes among trash collectors has led to garbage hills like this one in lower saxony prior to a crucial high-level meeting between unions and public service representatives , key negotiators gave no clear signals that the talks would be fruitful .
state leaders have formed a united front in favor of increasing civil service work hours from 38.5 to 40 hours , while the union has said it is committed to preventing this .
at the head of services trade union ver.di is frank bsirske .
ver.di was created five years ago when five smaller unions joined forces , and bsirske 's gift has been the ability to unify his union 's various membership streams into a single , powerful organization .
at stake : a union 's reputation as the 54-year-old union organizer sees it , the current fight is about more than just jobs and money for its members .
it will decide whether germany 's approximately three million civil servants will have equal pay and working conditions on the local , state and federal level .
more importantly , the results of the strike show whether ver.di - one of the world 's largest trade unions - is capable of supporting its members in the face of opposition from public employers .
like virtually all german unions , ver.di has seen its membership rolls decline recently .
it is clear that the fight over the work week will be a decisive one for bsirske and the unions alike .
up to now , everything has gone well for the unions - the strike has enjoyed more than 50 percent approval among the public - but the honeymoon may not last .
if employers remain inflexible , goodwill may well begin to drop off .
' fight for prestige ' a loss for ver.di in this case could mean a reassessment of the value of unions in german society .
" ver.di is fighting for its prestige and its influence on the political stage , " berlin union researcher hans-peter müller told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di members took to the streets for bsirske , the battle will be a complex one ; the strikes are essentially defensive moves against the state and local governments , which are wrangling over details of wage agreements and work hours .
a defensive strike is unusual for germany 's civil servants , and it is a new experience for bsirske .
the last widespread work conflict , 14 years ago , saw some 400,000 workers hit the streets , and public services in the country suffered greatly .
as a result , when bsirske was coming up the union ranks , the mere threat of a strike was enough to bring parties to the table .
not afraid of conflict but bsirske does n't shy away from conflict .
as head of personnel for the city of hanover , he had to cut some 1,000 jobs . " as someone with three decades of union work , and who also had personnel responsibilities in a large organization , i not only learned how to communicate , but how to deal with conflict , " he said .
" but i think these abilities are expected in a union leader .
he needs to be able to find common solutions with employers , and when nothing else works , he has to be able to get into conflicts .
if the membership wants it . "
politics in the blood ?
bsirske studied political science , and even today he is a political person . the son of a volkswagen works council head , he joined the social democratic party at age 15 , and later represented the greens in hanover .
he is the only union leader who is a member of the greens . " i think a union that represents such a wide array of jobs and careers is well served by someone with a slightly unusual background , " he said . with so much riding on the outcome of the strikes , union members can only help bsirske is right . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german public sector strike expands germany 's public sector is facing large scale industrial action for the first time in more than a decade .

" this irresponsible film does not encourage integration but sows hate and mistrust against the west , " stoiber told the bild am sonntag newspaper in a reference to the film 's popularity among germany 's large turkish immigrant community . " i urge the cinema owners in germany to pull this racist and anti-western hate film immediately , " he said , adding that " eu candidate turkey should take a clear stand . " charlotte knobloch , vice president of the central council of jews in germany , told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung the movie stoked anti-semitic sentiment . the film has so far sold 200,000 tickets and is ranked fifth in the german box office charts . film based on actual event it is based on an actual event - the arrest of 11 turkish soldiers by a us military unit in northern iraq in july 2003 on grounds of " suspicious activity . "
the men were held for two days , their heads bagged , before being released without explanation . the incident dealt a severe and lasting blow to relations between turkey and the united states , long-time nato allies .

" the news is full of hundreds of iraqis being killed every day - there 's none of that in the movie .
it presents the situation as it is , with the americans who want to seize all power in the region . " " there is a bit of fiction , " conceded 28-year-old soldier alperen , who also withheld his surname , " but it 's very close to reality .

earlier , he had acknowledged that the auschwitz gas chambers had existed . during the one-day trial , irving had pleaded guilty to a charge from 1989 of denying the holocaust , which in austria is a crime , but said he no longer held that view . " i acknowledge my guilt on this charge , " he told judge peter liebetreu . irving said that he now realized his statement that " there were no gas chambers in auschwitz -lrb- was -rrb- false . " he had earlier told reporters upon entering the court in central vienna in handcuffs that it was " ridiculous for me to be standing here on trial for something i expressed 17 years ago . " i am not a holocaust denier , " he added .
" my views have changed .
history is a constantly growing tree . ...
the more documents are available , the more you learn , and i have learned a lot since 1989 . " asked about the holocaust , he said : " i would call it the jewish tragedy in world war ii " and that millions of jews had died . accurate research ? irving , whose handcuffs were removed as the trial began , insisted on the accuracy of his historical research as liebetreu bombarded him with questions about holocaust denials he had made in the past and what he thought now . the 67-year-old said he had changed his mind since 1989 after discovering documents , some of them from adolf eichmann who organized the nazi genocide of the jews , while on a trip to argentina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wreath lies on the tracks leading to the gas chamber and crematorium at auschwitz but irving insisted on the logic of some of his past statements , such as saying the fact 100,000 people survived auschwitz was a sign the gas chambers did not exist , even if he now regretted the formulation . under questioning from prosecutor michael klackl , irving denied that his statement about the gas chambers was tantamount to denying the holocaust . " that was no holocaust denial , that was only -lrb- a statement -rrb- about a part of the -lrb- holocaust -rrb- history , " irving said . klackl later told reporters : " we know about david irving , that he always tries to arrange every evidence and find many reasons why you should take his argument in the right way . " irvi n g faced up to 10 years i n priso n irving , 67 , faced up to 10 years in jail under an austrian law that prosecutes those who " deny the genocide by the national socialists or other national socialist crimes against humanity . " the right-wing historian was arrested in november after a routine check on a highway in austria . the warrant for his arrest was issued by a vienna court in 1989 after he allegedly denied at meetings in austria that the nazi regime used gas chambers in concentration camps . irving was on trial for also saying that the november 1938 kristallnacht pogrom against the jews was not the work of the nazis but " unknown " people who had dressed up as storm troopers , and that adolf hitler had in fact protected the jews . ba n n ed from livi n g i n germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irving now says the nazis systematically murdered jews irving has become notorious worldwide for attempting to establish , despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary , that hitler was not party to the holocaust , that there were no gas chambers in auschwitz , and that the number of jews killed by the nazis was greatly exaggerated . he has been condemned by the courts several times , notably in britain and germany , and last year he was refused entry to new zealand .
he is reportedly also banned from residing in australia , canada , italy and south africa as well as germany . irving sparked widespread outrage with his book " hitler 's war " in 1977 , in which he claimed the nazi dictator did not know about the mass killings of jews until 1943 and that he never ordered the holocaust .
he carried a copy of that book when he entered court monday . in 2000 , he lost a high-profile libel case in london against us historian deborah lipstadt after she called him a holocaust denier . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany condemns proposed iranian holocaust conference the iranian government 's announcement that it plans to hold a conference on the holocaust with notorious deniers as guests has caused outrage in germany .

what will be the outcome ?
germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .
as high-level talks on monday failed to reach agreement , union leader frank bsirske settled in for a long haul . in all , it is the largest strike germany has seen in 14 years , with more than 30,000 civil servants - including trash collectors , kindergarten teachers , nurses and government officials - stopping work across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes among trash collectors has led to garbage hills like this one in lower saxony prior to a crucial high-level meeting between unions and public service representatives , key negotiators gave no clear signals that the talks would be fruitful .
state leaders have formed a united front in favor of increasing civil service work hours from 38.5 to 40 hours , while the union has said it is committed to preventing this .
at the head of services trade union ver.di is frank bsirske .
ver.di was created five years ago when five smaller unions joined forces , and bsirske 's gift has been the ability to unify his union 's various membership streams into a single , powerful organization .
at stake : a union 's reputation as the 54-year-old union organizer sees it , the current fight is about more than just jobs and money for its members .
it will decide whether germany 's approximately three million civil servants will have equal pay and working conditions on the local , state and federal level .
more importantly , the results of the strike show whether ver.di - one of the world 's largest trade unions - is capable of supporting its members in the face of opposition from public employers .
like virtually all german unions , ver.di has seen its membership rolls decline recently .
it is clear that the fight over the work week will be a decisive one for bsirske and the unions alike .
up to now , everything has gone well for the unions - the strike has enjoyed more than 50 percent approval among the public - but the honeymoon may not last .
if employers remain inflexible , goodwill may well begin to drop off .
' fight for prestige ' a loss for ver.di in this case could mean a reassessment of the value of unions in german society .
" ver.di is fighting for its prestige and its influence on the political stage , " berlin union researcher hans-peter müller told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di members took to the streets for bsirske , the battle will be a complex one ; the strikes are essentially defensive moves against the state and local governments , which are wrangling over details of wage agreements and work hours .
a defensive strike is unusual for germany 's civil servants , and it is a new experience for bsirske .
the last widespread work conflict , 14 years ago , saw some 400,000 workers hit the streets , and public services in the country suffered greatly .
as a result , when bsirske was coming up the union ranks , the mere threat of a strike was enough to bring parties to the table .
not afraid of conflict but bsirske does n't shy away from conflict .
as head of personnel for the city of hanover , he had to cut some 1,000 jobs . " as someone with three decades of union work , and who also had personnel responsibilities in a large organization , i not only learned how to communicate , but how to deal with conflict , " he said .
" but i think these abilities are expected in a union leader .
he needs to be able to find common solutions with employers , and when nothing else works , he has to be able to get into conflicts .
if the membership wants it . "
politics in the blood ?
bsirske studied political science , and even today he is a political person . the son of a volkswagen works council head , he joined the social democratic party at age 15 , and later represented the greens in hanover .
he is the only union leader who is a member of the greens . " i think a union that represents such a wide array of jobs and careers is well served by someone with a slightly unusual background , " he said . with so much riding on the outcome of the strikes , union members can only help bsirske is right . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german public sector strike expands germany 's public sector is facing large scale industrial action for the first time in more than a decade .

two districts of the state declared a state of emergency , a measure which allows the army to be deployed there if required . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german military specialists have begun disinfecting vehicles agriculture minister horst seehofer said ahead of a meeting with his eu counterparts in brussels that the army had been called in because it was important to find and collect the dead birds as soon as possible . scavenging birds feeding on the carcasses of infected animals could spread the virus further , he added .

" while the virus has infected chickens on the eu 's doorstep in ukraine , romania and bulgaria , the outbreaks in italy , france , greece , austria , germany and slovenia have only hit wild birds like swans and ducks . " there is no reason for european citizens not to consume poultry meat and poultry products , " eu health commissioner markos kyprianou added .

earlier , he had acknowledged that the auschwitz gas chambers had existed . during the one-day trial , irving had pleaded guilty to a charge from 1989 of denying the holocaust , which in austria is a crime , but said he no longer held that view . " i acknowledge my guilt on this charge , " he told judge peter liebetreu . irving said that he now realized his statement that " there were no gas chambers in auschwitz -lrb- was -rrb- false . " he had earlier told reporters upon entering the court in central vienna in handcuffs that it was " ridiculous for me to be standing here on trial for something i expressed 17 years ago . " i am not a holocaust denier , " he added .
" my views have changed .
history is a constantly growing tree . ...
the more documents are available , the more you learn , and i have learned a lot since 1989 . " asked about the holocaust , he said : " i would call it the jewish tragedy in world war ii " and that millions of jews had died . accurate research ? irving , whose handcuffs were removed as the trial began , insisted on the accuracy of his historical research as liebetreu bombarded him with questions about holocaust denials he had made in the past and what he thought now . the 67-year-old said he had changed his mind since 1989 after discovering documents , some of them from adolf eichmann who organized the nazi genocide of the jews , while on a trip to argentina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wreath lies on the tracks leading to the gas chamber and crematorium at auschwitz but irving insisted on the logic of some of his past statements , such as saying the fact 100,000 people survived auschwitz was a sign the gas chambers did not exist , even if he now regretted the formulation . under questioning from prosecutor michael klackl , irving denied that his statement about the gas chambers was tantamount to denying the holocaust . " that was no holocaust denial , that was only -lrb- a statement -rrb- about a part of the -lrb- holocaust -rrb- history , " irving said . klackl later told reporters : " we know about david irving , that he always tries to arrange every evidence and find many reasons why you should take his argument in the right way . " irvi n g faced up to 10 years i n priso n irving , 67 , faced up to 10 years in jail under an austrian law that prosecutes those who " deny the genocide by the national socialists or other national socialist crimes against humanity . " the right-wing historian was arrested in november after a routine check on a highway in austria . the warrant for his arrest was issued by a vienna court in 1989 after he allegedly denied at meetings in austria that the nazi regime used gas chambers in concentration camps . irving was on trial for also saying that the november 1938 kristallnacht pogrom against the jews was not the work of the nazis but " unknown " people who had dressed up as storm troopers , and that adolf hitler had in fact protected the jews . ba n n ed from livi n g i n germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irving now says the nazis systematically murdered jews irving has become notorious worldwide for attempting to establish , despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary , that hitler was not party to the holocaust , that there were no gas chambers in auschwitz , and that the number of jews killed by the nazis was greatly exaggerated . he has been condemned by the courts several times , notably in britain and germany , and last year he was refused entry to new zealand .
he is reportedly also banned from residing in australia , canada , italy and south africa as well as germany . irving sparked widespread outrage with his book " hitler 's war " in 1977 , in which he claimed the nazi dictator did not know about the mass killings of jews until 1943 and that he never ordered the holocaust .
he carried a copy of that book when he entered court monday . in 2000 , he lost a high-profile libel case in london against us historian deborah lipstadt after she called him a holocaust denier . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany condemns proposed iranian holocaust conference the iranian government 's announcement that it plans to hold a conference on the holocaust with notorious deniers as guests has caused outrage in germany .

what will be the outcome ?
germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .
as high-level talks on monday failed to reach agreement , union leader frank bsirske settled in for a long haul . in all , it is the largest strike germany has seen in 14 years , with more than 30,000 civil servants - including trash collectors , kindergarten teachers , nurses and government officials - stopping work across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes among trash collectors has led to garbage hills like this one in lower saxony prior to a crucial high-level meeting between unions and public service representatives , key negotiators gave no clear signals that the talks would be fruitful .
state leaders have formed a united front in favor of increasing civil service work hours from 38.5 to 40 hours , while the union has said it is committed to preventing this .
at the head of services trade union ver.di is frank bsirske .
ver.di was created five years ago when five smaller unions joined forces , and bsirske 's gift has been the ability to unify his union 's various membership streams into a single , powerful organization .
at stake : a union 's reputation as the 54-year-old union organizer sees it , the current fight is about more than just jobs and money for its members .
it will decide whether germany 's approximately three million civil servants will have equal pay and working conditions on the local , state and federal level .
more importantly , the results of the strike show whether ver.di - one of the world 's largest trade unions - is capable of supporting its members in the face of opposition from public employers .
like virtually all german unions , ver.di has seen its membership rolls decline recently .
it is clear that the fight over the work week will be a decisive one for bsirske and the unions alike .
up to now , everything has gone well for the unions - the strike has enjoyed more than 50 percent approval among the public - but the honeymoon may not last .
if employers remain inflexible , goodwill may well begin to drop off .
' fight for prestige ' a loss for ver.di in this case could mean a reassessment of the value of unions in german society .
" ver.di is fighting for its prestige and its influence on the political stage , " berlin union researcher hans-peter müller told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di members took to the streets for bsirske , the battle will be a complex one ; the strikes are essentially defensive moves against the state and local governments , which are wrangling over details of wage agreements and work hours .
a defensive strike is unusual for germany 's civil servants , and it is a new experience for bsirske .
the last widespread work conflict , 14 years ago , saw some 400,000 workers hit the streets , and public services in the country suffered greatly .
as a result , when bsirske was coming up the union ranks , the mere threat of a strike was enough to bring parties to the table .
not afraid of conflict but bsirske does n't shy away from conflict .
as head of personnel for the city of hanover , he had to cut some 1,000 jobs . " as someone with three decades of union work , and who also had personnel responsibilities in a large organization , i not only learned how to communicate , but how to deal with conflict , " he said .
" but i think these abilities are expected in a union leader .
he needs to be able to find common solutions with employers , and when nothing else works , he has to be able to get into conflicts .
if the membership wants it . "
politics in the blood ?

what will be the outcome ?
germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .
as high-level talks on monday failed to reach agreement , union leader frank bsirske settled in for a long haul . in all , it is the largest strike germany has seen in 14 years , with more than 30,000 civil servants - including trash collectors , kindergarten teachers , nurses and government officials - stopping work across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes among trash collectors has led to garbage hills like this one in lower saxony prior to a crucial high-level meeting between unions and public service representatives , key negotiators gave no clear signals that the talks would be fruitful .
state leaders have formed a united front in favor of increasing civil service work hours from 38.5 to 40 hours , while the union has said it is committed to preventing this .
at the head of services trade union ver.di is frank bsirske .
ver.di was created five years ago when five smaller unions joined forces , and bsirske 's gift has been the ability to unify his union 's various membership streams into a single , powerful organization .
at stake : a union 's reputation as the 54-year-old union organizer sees it , the current fight is about more than just jobs and money for its members .
it will decide whether germany 's approximately three million civil servants will have equal pay and working conditions on the local , state and federal level .
more importantly , the results of the strike show whether ver.di - one of the world 's largest trade unions - is capable of supporting its members in the face of opposition from public employers .
like virtually all german unions , ver.di has seen its membership rolls decline recently .
it is clear that the fight over the work week will be a decisive one for bsirske and the unions alike .
up to now , everything has gone well for the unions - the strike has enjoyed more than 50 percent approval among the public - but the honeymoon may not last .
if employers remain inflexible , goodwill may well begin to drop off .
' fight for prestige ' a loss for ver.di in this case could mean a reassessment of the value of unions in german society .
" ver.di is fighting for its prestige and its influence on the political stage , " berlin union researcher hans-peter müller told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di members took to the streets for bsirske , the battle will be a complex one ; the strikes are essentially defensive moves against the state and local governments , which are wrangling over details of wage agreements and work hours .
a defensive strike is unusual for germany 's civil servants , and it is a new experience for bsirske .
the last widespread work conflict , 14 years ago , saw some 400,000 workers hit the streets , and public services in the country suffered greatly .
as a result , when bsirske was coming up the union ranks , the mere threat of a strike was enough to bring parties to the table .
not afraid of conflict but bsirske does n't shy away from conflict .
as head of personnel for the city of hanover , he had to cut some 1,000 jobs . " as someone with three decades of union work , and who also had personnel responsibilities in a large organization , i not only learned how to communicate , but how to deal with conflict , " he said .
" but i think these abilities are expected in a union leader .
he needs to be able to find common solutions with employers , and when nothing else works , he has to be able to get into conflicts .
if the membership wants it . "
politics in the blood ?
bsirske studied political science , and even today he is a political person . the son of a volkswagen works council head , he joined the social democratic party at age 15 , and later represented the greens in hanover .
he is the only union leader who is a member of the greens . " i think a union that represents such a wide array of jobs and careers is well served by someone with a slightly unusual background , " he said . with so much riding on the outcome of the strikes , union members can only help bsirske is right . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german public sector strike expands germany 's public sector is facing large scale industrial action for the first time in more than a decade .

you 've lost a lot of people , " said manning .
" it 's difficult to find the right line to draw between your duties as a government for security and safeguarding liberty , but it is clearly an anomaly , and it needs to be dealt with . " the camp at guantanamo has some 500 inmates , most of whom have never been charged .
controversial since its establishment , it re-emerged into the international spotlight after a group of human rights experts commissioned to write a report on the camp said some practices at guantanamo were tantamount to torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general annan : camp closure sooner or later un secretary general kofi annan distanced the united nations from the report , which was commissioned by the un but carried out by independent human-rights experts .
at the same time , he clearly supported its message , saying that " sooner or later , " guantanamo would have to be closed . he added that he hoped a decision would be made quickly . " this is not a report from the un or the un secretary general , " annan clarified in a statement in new york . agreement on ' basic points ' he said he did n't agree with everything in the report .
" but the basic point - that one can not detain individuals in perpetuity , and that charges have to be brought against them and be given a chance to explain themselves , prosecuted , charged or released - i think is something that is common under any legal system . " according to annan , the us is walking a fine line with its guantanamo dealings .
" the basic premise is , we have to be particularly careful to keep a balance between effective anti-terror measures , and individual freedom and human rights , " he warned . lost balance this balance seems to have been lost in guantanamo , and the geneva conventions are not being respected .
therefore , he said , " i think sooner or later , guantanamo will need to be closed .
the us government has to decide this .
and i hope they do it as quickly as possible .

earlier , he had acknowledged that the auschwitz gas chambers had existed . during the one-day trial , irving had pleaded guilty to a charge from 1989 of denying the holocaust , which in austria is a crime , but said he no longer held that view . " i acknowledge my guilt on this charge , " he told judge peter liebetreu . irving said that he now realized his statement that " there were no gas chambers in auschwitz -lrb- was -rrb- false . " he had earlier told reporters upon entering the court in central vienna in handcuffs that it was " ridiculous for me to be standing here on trial for something i expressed 17 years ago . " i am not a holocaust denier , " he added .
" my views have changed .
history is a constantly growing tree . ...
the more documents are available , the more you learn , and i have learned a lot since 1989 . " asked about the holocaust , he said : " i would call it the jewish tragedy in world war ii " and that millions of jews had died . accurate research ? irving , whose handcuffs were removed as the trial began , insisted on the accuracy of his historical research as liebetreu bombarded him with questions about holocaust denials he had made in the past and what he thought now . the 67-year-old said he had changed his mind since 1989 after discovering documents , some of them from adolf eichmann who organized the nazi genocide of the jews , while on a trip to argentina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wreath lies on the tracks leading to the gas chamber and crematorium at auschwitz but irving insisted on the logic of some of his past statements , such as saying the fact 100,000 people survived auschwitz was a sign the gas chambers did not exist , even if he now regretted the formulation . under questioning from prosecutor michael klackl , irving denied that his statement about the gas chambers was tantamount to denying the holocaust . " that was no holocaust denial , that was only -lrb- a statement -rrb- about a part of the -lrb- holocaust -rrb- history , " irving said . klackl later told reporters : " we know about david irving , that he always tries to arrange every evidence and find many reasons why you should take his argument in the right way . " irvi n g faced up to 10 years i n priso n irving , 67 , faced up to 10 years in jail under an austrian law that prosecutes those who " deny the genocide by the national socialists or other national socialist crimes against humanity . " the right-wing historian was arrested in november after a routine check on a highway in austria . the warrant for his arrest was issued by a vienna court in 1989 after he allegedly denied at meetings in austria that the nazi regime used gas chambers in concentration camps . irving was on trial for also saying that the november 1938 kristallnacht pogrom against the jews was not the work of the nazis but " unknown " people who had dressed up as storm troopers , and that adolf hitler had in fact protected the jews . ba n n ed from livi n g i n germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irving now says the nazis systematically murdered jews irving has become notorious worldwide for attempting to establish , despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary , that hitler was not party to the holocaust , that there were no gas chambers in auschwitz , and that the number of jews killed by the nazis was greatly exaggerated . he has been condemned by the courts several times , notably in britain and germany , and last year he was refused entry to new zealand .
he is reportedly also banned from residing in australia , canada , italy and south africa as well as germany . irving sparked widespread outrage with his book " hitler 's war " in 1977 , in which he claimed the nazi dictator did not know about the mass killings of jews until 1943 and that he never ordered the holocaust .
he carried a copy of that book when he entered court monday . in 2000 , he lost a high-profile libel case in london against us historian deborah lipstadt after she called him a holocaust denier . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany condemns proposed iranian holocaust conference the iranian government 's announcement that it plans to hold a conference on the holocaust with notorious deniers as guests has caused outrage in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.02.2006 germans look to talks amid drawn-out strike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bsirske led the civil servants into battle .
what will be the outcome ?
germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .
as high-level talks on monday failed to reach agreement , union leader frank bsirske settled in for a long haul . in all , it is the largest strike germany has seen in 14 years , with more than 30,000 civil servants - including trash collectors , kindergarten teachers , nurses and government officials - stopping work across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes among trash collectors has led to garbage hills like this one in lower saxony prior to a crucial high-level meeting between unions and public service representatives , key negotiators gave no clear signals that the talks would be fruitful .
state leaders have formed a united front in favor of increasing civil service work hours from 38.5 to 40 hours , while the union has said it is committed to preventing this .
at the head of services trade union ver.di is frank bsirske .
ver.di was created five years ago when five smaller unions joined forces , and bsirske 's gift has been the ability to unify his union 's various membership streams into a single , powerful organization .
at stake : a union 's reputation as the 54-year-old union organizer sees it , the current fight is about more than just jobs and money for its members .
it will decide whether germany 's approximately three million civil servants will have equal pay and working conditions on the local , state and federal level .
more importantly , the results of the strike show whether ver.di - one of the world 's largest trade unions - is capable of supporting its members in the face of opposition from public employers .
like virtually all german unions , ver.di has seen its membership rolls decline recently .
it is clear that the fight over the work week will be a decisive one for bsirske and the unions alike .
up to now , everything has gone well for the unions - the strike has enjoyed more than 50 percent approval among the public - but the honeymoon may not last .
if employers remain inflexible , goodwill may well begin to drop off .
' fight for prestige ' a loss for ver.di in this case could mean a reassessment of the value of unions in german society .
" ver.di is fighting for its prestige and its influence on the political stage , " berlin union researcher hans-peter müller told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di members took to the streets for bsirske , the battle will be a complex one ; the strikes are essentially defensive moves against the state and local governments , which are wrangling over details of wage agreements and work hours .
a defensive strike is unusual for germany 's civil servants , and it is a new experience for bsirske .
the last widespread work conflict , 14 years ago , saw some 400,000 workers hit the streets , and public services in the country suffered greatly .
as a result , when bsirske was coming up the union ranks , the mere threat of a strike was enough to bring parties to the table .
not afraid of conflict but bsirske does n't shy away from conflict .
as head of personnel for the city of hanover , he had to cut some 1,000 jobs . " as someone with three decades of union work , and who also had personnel responsibilities in a large organization , i not only learned how to communicate , but how to deal with conflict , " he said .
" but i think these abilities are expected in a union leader .
he needs to be able to find common solutions with employers , and when nothing else works , he has to be able to get into conflicts .
if the membership wants it . "
politics in the blood ?
bsirske studied political science , and even today he is a political person . the son of a volkswagen works council head , he joined the social democratic party at age 15 , and later represented the greens in hanover .
he is the only union leader who is a member of the greens . " i think a union that represents such a wide array of jobs and careers is well served by someone with a slightly unusual background , " he said . with so much riding on the outcome of the strikes , union members can only help bsirske is right . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german public sector strike expands germany 's public sector is facing large scale industrial action for the first time in more than a decade .

earlier , he had acknowledged that the auschwitz gas chambers had existed . during the one-day trial , irving had pleaded guilty to a charge from 1989 of denying the holocaust , which in austria is a crime , but said he no longer held that view . " i acknowledge my guilt on this charge , " he told judge peter liebetreu . irving said that he now realized his statement that " there were no gas chambers in auschwitz -lrb- was -rrb- false . " he had earlier told reporters upon entering the court in central vienna in handcuffs that it was " ridiculous for me to be standing here on trial for something i expressed 17 years ago . " i am not a holocaust denier , " he added .

" asked about the holocaust , he said : " i would call it the jewish tragedy in world war ii " and that millions of jews had died . accurate research ? irving , whose handcuffs were removed as the trial began , insisted on the accuracy of his historical research as liebetreu bombarded him with questions about holocaust denials he had made in the past and what he thought now . the 67-year-old said he had changed his mind since 1989 after discovering documents , some of them from adolf eichmann who organized the nazi genocide of the jews , while on a trip to argentina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wreath lies on the tracks leading to the gas chamber and crematorium at auschwitz but irving insisted on the logic of some of his past statements , such as saying the fact 100,000 people survived auschwitz was a sign the gas chambers did not exist , even if he now regretted the formulation . under questioning from prosecutor michael klackl , irving denied that his statement about the gas chambers was tantamount to denying the holocaust . " that was no holocaust denial , that was only -lrb- a statement -rrb- about a part of the -lrb- holocaust -rrb- history , " irving said . klackl later told reporters : " we know about david irving , that he always tries to arrange every evidence and find many reasons why you should take his argument in the right way .

he is reportedly also banned from residing in australia , canada , italy and south africa as well as germany . irving sparked widespread outrage with his book " hitler 's war " in 1977 , in which he claimed the nazi dictator did not know about the mass killings of jews until 1943 and that he never ordered the holocaust .

in paris , a charity group linked to the far right is under fire for serving pork soup to the homeless .
critics say the government should ban the program as the choice of food discriminates against muslims and jews . every thursday night a handful of volunteers equipped with a trunk of hot food meet up in a poor district of paris to feed the needy .
they kick off with red wine served from a cask on the roof of a car , and an appetizer of dried sausage .
that is followed with bowls of steaming hot soup , traditionally known as a " repas gaulois " or gallic dinner , cheese and dessert . anne lucien-brun , a retiree , has been volunteering with the group , solidarity for the french -lrb- sdf -rrb- for the past year .
" i am here to serve soup to the homeless , to the people who are let down by our society , and to those who accept eating soup with pork in it , " she said .
although sdf has links to a fringe far-right political group , lucien-brun says that rather than being politically motivated , the work she does is about defending french traditions . " we are in france , in europe .
we cook with pork , we have soup with pork and we do n't see why our country should be banned from doing something that is our tradition , " lucien-brun said . calls for a ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pork belongs to the traditional french menu the government does n't actually prohibit pork dinners , but some city officials would like to see that happen .
paris city hall is managed by a coalition of socialists and greens who say the meals are discriminatory and xenophobic because they 're designed to exclude observant muslims who do n't eat pork . although the police say there 's no law against distributing soup to the homeless , they shut down weekly dinners twice in december on the grounds that they were creating a public disturbance .
the volunteers say such action amounts to police harassment and prevents them from providing a much-needed service to anyone who wants to take advantage of it . kalif kamaté , a homeless muslim from mali says he prefers not to eat pork , but that these days he ca n't afford to be choosy .
similar pork dinners have been organized in nice , nantes and strasbourg , where they were also banned for a time last month . using soup to spread a message ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beggars , they say , ca n't be choosers although they have since resumed , an anti-racism group is working to outlaw the initiative nationwide .
mouloud aounit is president of the " movement against racism and for friendship between people . "
he says the pork soup kitchens go against the very concept of solidarity . " these extremist groups are using the soup kitchen to spread their message of hate and contempt towards muslims .
we just ca n't accept this form of solidarity based on discrimination . " but the sdf volunteers insist that they do not discriminate , and that anyone can eat their soup .
kamaté confirms that to be true .
" at first i was told it was a private party .
then i asked the woman in charge and she allowed me to eat and drink with the others .
it really helped me out because i 'm homeless too and i face the same problems as the others . " safe environment one such other person is michel bewulf , a 37-year-old who has been living on the streets for two years , ever since he got divorced and lost his job .
he enjoys the thursday night four-course spread .
" i like to come here because it 's friendly .
it 's also very secure , " he said .
" people offer me jackets , trousers , socks , sometimes money and food . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standing in line for soup bewulf says other soup kitchens , where there are hundreds of people and not enough food , can be dangerous , and adds that some church groups proselytize while they serve .
by contrast , he says the volunteers at the gallic dinners do n't bring up their political ideas and few of those who show up for their weekly serving of pork soup seem to care about the controversy it has stirred .
ultimately they are just happy to be fed and to share a meal in a pleasant atmosphere , where they do n't have to fight for their food or be on their guard . helen seeney -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe chilled to the bone by arctic freeze sub-zero temperatures in europe claimed more victims and set energy consumption records wednesday as the killer chill spread its icy tendrils further across the continent .

9 , ernst zündel , a holocaust denier , faces a german court on charges of inciting racial hatred and defaming the dead .
the case shows that while germany guarantees freedom of expression , there are limits . according to prosecutors , ernst zündel is one of the " most active " holocaust deniers today .
he began distributing nazi and neo-nazi propaganda in the 1970s and has written several books praising adolf hitler and the nazi regime .
since 1995 , he has been associated with a web site that carries his name and is one of biggest online repositories of holocaust-denial propaganda . but zündel , who was born in germany 's black forest region , was only able to engage in such activities because he was living outside of his native county , in canada and the united states . although freedom of the press and of expression is written into german law , the country is generally more wary of free speech than the us , where zündel 's dissemination of racist literature and refutation of the holocaust - while distasteful to most - was perfectly legal . in germany , however , it was not .
zündel was deported to his native country in march 2005 after a long legal battle with the canadian government .
he found himself immediately under arrest and up against the german justice system .
if the 66-year-old is found guilty by a court in mannheim of incitement to racial hatred , libel and defamation of the memory of the dead , he faces up to five years in prison . constitutional rights and constraints article 5 of germany 's constitution , or basic law , enshrines the right of freedom of speech and of the press . " everyone has the right to freely express and disseminate their opinions orally , in writing or visually and to obtain information from generally accessible sources without hindrance , " states paragraph one of the law .
" freedom of the press and freedom of reporting through audiovisual media shall be guaranteed .
there shall be no censorship . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's " basic law " but the next paragraph puts certain limits on that freedom , which were deemed necessary when the basic law was proclaimed in 1949 , just four years after the end of world war ii and the downfall of the nazi dictatorship . " these rights are subject to limitations embodied in the provisions of general legislation , statutory provisions for the protection of young persons and the citizen 's right to personal respect , " reads the second paragraph . german law therefore constrains press freedom , said udo branahl , a professor of media law at the university of dortmund . " the penal law code says holocaust denial is a punishable offense , " he said .
" that ban limits press freedom and overrides the right to free expression in the mass media . " germany is not the only european country to make holocaust denial a crime .
france , italy and austria have similar statutes on the books . criminal abroad , tried in germany so while in the us and canada , zündel could freely present his " evidence " that the gas chambers and crematoria of the third reich did not exist , in germany , he was committing a crime that he would be tried for , even though it was not committed on german soil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german courts have considered the severity of holocaust in weighing free speech against individual rights the country 's federal constitutional court confirmed in 1994 that holocaust revisionism is not protected speech . " in weighing the importance of free speech against that of individual rights , courts must consider on the one hand the severity of the offense caused by holocaust denial to the jewish population in light of the suffering inflicted upon it by germany , " the court wrote at the time .
" this court has consistently protected the personal honor of those defamed above the right of others to make patently false statements . " in the united states , where a broader definition of the freedom of expression has traditionally been considered one of the country 's most foundations , this limitation on expression is often met with disapproval . " i disapprove of what you say , but i will defend to the death your right to say it , " goes a citation from voltaire that 's often quoted . " i 've spoken with a lot of americans , and they do n't understand us , " said wolfgang wippermann , a professor at the freie university in berlin who studies nazism and right-wing extremism .
" i tell them , ' in your country , drug dealers also go to prison ; these holocaust deniers are like drug dealers , but dealing in mental poison ' .

9 , ernst zündel , a holocaust denier , faces a german court on charges of inciting racial hatred and defaming the dead .
the case shows that while germany guarantees freedom of expression , there are limits . according to prosecutors , ernst zündel is one of the " most active " holocaust deniers today .
he began distributing nazi and neo-nazi propaganda in the 1970s and has written several books praising adolf hitler and the nazi regime .
since 1995 , he has been associated with a web site that carries his name and is one of biggest online repositories of holocaust-denial propaganda . but zündel , who was born in germany 's black forest region , was only able to engage in such activities because he was living outside of his native county , in canada and the united states . although freedom of the press and of expression is written into german law , the country is generally more wary of free speech than the us , where zündel 's dissemination of racist literature and refutation of the holocaust - while distasteful to most - was perfectly legal . in germany , however , it was not .
zündel was deported to his native country in march 2005 after a long legal battle with the canadian government .
he found himself immediately under arrest and up against the german justice system .
if the 66-year-old is found guilty by a court in mannheim of incitement to racial hatred , libel and defamation of the memory of the dead , he faces up to five years in prison . constitutional rights and constraints article 5 of germany 's constitution , or basic law , enshrines the right of freedom of speech and of the press . " everyone has the right to freely express and disseminate their opinions orally , in writing or visually and to obtain information from generally accessible sources without hindrance , " states paragraph one of the law .

" these rights are subject to limitations embodied in the provisions of general legislation , statutory provisions for the protection of young persons and the citizen 's right to personal respect , " reads the second paragraph . german law therefore constrains press freedom , said udo branahl , a professor of media law at the university of dortmund .

" in weighing the importance of free speech against that of individual rights , courts must consider on the one hand the severity of the offense caused by holocaust denial to the jewish population in light of the suffering inflicted upon it by germany , " the court wrote at the time .

meanwhile new cases of h5n1 infection in italy , france and india raise the threat of a global pandemic . deadly bird flu was detected for the first time on the german mainland , bringing the total number of cases in the country to 61 , animal health experts said sunday . the friedrich-löffler institute for animal health said two new cases of the h5n1 virus that can be fatal to humans were detected in a buzzard and a gull found dead in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-pomerania .
earlier sunday , 18 new cases of h5n1 were confirmed on the baltic island of rügen , also part of the state . german chancellor angela merkel on sunday surveyed measures taken to combat bird flu on rügen , as army disinfection experts deployed to curb the spread of the virus .
" the situation is serious , " she said after meeting with local crisis teams working to contain the outbreak . she said that if the situation worsened , " the federal government will be present with all the means at its disposal . " ministers rush to stem the wave of infection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture minister seehofer -lrb- left -rrb- and till backhaus face the press mecklenburg-pomerania 's agriculture minister , till backhaus , said the 18 new cases on rügen included swans , cormorants , geese and a buzzard .
he said the state would begin slaughtering domestic fowl including chickens and ducks sunday as a precaution to prevent a broader outbreak of the virus .
backhaus declined to say how many birds would be killed . meanwhile 19 bundeswehr army specialists were sent to rügen to disinfect vehicles and people who may have come in contact with the virus , a defense ministry spokesman said .
all vehicles and bicycles leaving the island had their tires decontaminated in special disinfectant baths .
pedestrians were told to have their shoes disinfected . the island is popular with tourists and has been inundated with reporters since the outbreak earlier this month , which experts said increased the risk of the virus being carried .
" the problem is that journalists get very close to the dead animals and also film the collection of cadavers , " the president of the friedrich löffler institute for animal health , thomas mettenleiter , said .
" then the camera teams go with their contaminated equipment and clothing directly where the birds are .
that is completely irresponsible and exactly what we have been trying to prevent . " germany has confirmed three cases of the highly pathogenic strain of the h5n1 virus and was awaiting confirmation of another 10 from a european union approved laboratory in england . emergency measures urged as lock-down takes hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is rushing to get enough tamiflu for 20 percent of the population health minister ulla schmidt called on germany 's 16 states to ensure that anti-viral medications such as tamiflu and relenza are available for 20 percent of the population . germany has begun enforcing an order to keep all poultry indoors , joining the netherlands , slovenia , denmark , france , greece , luxembourg and sweden in doing so . more infected birds were found in italy and france .
in india seven people were under observation with symptoms of the disease . in italy , the institute of animal health in the northeastern city of padua announced the virus had been detected in a total of 16 birds in the country . h5n1 was also confirmed in tuzla and navodari on the shores of the black sea in romania , bringing to 33 the number of sites where it has been found nationwide , a veterinary official said .
samples from the latest romanian cases were sent to the eu reference laboratory to establish whether it was the highly pathogenic form of the h5n1 virus . nearly 35,000 birds will be culled from monday morning in romania , a top official for the constanta region , danut culetu , told mediafax news agency france faces economic implications as bird flu arrives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 virsu was found in a dead wild duck prompting panic in france french authorities vowed to spare no effort in containing avian influenza after the country became the sixth in the european union , and the most westerly , to be hit by the virus . europe 's top producer and the world 's fourth-largest exporter of poultry , france confirmed that h5n1 had been identified in a wild duck found dead in the central-eastern ain region . french health minister xavier bertrand stressed that the dead duck was an isolated case , although food authorities said tests were continuing on some 15 birds found dead in various parts of the country . " there will be no financial or economic obstacle in preparing france in the face of these risks , " he said on europe 1 radio , as the country 's main farmers ' union called for more state help in tackling the threat . the plight of eu poultry producers , faced with plummeting sales , will be discussed by agriculture ministers monday .
sales are down by 70 percent in italy , 40 to 50 percent in greece and 15 percent in france . but in brussels officials held out little hope in the short term .
" we 're sympathetic but there is very little we , from the european budget , can actually do , " a european commission spokesman said . virus spreading through europe and beyond bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is putting up buffer zones but the virus knows no borders the other eu member states so far to have detected the h5n1 virus are austria , greece , and slovenia .
there have also been cases in bulgaria , croatia , ukraine and russia .
britain , too , said the risk of bird flu there was " more likely " following the french case . " it 's not inevitable , but it is clear , obviously , that it 's more likely than it was when it was further away , " agriculture minister ben bradshaw said . in india , seven people were under observation while up to half a million birds were being slaughtered sunday after the presence of h5n1 was confirmed .
but fears that the virus caused the death of a farmer in the western gujarat state proved unfounded . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german chancellor alarmed by bird flu chancellor angela merkel has expressed alarm over the rapid spread of bird fu on the baltic island of rügen .

what will be the outcome ?
germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .
as high-level talks on monday failed to reach agreement , union leader frank bsirske settled in for a long haul . in all , it is the largest strike germany has seen in 14 years , with more than 30,000 civil servants - including trash collectors , kindergarten teachers , nurses and government officials - stopping work across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes among trash collectors has led to garbage hills like this one in lower saxony prior to a crucial high-level meeting between unions and public service representatives , key negotiators gave no clear signals that the talks would be fruitful .
state leaders have formed a united front in favor of increasing civil service work hours from 38.5 to 40 hours , while the union has said it is committed to preventing this .
at the head of services trade union ver.di is frank bsirske .
ver.di was created five years ago when five smaller unions joined forces , and bsirske 's gift has been the ability to unify his union 's various membership streams into a single , powerful organization .
at stake : a union 's reputation as the 54-year-old union organizer sees it , the current fight is about more than just jobs and money for its members .
it will decide whether germany 's approximately three million civil servants will have equal pay and working conditions on the local , state and federal level .
more importantly , the results of the strike show whether ver.di - one of the world 's largest trade unions - is capable of supporting its members in the face of opposition from public employers .
like virtually all german unions , ver.di has seen its membership rolls decline recently .
it is clear that the fight over the work week will be a decisive one for bsirske and the unions alike .
up to now , everything has gone well for the unions - the strike has enjoyed more than 50 percent approval among the public - but the honeymoon may not last .
if employers remain inflexible , goodwill may well begin to drop off .
' fight for prestige ' a loss for ver.di in this case could mean a reassessment of the value of unions in german society .
" ver.di is fighting for its prestige and its influence on the political stage , " berlin union researcher hans-peter müller told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di members took to the streets for bsirske , the battle will be a complex one ; the strikes are essentially defensive moves against the state and local governments , which are wrangling over details of wage agreements and work hours .
a defensive strike is unusual for germany 's civil servants , and it is a new experience for bsirske .
the last widespread work conflict , 14 years ago , saw some 400,000 workers hit the streets , and public services in the country suffered greatly .
as a result , when bsirske was coming up the union ranks , the mere threat of a strike was enough to bring parties to the table .
not afraid of conflict but bsirske does n't shy away from conflict .
as head of personnel for the city of hanover , he had to cut some 1,000 jobs . " as someone with three decades of union work , and who also had personnel responsibilities in a large organization , i not only learned how to communicate , but how to deal with conflict , " he said .
" but i think these abilities are expected in a union leader .
he needs to be able to find common solutions with employers , and when nothing else works , he has to be able to get into conflicts .
if the membership wants it . "
politics in the blood ?
bsirske studied political science , and even today he is a political person . the son of a volkswagen works council head , he joined the social democratic party at age 15 , and later represented the greens in hanover .
he is the only union leader who is a member of the greens . " i think a union that represents such a wide array of jobs and careers is well served by someone with a slightly unusual background , " he said . with so much riding on the outcome of the strikes , union members can only help bsirske is right . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german public sector strike expands germany 's public sector is facing large scale industrial action for the first time in more than a decade .

meanwhile new cases of h5n1 infection in italy , france and india raise the threat of a global pandemic . deadly bird flu was detected for the first time on the german mainland , bringing the total number of cases in the country to 61 , animal health experts said sunday . the friedrich-löffler institute for animal health said two new cases of the h5n1 virus that can be fatal to humans were detected in a buzzard and a gull found dead in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-pomerania .
earlier sunday , 18 new cases of h5n1 were confirmed on the baltic island of rügen , also part of the state . german chancellor angela merkel on sunday surveyed measures taken to combat bird flu on rügen , as army disinfection experts deployed to curb the spread of the virus .
" the situation is serious , " she said after meeting with local crisis teams working to contain the outbreak . she said that if the situation worsened , " the federal government will be present with all the means at its disposal . " ministers rush to stem the wave of infection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture minister seehofer -lrb- left -rrb- and till backhaus face the press mecklenburg-pomerania 's agriculture minister , till backhaus , said the 18 new cases on rügen included swans , cormorants , geese and a buzzard .
he said the state would begin slaughtering domestic fowl including chickens and ducks sunday as a precaution to prevent a broader outbreak of the virus .
backhaus declined to say how many birds would be killed . meanwhile 19 bundeswehr army specialists were sent to rügen to disinfect vehicles and people who may have come in contact with the virus , a defense ministry spokesman said .
all vehicles and bicycles leaving the island had their tires decontaminated in special disinfectant baths .
pedestrians were told to have their shoes disinfected . the island is popular with tourists and has been inundated with reporters since the outbreak earlier this month , which experts said increased the risk of the virus being carried .
" the problem is that journalists get very close to the dead animals and also film the collection of cadavers , " the president of the friedrich löffler institute for animal health , thomas mettenleiter , said .
" then the camera teams go with their contaminated equipment and clothing directly where the birds are .
that is completely irresponsible and exactly what we have been trying to prevent . " germany has confirmed three cases of the highly pathogenic strain of the h5n1 virus and was awaiting confirmation of another 10 from a european union approved laboratory in england . emergency measures urged as lock-down takes hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is rushing to get enough tamiflu for 20 percent of the population health minister ulla schmidt called on germany 's 16 states to ensure that anti-viral medications such as tamiflu and relenza are available for 20 percent of the population . germany has begun enforcing an order to keep all poultry indoors , joining the netherlands , slovenia , denmark , france , greece , luxembourg and sweden in doing so . more infected birds were found in italy and france .
in india seven people were under observation with symptoms of the disease . in italy , the institute of animal health in the northeastern city of padua announced the virus had been detected in a total of 16 birds in the country . h5n1 was also confirmed in tuzla and navodari on the shores of the black sea in romania , bringing to 33 the number of sites where it has been found nationwide , a veterinary official said .
samples from the latest romanian cases were sent to the eu reference laboratory to establish whether it was the highly pathogenic form of the h5n1 virus . nearly 35,000 birds will be culled from monday morning in romania , a top official for the constanta region , danut culetu , told mediafax news agency france faces economic implications as bird flu arrives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 virsu was found in a dead wild duck prompting panic in france french authorities vowed to spare no effort in containing avian influenza after the country became the sixth in the european union , and the most westerly , to be hit by the virus . europe 's top producer and the world 's fourth-largest exporter of poultry , france confirmed that h5n1 had been identified in a wild duck found dead in the central-eastern ain region . french health minister xavier bertrand stressed that the dead duck was an isolated case , although food authorities said tests were continuing on some 15 birds found dead in various parts of the country . " there will be no financial or economic obstacle in preparing france in the face of these risks , " he said on europe 1 radio , as the country 's main farmers ' union called for more state help in tackling the threat . the plight of eu poultry producers , faced with plummeting sales , will be discussed by agriculture ministers monday .
sales are down by 70 percent in italy , 40 to 50 percent in greece and 15 percent in france . but in brussels officials held out little hope in the short term .
" we 're sympathetic but there is very little we , from the european budget , can actually do , " a european commission spokesman said . virus spreading through europe and beyond bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is putting up buffer zones but the virus knows no borders the other eu member states so far to have detected the h5n1 virus are austria , greece , and slovenia .
there have also been cases in bulgaria , croatia , ukraine and russia .
britain , too , said the risk of bird flu there was " more likely " following the french case . " it 's not inevitable , but it is clear , obviously , that it 's more likely than it was when it was further away , " agriculture minister ben bradshaw said . in india , seven people were under observation while up to half a million birds were being slaughtered sunday after the presence of h5n1 was confirmed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2006 modest beginning for kosovo talks expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to ethnic strife , kosovo is plagued by unemployment , corruption and poverty for the first time since the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian delegations will sit down together at the negotiating table .
the talks are bound to prove challenging for both sides . six and a half years after the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian representatives will meet for the first time in vienna on monday , feb .
20 , to discuss a key issue for both sides of the ethnic divide - decentralization and local self-government .
these talks are seen by many as a necessary prelude to the future talks on kosovo 's final status . " decentralization is a key question for kosovo , but especially for the minorities .
it will determine the competences of local self-government as well as the rights and responsibilities of the minorities , " said sören jessen-petersen , special representative of the un secretary general and head of the united nations mission in kosovo . " but one thing has to be clear : we 're talking about a decentralization , not partition of kosovo , " he said . international tug of war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un special envoy martti ahtisaari is aware of the difficulties that lie ahead the preparations for direct talks between serbian and kosovar delegations have been going on for months .
marti ahtisaari , the experienced finnish diplomat and un special envoy for the future status process for kosovo , is well aware that neither of the two parties has so far shown willingness to compromise . " this is a meeting , at which we 're starting from scratch by looking at the problems that need to be solved , " said ahtisaari . yet the position of the kosovo albanians , who are rooting for independence , is fundamentally incompatible with the position of the serbian government in belgrade , which insists that kosovo remains a part of serbia . " we insist on the formula : more than autonomy , less than independence , " said serbian foreign minister vuk draskovic . " that means two things : first of all , the protection of the serbian minority in kosovo and metohija and of the churches and monasteries in accordance with european standards .
and , secondly , preserving the current state border between serbia , albania and macedonia , " draskovic said . uncertain prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian foreign minister draskovic rejects the idea of a fully independent kosovo it is rather doubtful whether draskovic will be able to achieve his goal .
the legal position of the region is ambivalent .
in socialist yugoslavia , kosovo was - together with the northern province of vojvodina - an administrative exception . it was declared as an autonomous province of the republic of serbia , yet it had a special constitutional status within the federal state .
kosovo had the same institutions like the six federal republics of yugoslavia : a parliament of its own , a government with its own jurisdiction , as well as full representation in the central institutions of the federal state . serbian president slobodan milosevic abolished kosovo 's autonomy in 1989 and introduced a brutal police regime in the province , which consequently led to the break-up of yugoslavia .
slovenia and croatia declared independence under the pressure of milosevic 's violent repression in kosovo .
bosnia and herzegovina and macedonia followed the same path in 1991 . escalation of violence the kosovo parliament went underground after the province 's autonomy had been revoked .
by 1997 , the province was ruled in parallel by the serbian central government and the underground state dominated by ethnic albanians .
the kosovo albanians were led by ibrahim rugova , who hoped to lead the province to independence through non-violent resistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato cruise missiles and warplanes attacked yugoslavia on march 24 , 1999 but rugova was not able to control the escalation of violence .
his peaceful strategy failed in 1998 with the outbreak of an armed conflict between the growing kosovo liberation army -lrb- uck -rrb- and the serbian troops . with the experience of the horror that the wars in croatia and bosnia brought upon the balkans , nato forces intervened in march 1999 .
after three months of air strikes against serbia , milosevic was forced to sign the rambouillet accord and accept the presence of the nato peacekeeping troops in the region . the international community took account of kosovo 's complicated legal situation by pronouncing in the un-resolution 1244 that kosovo was a part of yugoslavia .
this resolution , which formed the basis of the rambouillet accord , however , did not make references to serbia . proponents of independence optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatmir sejdiu succeeded ibrahim rugova as kosovo 's president after the session of the un security council on feb .
14 , fatmir sejdiu , rugova 's successor as kosovo 's president , was optimistic that the international community would fulfil the wishes of the kosovar majority . " i welcome the engagement of all members of the security council . independence is a realistic option , which is also the will of the people of kosovo , " sejdiu said . these days , however , kosovo is not the only worry of the serbian government .
the union of serbia and montenegro , the last country to claim itself as a legal successor to yugoslavia , is on the verge of a break-up .
on feb .
25 , the montenegrin parliament will hold an extraordinary session about organizing a referendum on independence . if the parliament approves the referendum , it could take place as early as may 14 , in parallel to the elections in montenegro .
and if montenegro and serbia part their ways , it is hard to expect that the international community will force kosovo to be reunited with serbia . an impossible compromise ? the status of kosovo may therefore be decided by the international community against the wishes of belgrade .
it may additionally frustrate the serbian minority in kosovo , which grew increasingly concerned after the outbreak of ethnic violence in march 2004 , which - despite the presence of the international peacekeeping troops in the region - left 28 people killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , displaced from their homes . before the final status of kosovo is decided , the security council will insist that the minorities in kosovo , and especially the serbs , receive full and comprehensive minority rights and that they are represented in the country 's institutions .
the practical implementation and safeguarding of these rights could become the core of a conditional independence under international observation . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , un call for unity in kosovo after rugova 's death eu foreign policy chief javier solana called on the leaders of kosovo to show " unity and responsibility " following the death saturday of the province 's president , ibrahim rugova .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2006 modest beginning for kosovo talks expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to ethnic strife , kosovo is plagued by unemployment , corruption and poverty for the first time since the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian delegations will sit down together at the negotiating table .
the talks are bound to prove challenging for both sides . six and a half years after the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian representatives will meet for the first time in vienna on monday , feb .
20 , to discuss a key issue for both sides of the ethnic divide - decentralization and local self-government .
these talks are seen by many as a necessary prelude to the future talks on kosovo 's final status . " decentralization is a key question for kosovo , but especially for the minorities .
it will determine the competences of local self-government as well as the rights and responsibilities of the minorities , " said sören jessen-petersen , special representative of the un secretary general and head of the united nations mission in kosovo . " but one thing has to be clear : we 're talking about a decentralization , not partition of kosovo , " he said . international tug of war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un special envoy martti ahtisaari is aware of the difficulties that lie ahead the preparations for direct talks between serbian and kosovar delegations have been going on for months .
marti ahtisaari , the experienced finnish diplomat and un special envoy for the future status process for kosovo , is well aware that neither of the two parties has so far shown willingness to compromise . " this is a meeting , at which we 're starting from scratch by looking at the problems that need to be solved , " said ahtisaari . yet the position of the kosovo albanians , who are rooting for independence , is fundamentally incompatible with the position of the serbian government in belgrade , which insists that kosovo remains a part of serbia . " we insist on the formula : more than autonomy , less than independence , " said serbian foreign minister vuk draskovic . " that means two things : first of all , the protection of the serbian minority in kosovo and metohija and of the churches and monasteries in accordance with european standards .
and , secondly , preserving the current state border between serbia , albania and macedonia , " draskovic said . uncertain prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian foreign minister draskovic rejects the idea of a fully independent kosovo it is rather doubtful whether draskovic will be able to achieve his goal .
the legal position of the region is ambivalent .
in socialist yugoslavia , kosovo was - together with the northern province of vojvodina - an administrative exception . it was declared as an autonomous province of the republic of serbia , yet it had a special constitutional status within the federal state .
kosovo had the same institutions like the six federal republics of yugoslavia : a parliament of its own , a government with its own jurisdiction , as well as full representation in the central institutions of the federal state . serbian president slobodan milosevic abolished kosovo 's autonomy in 1989 and introduced a brutal police regime in the province , which consequently led to the break-up of yugoslavia .
slovenia and croatia declared independence under the pressure of milosevic 's violent repression in kosovo .
bosnia and herzegovina and macedonia followed the same path in 1991 . escalation of violence the kosovo parliament went underground after the province 's autonomy had been revoked .
by 1997 , the province was ruled in parallel by the serbian central government and the underground state dominated by ethnic albanians .
the kosovo albanians were led by ibrahim rugova , who hoped to lead the province to independence through non-violent resistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato cruise missiles and warplanes attacked yugoslavia on march 24 , 1999 but rugova was not able to control the escalation of violence .
his peaceful strategy failed in 1998 with the outbreak of an armed conflict between the growing kosovo liberation army -lrb- uck -rrb- and the serbian troops . with the experience of the horror that the wars in croatia and bosnia brought upon the balkans , nato forces intervened in march 1999 .
after three months of air strikes against serbia , milosevic was forced to sign the rambouillet accord and accept the presence of the nato peacekeeping troops in the region . the international community took account of kosovo 's complicated legal situation by pronouncing in the un-resolution 1244 that kosovo was a part of yugoslavia .
this resolution , which formed the basis of the rambouillet accord , however , did not make references to serbia . proponents of independence optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatmir sejdiu succeeded ibrahim rugova as kosovo 's president after the session of the un security council on feb .
14 , fatmir sejdiu , rugova 's successor as kosovo 's president , was optimistic that the international community would fulfil the wishes of the kosovar majority . " i welcome the engagement of all members of the security council . independence is a realistic option , which is also the will of the people of kosovo , " sejdiu said . these days , however , kosovo is not the only worry of the serbian government .
the union of serbia and montenegro , the last country to claim itself as a legal successor to yugoslavia , is on the verge of a break-up .
on feb .
25 , the montenegrin parliament will hold an extraordinary session about organizing a referendum on independence . if the parliament approves the referendum , it could take place as early as may 14 , in parallel to the elections in montenegro .
and if montenegro and serbia part their ways , it is hard to expect that the international community will force kosovo to be reunited with serbia . an impossible compromise ? the status of kosovo may therefore be decided by the international community against the wishes of belgrade .
it may additionally frustrate the serbian minority in kosovo , which grew increasingly concerned after the outbreak of ethnic violence in march 2004 , which - despite the presence of the international peacekeeping troops in the region - left 28 people killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , displaced from their homes . before the final status of kosovo is decided , the security council will insist that the minorities in kosovo , and especially the serbs , receive full and comprehensive minority rights and that they are represented in the country 's institutions .
the practical implementation and safeguarding of these rights could become the core of a conditional independence under international observation . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , un call for unity in kosovo after rugova 's death eu foreign policy chief javier solana called on the leaders of kosovo to show " unity and responsibility " following the death saturday of the province 's president , ibrahim rugova .

and , secondly , preserving the current state border between serbia , albania and macedonia , " draskovic said . uncertain prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian foreign minister draskovic rejects the idea of a fully independent kosovo it is rather doubtful whether draskovic will be able to achieve his goal .
the legal position of the region is ambivalent .
in socialist yugoslavia , kosovo was - together with the northern province of vojvodina - an administrative exception . it was declared as an autonomous province of the republic of serbia , yet it had a special constitutional status within the federal state .
kosovo had the same institutions like the six federal republics of yugoslavia : a parliament of its own , a government with its own jurisdiction , as well as full representation in the central institutions of the federal state . serbian president slobodan milosevic abolished kosovo 's autonomy in 1989 and introduced a brutal police regime in the province , which consequently led to the break-up of yugoslavia .
slovenia and croatia declared independence under the pressure of milosevic 's violent repression in kosovo .
bosnia and herzegovina and macedonia followed the same path in 1991 . escalation of violence the kosovo parliament went underground after the province 's autonomy had been revoked .
by 1997 , the province was ruled in parallel by the serbian central government and the underground state dominated by ethnic albanians .
the kosovo albanians were led by ibrahim rugova , who hoped to lead the province to independence through non-violent resistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato cruise missiles and warplanes attacked yugoslavia on march 24 , 1999 but rugova was not able to control the escalation of violence .
his peaceful strategy failed in 1998 with the outbreak of an armed conflict between the growing kosovo liberation army -lrb- uck -rrb- and the serbian troops . with the experience of the horror that the wars in croatia and bosnia brought upon the balkans , nato forces intervened in march 1999 .
after three months of air strikes against serbia , milosevic was forced to sign the rambouillet accord and accept the presence of the nato peacekeeping troops in the region . the international community took account of kosovo 's complicated legal situation by pronouncing in the un-resolution 1244 that kosovo was a part of yugoslavia .
this resolution , which formed the basis of the rambouillet accord , however , did not make references to serbia . proponents of independence optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatmir sejdiu succeeded ibrahim rugova as kosovo 's president after the session of the un security council on feb .
14 , fatmir sejdiu , rugova 's successor as kosovo 's president , was optimistic that the international community would fulfil the wishes of the kosovar majority . " i welcome the engagement of all members of the security council . independence is a realistic option , which is also the will of the people of kosovo , " sejdiu said . these days , however , kosovo is not the only worry of the serbian government .
the union of serbia and montenegro , the last country to claim itself as a legal successor to yugoslavia , is on the verge of a break-up .
on feb .
25 , the montenegrin parliament will hold an extraordinary session about organizing a referendum on independence . if the parliament approves the referendum , it could take place as early as may 14 , in parallel to the elections in montenegro .
and if montenegro and serbia part their ways , it is hard to expect that the international community will force kosovo to be reunited with serbia . an impossible compromise ? the status of kosovo may therefore be decided by the international community against the wishes of belgrade .
it may additionally frustrate the serbian minority in kosovo , which grew increasingly concerned after the outbreak of ethnic violence in march 2004 , which - despite the presence of the international peacekeeping troops in the region - left 28 people killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , displaced from their homes . before the final status of kosovo is decided , the security council will insist that the minorities in kosovo , and especially the serbs , receive full and comprehensive minority rights and that they are represented in the country 's institutions .
the practical implementation and safeguarding of these rights could become the core of a conditional independence under international observation . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , un call for unity in kosovo after rugova 's death eu foreign policy chief javier solana called on the leaders of kosovo to show " unity and responsibility " following the death saturday of the province 's president , ibrahim rugova .

what will be the outcome ?
germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .
as high-level talks on monday failed to reach agreement , union leader frank bsirske settled in for a long haul . in all , it is the largest strike germany has seen in 14 years , with more than 30,000 civil servants - including trash collectors , kindergarten teachers , nurses and government officials - stopping work across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes among trash collectors has led to garbage hills like this one in lower saxony prior to a crucial high-level meeting between unions and public service representatives , key negotiators gave no clear signals that the talks would be fruitful .
state leaders have formed a united front in favor of increasing civil service work hours from 38.5 to 40 hours , while the union has said it is committed to preventing this .
at the head of services trade union ver.di is frank bsirske .
ver.di was created five years ago when five smaller unions joined forces , and bsirske 's gift has been the ability to unify his union 's various membership streams into a single , powerful organization .
at stake : a union 's reputation as the 54-year-old union organizer sees it , the current fight is about more than just jobs and money for its members .
it will decide whether germany 's approximately three million civil servants will have equal pay and working conditions on the local , state and federal level .
more importantly , the results of the strike show whether ver.di - one of the world 's largest trade unions - is capable of supporting its members in the face of opposition from public employers .
like virtually all german unions , ver.di has seen its membership rolls decline recently .
it is clear that the fight over the work week will be a decisive one for bsirske and the unions alike .
up to now , everything has gone well for the unions - the strike has enjoyed more than 50 percent approval among the public - but the honeymoon may not last .
if employers remain inflexible , goodwill may well begin to drop off .
' fight for prestige ' a loss for ver.di in this case could mean a reassessment of the value of unions in german society .
" ver.di is fighting for its prestige and its influence on the political stage , " berlin union researcher hans-peter müller told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di members took to the streets for bsirske , the battle will be a complex one ; the strikes are essentially defensive moves against the state and local governments , which are wrangling over details of wage agreements and work hours .
a defensive strike is unusual for germany 's civil servants , and it is a new experience for bsirske .
the last widespread work conflict , 14 years ago , saw some 400,000 workers hit the streets , and public services in the country suffered greatly .
as a result , when bsirske was coming up the union ranks , the mere threat of a strike was enough to bring parties to the table .
not afraid of conflict but bsirske does n't shy away from conflict .
as head of personnel for the city of hanover , he had to cut some 1,000 jobs . " as someone with three decades of union work , and who also had personnel responsibilities in a large organization , i not only learned how to communicate , but how to deal with conflict , " he said .
" but i think these abilities are expected in a union leader .
he needs to be able to find common solutions with employers , and when nothing else works , he has to be able to get into conflicts .
if the membership wants it . "
politics in the blood ?
bsirske studied political science , and even today he is a political person . the son of a volkswagen works council head , he joined the social democratic party at age 15 , and later represented the greens in hanover .
he is the only union leader who is a member of the greens . " i think a union that represents such a wide array of jobs and careers is well served by someone with a slightly unusual background , " he said . with so much riding on the outcome of the strikes , union members can only help bsirske is right . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german public sector strike expands germany 's public sector is facing large scale industrial action for the first time in more than a decade .

what will be the outcome ?
germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .
as high-level talks on monday failed to reach agreement , union leader frank bsirske settled in for a long haul . in all , it is the largest strike germany has seen in 14 years , with more than 30,000 civil servants - including trash collectors , kindergarten teachers , nurses and government officials - stopping work across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes among trash collectors has led to garbage hills like this one in lower saxony prior to a crucial high-level meeting between unions and public service representatives , key negotiators gave no clear signals that the talks would be fruitful .
state leaders have formed a united front in favor of increasing civil service work hours from 38.5 to 40 hours , while the union has said it is committed to preventing this .
at the head of services trade union ver.di is frank bsirske .
ver.di was created five years ago when five smaller unions joined forces , and bsirske 's gift has been the ability to unify his union 's various membership streams into a single , powerful organization .
at stake : a union 's reputation as the 54-year-old union organizer sees it , the current fight is about more than just jobs and money for its members .
it will decide whether germany 's approximately three million civil servants will have equal pay and working conditions on the local , state and federal level .
more importantly , the results of the strike show whether ver.di - one of the world 's largest trade unions - is capable of supporting its members in the face of opposition from public employers .
like virtually all german unions , ver.di has seen its membership rolls decline recently .
it is clear that the fight over the work week will be a decisive one for bsirske and the unions alike .
up to now , everything has gone well for the unions - the strike has enjoyed more than 50 percent approval among the public - but the honeymoon may not last .
if employers remain inflexible , goodwill may well begin to drop off .
' fight for prestige ' a loss for ver.di in this case could mean a reassessment of the value of unions in german society .
" ver.di is fighting for its prestige and its influence on the political stage , " berlin union researcher hans-peter müller told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di members took to the streets for bsirske , the battle will be a complex one ; the strikes are essentially defensive moves against the state and local governments , which are wrangling over details of wage agreements and work hours .
a defensive strike is unusual for germany 's civil servants , and it is a new experience for bsirske .
the last widespread work conflict , 14 years ago , saw some 400,000 workers hit the streets , and public services in the country suffered greatly .
as a result , when bsirske was coming up the union ranks , the mere threat of a strike was enough to bring parties to the table .
not afraid of conflict but bsirske does n't shy away from conflict .
as head of personnel for the city of hanover , he had to cut some 1,000 jobs . " as someone with three decades of union work , and who also had personnel responsibilities in a large organization , i not only learned how to communicate , but how to deal with conflict , " he said .

in paris , a charity group linked to the far right is under fire for serving pork soup to the homeless .
critics say the government should ban the program as the choice of food discriminates against muslims and jews . every thursday night a handful of volunteers equipped with a trunk of hot food meet up in a poor district of paris to feed the needy .
they kick off with red wine served from a cask on the roof of a car , and an appetizer of dried sausage .
that is followed with bowls of steaming hot soup , traditionally known as a " repas gaulois " or gallic dinner , cheese and dessert . anne lucien-brun , a retiree , has been volunteering with the group , solidarity for the french -lrb- sdf -rrb- for the past year .
" i am here to serve soup to the homeless , to the people who are let down by our society , and to those who accept eating soup with pork in it , " she said .
although sdf has links to a fringe far-right political group , lucien-brun says that rather than being politically motivated , the work she does is about defending french traditions . " we are in france , in europe .
we cook with pork , we have soup with pork and we do n't see why our country should be banned from doing something that is our tradition , " lucien-brun said . calls for a ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pork belongs to the traditional french menu the government does n't actually prohibit pork dinners , but some city officials would like to see that happen .
paris city hall is managed by a coalition of socialists and greens who say the meals are discriminatory and xenophobic because they 're designed to exclude observant muslims who do n't eat pork . although the police say there 's no law against distributing soup to the homeless , they shut down weekly dinners twice in december on the grounds that they were creating a public disturbance .
the volunteers say such action amounts to police harassment and prevents them from providing a much-needed service to anyone who wants to take advantage of it . kalif kamaté , a homeless muslim from mali says he prefers not to eat pork , but that these days he ca n't afford to be choosy .

he says the pork soup kitchens go against the very concept of solidarity . " these extremist groups are using the soup kitchen to spread their message of hate and contempt towards muslims .
we just ca n't accept this form of solidarity based on discrimination . " but the sdf volunteers insist that they do not discriminate , and that anyone can eat their soup .
kamaté confirms that to be true .

in paris , a charity group linked to the far right is under fire for serving pork soup to the homeless .
critics say the government should ban the program as the choice of food discriminates against muslims and jews . every thursday night a handful of volunteers equipped with a trunk of hot food meet up in a poor district of paris to feed the needy .
they kick off with red wine served from a cask on the roof of a car , and an appetizer of dried sausage .
that is followed with bowls of steaming hot soup , traditionally known as a " repas gaulois " or gallic dinner , cheese and dessert . anne lucien-brun , a retiree , has been volunteering with the group , solidarity for the french -lrb- sdf -rrb- for the past year .
" i am here to serve soup to the homeless , to the people who are let down by our society , and to those who accept eating soup with pork in it , " she said .
although sdf has links to a fringe far-right political group , lucien-brun says that rather than being politically motivated , the work she does is about defending french traditions . " we are in france , in europe .
we cook with pork , we have soup with pork and we do n't see why our country should be banned from doing something that is our tradition , " lucien-brun said . calls for a ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pork belongs to the traditional french menu the government does n't actually prohibit pork dinners , but some city officials would like to see that happen .
paris city hall is managed by a coalition of socialists and greens who say the meals are discriminatory and xenophobic because they 're designed to exclude observant muslims who do n't eat pork . although the police say there 's no law against distributing soup to the homeless , they shut down weekly dinners twice in december on the grounds that they were creating a public disturbance .
the volunteers say such action amounts to police harassment and prevents them from providing a much-needed service to anyone who wants to take advantage of it . kalif kamaté , a homeless muslim from mali says he prefers not to eat pork , but that these days he ca n't afford to be choosy .

he says the pork soup kitchens go against the very concept of solidarity . " these extremist groups are using the soup kitchen to spread their message of hate and contempt towards muslims .
we just ca n't accept this form of solidarity based on discrimination . " but the sdf volunteers insist that they do not discriminate , and that anyone can eat their soup .
kamaté confirms that to be true .

earlier , he had acknowledged that the auschwitz gas chambers had existed . during the one-day trial , irving had pleaded guilty to a charge from 1989 of denying the holocaust , which in austria is a crime , but said he no longer held that view . " i acknowledge my guilt on this charge , " he told judge peter liebetreu . irving said that he now realized his statement that " there were no gas chambers in auschwitz -lrb- was -rrb- false . " he had earlier told reporters upon entering the court in central vienna in handcuffs that it was " ridiculous for me to be standing here on trial for something i expressed 17 years ago . " i am not a holocaust denier , " he added .
" my views have changed .
history is a constantly growing tree . ...
the more documents are available , the more you learn , and i have learned a lot since 1989 . " asked about the holocaust , he said : " i would call it the jewish tragedy in world war ii " and that millions of jews had died . accurate research ? irving , whose handcuffs were removed as the trial began , insisted on the accuracy of his historical research as liebetreu bombarded him with questions about holocaust denials he had made in the past and what he thought now . the 67-year-old said he had changed his mind since 1989 after discovering documents , some of them from adolf eichmann who organized the nazi genocide of the jews , while on a trip to argentina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wreath lies on the tracks leading to the gas chamber and crematorium at auschwitz but irving insisted on the logic of some of his past statements , such as saying the fact 100,000 people survived auschwitz was a sign the gas chambers did not exist , even if he now regretted the formulation . under questioning from prosecutor michael klackl , irving denied that his statement about the gas chambers was tantamount to denying the holocaust . " that was no holocaust denial , that was only -lrb- a statement -rrb- about a part of the -lrb- holocaust -rrb- history , " irving said . klackl later told reporters : " we know about david irving , that he always tries to arrange every evidence and find many reasons why you should take his argument in the right way . " irvi n g faced up to 10 years i n priso n irving , 67 , faced up to 10 years in jail under an austrian law that prosecutes those who " deny the genocide by the national socialists or other national socialist crimes against humanity . " the right-wing historian was arrested in november after a routine check on a highway in austria . the warrant for his arrest was issued by a vienna court in 1989 after he allegedly denied at meetings in austria that the nazi regime used gas chambers in concentration camps . irving was on trial for also saying that the november 1938 kristallnacht pogrom against the jews was not the work of the nazis but " unknown " people who had dressed up as storm troopers , and that adolf hitler had in fact protected the jews . ba n n ed from livi n g i n germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irving now says the nazis systematically murdered jews irving has become notorious worldwide for attempting to establish , despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary , that hitler was not party to the holocaust , that there were no gas chambers in auschwitz , and that the number of jews killed by the nazis was greatly exaggerated . he has been condemned by the courts several times , notably in britain and germany , and last year he was refused entry to new zealand .
he is reportedly also banned from residing in australia , canada , italy and south africa as well as germany . irving sparked widespread outrage with his book " hitler 's war " in 1977 , in which he claimed the nazi dictator did not know about the mass killings of jews until 1943 and that he never ordered the holocaust .
he carried a copy of that book when he entered court monday . in 2000 , he lost a high-profile libel case in london against us historian deborah lipstadt after she called him a holocaust denier . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany condemns proposed iranian holocaust conference the iranian government 's announcement that it plans to hold a conference on the holocaust with notorious deniers as guests has caused outrage in germany .

earlier , he had acknowledged that the auschwitz gas chambers had existed . during the one-day trial , irving had pleaded guilty to a charge from 1989 of denying the holocaust , which in austria is a crime , but said he no longer held that view . " i acknowledge my guilt on this charge , " he told judge peter liebetreu . irving said that he now realized his statement that " there were no gas chambers in auschwitz -lrb- was -rrb- false . " he had earlier told reporters upon entering the court in central vienna in handcuffs that it was " ridiculous for me to be standing here on trial for something i expressed 17 years ago . " i am not a holocaust denier , " he added .
" my views have changed .

meanwhile new cases of h5n1 infection in italy , france and india raise the threat of a global pandemic . deadly bird flu was detected for the first time on the german mainland , bringing the total number of cases in the country to 61 , animal health experts said sunday . the friedrich-löffler institute for animal health said two new cases of the h5n1 virus that can be fatal to humans were detected in a buzzard and a gull found dead in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-pomerania .
earlier sunday , 18 new cases of h5n1 were confirmed on the baltic island of rügen , also part of the state . german chancellor angela merkel on sunday surveyed measures taken to combat bird flu on rügen , as army disinfection experts deployed to curb the spread of the virus .
" the situation is serious , " she said after meeting with local crisis teams working to contain the outbreak . she said that if the situation worsened , " the federal government will be present with all the means at its disposal . " ministers rush to stem the wave of infection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture minister seehofer -lrb- left -rrb- and till backhaus face the press mecklenburg-pomerania 's agriculture minister , till backhaus , said the 18 new cases on rügen included swans , cormorants , geese and a buzzard .
he said the state would begin slaughtering domestic fowl including chickens and ducks sunday as a precaution to prevent a broader outbreak of the virus .
backhaus declined to say how many birds would be killed . meanwhile 19 bundeswehr army specialists were sent to rügen to disinfect vehicles and people who may have come in contact with the virus , a defense ministry spokesman said .
all vehicles and bicycles leaving the island had their tires decontaminated in special disinfectant baths .
pedestrians were told to have their shoes disinfected . the island is popular with tourists and has been inundated with reporters since the outbreak earlier this month , which experts said increased the risk of the virus being carried .
" the problem is that journalists get very close to the dead animals and also film the collection of cadavers , " the president of the friedrich löffler institute for animal health , thomas mettenleiter , said .
" then the camera teams go with their contaminated equipment and clothing directly where the birds are .
that is completely irresponsible and exactly what we have been trying to prevent .

in india seven people were under observation with symptoms of the disease . in italy , the institute of animal health in the northeastern city of padua announced the virus had been detected in a total of 16 birds in the country . h5n1 was also confirmed in tuzla and navodari on the shores of the black sea in romania , bringing to 33 the number of sites where it has been found nationwide , a veterinary official said .

" there will be no financial or economic obstacle in preparing france in the face of these risks , " he said on europe 1 radio , as the country 's main farmers ' union called for more state help in tackling the threat . the plight of eu poultry producers , faced with plummeting sales , will be discussed by agriculture ministers monday .
sales are down by 70 percent in italy , 40 to 50 percent in greece and 15 percent in france . but in brussels officials held out little hope in the short term .
" we 're sympathetic but there is very little we , from the european budget , can actually do , " a european commission spokesman said . virus spreading through europe and beyond bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is putting up buffer zones but the virus knows no borders the other eu member states so far to have detected the h5n1 virus are austria , greece , and slovenia .
there have also been cases in bulgaria , croatia , ukraine and russia .
britain , too , said the risk of bird flu there was " more likely " following the french case . " it 's not inevitable , but it is clear , obviously , that it 's more likely than it was when it was further away , " agriculture minister ben bradshaw said . in india , seven people were under observation while up to half a million birds were being slaughtered sunday after the presence of h5n1 was confirmed .

carwyn jones said : " we now have a system in place to deal with an outbreak should it happen in future . "
more than 360,000 animals were slaughtered in wales in the outbreak .
but the farmers union of wales president at the time of the crisis said he was still feared government would take too long to react .
vaccination was probably one of the most contentious issues during the outbreak and there are still differing views on the subject .
emergency vaccination is now part of the contingency plan to deal with any future outbreak and teams should be ready to vaccinate on day five of any outbreak .
former mep eurig wyn , who co-ordinated the european parliament 's investigation into the epidemic , said vaccination should take place rather than " contiguous culling " if there was another outbreak .
he added : " we do n't want these massive pyres throughout the country again .
legislation must be applied stringently . "
bob parry wants quicker action with any future outbreak but vet meurig evans is adamant that vaccination would not have worked five years ago .
" we were stretched with the manpower to control the disease as it was , " he said .
" i do n't where the staff or the manpower would have come to be able to vaccinate .
it was a matter of staying ahead of disease all the time . "
the power to deal with animal health has now been devolved to the assembly and wales has its own contingency plan .
responsibility but former farmers ' union of wales leader bob parry still has his doubts as to how a future outbreak could be handled .
" i still believe the assembly and the ministry would take too long in reacting , " he said .
" whatever is going to happen in the future i believe that if there is another case of foot-and-mouth those animals , whether they be suspect or positive , should be slaughtered within 24 hours . "
but mr jones , the welsh environment and countryside minister , is confident that any further outbreak would be dealt with effectively .
more than 360,000 animals were slaughtered in wales he said : " we argue that it was dealt with effectively five years ago .
we got rid of it pretty quickly - more quickly than we did in 1967 .
" but of course we learn from these things .
we now have a system in place to deal with an outbreak should it happen in future . "
he also believes that devolving the power to the assembly was an important step forward .
" it makes an enormous difference because the situation we had was that the ministry of agriculture -lsb- maff -rsb- was responsible for dealing with the outbreak and they had no staff in wales to deal with it .
" they had to use assembly staff and that meant it was unclear - particularly to farmers - who was responsible , whether it was the assembly or maff .
now it 's the assembly which has the responsibility . "

gyllenhaal 's performance in ang lee 's gay cowboy film brokeback mountain , which has earned him the best supporting actor award , has given him the best reviews of his career .
the actor , whose first role in a major film was a child part in 1991 cowboy comedy city slickers , has been praised along with screen lover heath ledger .
the guardian newspaper said the film showed how gyllenhaal had " matured into one of the most charismatic actors of his generation " .
meanwhile , us rock magazine rolling stone called the pair 's performances " a triumph " .
brokeback mountain is among the frontrunners for the award season .
it has garnered eight oscar nominations and secured the best film win at the bafta awards .
film background gyllenhaal first made a name in the 2001 cult hit donnie darko , in which he played a troubled teenager visited by a giant rabbit , which warns him of the end of the world .

clouds of thick black smoke and the pungent smell of disinfectant became part and parcel of everyday life .
there was a ban on the movement of animals and livestock markets were closed and so were public foot paths .
five years on and some of the memories are still very raw .
the first case in wales was at the welsh country foods abattoir in gaerwen on anglesey .
local vet meurig evans contacted the authorities after examining a lame lamb which had travelled from yorkshire .
" there was part of me which hoped i was wrong because i did n't want foot-and-mouth on my doorstep .
but there was also a part of me which hoped i was right because i did n't want to cause a fuss unnecessarily . "
they can see my bank statements , foot and mouth was a huge loss to me - i 'm still not back where i was before the outbreak farmer alun roberts it took a couple of days for the case to be confirmed and during that time fears that foot-and-mouth had come to wales were rising .
bob parry , who was president of the farmers ' union of wales at the time , was getting off a plane in brussels when he heard .
he recalls : " there was a phone call asking me whether i knew where the suspect case of foot-and-mouth on anglesey was .
later on that evening i found out it was in gaerwen - just a few miles from my home farm . "
within a week there was another case on anglesey - this time at bodlew farm , llanddaniel .
alun roberts had a sick heifer , who was frothing at the mouth .
foot-and-mouth was confirmed and 300 of his cattle and 900 sheep had to be destroyed .
" i 've had a few knocks in my life but my father used to say as long as the problem is outside you 're lucky - and of course foot-and-mouth struck outside not inside the house .
" but i knew i had to be an example to others . "
mr roberts added : " i did n't want anyone saying that i was to blame for the spread of the disease so when it was confirmed i decided we had to slaughter as soon as possible . "
foot and mouth crisis plan main differences if there was another outbreak of foot-and- mouth no mass pyres : incineration would be the first option although farm pyres could not be ruled out immediate ban on movement of animals : in 2001 there was a three-day gap between the confirmation of the first case and the ban coming into force contingency plans to be regularly up-dated : poor communications and cumbersome decision making process was criticised by independent inquiries following the 2001 outbreak emergency vaccination to be considered as part of the policy to combat the disease although animals on the infected farm would still have to be culled vet meurig evans also remembers it was a very busy time .
" we just had to keep going every day from dawn until dusk - in an effort to keep ahead of the disease , " he said .
critics say that some farmers were over-compensated for their losses but mr roberts refutes that claim .
" they can see my bank statements .
foot-and-mouth was a huge loss to me - i 'm still not back where i was before the outbreak . "
his sentiments are echoed by eurwyn edwards , director of the glynllifon agricultural college near caernarfon .
" what you need to remember is that farmers may have taken 20 or 30 years to build up their dairy herds for example - there is no price on that kind of loss .
and it 's not only the animals they lost - but their produce for months afterwards . "
mr roberts did not contemplate the idea of turning his back on farming - but accepts that family and community support carried him through the difficult months .
" i did n't leave the farm for two months during that period .
but i 'm fortunate that i 'm part of a very big family - and i have many good friends .
it would have been difficult to pull through without them , " he said .

the deal with airbus , which is 80 % owned by the european defence group eads and 20 % by the uk 's bae systems , comes after three years of talks .
the agreement marks the first purchase of new planes by indian for 15 years .
the carrier , formerly known as indian airlines , flies mainly domestic routes .
from a former monopoly position , its domestic market share has slid to 33 % .
' great achievement ' indian has fallen behind privately-run jet airways , which has 43 % market share and regularly wins awards for good service and food .
the deal between indian and airbus will be formally signed by french president jacques chirac and india 's prime minister manmohan singh , who were meeting in delhi on monday .
indian will purchase airbus a320 and a319 planes .
noel forgeard , chief executive of eads which owns 80 % or airbus , described the agreement as " a great achievement " which had come to a " happy conclusion today " .
a hold-up in talks last september was only cleared after airbus lowered its price by around $ 75m , the indian government said last september .

but this battle will have a commercial , and not sporting , outcome .
the london olympics bill is designed to curb the advertising phenomenon known as ambush marketing before the summer games take place in the capital in 2012 .
the bill is wending its way through parliament as the government and the british olympic association -lrb- boa -rrb- seek to ensure that sponsors get full value for money .
the boa says the bill is needed to protect the integrity of its sponsorship deals , but the uk advertising industry says the proposed act 's strictures are draconian and that business may suffer .
it wants proposals on the restriction of certain words surrounding the games amended .
getting ' connected ' depending on your standpoint , ambush marketing is either clever and inventive advertising , or a means of cunningly reaping the benefits of a major sporting event - without paying any official sponsorship monies . "
well thought-out attempts to ride on the back , and goodwill , of an event can be potentially damaging to sponsorship agreements " sara friend , british olympic association dictionaries describe it as a strategy whereby brands attach themselves to major sporting events without paying sponsorship fees , while at the same time creating a sense that they are somehow connected to the tournament .
previous examples have included campaigns by sportswear maker nike at both olympic and world cup events , and by beer-makers trying to intrude on legitimate sponsor territory by getting branded items into stadiums .
in germany , the venue for this year 's football world cup , firms outside the official 15 fifa partners and six suppliers are using ploys to associate themselves in the public mind with the event .
aircraft ' ambassadors ' national airline lufthansa has put football decals on the nosecones of 40 of its aircraft .
to the casual viewer it may seem the airline is an official sponsor of world cup 2006 , but emirates is in fact the official airline of the fifa tournament .
" the lufthansa aircraft with the football nose will act as football 's ambassadors inviting all to enjoy their stay here , " says lufthansa , associating itself with the tournament but avoiding any official connection .
and electrical retailer mediamarkt is proclaiming we will be the champions -lrb- wir wollen den titel -rrb- , and that it provides a " gold " service on prices .
however , if the uk government and british olympic association get their way , expressions such as gold could be forbidden for advertisers when the games come to london .
the government is aware of the boost the games could give the uk economy and is doing everything to ensure big sponsors will be attracted and not have their rights packages diluted by the ambushers .
hence the current bill , which makes a list of olympic-related words and images prohibited for use by non-sponsors .
forbidden words existing legislation already prohibits the use of distinctive " marks " like the olympic rings , but now words like gold , silver and bronze could be on the banned list .
the proposed new legislation covers goods , packaging , advertising and other unauthorised uses .
the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- has an olympics partners programme , which gives big names like coca-cola , mcdonalds and visa exclusive marketing rights .
proposed protection the words olympic , olympiad and olympian olympic rings , team gb and british olympic association logo words london 2012 , london 's bid logo and derivatives of london2012.com the 2012 games logo and mascots -lrb- not designed yet -rrb- olympic motto citius , altius , fortius / faster , higher , stronger the british paralympic association and team logos other banned words may soon include games , medals , gold , silver , bronze , 2012 , sponsor , summer the london organising committee estimates up to 40 % of its operating budget will come from sponsorship , hence the determination to tackle anything that might diminish sponsor revenues .
one tactic used in the past by ambushers - strategically-placed billboards near stadiums - has been tackled by the london organisers securing first rights on nearly all major city boards at the time of the games .
british olympic association lawyer sara friend says : " ambush marketing should be seen as working against the interests of official rights package holders .
" we acknowledge there has to be a balance between the interest of sponsors and rights holders , and in allowing clever and creative advertising and marketing .
" but the boa is not government funded and money for funding comes either through the ioc 's partner programmes , or our own domestic sponsor programmes .
" therefore we need to protect the rights that partners receive for backing team gb .
and it is incredibly important to protect the team gb identity . "
she said that at major events run by global bodies like the ioc , fifa , and cricket 's icc , it was not unreasonable for host nations to put in place " legislative protection " .
" we have no problems with creative advertising - but well thought-out attempts to ride on the back , and goodwill , of an event can be potentially damaging to sponsorship agreements . "
' too far ' but christopher hackford , legal manager at the institute of practitioners in advertising , says : " sponsorship should be protected , but we think the existing law in the uk is sufficient to protect sponsors .
" there are already safeguards covering copyright , trademarks , passing-off , and misleading advertising , as well as the olympic symbols protection act .
" the olympics bill takes this protection potentially too far . "
the ipa has written to all 646 members of parliament to advise them of its concern , and says the proposed new law is " too broad and disproportionate " .
" the position is clearly an unfair limitation of commercial expression , " mr hackford says .
" such radical and disproportionate legislation does not benefit anyone , it gives unparalleled power to event holders , which pushes up the price of sponsorship and prevents ordinary smaller businesses from benefiting at all from major national events . "

but this battle will have a commercial , and not sporting , outcome .
the london olympics bill is designed to curb the advertising phenomenon known as ambush marketing before the summer games take place in the capital in 2012 .
the bill is wending its way through parliament as the government and the british olympic association -lrb- boa -rrb- seek to ensure that sponsors get full value for money .
the boa says the bill is needed to protect the integrity of its sponsorship deals , but the uk advertising industry says the proposed act 's strictures are draconian and that business may suffer .
it wants proposals on the restriction of certain words surrounding the games amended .
getting ' connected ' depending on your standpoint , ambush marketing is either clever and inventive advertising , or a means of cunningly reaping the benefits of a major sporting event - without paying any official sponsorship monies .
well thought-out attempts to ride on the back , and goodwill , of an event can be potentially damaging to sponsorship agreements sara friend , british olympic association dictionaries describe it as a strategy whereby brands attach themselves to major sporting events without paying sponsorship fees , while at the same time creating a sense that they are somehow connected to the tournament .
previous examples have included campaigns by sportswear maker nike at both olympic and world cup events , and by beer-makers trying to intrude on legitimate sponsor territory by getting branded items into stadiums .
in germany , the venue for this year 's football world cup , firms outside the official 15 fifa partners and six suppliers are using ploys to associate themselves in the public mind with the event .
aircraft ' ambassadors ' national airline lufthansa has put football decals on the nosecones of 40 of its aircraft .
to the casual viewer it may seem the airline is an official sponsor of world cup 2006 , but emirates is in fact the official airline of the fifa tournament .
lufthansa has put a football motif on 40 of its aircraft " the lufthansa aircraft with the football nose will act as football 's ambassadors inviting all to enjoy their stay here , " says lufthansa , associating itself with the tournament but avoiding any official connection .
and electrical retailer mediamarkt is proclaiming we will be the champions -lrb- wir wollen den titel -rrb- , and that it provides a " gold " service on prices .
however , if the uk government and british olympic association get their way , expressions such as gold could be forbidden for advertisers when the games come to london .
the government is aware of the boost the games could give the uk economy and is doing everything to ensure big sponsors will be attracted and not have their rights packages diluted by the ambushers .
hence the current bill , which makes a list of olympic-related words and images prohibited for use by non-sponsors .
forbidden words existing legislation already prohibits the use of distinctive " marks " like the olympic rings , but now words like gold , silver and bronze could be on the banned list .
the proposed new legislation covers goods , packaging , advertising and other unauthorised uses .
the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- has an olympics partners programme , which gives big names like coca-cola , mcdonalds and visa exclusive marketing rights .
proposed protection the words olympic , olympiad and olympian olympic rings , team gb and british olympic association logo words london 2012 , london 's bid logo and derivatives of london2012.com the 2012 games logo and mascots -lrb- not designed yet -rrb- olympic motto citius , altius , fortius / faster , higher , stronger the british paralympic association and team logos other banned words may soon include games , medals , gold , silver , bronze , 2012 , sponsor , summer the london organising committee estimates up to 40 % of its operating budget will come from sponsorship , hence the determination to tackle anything that might diminish sponsor revenues .
one tactic used in the past by ambushers - strategically-placed billboards near stadiums - has been tackled by the london organisers securing first rights on nearly all major city boards at the time of the games .
british olympic association lawyer sara friend says : " ambush marketing should be seen as working against the interests of official rights package holders .
" we acknowledge there has to be a balance between the interest of sponsors and rights holders , and in allowing clever and creative advertising and marketing .
now london has the games it wants to make the most of them " but the boa is not government funded and money for funding comes either through the ioc 's partner programmes , or our own domestic sponsor programmes .
" therefore we need to protect the rights that partners receive for backing team gb .
and it is incredibly important to protect the team gb identity . "
she said that at major events run by global bodies like the ioc , fifa , and cricket 's icc , it was not unreasonable for host nations to put in place " legislative protection " .
" we have no problems with creative advertising - but well thought-out attempts to ride on the back , and goodwill , of an event can be potentially damaging to sponsorship agreements . "
' too far ' but christopher hackford , legal manager at the institute of practitioners in advertising , says : " sponsorship should be protected , but we think the existing law in the uk is sufficient to protect sponsors .
" there are already safeguards covering copyright , trademarks , passing-off , and misleading advertising , as well as the olympic symbols protection act .
" the olympics bill takes this protection potentially too far . "
the ipa has written to all 646 members of parliament to advise them of its concern , and says the proposed new law is " too broad and disproportionate " .
" the position is clearly an unfair limitation of commercial expression , " mr hackford says .
" such radical and disproportionate legislation does not benefit anyone , it gives unparalleled power to event holders , which pushes up the price of sponsorship and prevents ordinary smaller businesses from benefiting at all from major national events . "

a group called lammas aims to create a largely self-sufficient settlement with community centre , shop , workshops and hostel on 100 to 250 acres of land .
it is looking for a suitable site in south west wales , with the village a " blueprint for sustainable living " .
it was launched at the red dragon hall in drefach velindre .
the concept is to create 30 to 45 dwellings situated around a traffic-free central village green .
it 's an open project open to anyone with low impact aspirations paul wimbush each would have vehicle access to the rear , on the other side of which would be a series of agricultural and forestry plots as well as wilderness areas .
paul wimbush of the lammas core group said : " it would be sustainable living at its cutting edge .
" the houses will be purpose built by the residents themselves and we envisage a wide range of materials and designs using stone , wood , straw , turf and recycled materials . "
he said the settlement would become integrated with the local community and would be a source of affordable housing for local people .
he said preliminary discussions had taken place with local councils and lammas was looking for a suitable location either in pembrokeshire , carmarthenshire or swansea and gower .

there would be transport restrictions and people would need to make their livelihoods on site .
when up and running it could be used to educate people on sustainable living , said mr wimbush .
" one of the main objects of the project is to provide a research model so that low impact development can be thoroughly assessed .
" if everything goes to plan we envisage buying the land next winter with people starting to move on by late summer 2007 .
the community would be fully established by 2012 . "

a website has been set up for people across the region to give their support to the campaign .

club chairman clive leach said : " the long term aim of durham county cricket club has been to stage international cricket of the highest standard in the north east .

the rejection was made in court documents google filed in response to official demands for search data .
in the strongly-worded papers google said the request would violate the privacy of its users and reveal trade secrets to its rivals .
it also added that handing over the data was impractical and would not accomplish what the government wanted .
rejection letter the us department of justice -lrb- doj -rrb- made the request for a week 's worth of search records in late january .
it made similar requests of other big net firms such as microsoft , yahoo and aol .
initially , google resisted the request from the doj and in court documents filed over the weekend has formally rejected it .
the 25 page document uses strong language to criticise the request for a list of the search terms used in a typical week .
the doj has made the request to shore up attempts to show that voluntary regulation is not doing a good enough job of keeping children free of the unsavoury material , largely pornographic , that exists online .
the document expressed its disbelief in us goverment assertions that the list of search words would help understand user behaviour .
" this statement is so uninformed as to be nonsensical , " comments the document .
google said the government request was flawed because it constantly tuned the algorithms behind the index that returns particular sites for particular search terms .
china 's growing ranks of net users are proving a strong lure this tinkering means that results for one search may not be the same from week to week .
google also said that it would take more than a week of work by one of its engineers to compile the list .
the documents go on to say : " google users trust that when they enter a search query into a google search box ... that google will keep private whatever information users communicate absent a compelling reason . "
the american civil liberties union also filed court documents supporting google 's stance .
lawyers for the aclu wrote : " this subpoena is the latest example of government overreaching , in which the government apparently believes it can demand that private entities turn over all sorts of information about their customers just because the government asserts that it needs the information . "
a court hearing to decide the row is scheduled for 13 march .
despite its stand against the doj demands for search data , google has been heavily criticised in recent weeks for its stance in china where it is co-operating with the regime 's demands for control of the net .

the rejection was made in court documents google filed in response to official demands for search data .
in the strongly-worded papers google said the request would violate the privacy of its users and reveal trade secrets to its rivals .
it also added that handing over the data was impractical and would not accomplish what the government wanted .
rejection letter the us department of justice -lrb- doj -rrb- made the request for a week 's worth of search records in late january .
it made similar requests of other big net firms such as microsoft , yahoo and aol .
initially , google resisted the request from the doj and in court documents filed over the weekend has formally rejected it .
the 25 page document uses strong language to criticise the request for a list of the search terms used in a typical week .
the doj has made the request to shore up attempts to show that voluntary regulation is not doing a good enough job of keeping children free of the unsavoury material , largely pornographic , that exists online .
the document expressed its disbelief in us goverment assertions that the list of search words would help understand user behaviour .
" this statement is so uninformed as to be nonsensical , " comments the document .
google said the government request was flawed because it constantly tuned the algorithms behind the index that returns particular sites for particular search terms .
china 's growing ranks of net users are proving a strong lure this tinkering means that results for one search may not be the same from week to week .
google also said that it would take more than a week of work by one of its engineers to compile the list .
the documents go on to say : " google users trust that when they enter a search query into a google search box ... that google will keep private whatever information users communicate absent a compelling reason . "
the american civil liberties union also filed court documents supporting google 's stance .
lawyers for the aclu wrote : " this subpoena is the latest example of government overreaching , in which the government apparently believes it can demand that private entities turn over all sorts of information about their customers just because the government asserts that it needs the information . "
a court hearing to decide the row is scheduled for 13 march .
despite its stand against the doj demands for search data , google has been heavily criticised in recent weeks for its stance in china where it is co-operating with the regime 's demands for control of the net .
