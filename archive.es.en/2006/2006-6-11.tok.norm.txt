sanchez 's availability for the game will depend on his mental and emotional state . the opening match is seen as critical to the hopes of both teams in a group which also contains portugal and angola . " this is the most important game .
we know the game against portugal will be really hard also so we really need to gain points in this game , " said iran skipper ali daei . mexico will hope to shrug off sanchez 's likely absence and their own unpromising build-up which saw them lose 2-1 to a second-string netherlands team . however a fourth-place finish in last year 's confederations cup - including a 1-0 win over brazil - and a 20-match unbeaten streak have instilled a strong sense of self-belief in ricardo lavolpe 's squad . " mexico are very compact , aggressive and fast - actually , they 're excellent , " said lavolpe 's opposite number branko ivankovic . " sometimes they 're playing very boring , but very successful . " mexico looking to justify top four ranking key player is barcelona rock rafael marquez , who will be looking to make amends for his red card in the knock-out defeat to the united states four years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talismanic jared borgetti -lrb- l . -rrb- has a point to prove mexico 's all-time top-scorer jared borgetti , who totted up a world-best 14 goals in qualifying , will be hoping to send a message to club manager sam allardyce who left him languishing on the bolton bench this season . mexico have qualified for 13 world cups but have never done better than the last eight on home ground in 1970 and 1986 , reaching the second round in the last three competitions . lavolpe , a member of argentina 's 1978 world cup-winning squad , has courted controversy by calling up naturalised mexicans guillermo franco and antonio naelson , while axing legendary striker cuauhtemoc blanco . iran 's walking wounded already at a disadvantage meanwhile iran , who have set their sights on making round two for the first time , look to have serious problems with several players either ruled out or recovering from injury . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's players who are fit face a tough time against mexico with key attackers ali karimi and mehdi mahdavikia coming back from ankle and back trouble respectively , defender sattar zare twisted a knee in training and midfielder fereydoon zandi also looks likely to miss out after coming down with a fever . however iran , who have plundered a mine of information on their opponents , remain optimistic that the asian giants could spring a surprise in their " most important game " . " our coaching staff is analysing mexico really well and every player is aware of the mexican players and their style of the game .
we know how to play against mexico , " said captain daei . " i think winning against mexico is not unreachable .
mexico is a very good team but it 's not unbeatable . " the match also has a political dimension with iran , under fire for their president 's comments about the holocaust , playing in the former nazi stronghold of nuremberg . mexico won the two teams ' only previous encounter , a friendly on june 9 , 2001 which ended 2-1 . mexico -lrb- 5-3-2 -rrb- : 1-oswaldo sanchez ; 3-carlos salcido , 14-gonzalo pineda -lrb- 30-1 -rrb- , 4-rafael marquez -lrb- 65-7 -rrb- , 5-ricardo osorio , 15-jose antonio castro ; 6-gerardo torrado , 7-antonio naelson , 8-pavel pardo ; 9-jared borgetti , 10-guillemro franco . coach : ricardo lavolpe iran : -lrb- 4-2-3-1 -rrb- : 1-ebrahim mirzapour ; 13-hossein kaebi , 5-rahman rezaei , 4-yahya golmohammadi , 20-mohammad nosrati ; 2-mehdi mahdavikia , 6-javan nekonam ; 14-andranik teymourian , 9-vahid hashemian , 8-ali karimi ; 10-ali daei coach : branko ivankovic dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ahmadinejad would face cool reception at world cup berlin was reserved in its response to iran 's president saying he would come to the world cup if his team made it beyond the first round .

figo can also be found on the sideline , but he 's only changing his shoes .
76. min .
mexico and iran wo n't be sure what to make of angola or portugal after this match .

bavarian state interior minister günther beckstein said the demonstration was not targeted against the iranian team or the iranian people but against " a man who has placed himself outside civilization . " " a criminal like ahmadinejad is not welcome -lrb- in germany -rrb- , " he said . " let us show that bavaria and germany as well as the entire western world stand firmly by israel and our jewish fellow citizens . " police said the event went off without incident . ahmadinejad condemned for holocaust comments ahmadinejad has been widely condemned for describing the holocaust as a " myth " and calling for israel to be " wiped off the map " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's comments about the holocaust have sparked anger worldwide he has said he would like to attend the soccer ball extravaganza running through july 9 but has made no firm plans .
a source close to him said he would be watching sunday 's game on television in his office in tehran . iranian vice president mohammad aliabadi was granted a german visa and visited the iranian team in nuremberg saturday ahead of their first world cup match sunday . michel friedman , a television presenter and high-profile member of germany 's jewish community , told the rally it was scandalous that aliabadi had been allowed to enter the country . knobloch warns of " anti-semitic alliance " charlotte knobloch , the newly appointed head of germany 's central council of jews said she was worried about an " explosive anti-semitic alliance . " writing in an article in bild am sonntag , knobloch pointed out that neo-nazis in germany wanted to use a game between iran and angola on june 21 in leipzig to " declare their solidarity with the tyrant from tehran . "
knobloch warned that germany could n't just watch events idly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch " we have to prevent that the enemies of the constitution and the iranian dictator do n't join forces to form an anti-semitic alliance , " knobloch wrote . earlier , police broke up a pro-iranian rally by neo-nazis in nuremberg , a former nazi stronghold . the 16 men and women there were dressed in iranian jerseys , hoisting iranian flags and distributing flyers demanding that the demonstration against ahmadinejad be banned , police spokesman peter grösch .
amid the controversy , iran coach branko ivankovic told reporters saturday to stop asking him about politics .
" these political questions are not for me .
i think it 's not for me and it 's not for people here .
please just ask about my team against mexico , " said the croatian . standing up against racism separately , german politicians and celebrities joined thousands of citizens and activists in the western german city of gelsenkirchen on saturday to send a strong message against neo-nazism and xenophobia . the gelsenkirchen event was meant to counter a march planned by the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- on saturday , a day after the city of gelsenkirchen hosted an opening world cup game between poland and ecuador . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and the ambassador of ecuador horacio sevilla borja addressing the estimated 5,000 people who gathered in gelsenkirchen to protest against the far-right , germany 's vice chancellor franz müntefering accused the npd of wanting to hijack the soccer world cup in germany to sow xenophobia .

" we want all people to be able to live here in germany irrespective of their skin color , passport , name and religion .
no one should be scared , " he said . racism debate in germany müntefering 's comments follow warnings last month by a former government spokesman who now heads an anti-racist organization that black soccer fans visiting the country during the world cup should avoid going to areas where neo-nazi attacks had taken place . his remarks triggered fierce debate in germany about so-called no-go areas for dark-skinned foreigners and were followed by a suspected racist attack on a politician of turkish-kurdish origin in eastern berlin . a string of other racist attacks in the east of the country have also put the country on edge . " world attention focused on germany " president of germany 's parliament , the bundestag , norbert lammert , underscored the importance of the anti-neo-nazi demonstration on saturday at a time when the world is looking at germany and particularly gelsenkirchen which hosts a number of world cup games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans from all over the world are in germany for the world cup " world attention wo n't focused on germany in the next few years the way that it is at present and in the coming weeks , " lammert said .

one private university in berlin started by a turkish industrialist bucks the trend . bright corridors , potted plants on window sills , an assortment of newspapers and magazines and young people hurrying around with laptops under their arms - the ota private university in berlin is a far cry from the scruffy lecture halls seen in most universities across germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lecture halls are usually full at state-run german universities students here learn in small groups instead of in usually overflowing classrooms .
and studying here is a full-time job - students cram market models and economic theory from nine in the morning until five in the afternoon . practical application important fatih aslan , a student of turkish origin - like most of the around 100 students at ota - is studying for an mba and plans to do his bachelor 's degree in a year .
the study program costs about 600 euros a month - expensive by german standards , but worth every euro , says aslan . " my best friend is studying at a state-run university and i get to hear from him of how dry it is and far-removed from practical applications , " said aslan .
" here we have to constantly make presentations .
and that does motivate you because you have to always use the stuff you learn during your time here . " practical application is strongly emphasized at the ota .
most of the lecturers come from business and industry and in addition to the theory they teach , they give students glimpses into the real working world .
doing an internship of several months is the norm here . not a " turkish university " ota is the antithesis of a german state-run university , and the going was n't easy initially , said erman tanyildiz .
the turkish businessmen who came to germany to study in the 1970s set up his own successful business empire and ended up investing his fortune in the private university . " nobody rolled out the red carpet for me when i first came up with the idea , " said tanyildiz .
" it took about two years before the authorities took me seriously .
they were very skeptical when they saw that off all people , a turk wanted to invest four million dm in a foundation .
they probably thought it was for something bad . " at the same time tanyildiz does n't like the ota to be referred to as a " turkish university . "
he says it 's open to all and wants to offer a chance in particular to those who lose out in the cut-throat competition for a decent education . immigrant kids losing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids from immigrants families are usually the losers when it comes to education and jobs most of the current misery plaguing children with immigrant backgrounds in germany reflects the country 's decades-long neglect when it came to integrating its immigrants , says tanyildiz . last month , a study by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- showed that germany is largely failing children from immigrant families .
the report said that only every tenth child from an immigrant family managed to get into a gymnasium , or high school that eventually leads to university .
while every third german studies at a university , only eight percent of immigrant children do so , the study found . " in the 1960s germany needed cheap labor that could do all the backbreaking work .
critical academics would have proved more of a burden , " said tanyildiz .
" they -lrb- cheap workers -rrb- were n't given a chance to educate themselves but rather were treated as ' guests ' for generations .
how do people who perhaps themselves ca n't read and write educate their children and tell them about the importance of a good education ? " tanyildiz says the key lies in language .
german courses at a pre-school age as well as more flexibility in germany 's current school system are crucial , said tanyildiz , since they would enable kids to develop their abilities and decide at a higher age if they wanted to go to university or opt for vocational training . tapping immigrant potential the turkish entrepreneur also pointed out that children from immigrant families had enormous potential - bilingualism and bicultural soft skills - which was often overlooked in germany .
at the ota , kids from such families are considered a benefit , not a deficit , tanyildiz said . " what we 're also doing is preparing a bit of the groundwork for turkey 's eu membership .
already there 's intensive economic cooperation between turkey and europe , " tanyildiz said .
" and there we need well-trained leaders who are familiar with several cultures and languages and are rooted in them . " people like fatih aslan are prime examples .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.06.2006 latest census underlines multicultural german reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is waking up and smelling the coffee national census results released this week reveal that germany is fatter , lonelier - and more ethnically diverse than ever before .
it was the first census to cover health and immigration . the recently announced results of the 2005 national census in germany have given an official face to what has been fairly obvious : germans are getting fatter -lrb- 58 percent men and 42 percent of women are overweight -rrb- and more than a quarter of them still ca n't kick their smoking habit . who is german ? of greater political significance however , is the finding , presented on tuesday by president of the federal office of statistics johann hahlen , that nearly one fifth of all germans -lrb- 15.3 million people or 19 percent of the population -rrb- have an immigrant background .
this includes those who have immigrated to germany themselves and may or may not have a german passport , and those with at least one immigrant parent . these statistics , part of the annual census for the very first time , come after a wave of immigration-related discussions spurred by a recent attack on an ethiopian-german in potsdam .
they also follow a recent exposé on violence and poor conditions in schools with immigrant majorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is the key to integration not everyone fits the mould the census is yet another sign that germany has to tackle the burning issue of integration of immigration and face up to its serious failings in the matter in the past . for decades germany has been content to treat all immigrants like " gastarbeiter " - pretending they will return to their home country at some point . ethnic germans from the former soviet union were hastily given passports after world war two and expected to assimilate on their own . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coexisting is n't enough redefining family the ongoing evolution of the family is another matter raised by the census results , which has both social and political ramifications .
patchwork families , disillusionment with marriage and a lack of willing caretakers for elderly parents are neither new concerns nor are they unique to germany . according to the census , only 1 percent germany 's 39.2 million households have three or more generations . germans are having fewer children , but apparently they are n't caring for their parents .
the elderly are n't living with their children -lrb- 22 percent of german households consist exclusively of individuals above the age of 65 -rrb- and nor are the middle-aged -lrb- 24 percent of couples live without children -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german men , especially divorced men , tend to smoke more than german women taking stock the census results bring warnings as well as reason for cautious optimism .
the country is rich in cultural diversity but is recognizing the need to rethink its immigration strategy . and even if smoking rates are high , they are down 2 percent than in 1999 .

dw-world.de spoke with national coach oleg blokhin about the country 's chances . appointed in 2003 as coach of the ukrainian national team , oleg blokhin is a world cup legend himself .
the ukrainian represented the soviet union in the world cup finals in 1982 and 1986 .
he is regarded as soviet soccer 's best player ever . dw-world.de : ukraine managed to qualify for the world cup for the first time .
what was the key to your success ? oleg blokhin : our single-mindedness and confidence were decisive .
when the world cup qualification rounds first began , no one believed that we would make it , in particular against strong teams such as european champion greece as well as denmark and turkey .
but i still managed to convince my boys that we were up to the challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ukrainian team celebrates after qualifying for the world cup for the first time is the world cup frenzy palpable in ukraine ? just like everywhere else in the world , you have been able to feel the world cup fever in ukraine for the past half year .
you notice it particularly with the growing number of journalists who want to interview me or the national players .
but we could completely focus on the world cup only after the ukrainian national league championships were over on may 14 .
the national team lost a week of preparation due to that .
we could have really used that week for a few players to relax fully before we began with the world cup training . what 's the atmosphere like within the team ?
do you think all that excitement can be damaging ? we 're prepared to perform well and we understand how important the world cup is for the image of our country as well for every individual player .
i notice that our players are slightly excited , but it 's important that we keep together .
the excitement should n't affect our performance ; it 's a normal condition for every player before each game .
if the player does n't feel any excitement , it means that he 's achieved everything and can end his career . which game in the preliminary round do you consider to be the most important ? the game against spain will be important because it 's the first one .
it will strongly determine the further constellation in our group .
but the two other games are equally important ; that 's why we 'll have to give every game our best .
there are no " games to fill the gap " in a world cup and no weak opponents . who 's the most dangerous opponent in group h ?
and why ? spain is one of the favorites of the tournament , and that 's why we 're preparing thoroughly for this game .
but i consider another team to be the most dangerous opponent and that 's tunisia . african teams are famous for springing surprises .
i think a team that 's coached by roger lemerre is capable of surprises during the world cup 2006 . do you also reckon with stiff competition from saudi arabia ? saudi arabia had more time to prepare , and that does play a big role .
i think we do have to take this team seriously ; it certainly wo n't let itself be just a whipping boy . what is the main strength of the ukrainian team ? our strength lies in our team spirit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian star striker shevchenko , center , with teammates and what are your weaknesses ? they include personnel problems as well as injuries that have plagued us during our entire preparation phase .
until now we have n't played any test games in the combination that i 'd like to see on the pitch .
andrei shevchenko , sergei rebrov as well as oleg gusev have only trained separately from the rest of the team until now .
our most important man in the defense line-up , sergei fiodorov , wo n't be there at all due to an injury .
four other players had to take part in the junior european championships in portugal until june 4 and are completely exhausted .
i ca n't rely on them 100 percent . which teams do you think have the best chances of making it to the finals ? brazil , italy and germany .
germany 's playing on home turf .
we have a saying : even the walls help you at home .
in addition , it could very well be that the referees are more partial towards the germans . many experts say the success of the ukrainian team depends on whether andrei shevchenko is fit .
is he the only key player in the team ? it 's true that shevchenko does lead the team .
but we 'll be in good form independent of whether he 'll be fit after his last injury and whether he 's in good shape or not .
our performance is n't only based on his dominating role though his talent , and charisma is really important to us and unpleasant to the opponents . what goals do you have at the world cup ? our first goal is to reach the round of 18 .

sanchez 's availability for the game will depend on his mental and emotional state . the opening match is seen as critical to the hopes of both teams in a group which also contains portugal and angola . " this is the most important game .
we know the game against portugal will be really hard also so we really need to gain points in this game , " said iran skipper ali daei . mexico will hope to shrug off sanchez 's likely absence and their own unpromising build-up which saw them lose 2-1 to a second-string netherlands team . however a fourth-place finish in last year 's confederations cup - including a 1-0 win over brazil - and a 20-match unbeaten streak have instilled a strong sense of self-belief in ricardo lavolpe 's squad .

" our coaching staff is analysing mexico really well and every player is aware of the mexican players and their style of the game .

it was the first census to cover health and immigration . the recently announced results of the 2005 national census in germany have given an official face to what has been fairly obvious : germans are getting fatter -lrb- 58 percent men and 42 percent of women are overweight -rrb- and more than a quarter of them still ca n't kick their smoking habit . who is german ? of greater political significance however , is the finding , presented on tuesday by president of the federal office of statistics johann hahlen , that nearly one fifth of all germans -lrb- 15.3 million people or 19 percent of the population -rrb- have an immigrant background .
this includes those who have immigrated to germany themselves and may or may not have a german passport , and those with at least one immigrant parent . these statistics , part of the annual census for the very first time , come after a wave of immigration-related discussions spurred by a recent attack on an ethiopian-german in potsdam .
they also follow a recent exposé on violence and poor conditions in schools with immigrant majorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is the key to integration not everyone fits the mould the census is yet another sign that germany has to tackle the burning issue of integration of immigration and face up to its serious failings in the matter in the past . for decades germany has been content to treat all immigrants like " gastarbeiter " - pretending they will return to their home country at some point . ethnic germans from the former soviet union were hastily given passports after world war two and expected to assimilate on their own . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coexisting is n't enough redefining family the ongoing evolution of the family is another matter raised by the census results , which has both social and political ramifications .
patchwork families , disillusionment with marriage and a lack of willing caretakers for elderly parents are neither new concerns nor are they unique to germany . according to the census , only 1 percent germany 's 39.2 million households have three or more generations . germans are having fewer children , but apparently they are n't caring for their parents .
the elderly are n't living with their children -lrb- 22 percent of german households consist exclusively of individuals above the age of 65 -rrb- and nor are the middle-aged -lrb- 24 percent of couples live without children -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german men , especially divorced men , tend to smoke more than german women taking stock the census results bring warnings as well as reason for cautious optimism .
the country is rich in cultural diversity but is recognizing the need to rethink its immigration strategy . and even if smoking rates are high , they are down 2 percent than in 1999 .

it was the first census to cover health and immigration . the recently announced results of the 2005 national census in germany have given an official face to what has been fairly obvious : germans are getting fatter -lrb- 58 percent men and 42 percent of women are overweight -rrb- and more than a quarter of them still ca n't kick their smoking habit . who is german ? of greater political significance however , is the finding , presented on tuesday by president of the federal office of statistics johann hahlen , that nearly one fifth of all germans -lrb- 15.3 million people or 19 percent of the population -rrb- have an immigrant background .
this includes those who have immigrated to germany themselves and may or may not have a german passport , and those with at least one immigrant parent . these statistics , part of the annual census for the very first time , come after a wave of immigration-related discussions spurred by a recent attack on an ethiopian-german in potsdam .
they also follow a recent exposé on violence and poor conditions in schools with immigrant majorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is the key to integration not everyone fits the mould the census is yet another sign that germany has to tackle the burning issue of integration of immigration and face up to its serious failings in the matter in the past . for decades germany has been content to treat all immigrants like " gastarbeiter " - pretending they will return to their home country at some point . ethnic germans from the former soviet union were hastily given passports after world war two and expected to assimilate on their own . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coexisting is n't enough redefining family the ongoing evolution of the family is another matter raised by the census results , which has both social and political ramifications .
patchwork families , disillusionment with marriage and a lack of willing caretakers for elderly parents are neither new concerns nor are they unique to germany . according to the census , only 1 percent germany 's 39.2 million households have three or more generations . germans are having fewer children , but apparently they are n't caring for their parents .
the elderly are n't living with their children -lrb- 22 percent of german households consist exclusively of individuals above the age of 65 -rrb- and nor are the middle-aged -lrb- 24 percent of couples live without children -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german men , especially divorced men , tend to smoke more than german women taking stock the census results bring warnings as well as reason for cautious optimism .
the country is rich in cultural diversity but is recognizing the need to rethink its immigration strategy . and even if smoking rates are high , they are down 2 percent than in 1999 .

the study program costs about 600 euros a month - expensive by german standards , but worth every euro , says aslan . " my best friend is studying at a state-run university and i get to hear from him of how dry it is and far-removed from practical applications , " said aslan .
" here we have to constantly make presentations .
and that does motivate you because you have to always use the stuff you learn during your time here . " practical application is strongly emphasized at the ota .
most of the lecturers come from business and industry and in addition to the theory they teach , they give students glimpses into the real working world .
doing an internship of several months is the norm here . not a " turkish university " ota is the antithesis of a german state-run university , and the going was n't easy initially , said erman tanyildiz .
the turkish businessmen who came to germany to study in the 1970s set up his own successful business empire and ended up investing his fortune in the private university . " nobody rolled out the red carpet for me when i first came up with the idea , " said tanyildiz .
" it took about two years before the authorities took me seriously .
they were very skeptical when they saw that off all people , a turk wanted to invest four million dm in a foundation .
they probably thought it was for something bad . " at the same time tanyildiz does n't like the ota to be referred to as a " turkish university . "
he says it 's open to all and wants to offer a chance in particular to those who lose out in the cut-throat competition for a decent education . immigrant kids losing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids from immigrants families are usually the losers when it comes to education and jobs most of the current misery plaguing children with immigrant backgrounds in germany reflects the country 's decades-long neglect when it came to integrating its immigrants , says tanyildiz . last month , a study by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- showed that germany is largely failing children from immigrant families .
the report said that only every tenth child from an immigrant family managed to get into a gymnasium , or high school that eventually leads to university .
while every third german studies at a university , only eight percent of immigrant children do so , the study found . " in the 1960s germany needed cheap labor that could do all the backbreaking work .
critical academics would have proved more of a burden , " said tanyildiz .
" they -lrb- cheap workers -rrb- were n't given a chance to educate themselves but rather were treated as ' guests ' for generations .
how do people who perhaps themselves ca n't read and write educate their children and tell them about the importance of a good education ? " tanyildiz says the key lies in language .
german courses at a pre-school age as well as more flexibility in germany 's current school system are crucial , said tanyildiz , since they would enable kids to develop their abilities and decide at a higher age if they wanted to go to university or opt for vocational training . tapping immigrant potential the turkish entrepreneur also pointed out that children from immigrant families had enormous potential - bilingualism and bicultural soft skills - which was often overlooked in germany .
at the ota , kids from such families are considered a benefit , not a deficit , tanyildiz said . " what we 're also doing is preparing a bit of the groundwork for turkey 's eu membership .

doing an internship of several months is the norm here . not a " turkish university " ota is the antithesis of a german state-run university , and the going was n't easy initially , said erman tanyildiz .
the turkish businessmen who came to germany to study in the 1970s set up his own successful business empire and ended up investing his fortune in the private university . " nobody rolled out the red carpet for me when i first came up with the idea , " said tanyildiz .
" it took about two years before the authorities took me seriously .
they were very skeptical when they saw that off all people , a turk wanted to invest four million dm in a foundation .
they probably thought it was for something bad . " at the same time tanyildiz does n't like the ota to be referred to as a " turkish university . "
he says it 's open to all and wants to offer a chance in particular to those who lose out in the cut-throat competition for a decent education . immigrant kids losing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids from immigrants families are usually the losers when it comes to education and jobs most of the current misery plaguing children with immigrant backgrounds in germany reflects the country 's decades-long neglect when it came to integrating its immigrants , says tanyildiz . last month , a study by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- showed that germany is largely failing children from immigrant families .
the report said that only every tenth child from an immigrant family managed to get into a gymnasium , or high school that eventually leads to university .
while every third german studies at a university , only eight percent of immigrant children do so , the study found . " in the 1960s germany needed cheap labor that could do all the backbreaking work .
critical academics would have proved more of a burden , " said tanyildiz .
" they -lrb- cheap workers -rrb- were n't given a chance to educate themselves but rather were treated as ' guests ' for generations .
how do people who perhaps themselves ca n't read and write educate their children and tell them about the importance of a good education ? " tanyildiz says the key lies in language .
german courses at a pre-school age as well as more flexibility in germany 's current school system are crucial , said tanyildiz , since they would enable kids to develop their abilities and decide at a higher age if they wanted to go to university or opt for vocational training . tapping immigrant potential the turkish entrepreneur also pointed out that children from immigrant families had enormous potential - bilingualism and bicultural soft skills - which was often overlooked in germany .
at the ota , kids from such families are considered a benefit , not a deficit , tanyildiz said . " what we 're also doing is preparing a bit of the groundwork for turkey 's eu membership .
already there 's intensive economic cooperation between turkey and europe , " tanyildiz said .
" and there we need well-trained leaders who are familiar with several cultures and languages and are rooted in them . " people like fatih aslan are prime examples .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.06.2006 latest census underlines multicultural german reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is waking up and smelling the coffee national census results released this week reveal that germany is fatter , lonelier - and more ethnically diverse than ever before .
it was the first census to cover health and immigration . the recently announced results of the 2005 national census in germany have given an official face to what has been fairly obvious : germans are getting fatter -lrb- 58 percent men and 42 percent of women are overweight -rrb- and more than a quarter of them still ca n't kick their smoking habit . who is german ? of greater political significance however , is the finding , presented on tuesday by president of the federal office of statistics johann hahlen , that nearly one fifth of all germans -lrb- 15.3 million people or 19 percent of the population -rrb- have an immigrant background .
this includes those who have immigrated to germany themselves and may or may not have a german passport , and those with at least one immigrant parent . these statistics , part of the annual census for the very first time , come after a wave of immigration-related discussions spurred by a recent attack on an ethiopian-german in potsdam .
they also follow a recent exposé on violence and poor conditions in schools with immigrant majorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is the key to integration not everyone fits the mould the census is yet another sign that germany has to tackle the burning issue of integration of immigration and face up to its serious failings in the matter in the past . for decades germany has been content to treat all immigrants like " gastarbeiter " - pretending they will return to their home country at some point . ethnic germans from the former soviet union were hastily given passports after world war two and expected to assimilate on their own . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coexisting is n't enough redefining family the ongoing evolution of the family is another matter raised by the census results , which has both social and political ramifications .
patchwork families , disillusionment with marriage and a lack of willing caretakers for elderly parents are neither new concerns nor are they unique to germany . according to the census , only 1 percent germany 's 39.2 million households have three or more generations . germans are having fewer children , but apparently they are n't caring for their parents .
the elderly are n't living with their children -lrb- 22 percent of german households consist exclusively of individuals above the age of 65 -rrb- and nor are the middle-aged -lrb- 24 percent of couples live without children -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german men , especially divorced men , tend to smoke more than german women taking stock the census results bring warnings as well as reason for cautious optimism .
the country is rich in cultural diversity but is recognizing the need to rethink its immigration strategy . and even if smoking rates are high , they are down 2 percent than in 1999 .

they could have jumped to the lead in the 11th minute , but striker vahid hashemian twice failed to find the net from short range . mexico looked nervous , as though they were afraid of not living up to their role as group favorites behind portugal .
it took them around 20 minutes to settle down and create viable chances on goal , especially on set plays . in the 27th minute they took the lead .
omar bravo directed the ball into the net , after guillermo franco headed on a pavel pardo free-kick . iran struck back some eight minutes later .
yahya golmohammadi slotted home a corner-kick by midfielder mehdi mahdavikia to level the match up as the first half whistle blew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bravo should have raised two fingers for his pair of goals mexico make game clear in second half mexico started the second half with a shock , when their top striker jared borgetti limped off the pitch in the 51st minute .
still , the mexicans proved to be the better team , having much more of the ball and pinning the iranians in their own half of the field . but mexico needed a bit of help to regain the lead .
mistakes by iranian keeper ebrahim mirzapour and defender rahman rezaei gifted the ball to mexican substitute sinha in the 76th minute .
he quickly found bravo , who put mexico back on top with his second goal of the day . iran looked exhausted , and a couple of minutes later , they allowed sinha to sprint into the penalty area and put the game away with a nifty header .
iran was done .

they could have jumped to the lead in the 11th minute , but striker vahid hashemian twice failed to find the net from short range . mexico looked nervous , as though they were afraid of not living up to their role as group favorites behind portugal .
it took them around 20 minutes to settle down and create viable chances on goal , especially on set plays . in the 27th minute they took the lead .
omar bravo directed the ball into the net , after guillermo franco headed on a pavel pardo free-kick . iran struck back some eight minutes later .
yahya golmohammadi slotted home a corner-kick by midfielder mehdi mahdavikia to level the match up as the first half whistle blew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bravo should have raised two fingers for his pair of goals mexico make game clear in second half mexico started the second half with a shock , when their top striker jared borgetti limped off the pitch in the 51st minute .
still , the mexicans proved to be the better team , having much more of the ball and pinning the iranians in their own half of the field . but mexico needed a bit of help to regain the lead .
mistakes by iranian keeper ebrahim mirzapour and defender rahman rezaei gifted the ball to mexican substitute sinha in the 76th minute .
he quickly found bravo , who put mexico back on top with his second goal of the day . iran looked exhausted , and a couple of minutes later , they allowed sinha to sprint into the penalty area and put the game away with a nifty header .

they could have jumped to the lead in the 11th minute , but striker vahid hashemian twice failed to find the net from short range . mexico looked nervous , as though they were afraid of not living up to their role as group favorites behind portugal .
it took them around 20 minutes to settle down and create viable chances on goal , especially on set plays . in the 27th minute they took the lead .
omar bravo directed the ball into the net , after guillermo franco headed on a pavel pardo free-kick . iran struck back some eight minutes later .
yahya golmohammadi slotted home a corner-kick by midfielder mehdi mahdavikia to level the match up as the first half whistle blew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bravo should have raised two fingers for his pair of goals mexico make game clear in second half mexico started the second half with a shock , when their top striker jared borgetti limped off the pitch in the 51st minute .
still , the mexicans proved to be the better team , having much more of the ball and pinning the iranians in their own half of the field . but mexico needed a bit of help to regain the lead .
mistakes by iranian keeper ebrahim mirzapour and defender rahman rezaei gifted the ball to mexican substitute sinha in the 76th minute .

sanchez 's availability for the game will depend on his mental and emotional state . the opening match is seen as critical to the hopes of both teams in a group which also contains portugal and angola . " this is the most important game .
we know the game against portugal will be really hard also so we really need to gain points in this game , " said iran skipper ali daei . mexico will hope to shrug off sanchez 's likely absence and their own unpromising build-up which saw them lose 2-1 to a second-string netherlands team . however a fourth-place finish in last year 's confederations cup - including a 1-0 win over brazil - and a 20-match unbeaten streak have instilled a strong sense of self-belief in ricardo lavolpe 's squad . " mexico are very compact , aggressive and fast - actually , they 're excellent , " said lavolpe 's opposite number branko ivankovic . " sometimes they 're playing very boring , but very successful . " mexico looking to justify top four ranking key player is barcelona rock rafael marquez , who will be looking to make amends for his red card in the knock-out defeat to the united states four years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talismanic jared borgetti -lrb- l . -rrb- has a point to prove mexico 's all-time top-scorer jared borgetti , who totted up a world-best 14 goals in qualifying , will be hoping to send a message to club manager sam allardyce who left him languishing on the bolton bench this season . mexico have qualified for 13 world cups but have never done better than the last eight on home ground in 1970 and 1986 , reaching the second round in the last three competitions . lavolpe , a member of argentina 's 1978 world cup-winning squad , has courted controversy by calling up naturalised mexicans guillermo franco and antonio naelson , while axing legendary striker cuauhtemoc blanco . iran 's walking wounded already at a disadvantage meanwhile iran , who have set their sights on making round two for the first time , look to have serious problems with several players either ruled out or recovering from injury . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's players who are fit face a tough time against mexico with key attackers ali karimi and mehdi mahdavikia coming back from ankle and back trouble respectively , defender sattar zare twisted a knee in training and midfielder fereydoon zandi also looks likely to miss out after coming down with a fever . however iran , who have plundered a mine of information on their opponents , remain optimistic that the asian giants could spring a surprise in their " most important game " . " our coaching staff is analysing mexico really well and every player is aware of the mexican players and their style of the game .
we know how to play against mexico , " said captain daei . " i think winning against mexico is not unreachable .
mexico is a very good team but it 's not unbeatable . " the match also has a political dimension with iran , under fire for their president 's comments about the holocaust , playing in the former nazi stronghold of nuremberg . mexico won the two teams ' only previous encounter , a friendly on june 9 , 2001 which ended 2-1 . mexico -lrb- 5-3-2 -rrb- : 1-oswaldo sanchez ; 3-carlos salcido , 14-gonzalo pineda -lrb- 30-1 -rrb- , 4-rafael marquez -lrb- 65-7 -rrb- , 5-ricardo osorio , 15-jose antonio castro ; 6-gerardo torrado , 7-antonio naelson , 8-pavel pardo ; 9-jared borgetti , 10-guillemro franco . coach : ricardo lavolpe iran : -lrb- 4-2-3-1 -rrb- : 1-ebrahim mirzapour ; 13-hossein kaebi , 5-rahman rezaei , 4-yahya golmohammadi , 20-mohammad nosrati ; 2-mehdi mahdavikia , 6-javan nekonam ; 14-andranik teymourian , 9-vahid hashemian , 8-ali karimi ; 10-ali daei coach : branko ivankovic dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ahmadinejad would face cool reception at world cup berlin was reserved in its response to iran 's president saying he would come to the world cup if his team made it beyond the first round .

sanchez 's availability for the game will depend on his mental and emotional state . the opening match is seen as critical to the hopes of both teams in a group which also contains portugal and angola . " this is the most important game .
we know the game against portugal will be really hard also so we really need to gain points in this game , " said iran skipper ali daei . mexico will hope to shrug off sanchez 's likely absence and their own unpromising build-up which saw them lose 2-1 to a second-string netherlands team . however a fourth-place finish in last year 's confederations cup - including a 1-0 win over brazil - and a 20-match unbeaten streak have instilled a strong sense of self-belief in ricardo lavolpe 's squad . " mexico are very compact , aggressive and fast - actually , they 're excellent , " said lavolpe 's opposite number branko ivankovic . " sometimes they 're playing very boring , but very successful . " mexico looking to justify top four ranking key player is barcelona rock rafael marquez , who will be looking to make amends for his red card in the knock-out defeat to the united states four years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talismanic jared borgetti -lrb- l . -rrb- has a point to prove mexico 's all-time top-scorer jared borgetti , who totted up a world-best 14 goals in qualifying , will be hoping to send a message to club manager sam allardyce who left him languishing on the bolton bench this season . mexico have qualified for 13 world cups but have never done better than the last eight on home ground in 1970 and 1986 , reaching the second round in the last three competitions . lavolpe , a member of argentina 's 1978 world cup-winning squad , has courted controversy by calling up naturalised mexicans guillermo franco and antonio naelson , while axing legendary striker cuauhtemoc blanco . iran 's walking wounded already at a disadvantage meanwhile iran , who have set their sights on making round two for the first time , look to have serious problems with several players either ruled out or recovering from injury . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's players who are fit face a tough time against mexico with key attackers ali karimi and mehdi mahdavikia coming back from ankle and back trouble respectively , defender sattar zare twisted a knee in training and midfielder fereydoon zandi also looks likely to miss out after coming down with a fever . however iran , who have plundered a mine of information on their opponents , remain optimistic that the asian giants could spring a surprise in their " most important game " . " our coaching staff is analysing mexico really well and every player is aware of the mexican players and their style of the game .
we know how to play against mexico , " said captain daei . " i think winning against mexico is not unreachable .
mexico is a very good team but it 's not unbeatable . " the match also has a political dimension with iran , under fire for their president 's comments about the holocaust , playing in the former nazi stronghold of nuremberg . mexico won the two teams ' only previous encounter , a friendly on june 9 , 2001 which ended 2-1 . mexico -lrb- 5-3-2 -rrb- : 1-oswaldo sanchez ; 3-carlos salcido , 14-gonzalo pineda -lrb- 30-1 -rrb- , 4-rafael marquez -lrb- 65-7 -rrb- , 5-ricardo osorio , 15-jose antonio castro ; 6-gerardo torrado , 7-antonio naelson , 8-pavel pardo ; 9-jared borgetti , 10-guillemro franco . coach : ricardo lavolpe iran : -lrb- 4-2-3-1 -rrb- : 1-ebrahim mirzapour ; 13-hossein kaebi , 5-rahman rezaei , 4-yahya golmohammadi , 20-mohammad nosrati ; 2-mehdi mahdavikia , 6-javan nekonam ; 14-andranik teymourian , 9-vahid hashemian , 8-ali karimi ; 10-ali daei coach : branko ivankovic dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ahmadinejad would face cool reception at world cup berlin was reserved in its response to iran 's president saying he would come to the world cup if his team made it beyond the first round .

" instead i would like us to rubberstamp the idea that we feel good when we play in germany . " " we should benefit from playing so close to home , " van basten said as 15,000 fans turned out to watch the first public dutch training session in freiburg on thursday . " we sense this enthusiasm .
it is now for the players to take that onto the pitch , " said the coach who raised some eyebrows before the tournament when he ditched several of the old guard such as midfielders clarence seedorf and edgar davids , who were often linked with dressing room dissent . winger robben looking no further than opening game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first serbia & montenegro then the world for arjen robben robben admitted that group c was probably the toughest of the first stage and that a moment 's hesitation could prove fatal in deciding who progressed to the second round . " i do n't really want to think about the tournament as a whole at the moment but rather focus on the first match against serbia-montenegro , " said robben .
" they are a solid side with classy individuals .
but we also have a squad packed with quality .
we think together , we play really tightly and i am very confident . " " the dutch have players who can take us a long way in the tournament , " robben added .
" however we have to stay alert .
because in our group it may be the merest thing that makes the difference .
it will be a shame to play well but to lose everything because of a slip of concentration . " serb defender goran gavrancic , who plays for dynamo kiev , said : " it is realistic that we can record a good result against the netherlands .
we have the best defense in the qualifiers , and the netherlands has the best attack .
we want to stop them showing it against us .

" instead i would like us to rubberstamp the idea that we feel good when we play in germany . " " we should benefit from playing so close to home , " van basten said as 15,000 fans turned out to watch the first public dutch training session in freiburg on thursday . " we sense this enthusiasm .
it is now for the players to take that onto the pitch , " said the coach who raised some eyebrows before the tournament when he ditched several of the old guard such as midfielders clarence seedorf and edgar davids , who were often linked with dressing room dissent . winger robben looking no further than opening game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first serbia & montenegro then the world for arjen robben robben admitted that group c was probably the toughest of the first stage and that a moment 's hesitation could prove fatal in deciding who progressed to the second round . " i do n't really want to think about the tournament as a whole at the moment but rather focus on the first match against serbia-montenegro , " said robben .
" they are a solid side with classy individuals .
but we also have a squad packed with quality .
we think together , we play really tightly and i am very confident . " " the dutch have players who can take us a long way in the tournament , " robben added .
" however we have to stay alert .
because in our group it may be the merest thing that makes the difference .
it will be a shame to play well but to lose everything because of a slip of concentration . " serb defender goran gavrancic , who plays for dynamo kiev , said : " it is realistic that we can record a good result against the netherlands .
we have the best defense in the qualifiers , and the netherlands has the best attack .
we want to stop them showing it against us .

" instead i would like us to rubberstamp the idea that we feel good when we play in germany . " " we should benefit from playing so close to home , " van basten said as 15,000 fans turned out to watch the first public dutch training session in freiburg on thursday . " we sense this enthusiasm .
it is now for the players to take that onto the pitch , " said the coach who raised some eyebrows before the tournament when he ditched several of the old guard such as midfielders clarence seedorf and edgar davids , who were often linked with dressing room dissent . winger robben looking no further than opening game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first serbia & montenegro then the world for arjen robben robben admitted that group c was probably the toughest of the first stage and that a moment 's hesitation could prove fatal in deciding who progressed to the second round . " i do n't really want to think about the tournament as a whole at the moment but rather focus on the first match against serbia-montenegro , " said robben .
" they are a solid side with classy individuals .
but we also have a squad packed with quality .
we think together , we play really tightly and i am very confident . " " the dutch have players who can take us a long way in the tournament , " robben added .
" however we have to stay alert .
because in our group it may be the merest thing that makes the difference .
it will be a shame to play well but to lose everything because of a slip of concentration . " serb defender goran gavrancic , who plays for dynamo kiev , said : " it is realistic that we can record a good result against the netherlands .
we have the best defense in the qualifiers , and the netherlands has the best attack .
we want to stop them showing it against us .

bavarian state interior minister günther beckstein said the demonstration was not targeted against the iranian team or the iranian people but against " a man who has placed himself outside civilization . " " a criminal like ahmadinejad is not welcome -lrb- in germany -rrb- , " he said . " let us show that bavaria and germany as well as the entire western world stand firmly by israel and our jewish fellow citizens . " police said the event went off without incident . ahmadinejad condemned for holocaust comments ahmadinejad has been widely condemned for describing the holocaust as a " myth " and calling for israel to be " wiped off the map " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's comments about the holocaust have sparked anger worldwide he has said he would like to attend the soccer ball extravaganza running through july 9 but has made no firm plans .
a source close to him said he would be watching sunday 's game on television in his office in tehran . iranian vice president mohammad aliabadi was granted a german visa and visited the iranian team in nuremberg saturday ahead of their first world cup match sunday . michel friedman , a television presenter and high-profile member of germany 's jewish community , told the rally it was scandalous that aliabadi had been allowed to enter the country . knobloch warns of " anti-semitic alliance " charlotte knobloch , the newly appointed head of germany 's central council of jews said she was worried about an " explosive anti-semitic alliance . " writing in an article in bild am sonntag , knobloch pointed out that neo-nazis in germany wanted to use a game between iran and angola on june 21 in leipzig to " declare their solidarity with the tyrant from tehran . "
knobloch warned that germany could n't just watch events idly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch " we have to prevent that the enemies of the constitution and the iranian dictator do n't join forces to form an anti-semitic alliance , " knobloch wrote . earlier , police broke up a pro-iranian rally by neo-nazis in nuremberg , a former nazi stronghold . the 16 men and women there were dressed in iranian jerseys , hoisting iranian flags and distributing flyers demanding that the demonstration against ahmadinejad be banned , police spokesman peter grösch .
amid the controversy , iran coach branko ivankovic told reporters saturday to stop asking him about politics .
" these political questions are not for me .
i think it 's not for me and it 's not for people here .
please just ask about my team against mexico , " said the croatian . standing up against racism separately , german politicians and celebrities joined thousands of citizens and activists in the western german city of gelsenkirchen on saturday to send a strong message against neo-nazism and xenophobia . the gelsenkirchen event was meant to counter a march planned by the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- on saturday , a day after the city of gelsenkirchen hosted an opening world cup game between poland and ecuador . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and the ambassador of ecuador horacio sevilla borja addressing the estimated 5,000 people who gathered in gelsenkirchen to protest against the far-right , germany 's vice chancellor franz müntefering accused the npd of wanting to hijack the soccer world cup in germany to sow xenophobia . " this brown sauce should never again get a chance in germany , never again , " said müntefering .
" we want all people to be able to live here in germany irrespective of their skin color , passport , name and religion .
no one should be scared , " he said . racism debate in germany müntefering 's comments follow warnings last month by a former government spokesman who now heads an anti-racist organization that black soccer fans visiting the country during the world cup should avoid going to areas where neo-nazi attacks had taken place . his remarks triggered fierce debate in germany about so-called no-go areas for dark-skinned foreigners and were followed by a suspected racist attack on a politician of turkish-kurdish origin in eastern berlin . a string of other racist attacks in the east of the country have also put the country on edge . " world attention focused on germany " president of germany 's parliament , the bundestag , norbert lammert , underscored the importance of the anti-neo-nazi demonstration on saturday at a time when the world is looking at germany and particularly gelsenkirchen which hosts a number of world cup games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans from all over the world are in germany for the world cup " world attention wo n't focused on germany in the next few years the way that it is at present and in the coming weeks , " lammert said . " that 's why we have to lay emphasis on germany presenting itself the way it is : open to the world , tolerant and naturally friendly to foreigners , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leaders say germany open to the world , but urge caution days before the world cup kicks off , leading politicians have underlined germany 's open and tolerant nature .
but chancellor merkel has warned the country must remain vigilant to the threat of attacks against foreigners .
-lrb- june 6 , 2006 -rrb- can the world cup withstand heated race debate ?
germany is working hard to prevent the far right from hijacking the soccer world cup and promote a positive image weeks before the event opens .
will ongoing controversy over racism get in the way ?

he trapped a pass from luis figo and fired it home three minutes later with the angolan defense so confused they may have been wondering if they also had 11 players on the field . the one goal turned out to be the height of the game 's excitement as portugal put together only a small handful of decent scoring chances , including portugal 's temperamental cristiano ronaldo thudding a header against the crossbar in the 35th minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angola needed some time to get warmed up before creating any goal chances after getting the butterflies out , angola got into their first ever world cup game and , though they were clearly less skilled than their opponents , played stretches of soccer that let them leave the field proud of giving up only one goal in an emotionally charged game . star striker akwa produced an adventurous bicycle kick and then portugal keeper ricardo had to be at full stretch to keep out a shot from andre and just before the break angola keeper joao ricardo produced a fine save to deny the omnipresent ronaldo and kept the 750-1 underdogs in the match .

bavarian state interior minister günther beckstein said the demonstration was not targeted against the iranian team or the iranian people but against " a man who has placed himself outside civilization . " " a criminal like ahmadinejad is not welcome -lrb- in germany -rrb- , " he said . " let us show that bavaria and germany as well as the entire western world stand firmly by israel and our jewish fellow citizens . " police said the event went off without incident . ahmadinejad condemned for holocaust comments ahmadinejad has been widely condemned for describing the holocaust as a " myth " and calling for israel to be " wiped off the map " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's comments about the holocaust have sparked anger worldwide he has said he would like to attend the soccer ball extravaganza running through july 9 but has made no firm plans .
a source close to him said he would be watching sunday 's game on television in his office in tehran . iranian vice president mohammad aliabadi was granted a german visa and visited the iranian team in nuremberg saturday ahead of their first world cup match sunday . michel friedman , a television presenter and high-profile member of germany 's jewish community , told the rally it was scandalous that aliabadi had been allowed to enter the country . knobloch warns of " anti-semitic alliance " charlotte knobloch , the newly appointed head of germany 's central council of jews said she was worried about an " explosive anti-semitic alliance . " writing in an article in bild am sonntag , knobloch pointed out that neo-nazis in germany wanted to use a game between iran and angola on june 21 in leipzig to " declare their solidarity with the tyrant from tehran . "
knobloch warned that germany could n't just watch events idly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch " we have to prevent that the enemies of the constitution and the iranian dictator do n't join forces to form an anti-semitic alliance , " knobloch wrote . earlier , police broke up a pro-iranian rally by neo-nazis in nuremberg , a former nazi stronghold . the 16 men and women there were dressed in iranian jerseys , hoisting iranian flags and distributing flyers demanding that the demonstration against ahmadinejad be banned , police spokesman peter grösch .
amid the controversy , iran coach branko ivankovic told reporters saturday to stop asking him about politics .
" these political questions are not for me .
i think it 's not for me and it 's not for people here .
please just ask about my team against mexico , " said the croatian . standing up against racism separately , german politicians and celebrities joined thousands of citizens and activists in the western german city of gelsenkirchen on saturday to send a strong message against neo-nazism and xenophobia . the gelsenkirchen event was meant to counter a march planned by the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- on saturday , a day after the city of gelsenkirchen hosted an opening world cup game between poland and ecuador . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and the ambassador of ecuador horacio sevilla borja addressing the estimated 5,000 people who gathered in gelsenkirchen to protest against the far-right , germany 's vice chancellor franz müntefering accused the npd of wanting to hijack the soccer world cup in germany to sow xenophobia . " this brown sauce should never again get a chance in germany , never again , " said müntefering .
" we want all people to be able to live here in germany irrespective of their skin color , passport , name and religion .
no one should be scared , " he said . racism debate in germany müntefering 's comments follow warnings last month by a former government spokesman who now heads an anti-racist organization that black soccer fans visiting the country during the world cup should avoid going to areas where neo-nazi attacks had taken place . his remarks triggered fierce debate in germany about so-called no-go areas for dark-skinned foreigners and were followed by a suspected racist attack on a politician of turkish-kurdish origin in eastern berlin . a string of other racist attacks in the east of the country have also put the country on edge . " world attention focused on germany " president of germany 's parliament , the bundestag , norbert lammert , underscored the importance of the anti-neo-nazi demonstration on saturday at a time when the world is looking at germany and particularly gelsenkirchen which hosts a number of world cup games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans from all over the world are in germany for the world cup " world attention wo n't focused on germany in the next few years the way that it is at present and in the coming weeks , " lammert said . " that 's why we have to lay emphasis on germany presenting itself the way it is : open to the world , tolerant and naturally friendly to foreigners , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leaders say germany open to the world , but urge caution days before the world cup kicks off , leading politicians have underlined germany 's open and tolerant nature .
but chancellor merkel has warned the country must remain vigilant to the threat of attacks against foreigners .

" instead i would like us to rubberstamp the idea that we feel good when we play in germany . " " we should benefit from playing so close to home , " van basten said as 15,000 fans turned out to watch the first public dutch training session in freiburg on thursday . " we sense this enthusiasm .
it is now for the players to take that onto the pitch , " said the coach who raised some eyebrows before the tournament when he ditched several of the old guard such as midfielders clarence seedorf and edgar davids , who were often linked with dressing room dissent . winger robben looking no further than opening game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first serbia & montenegro then the world for arjen robben robben admitted that group c was probably the toughest of the first stage and that a moment 's hesitation could prove fatal in deciding who progressed to the second round . " i do n't really want to think about the tournament as a whole at the moment but rather focus on the first match against serbia-montenegro , " said robben .
" they are a solid side with classy individuals .
but we also have a squad packed with quality .
we think together , we play really tightly and i am very confident . " " the dutch have players who can take us a long way in the tournament , " robben added .
" however we have to stay alert .
because in our group it may be the merest thing that makes the difference .
it will be a shame to play well but to lose everything because of a slip of concentration . " serb defender goran gavrancic , who plays for dynamo kiev , said : " it is realistic that we can record a good result against the netherlands .

" instead i would like us to rubberstamp the idea that we feel good when we play in germany . " " we should benefit from playing so close to home , " van basten said as 15,000 fans turned out to watch the first public dutch training session in freiburg on thursday . " we sense this enthusiasm .
it is now for the players to take that onto the pitch , " said the coach who raised some eyebrows before the tournament when he ditched several of the old guard such as midfielders clarence seedorf and edgar davids , who were often linked with dressing room dissent . winger robben looking no further than opening game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first serbia & montenegro then the world for arjen robben robben admitted that group c was probably the toughest of the first stage and that a moment 's hesitation could prove fatal in deciding who progressed to the second round . " i do n't really want to think about the tournament as a whole at the moment but rather focus on the first match against serbia-montenegro , " said robben .
" they are a solid side with classy individuals .
but we also have a squad packed with quality .
we think together , we play really tightly and i am very confident . " " the dutch have players who can take us a long way in the tournament , " robben added .
" however we have to stay alert .
because in our group it may be the merest thing that makes the difference .
it will be a shame to play well but to lose everything because of a slip of concentration . " serb defender goran gavrancic , who plays for dynamo kiev , said : " it is realistic that we can record a good result against the netherlands .

dw-world.de spoke with national coach oleg blokhin about the country 's chances . appointed in 2003 as coach of the ukrainian national team , oleg blokhin is a world cup legend himself .
the ukrainian represented the soviet union in the world cup finals in 1982 and 1986 .
he is regarded as soviet soccer 's best player ever . dw-world.de : ukraine managed to qualify for the world cup for the first time .
what was the key to your success ? oleg blokhin : our single-mindedness and confidence were decisive .
when the world cup qualification rounds first began , no one believed that we would make it , in particular against strong teams such as european champion greece as well as denmark and turkey .
but i still managed to convince my boys that we were up to the challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ukrainian team celebrates after qualifying for the world cup for the first time is the world cup frenzy palpable in ukraine ? just like everywhere else in the world , you have been able to feel the world cup fever in ukraine for the past half year .
you notice it particularly with the growing number of journalists who want to interview me or the national players .
but we could completely focus on the world cup only after the ukrainian national league championships were over on may 14 .
the national team lost a week of preparation due to that .
we could have really used that week for a few players to relax fully before we began with the world cup training . what 's the atmosphere like within the team ?
do you think all that excitement can be damaging ? we 're prepared to perform well and we understand how important the world cup is for the image of our country as well for every individual player .
i notice that our players are slightly excited , but it 's important that we keep together .
the excitement should n't affect our performance ; it 's a normal condition for every player before each game .
if the player does n't feel any excitement , it means that he 's achieved everything and can end his career . which game in the preliminary round do you consider to be the most important ? the game against spain will be important because it 's the first one .
it will strongly determine the further constellation in our group .
but the two other games are equally important ; that 's why we 'll have to give every game our best .
there are no " games to fill the gap " in a world cup and no weak opponents . who 's the most dangerous opponent in group h ?
and why ? spain is one of the favorites of the tournament , and that 's why we 're preparing thoroughly for this game .
but i consider another team to be the most dangerous opponent and that 's tunisia . african teams are famous for springing surprises .
i think a team that 's coached by roger lemerre is capable of surprises during the world cup 2006 . do you also reckon with stiff competition from saudi arabia ? saudi arabia had more time to prepare , and that does play a big role .
i think we do have to take this team seriously ; it certainly wo n't let itself be just a whipping boy . what is the main strength of the ukrainian team ? our strength lies in our team spirit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian star striker shevchenko , center , with teammates and what are your weaknesses ? they include personnel problems as well as injuries that have plagued us during our entire preparation phase .
until now we have n't played any test games in the combination that i 'd like to see on the pitch .
andrei shevchenko , sergei rebrov as well as oleg gusev have only trained separately from the rest of the team until now .
our most important man in the defense line-up , sergei fiodorov , wo n't be there at all due to an injury .
four other players had to take part in the junior european championships in portugal until june 4 and are completely exhausted .
i ca n't rely on them 100 percent . which teams do you think have the best chances of making it to the finals ? brazil , italy and germany .
germany 's playing on home turf .
we have a saying : even the walls help you at home .
in addition , it could very well be that the referees are more partial towards the germans . many experts say the success of the ukrainian team depends on whether andrei shevchenko is fit .
is he the only key player in the team ? it 's true that shevchenko does lead the team .
but we 'll be in good form independent of whether he 'll be fit after his last injury and whether he 's in good shape or not .
our performance is n't only based on his dominating role though his talent , and charisma is really important to us and unpleasant to the opponents . what goals do you have at the world cup ? our first goal is to reach the round of 18 .
if we manage that , then we can identify further goals . tatiana petrenko interviewed oleg blokhin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .
could the amount of games played in a season threaten the prestige of future cups ?
would a compulsory winter break ensure more stars are fit ?
-lrb- may 29 , 2006 -rrb- interviews with the stars dw-world.de 's interview series gives you the chance to hear from the people who have the most to say when it comes to events on world soccer 's biggest stage .
ronaldinho : this will be brazil 's world cup midfielder ronaldinho is considered by many to be the world 's best soccer player .

this includes those who have immigrated to germany themselves and may or may not have a german passport , and those with at least one immigrant parent . these statistics , part of the annual census for the very first time , come after a wave of immigration-related discussions spurred by a recent attack on an ethiopian-german in potsdam .
they also follow a recent exposé on violence and poor conditions in schools with immigrant majorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is the key to integration not everyone fits the mould the census is yet another sign that germany has to tackle the burning issue of integration of immigration and face up to its serious failings in the matter in the past . for decades germany has been content to treat all immigrants like " gastarbeiter " - pretending they will return to their home country at some point . ethnic germans from the former soviet union were hastily given passports after world war two and expected to assimilate on their own . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coexisting is n't enough redefining family the ongoing evolution of the family is another matter raised by the census results , which has both social and political ramifications .
patchwork families , disillusionment with marriage and a lack of willing caretakers for elderly parents are neither new concerns nor are they unique to germany . according to the census , only 1 percent germany 's 39.2 million households have three or more generations . germans are having fewer children , but apparently they are n't caring for their parents .

you notice it particularly with the growing number of journalists who want to interview me or the national players .
but we could completely focus on the world cup only after the ukrainian national league championships were over on may 14 .
the national team lost a week of preparation due to that .
we could have really used that week for a few players to relax fully before we began with the world cup training . what 's the atmosphere like within the team ?
do you think all that excitement can be damaging ? we 're prepared to perform well and we understand how important the world cup is for the image of our country as well for every individual player .
i notice that our players are slightly excited , but it 's important that we keep together .
the excitement should n't affect our performance ; it 's a normal condition for every player before each game .
if the player does n't feel any excitement , it means that he 's achieved everything and can end his career . which game in the preliminary round do you consider to be the most important ? the game against spain will be important because it 's the first one .
it will strongly determine the further constellation in our group .
but the two other games are equally important ; that 's why we 'll have to give every game our best .
there are no " games to fill the gap " in a world cup and no weak opponents . who 's the most dangerous opponent in group h ?
and why ? spain is one of the favorites of the tournament , and that 's why we 're preparing thoroughly for this game .
but i consider another team to be the most dangerous opponent and that 's tunisia . african teams are famous for springing surprises .
i think a team that 's coached by roger lemerre is capable of surprises during the world cup 2006 . do you also reckon with stiff competition from saudi arabia ? saudi arabia had more time to prepare , and that does play a big role .
i think we do have to take this team seriously ; it certainly wo n't let itself be just a whipping boy . what is the main strength of the ukrainian team ? our strength lies in our team spirit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian star striker shevchenko , center , with teammates and what are your weaknesses ? they include personnel problems as well as injuries that have plagued us during our entire preparation phase .
until now we have n't played any test games in the combination that i 'd like to see on the pitch .
andrei shevchenko , sergei rebrov as well as oleg gusev have only trained separately from the rest of the team until now .
our most important man in the defense line-up , sergei fiodorov , wo n't be there at all due to an injury .
four other players had to take part in the junior european championships in portugal until june 4 and are completely exhausted .
i ca n't rely on them 100 percent . which teams do you think have the best chances of making it to the finals ? brazil , italy and germany .
germany 's playing on home turf .
we have a saying : even the walls help you at home .
in addition , it could very well be that the referees are more partial towards the germans . many experts say the success of the ukrainian team depends on whether andrei shevchenko is fit .
is he the only key player in the team ? it 's true that shevchenko does lead the team .
but we 'll be in good form independent of whether he 'll be fit after his last injury and whether he 's in good shape or not .
our performance is n't only based on his dominating role though his talent , and charisma is really important to us and unpleasant to the opponents . what goals do you have at the world cup ? our first goal is to reach the round of 18 .
if we manage that , then we can identify further goals . tatiana petrenko interviewed oleg blokhin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .

" here we have to constantly make presentations .
and that does motivate you because you have to always use the stuff you learn during your time here . " practical application is strongly emphasized at the ota .
most of the lecturers come from business and industry and in addition to the theory they teach , they give students glimpses into the real working world .
doing an internship of several months is the norm here . not a " turkish university " ota is the antithesis of a german state-run university , and the going was n't easy initially , said erman tanyildiz .

the report said that only every tenth child from an immigrant family managed to get into a gymnasium , or high school that eventually leads to university .

german courses at a pre-school age as well as more flexibility in germany 's current school system are crucial , said tanyildiz , since they would enable kids to develop their abilities and decide at a higher age if they wanted to go to university or opt for vocational training . tapping immigrant potential the turkish entrepreneur also pointed out that children from immigrant families had enormous potential - bilingualism and bicultural soft skills - which was often overlooked in germany .

dw-world.de spoke with national coach oleg blokhin about the country 's chances . appointed in 2003 as coach of the ukrainian national team , oleg blokhin is a world cup legend himself .
the ukrainian represented the soviet union in the world cup finals in 1982 and 1986 .
he is regarded as soviet soccer 's best player ever . dw-world.de : ukraine managed to qualify for the world cup for the first time .
what was the key to your success ? oleg blokhin : our single-mindedness and confidence were decisive .
when the world cup qualification rounds first began , no one believed that we would make it , in particular against strong teams such as european champion greece as well as denmark and turkey .
but i still managed to convince my boys that we were up to the challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ukrainian team celebrates after qualifying for the world cup for the first time is the world cup frenzy palpable in ukraine ? just like everywhere else in the world , you have been able to feel the world cup fever in ukraine for the past half year .
you notice it particularly with the growing number of journalists who want to interview me or the national players .
but we could completely focus on the world cup only after the ukrainian national league championships were over on may 14 .
the national team lost a week of preparation due to that .
we could have really used that week for a few players to relax fully before we began with the world cup training . what 's the atmosphere like within the team ?
do you think all that excitement can be damaging ? we 're prepared to perform well and we understand how important the world cup is for the image of our country as well for every individual player .

he is regarded as soviet soccer 's best player ever . dw-world.de : ukraine managed to qualify for the world cup for the first time .
what was the key to your success ? oleg blokhin : our single-mindedness and confidence were decisive .
when the world cup qualification rounds first began , no one believed that we would make it , in particular against strong teams such as european champion greece as well as denmark and turkey .
but i still managed to convince my boys that we were up to the challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ukrainian team celebrates after qualifying for the world cup for the first time is the world cup frenzy palpable in ukraine ? just like everywhere else in the world , you have been able to feel the world cup fever in ukraine for the past half year .
you notice it particularly with the growing number of journalists who want to interview me or the national players .
but we could completely focus on the world cup only after the ukrainian national league championships were over on may 14 .
the national team lost a week of preparation due to that .
we could have really used that week for a few players to relax fully before we began with the world cup training . what 's the atmosphere like within the team ?
do you think all that excitement can be damaging ? we 're prepared to perform well and we understand how important the world cup is for the image of our country as well for every individual player .
i notice that our players are slightly excited , but it 's important that we keep together .
the excitement should n't affect our performance ; it 's a normal condition for every player before each game .
if the player does n't feel any excitement , it means that he 's achieved everything and can end his career . which game in the preliminary round do you consider to be the most important ? the game against spain will be important because it 's the first one .
it will strongly determine the further constellation in our group .
but the two other games are equally important ; that 's why we 'll have to give every game our best .
there are no " games to fill the gap " in a world cup and no weak opponents . who 's the most dangerous opponent in group h ?
and why ? spain is one of the favorites of the tournament , and that 's why we 're preparing thoroughly for this game .
but i consider another team to be the most dangerous opponent and that 's tunisia . african teams are famous for springing surprises .
i think a team that 's coached by roger lemerre is capable of surprises during the world cup 2006 . do you also reckon with stiff competition from saudi arabia ? saudi arabia had more time to prepare , and that does play a big role .
i think we do have to take this team seriously ; it certainly wo n't let itself be just a whipping boy . what is the main strength of the ukrainian team ? our strength lies in our team spirit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian star striker shevchenko , center , with teammates and what are your weaknesses ? they include personnel problems as well as injuries that have plagued us during our entire preparation phase .
until now we have n't played any test games in the combination that i 'd like to see on the pitch .
andrei shevchenko , sergei rebrov as well as oleg gusev have only trained separately from the rest of the team until now .
our most important man in the defense line-up , sergei fiodorov , wo n't be there at all due to an injury .
four other players had to take part in the junior european championships in portugal until june 4 and are completely exhausted .
i ca n't rely on them 100 percent . which teams do you think have the best chances of making it to the finals ? brazil , italy and germany .
germany 's playing on home turf .
we have a saying : even the walls help you at home .
in addition , it could very well be that the referees are more partial towards the germans . many experts say the success of the ukrainian team depends on whether andrei shevchenko is fit .
is he the only key player in the team ? it 's true that shevchenko does lead the team .
but we 'll be in good form independent of whether he 'll be fit after his last injury and whether he 's in good shape or not .
our performance is n't only based on his dominating role though his talent , and charisma is really important to us and unpleasant to the opponents . what goals do you have at the world cup ? our first goal is to reach the round of 18 .
if we manage that , then we can identify further goals . tatiana petrenko interviewed oleg blokhin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .

1. min .
we 're off portugal starts with the ball .
1. min .
what a start it is ! 14 seconds into the game and the ball is already rolling past the far post .
pauleta nearly got possibly the fastest goal in world cup history .
3. min .
figo crosses and angolan keeper joao ricardo gets his hands on the ball that was too close to his goal for portugal to make anything of .
3. min .
goal portugal ! 4. min .
pauleta did n't waste any time taking the pass from figo , who drew two defenders toward him , and drilling it into the back of the net .
7. min .
cutting the whole defense c. ronaldo dribbles through half the angola defense and is only stopped by stepping on the ball himself .
8. min .
corner angola akwa gives ricardo a bit of push while going up to head the ball away from the goalie and is called for a foul .
10. min .
akwa goes down after giving up one goal , angola push forward with a drive down the right side and akwa is able to head a weak ball towards to goal before falling to the ground .
12. min .
portugal line up a free kick .
12. min .
petit fires a shot that will certainly leave a bruise into the 4-man wall .
15. min .
joao ricardo hit in the stomach a collision between pauleta 's shin and the angolan keeper 's midsection has ricardo on the ground .
hopefully he 's only had the wind knocked out of him .
16. min .
with a bit of ice and a stretch , he 's ready to continue between the pipes .
18. min .
delgado tosses in a short throw-in ; miguel is there first to clear it to midfield .
19. min .
portugal are slowing down the portuguese players are slowing down the game 's tempo , making the rough and tumble angolans look decent .
22. min .
lonely in the back the portuguese defenders have moved up to midfield , leaving goalkeeper ricardo with only the fans in the stands behind the goal to chat to .
24. min .
simano and figo pass between each other , and simano puts the ball over goal , much to ronaldo 's chagrin as he was wide open on the flank .
24. min .
angola shoots mateus unloads from 35 yards out .
the ball sails over the crossbar , but it was enough for fans of both teams to take a gasp .
25. min .
akwa earns praise a bike kick inside the penalty area and now the portuguese defenders are beginning to pull at the forward 's jersey . maybe angola is n't as harmless as everyone thought ? 26. min .
yellow for c. ronaldo the ref warns ronaldo that he is n't at a judo match and gives yellow for a violent kick .
28. min .
this time jamba gets yellow a late tackle earns a booking for the angolan defender .
30. min .
half and hour into the game and angola are showing their passion for soccer with drives forward and aggressive attacks on every 50-50 ball .
32. min .
surprised that the ball landed in front of him , ronaldo is n't able to convert on a cross alone at goal .
34. min .
figueiredo tries his luck at a long-range shot , but it floats well-wide of the post .
35. min .
ding !
ronaldo hammers a header off a figo corner solidly into the crossbar and grabs at his hair in desperation .
37. min .
stymied by delgado 's arm , ronaldo , a well-known hot head who has already been booked once , works to keep his emotions in check .
38. min .
pauleta does n't get any power behind his header and joao ricardo collects it and send the ball to soaring to the center circle .
40. min .
simano slips at the edge of the box , the fans want a penalty kick , but the portuguese player does n't give the referee a look .
42. min .
ronaldo fouled again .
are the angolans trying to provoke him into getting another card and tossed out of the game ? 43. min .
macanga rifles a shot at goal that ricardo can only block over the end line .
nothing comes of the resulting corner .
45. min .
ronaldo rockets a shot after receiving the back pass and ricardo parries it in all-star style .
another case of bad luck for the portuguese .
two minutes of injury time in cologne .
45 + 2. min .
yellow for loco an extended leg attack against figo gets loco a place in the ref 's book .
45 + 2. min .
that 's it for the first half though the scoreboard does n't show the expected blowout -lrb- yet ? -rrb- , on the field , today 's third game has looked like the varsity scrimmaging the jv team .
whenever figo and co. pick up the pace it 's all angola can do to follow the ball back .
46. min .
the second half is underway ! 46. min .
no changes to either team for the second 45 minutes .
47. min .
tiago lifts the ball to simano , ricardo is there to stop the shot .
48. min .
just three minutes in , but ... ... the angolan defenders are doing a better job of swarming around the ball in their own end , keeping portugal from stringing together their trademark passes .
50. min .
what did i do ?
tiago draws a foul in a dangerous spot for figo 's foot .
51. min .
unsure of himself in the goal box , ricardo looses the ball but can take heart in the fact he may have missed it because he was pushed .
52. min .
macanga gets yellow macanga takes out the legs of luis figo - right in front of the ref 's eyes - and is booked .
55. min .
not until the portuguese get into the penalty box , do the angolans seem willing to defend .
57. min .
figo 's corner too long but loco heads it over the line for another corner .
simano shoots , but it 's blocked easily .

they could have jumped to the lead in the 11th minute , but striker vahid hashemian twice failed to find the net from short range . mexico looked nervous , as though they were afraid of not living up to their role as group favorites behind portugal .
it took them around 20 minutes to settle down and create viable chances on goal , especially on set plays . in the 27th minute they took the lead .
omar bravo directed the ball into the net , after guillermo franco headed on a pavel pardo free-kick . iran struck back some eight minutes later .
yahya golmohammadi slotted home a corner-kick by midfielder mehdi mahdavikia to level the match up as the first half whistle blew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bravo should have raised two fingers for his pair of goals mexico make game clear in second half mexico started the second half with a shock , when their top striker jared borgetti limped off the pitch in the 51st minute .
still , the mexicans proved to be the better team , having much more of the ball and pinning the iranians in their own half of the field . but mexico needed a bit of help to regain the lead .
mistakes by iranian keeper ebrahim mirzapour and defender rahman rezaei gifted the ball to mexican substitute sinha in the 76th minute .
he quickly found bravo , who put mexico back on top with his second goal of the day . iran looked exhausted , and a couple of minutes later , they allowed sinha to sprint into the penalty area and put the game away with a nifty header .
iran was done .
mexico began their campaign well with a 3-1 win , while iran will have to recover for their make-or-break match against angola on june 16 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crunch time comes early for iran against seeded mexico mexico will be looking to kill off iran 's world cup hopes at the first hurdle on sunday as the world number four begin their campaign to make it past the quarter-finals for the first time .

one private university in berlin started by a turkish industrialist bucks the trend . bright corridors , potted plants on window sills , an assortment of newspapers and magazines and young people hurrying around with laptops under their arms - the ota private university in berlin is a far cry from the scruffy lecture halls seen in most universities across germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lecture halls are usually full at state-run german universities students here learn in small groups instead of in usually overflowing classrooms .
and studying here is a full-time job - students cram market models and economic theory from nine in the morning until five in the afternoon . practical application important fatih aslan , a student of turkish origin - like most of the around 100 students at ota - is studying for an mba and plans to do his bachelor 's degree in a year .
the study program costs about 600 euros a month - expensive by german standards , but worth every euro , says aslan . " my best friend is studying at a state-run university and i get to hear from him of how dry it is and far-removed from practical applications , " said aslan .
" here we have to constantly make presentations .
and that does motivate you because you have to always use the stuff you learn during your time here . " practical application is strongly emphasized at the ota .
most of the lecturers come from business and industry and in addition to the theory they teach , they give students glimpses into the real working world .
doing an internship of several months is the norm here . not a " turkish university " ota is the antithesis of a german state-run university , and the going was n't easy initially , said erman tanyildiz .
the turkish businessmen who came to germany to study in the 1970s set up his own successful business empire and ended up investing his fortune in the private university . " nobody rolled out the red carpet for me when i first came up with the idea , " said tanyildiz .
" it took about two years before the authorities took me seriously .
they were very skeptical when they saw that off all people , a turk wanted to invest four million dm in a foundation .
they probably thought it was for something bad . " at the same time tanyildiz does n't like the ota to be referred to as a " turkish university . "
he says it 's open to all and wants to offer a chance in particular to those who lose out in the cut-throat competition for a decent education . immigrant kids losing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids from immigrants families are usually the losers when it comes to education and jobs most of the current misery plaguing children with immigrant backgrounds in germany reflects the country 's decades-long neglect when it came to integrating its immigrants , says tanyildiz . last month , a study by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- showed that germany is largely failing children from immigrant families .
the report said that only every tenth child from an immigrant family managed to get into a gymnasium , or high school that eventually leads to university .
while every third german studies at a university , only eight percent of immigrant children do so , the study found . " in the 1960s germany needed cheap labor that could do all the backbreaking work .
critical academics would have proved more of a burden , " said tanyildiz .
" they -lrb- cheap workers -rrb- were n't given a chance to educate themselves but rather were treated as ' guests ' for generations .
how do people who perhaps themselves ca n't read and write educate their children and tell them about the importance of a good education ? " tanyildiz says the key lies in language .
german courses at a pre-school age as well as more flexibility in germany 's current school system are crucial , said tanyildiz , since they would enable kids to develop their abilities and decide at a higher age if they wanted to go to university or opt for vocational training . tapping immigrant potential the turkish entrepreneur also pointed out that children from immigrant families had enormous potential - bilingualism and bicultural soft skills - which was often overlooked in germany .
at the ota , kids from such families are considered a benefit , not a deficit , tanyildiz said . " what we 're also doing is preparing a bit of the groundwork for turkey 's eu membership .
already there 's intensive economic cooperation between turkey and europe , " tanyildiz said .
" and there we need well-trained leaders who are familiar with several cultures and languages and are rooted in them . " people like fatih aslan are prime examples .

it was the first census to cover health and immigration . the recently announced results of the 2005 national census in germany have given an official face to what has been fairly obvious : germans are getting fatter -lrb- 58 percent men and 42 percent of women are overweight -rrb- and more than a quarter of them still ca n't kick their smoking habit . who is german ? of greater political significance however , is the finding , presented on tuesday by president of the federal office of statistics johann hahlen , that nearly one fifth of all germans -lrb- 15.3 million people or 19 percent of the population -rrb- have an immigrant background .
this includes those who have immigrated to germany themselves and may or may not have a german passport , and those with at least one immigrant parent . these statistics , part of the annual census for the very first time , come after a wave of immigration-related discussions spurred by a recent attack on an ethiopian-german in potsdam .
they also follow a recent exposé on violence and poor conditions in schools with immigrant majorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is the key to integration not everyone fits the mould the census is yet another sign that germany has to tackle the burning issue of integration of immigration and face up to its serious failings in the matter in the past . for decades germany has been content to treat all immigrants like " gastarbeiter " - pretending they will return to their home country at some point . ethnic germans from the former soviet union were hastily given passports after world war two and expected to assimilate on their own . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coexisting is n't enough redefining family the ongoing evolution of the family is another matter raised by the census results , which has both social and political ramifications .
patchwork families , disillusionment with marriage and a lack of willing caretakers for elderly parents are neither new concerns nor are they unique to germany . according to the census , only 1 percent germany 's 39.2 million households have three or more generations . germans are having fewer children , but apparently they are n't caring for their parents .
the elderly are n't living with their children -lrb- 22 percent of german households consist exclusively of individuals above the age of 65 -rrb- and nor are the middle-aged -lrb- 24 percent of couples live without children -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german men , especially divorced men , tend to smoke more than german women taking stock the census results bring warnings as well as reason for cautious optimism .
the country is rich in cultural diversity but is recognizing the need to rethink its immigration strategy . and even if smoking rates are high , they are down 2 percent than in 1999 .

dw-world.de spoke with national coach oleg blokhin about the country 's chances . appointed in 2003 as coach of the ukrainian national team , oleg blokhin is a world cup legend himself .
the ukrainian represented the soviet union in the world cup finals in 1982 and 1986 .
he is regarded as soviet soccer 's best player ever . dw-world.de : ukraine managed to qualify for the world cup for the first time .
what was the key to your success ? oleg blokhin : our single-mindedness and confidence were decisive .
when the world cup qualification rounds first began , no one believed that we would make it , in particular against strong teams such as european champion greece as well as denmark and turkey .
but i still managed to convince my boys that we were up to the challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ukrainian team celebrates after qualifying for the world cup for the first time is the world cup frenzy palpable in ukraine ? just like everywhere else in the world , you have been able to feel the world cup fever in ukraine for the past half year .
you notice it particularly with the growing number of journalists who want to interview me or the national players .
but we could completely focus on the world cup only after the ukrainian national league championships were over on may 14 .
the national team lost a week of preparation due to that .
we could have really used that week for a few players to relax fully before we began with the world cup training . what 's the atmosphere like within the team ?
do you think all that excitement can be damaging ? we 're prepared to perform well and we understand how important the world cup is for the image of our country as well for every individual player .
i notice that our players are slightly excited , but it 's important that we keep together .
the excitement should n't affect our performance ; it 's a normal condition for every player before each game .
if the player does n't feel any excitement , it means that he 's achieved everything and can end his career . which game in the preliminary round do you consider to be the most important ? the game against spain will be important because it 's the first one .
it will strongly determine the further constellation in our group .
but the two other games are equally important ; that 's why we 'll have to give every game our best .
there are no " games to fill the gap " in a world cup and no weak opponents . who 's the most dangerous opponent in group h ?
and why ? spain is one of the favorites of the tournament , and that 's why we 're preparing thoroughly for this game .
but i consider another team to be the most dangerous opponent and that 's tunisia . african teams are famous for springing surprises .
i think a team that 's coached by roger lemerre is capable of surprises during the world cup 2006 . do you also reckon with stiff competition from saudi arabia ? saudi arabia had more time to prepare , and that does play a big role .
i think we do have to take this team seriously ; it certainly wo n't let itself be just a whipping boy . what is the main strength of the ukrainian team ? our strength lies in our team spirit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian star striker shevchenko , center , with teammates and what are your weaknesses ? they include personnel problems as well as injuries that have plagued us during our entire preparation phase .
until now we have n't played any test games in the combination that i 'd like to see on the pitch .
andrei shevchenko , sergei rebrov as well as oleg gusev have only trained separately from the rest of the team until now .
our most important man in the defense line-up , sergei fiodorov , wo n't be there at all due to an injury .
four other players had to take part in the junior european championships in portugal until june 4 and are completely exhausted .
i ca n't rely on them 100 percent . which teams do you think have the best chances of making it to the finals ? brazil , italy and germany .
germany 's playing on home turf .
we have a saying : even the walls help you at home .
in addition , it could very well be that the referees are more partial towards the germans . many experts say the success of the ukrainian team depends on whether andrei shevchenko is fit .
is he the only key player in the team ? it 's true that shevchenko does lead the team .
but we 'll be in good form independent of whether he 'll be fit after his last injury and whether he 's in good shape or not .
our performance is n't only based on his dominating role though his talent , and charisma is really important to us and unpleasant to the opponents . what goals do you have at the world cup ? our first goal is to reach the round of 18 .
if we manage that , then we can identify further goals . tatiana petrenko interviewed oleg blokhin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .

sanchez 's availability for the game will depend on his mental and emotional state . the opening match is seen as critical to the hopes of both teams in a group which also contains portugal and angola . " this is the most important game .
we know the game against portugal will be really hard also so we really need to gain points in this game , " said iran skipper ali daei . mexico will hope to shrug off sanchez 's likely absence and their own unpromising build-up which saw them lose 2-1 to a second-string netherlands team . however a fourth-place finish in last year 's confederations cup - including a 1-0 win over brazil - and a 20-match unbeaten streak have instilled a strong sense of self-belief in ricardo lavolpe 's squad . " mexico are very compact , aggressive and fast - actually , they 're excellent , " said lavolpe 's opposite number branko ivankovic . " sometimes they 're playing very boring , but very successful . " mexico looking to justify top four ranking key player is barcelona rock rafael marquez , who will be looking to make amends for his red card in the knock-out defeat to the united states four years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talismanic jared borgetti -lrb- l . -rrb- has a point to prove mexico 's all-time top-scorer jared borgetti , who totted up a world-best 14 goals in qualifying , will be hoping to send a message to club manager sam allardyce who left him languishing on the bolton bench this season . mexico have qualified for 13 world cups but have never done better than the last eight on home ground in 1970 and 1986 , reaching the second round in the last three competitions . lavolpe , a member of argentina 's 1978 world cup-winning squad , has courted controversy by calling up naturalised mexicans guillermo franco and antonio naelson , while axing legendary striker cuauhtemoc blanco . iran 's walking wounded already at a disadvantage meanwhile iran , who have set their sights on making round two for the first time , look to have serious problems with several players either ruled out or recovering from injury . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's players who are fit face a tough time against mexico with key attackers ali karimi and mehdi mahdavikia coming back from ankle and back trouble respectively , defender sattar zare twisted a knee in training and midfielder fereydoon zandi also looks likely to miss out after coming down with a fever . however iran , who have plundered a mine of information on their opponents , remain optimistic that the asian giants could spring a surprise in their " most important game " . " our coaching staff is analysing mexico really well and every player is aware of the mexican players and their style of the game .
we know how to play against mexico , " said captain daei . " i think winning against mexico is not unreachable .
mexico is a very good team but it 's not unbeatable . " the match also has a political dimension with iran , under fire for their president 's comments about the holocaust , playing in the former nazi stronghold of nuremberg . mexico won the two teams ' only previous encounter , a friendly on june 9 , 2001 which ended 2-1 . mexico -lrb- 5-3-2 -rrb- : 1-oswaldo sanchez ; 3-carlos salcido , 14-gonzalo pineda -lrb- 30-1 -rrb- , 4-rafael marquez -lrb- 65-7 -rrb- , 5-ricardo osorio , 15-jose antonio castro ; 6-gerardo torrado , 7-antonio naelson , 8-pavel pardo ; 9-jared borgetti , 10-guillemro franco . coach : ricardo lavolpe iran : -lrb- 4-2-3-1 -rrb- : 1-ebrahim mirzapour ; 13-hossein kaebi , 5-rahman rezaei , 4-yahya golmohammadi , 20-mohammad nosrati ; 2-mehdi mahdavikia , 6-javan nekonam ; 14-andranik teymourian , 9-vahid hashemian , 8-ali karimi ; 10-ali daei coach : branko ivankovic dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ahmadinejad would face cool reception at world cup berlin was reserved in its response to iran 's president saying he would come to the world cup if his team made it beyond the first round .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : education in europe : a right not a privilege school in the afternoon is new to germany , but catching on sex education patchy in europe call for european history book as education ministers meet berlin school wants to profit from education germany -pipe- 11.06.2006 private berlin university taps immigrant potential großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students from immigrant families are n't a common phenomenon at german universities a recent study showed that most children from immigrant families perform disastrously at school and subsequently in the job market .
one private university in berlin started by a turkish industrialist bucks the trend . bright corridors , potted plants on window sills , an assortment of newspapers and magazines and young people hurrying around with laptops under their arms - the ota private university in berlin is a far cry from the scruffy lecture halls seen in most universities across germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lecture halls are usually full at state-run german universities students here learn in small groups instead of in usually overflowing classrooms .
and studying here is a full-time job - students cram market models and economic theory from nine in the morning until five in the afternoon . practical application important fatih aslan , a student of turkish origin - like most of the around 100 students at ota - is studying for an mba and plans to do his bachelor 's degree in a year .
the study program costs about 600 euros a month - expensive by german standards , but worth every euro , says aslan . " my best friend is studying at a state-run university and i get to hear from him of how dry it is and far-removed from practical applications , " said aslan .
" here we have to constantly make presentations .
and that does motivate you because you have to always use the stuff you learn during your time here . " practical application is strongly emphasized at the ota .
most of the lecturers come from business and industry and in addition to the theory they teach , they give students glimpses into the real working world .
doing an internship of several months is the norm here . not a " turkish university " ota is the antithesis of a german state-run university , and the going was n't easy initially , said erman tanyildiz .
the turkish businessmen who came to germany to study in the 1970s set up his own successful business empire and ended up investing his fortune in the private university . " nobody rolled out the red carpet for me when i first came up with the idea , " said tanyildiz .
" it took about two years before the authorities took me seriously .
they were very skeptical when they saw that off all people , a turk wanted to invest four million dm in a foundation .
they probably thought it was for something bad . " at the same time tanyildiz does n't like the ota to be referred to as a " turkish university . "
he says it 's open to all and wants to offer a chance in particular to those who lose out in the cut-throat competition for a decent education . immigrant kids losing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids from immigrants families are usually the losers when it comes to education and jobs most of the current misery plaguing children with immigrant backgrounds in germany reflects the country 's decades-long neglect when it came to integrating its immigrants , says tanyildiz . last month , a study by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- showed that germany is largely failing children from immigrant families .
the report said that only every tenth child from an immigrant family managed to get into a gymnasium , or high school that eventually leads to university .
while every third german studies at a university , only eight percent of immigrant children do so , the study found . " in the 1960s germany needed cheap labor that could do all the backbreaking work .
critical academics would have proved more of a burden , " said tanyildiz .
" they -lrb- cheap workers -rrb- were n't given a chance to educate themselves but rather were treated as ' guests ' for generations .
how do people who perhaps themselves ca n't read and write educate their children and tell them about the importance of a good education ? " tanyildiz says the key lies in language .
german courses at a pre-school age as well as more flexibility in germany 's current school system are crucial , said tanyildiz , since they would enable kids to develop their abilities and decide at a higher age if they wanted to go to university or opt for vocational training . tapping immigrant potential the turkish entrepreneur also pointed out that children from immigrant families had enormous potential - bilingualism and bicultural soft skills - which was often overlooked in germany .
at the ota , kids from such families are considered a benefit , not a deficit , tanyildiz said . " what we 're also doing is preparing a bit of the groundwork for turkey 's eu membership .
already there 's intensive economic cooperation between turkey and europe , " tanyildiz said .

" instead i would like us to rubberstamp the idea that we feel good when we play in germany . " " we should benefit from playing so close to home , " van basten said as 15,000 fans turned out to watch the first public dutch training session in freiburg on thursday . " we sense this enthusiasm .
it is now for the players to take that onto the pitch , " said the coach who raised some eyebrows before the tournament when he ditched several of the old guard such as midfielders clarence seedorf and edgar davids , who were often linked with dressing room dissent . winger robben looking no further than opening game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first serbia & montenegro then the world for arjen robben robben admitted that group c was probably the toughest of the first stage and that a moment 's hesitation could prove fatal in deciding who progressed to the second round . " i do n't really want to think about the tournament as a whole at the moment but rather focus on the first match against serbia-montenegro , " said robben .
" they are a solid side with classy individuals .
but we also have a squad packed with quality .
we think together , we play really tightly and i am very confident . " " the dutch have players who can take us a long way in the tournament , " robben added .
" however we have to stay alert .
because in our group it may be the merest thing that makes the difference .
it will be a shame to play well but to lose everything because of a slip of concentration . " serb defender goran gavrancic , who plays for dynamo kiev , said : " it is realistic that we can record a good result against the netherlands .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.06.2006 latest census underlines multicultural german reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is waking up and smelling the coffee national census results released this week reveal that germany is fatter , lonelier - and more ethnically diverse than ever before .
it was the first census to cover health and immigration . the recently announced results of the 2005 national census in germany have given an official face to what has been fairly obvious : germans are getting fatter -lrb- 58 percent men and 42 percent of women are overweight -rrb- and more than a quarter of them still ca n't kick their smoking habit . who is german ? of greater political significance however , is the finding , presented on tuesday by president of the federal office of statistics johann hahlen , that nearly one fifth of all germans -lrb- 15.3 million people or 19 percent of the population -rrb- have an immigrant background .
this includes those who have immigrated to germany themselves and may or may not have a german passport , and those with at least one immigrant parent . these statistics , part of the annual census for the very first time , come after a wave of immigration-related discussions spurred by a recent attack on an ethiopian-german in potsdam .
they also follow a recent exposé on violence and poor conditions in schools with immigrant majorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is the key to integration not everyone fits the mould the census is yet another sign that germany has to tackle the burning issue of integration of immigration and face up to its serious failings in the matter in the past . for decades germany has been content to treat all immigrants like " gastarbeiter " - pretending they will return to their home country at some point . ethnic germans from the former soviet union were hastily given passports after world war two and expected to assimilate on their own . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coexisting is n't enough redefining family the ongoing evolution of the family is another matter raised by the census results , which has both social and political ramifications .
patchwork families , disillusionment with marriage and a lack of willing caretakers for elderly parents are neither new concerns nor are they unique to germany . according to the census , only 1 percent germany 's 39.2 million households have three or more generations . germans are having fewer children , but apparently they are n't caring for their parents .
the elderly are n't living with their children -lrb- 22 percent of german households consist exclusively of individuals above the age of 65 -rrb- and nor are the middle-aged -lrb- 24 percent of couples live without children -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german men , especially divorced men , tend to smoke more than german women taking stock the census results bring warnings as well as reason for cautious optimism .
the country is rich in cultural diversity but is recognizing the need to rethink its immigration strategy . and even if smoking rates are high , they are down 2 percent than in 1999 .

dw-world.de spoke with national coach oleg blokhin about the country 's chances . appointed in 2003 as coach of the ukrainian national team , oleg blokhin is a world cup legend himself .
the ukrainian represented the soviet union in the world cup finals in 1982 and 1986 .
he is regarded as soviet soccer 's best player ever . dw-world.de : ukraine managed to qualify for the world cup for the first time .
what was the key to your success ? oleg blokhin : our single-mindedness and confidence were decisive .
when the world cup qualification rounds first began , no one believed that we would make it , in particular against strong teams such as european champion greece as well as denmark and turkey .
but i still managed to convince my boys that we were up to the challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ukrainian team celebrates after qualifying for the world cup for the first time is the world cup frenzy palpable in ukraine ? just like everywhere else in the world , you have been able to feel the world cup fever in ukraine for the past half year .
you notice it particularly with the growing number of journalists who want to interview me or the national players .
but we could completely focus on the world cup only after the ukrainian national league championships were over on may 14 .
the national team lost a week of preparation due to that .
we could have really used that week for a few players to relax fully before we began with the world cup training . what 's the atmosphere like within the team ?
do you think all that excitement can be damaging ? we 're prepared to perform well and we understand how important the world cup is for the image of our country as well for every individual player .
i notice that our players are slightly excited , but it 's important that we keep together .
the excitement should n't affect our performance ; it 's a normal condition for every player before each game .
if the player does n't feel any excitement , it means that he 's achieved everything and can end his career . which game in the preliminary round do you consider to be the most important ? the game against spain will be important because it 's the first one .
it will strongly determine the further constellation in our group .
but the two other games are equally important ; that 's why we 'll have to give every game our best .
there are no " games to fill the gap " in a world cup and no weak opponents . who 's the most dangerous opponent in group h ?
and why ? spain is one of the favorites of the tournament , and that 's why we 're preparing thoroughly for this game .
but i consider another team to be the most dangerous opponent and that 's tunisia . african teams are famous for springing surprises .
i think a team that 's coached by roger lemerre is capable of surprises during the world cup 2006 . do you also reckon with stiff competition from saudi arabia ? saudi arabia had more time to prepare , and that does play a big role .
i think we do have to take this team seriously ; it certainly wo n't let itself be just a whipping boy . what is the main strength of the ukrainian team ? our strength lies in our team spirit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian star striker shevchenko , center , with teammates and what are your weaknesses ? they include personnel problems as well as injuries that have plagued us during our entire preparation phase .
until now we have n't played any test games in the combination that i 'd like to see on the pitch .
andrei shevchenko , sergei rebrov as well as oleg gusev have only trained separately from the rest of the team until now .
our most important man in the defense line-up , sergei fiodorov , wo n't be there at all due to an injury .
four other players had to take part in the junior european championships in portugal until june 4 and are completely exhausted .
i ca n't rely on them 100 percent . which teams do you think have the best chances of making it to the finals ? brazil , italy and germany .
germany 's playing on home turf .
we have a saying : even the walls help you at home .
in addition , it could very well be that the referees are more partial towards the germans . many experts say the success of the ukrainian team depends on whether andrei shevchenko is fit .
is he the only key player in the team ? it 's true that shevchenko does lead the team .
but we 'll be in good form independent of whether he 'll be fit after his last injury and whether he 's in good shape or not .
our performance is n't only based on his dominating role though his talent , and charisma is really important to us and unpleasant to the opponents . what goals do you have at the world cup ? our first goal is to reach the round of 18 .
if we manage that , then we can identify further goals . tatiana petrenko interviewed oleg blokhin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .

sanchez 's availability for the game will depend on his mental and emotional state . the opening match is seen as critical to the hopes of both teams in a group which also contains portugal and angola . " this is the most important game .

the african nation would cherish being able to put their one-time colonial rulers at the bottom of group d. though all but the most devout of angola supporters do n't expect much more than the occasional goal , angolan players are n't willing to give in before the game gets underway . " sunday is a special game for us , " angolan striker love said .
" it 's the first time in the world cup , made all the more special with the great feeling and history between us and portugal .
there 's great excitement back home , the whole country will be watching this game . " portugal sailed through qualifying without losing a single game and are out to enhance their mixed record in the finals while being mindful of avoiding the fate that befell france , embarrassed by former colony senegal in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese refer to their coach simply as " big phil " but luis felipe scolari , who took over the euro 2004 runners-up after guiding brazil to the 2002 title , is not aiming to catch an early flight back to lisbon . portugal sights set on quarter-finals " what we want is to finish in the top eight .
that 's the minimum we 're looking for , " scolari said . " unfortunately in previous years , things did not go well for the portuguese squad , but obviously you also learn with your mistakes , " said defender nuno valente , adding he expects his team to move beyond the first round .

this includes those who have immigrated to germany themselves and may or may not have a german passport , and those with at least one immigrant parent . these statistics , part of the annual census for the very first time , come after a wave of immigration-related discussions spurred by a recent attack on an ethiopian-german in potsdam .

sanchez 's availability for the game will depend on his mental and emotional state . the opening match is seen as critical to the hopes of both teams in a group which also contains portugal and angola . " this is the most important game .
we know the game against portugal will be really hard also so we really need to gain points in this game , " said iran skipper ali daei . mexico will hope to shrug off sanchez 's likely absence and their own unpromising build-up which saw them lose 2-1 to a second-string netherlands team . however a fourth-place finish in last year 's confederations cup - including a 1-0 win over brazil - and a 20-match unbeaten streak have instilled a strong sense of self-belief in ricardo lavolpe 's squad . " mexico are very compact , aggressive and fast - actually , they 're excellent , " said lavolpe 's opposite number branko ivankovic . " sometimes they 're playing very boring , but very successful . " mexico looking to justify top four ranking key player is barcelona rock rafael marquez , who will be looking to make amends for his red card in the knock-out defeat to the united states four years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talismanic jared borgetti -lrb- l . -rrb- has a point to prove mexico 's all-time top-scorer jared borgetti , who totted up a world-best 14 goals in qualifying , will be hoping to send a message to club manager sam allardyce who left him languishing on the bolton bench this season . mexico have qualified for 13 world cups but have never done better than the last eight on home ground in 1970 and 1986 , reaching the second round in the last three competitions . lavolpe , a member of argentina 's 1978 world cup-winning squad , has courted controversy by calling up naturalised mexicans guillermo franco and antonio naelson , while axing legendary striker cuauhtemoc blanco . iran 's walking wounded already at a disadvantage meanwhile iran , who have set their sights on making round two for the first time , look to have serious problems with several players either ruled out or recovering from injury . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's players who are fit face a tough time against mexico with key attackers ali karimi and mehdi mahdavikia coming back from ankle and back trouble respectively , defender sattar zare twisted a knee in training and midfielder fereydoon zandi also looks likely to miss out after coming down with a fever . however iran , who have plundered a mine of information on their opponents , remain optimistic that the asian giants could spring a surprise in their " most important game " . " our coaching staff is analysing mexico really well and every player is aware of the mexican players and their style of the game .
we know how to play against mexico , " said captain daei . " i think winning against mexico is not unreachable .
mexico is a very good team but it 's not unbeatable . " the match also has a political dimension with iran , under fire for their president 's comments about the holocaust , playing in the former nazi stronghold of nuremberg . mexico won the two teams ' only previous encounter , a friendly on june 9 , 2001 which ended 2-1 . mexico -lrb- 5-3-2 -rrb- : 1-oswaldo sanchez ; 3-carlos salcido , 14-gonzalo pineda -lrb- 30-1 -rrb- , 4-rafael marquez -lrb- 65-7 -rrb- , 5-ricardo osorio , 15-jose antonio castro ; 6-gerardo torrado , 7-antonio naelson , 8-pavel pardo ; 9-jared borgetti , 10-guillemro franco . coach : ricardo lavolpe iran : -lrb- 4-2-3-1 -rrb- : 1-ebrahim mirzapour ; 13-hossein kaebi , 5-rahman rezaei , 4-yahya golmohammadi , 20-mohammad nosrati ; 2-mehdi mahdavikia , 6-javan nekonam ; 14-andranik teymourian , 9-vahid hashemian , 8-ali karimi ; 10-ali daei coach : branko ivankovic dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ahmadinejad would face cool reception at world cup berlin was reserved in its response to iran 's president saying he would come to the world cup if his team made it beyond the first round .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : education in europe : a right not a privilege school in the afternoon is new to germany , but catching on sex education patchy in europe call for european history book as education ministers meet berlin school wants to profit from education germany -pipe- 11.06.2006 private berlin university taps immigrant potential großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students from immigrant families are n't a common phenomenon at german universities a recent study showed that most children from immigrant families perform disastrously at school and subsequently in the job market .
one private university in berlin started by a turkish industrialist bucks the trend . bright corridors , potted plants on window sills , an assortment of newspapers and magazines and young people hurrying around with laptops under their arms - the ota private university in berlin is a far cry from the scruffy lecture halls seen in most universities across germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lecture halls are usually full at state-run german universities students here learn in small groups instead of in usually overflowing classrooms .
and studying here is a full-time job - students cram market models and economic theory from nine in the morning until five in the afternoon . practical application important fatih aslan , a student of turkish origin - like most of the around 100 students at ota - is studying for an mba and plans to do his bachelor 's degree in a year .
the study program costs about 600 euros a month - expensive by german standards , but worth every euro , says aslan . " my best friend is studying at a state-run university and i get to hear from him of how dry it is and far-removed from practical applications , " said aslan .
" here we have to constantly make presentations .
and that does motivate you because you have to always use the stuff you learn during your time here . " practical application is strongly emphasized at the ota .
most of the lecturers come from business and industry and in addition to the theory they teach , they give students glimpses into the real working world .
doing an internship of several months is the norm here . not a " turkish university " ota is the antithesis of a german state-run university , and the going was n't easy initially , said erman tanyildiz .
the turkish businessmen who came to germany to study in the 1970s set up his own successful business empire and ended up investing his fortune in the private university . " nobody rolled out the red carpet for me when i first came up with the idea , " said tanyildiz .
" it took about two years before the authorities took me seriously .
they were very skeptical when they saw that off all people , a turk wanted to invest four million dm in a foundation .
they probably thought it was for something bad . " at the same time tanyildiz does n't like the ota to be referred to as a " turkish university . "
he says it 's open to all and wants to offer a chance in particular to those who lose out in the cut-throat competition for a decent education . immigrant kids losing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids from immigrants families are usually the losers when it comes to education and jobs most of the current misery plaguing children with immigrant backgrounds in germany reflects the country 's decades-long neglect when it came to integrating its immigrants , says tanyildiz . last month , a study by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- showed that germany is largely failing children from immigrant families .
the report said that only every tenth child from an immigrant family managed to get into a gymnasium , or high school that eventually leads to university .
while every third german studies at a university , only eight percent of immigrant children do so , the study found . " in the 1960s germany needed cheap labor that could do all the backbreaking work .
critical academics would have proved more of a burden , " said tanyildiz .
" they -lrb- cheap workers -rrb- were n't given a chance to educate themselves but rather were treated as ' guests ' for generations .
how do people who perhaps themselves ca n't read and write educate their children and tell them about the importance of a good education ? " tanyildiz says the key lies in language .
german courses at a pre-school age as well as more flexibility in germany 's current school system are crucial , said tanyildiz , since they would enable kids to develop their abilities and decide at a higher age if they wanted to go to university or opt for vocational training . tapping immigrant potential the turkish entrepreneur also pointed out that children from immigrant families had enormous potential - bilingualism and bicultural soft skills - which was often overlooked in germany .
at the ota , kids from such families are considered a benefit , not a deficit , tanyildiz said . " what we 're also doing is preparing a bit of the groundwork for turkey 's eu membership .
already there 's intensive economic cooperation between turkey and europe , " tanyildiz said .
" and there we need well-trained leaders who are familiar with several cultures and languages and are rooted in them . " people like fatih aslan are prime examples .

one private university in berlin started by a turkish industrialist bucks the trend . bright corridors , potted plants on window sills , an assortment of newspapers and magazines and young people hurrying around with laptops under their arms - the ota private university in berlin is a far cry from the scruffy lecture halls seen in most universities across germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lecture halls are usually full at state-run german universities students here learn in small groups instead of in usually overflowing classrooms .
and studying here is a full-time job - students cram market models and economic theory from nine in the morning until five in the afternoon . practical application important fatih aslan , a student of turkish origin - like most of the around 100 students at ota - is studying for an mba and plans to do his bachelor 's degree in a year .
the study program costs about 600 euros a month - expensive by german standards , but worth every euro , says aslan . " my best friend is studying at a state-run university and i get to hear from him of how dry it is and far-removed from practical applications , " said aslan .
" here we have to constantly make presentations .
and that does motivate you because you have to always use the stuff you learn during your time here . " practical application is strongly emphasized at the ota .
most of the lecturers come from business and industry and in addition to the theory they teach , they give students glimpses into the real working world .
doing an internship of several months is the norm here . not a " turkish university " ota is the antithesis of a german state-run university , and the going was n't easy initially , said erman tanyildiz .
the turkish businessmen who came to germany to study in the 1970s set up his own successful business empire and ended up investing his fortune in the private university . " nobody rolled out the red carpet for me when i first came up with the idea , " said tanyildiz .
" it took about two years before the authorities took me seriously .
they were very skeptical when they saw that off all people , a turk wanted to invest four million dm in a foundation .
they probably thought it was for something bad . " at the same time tanyildiz does n't like the ota to be referred to as a " turkish university . "
he says it 's open to all and wants to offer a chance in particular to those who lose out in the cut-throat competition for a decent education . immigrant kids losing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids from immigrants families are usually the losers when it comes to education and jobs most of the current misery plaguing children with immigrant backgrounds in germany reflects the country 's decades-long neglect when it came to integrating its immigrants , says tanyildiz . last month , a study by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- showed that germany is largely failing children from immigrant families .
the report said that only every tenth child from an immigrant family managed to get into a gymnasium , or high school that eventually leads to university .
while every third german studies at a university , only eight percent of immigrant children do so , the study found . " in the 1960s germany needed cheap labor that could do all the backbreaking work .
critical academics would have proved more of a burden , " said tanyildiz .
" they -lrb- cheap workers -rrb- were n't given a chance to educate themselves but rather were treated as ' guests ' for generations .
how do people who perhaps themselves ca n't read and write educate their children and tell them about the importance of a good education ? " tanyildiz says the key lies in language .
german courses at a pre-school age as well as more flexibility in germany 's current school system are crucial , said tanyildiz , since they would enable kids to develop their abilities and decide at a higher age if they wanted to go to university or opt for vocational training . tapping immigrant potential the turkish entrepreneur also pointed out that children from immigrant families had enormous potential - bilingualism and bicultural soft skills - which was often overlooked in germany .
at the ota , kids from such families are considered a benefit , not a deficit , tanyildiz said . " what we 're also doing is preparing a bit of the groundwork for turkey 's eu membership .
already there 's intensive economic cooperation between turkey and europe , " tanyildiz said .
" and there we need well-trained leaders who are familiar with several cultures and languages and are rooted in them . " people like fatih aslan are prime examples .

one private university in berlin started by a turkish industrialist bucks the trend . bright corridors , potted plants on window sills , an assortment of newspapers and magazines and young people hurrying around with laptops under their arms - the ota private university in berlin is a far cry from the scruffy lecture halls seen in most universities across germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lecture halls are usually full at state-run german universities students here learn in small groups instead of in usually overflowing classrooms .
and studying here is a full-time job - students cram market models and economic theory from nine in the morning until five in the afternoon . practical application important fatih aslan , a student of turkish origin - like most of the around 100 students at ota - is studying for an mba and plans to do his bachelor 's degree in a year .
the study program costs about 600 euros a month - expensive by german standards , but worth every euro , says aslan . " my best friend is studying at a state-run university and i get to hear from him of how dry it is and far-removed from practical applications , " said aslan .
" here we have to constantly make presentations .
and that does motivate you because you have to always use the stuff you learn during your time here . " practical application is strongly emphasized at the ota .
most of the lecturers come from business and industry and in addition to the theory they teach , they give students glimpses into the real working world .
doing an internship of several months is the norm here . not a " turkish university " ota is the antithesis of a german state-run university , and the going was n't easy initially , said erman tanyildiz .
the turkish businessmen who came to germany to study in the 1970s set up his own successful business empire and ended up investing his fortune in the private university . " nobody rolled out the red carpet for me when i first came up with the idea , " said tanyildiz .
" it took about two years before the authorities took me seriously .
they were very skeptical when they saw that off all people , a turk wanted to invest four million dm in a foundation .
they probably thought it was for something bad . " at the same time tanyildiz does n't like the ota to be referred to as a " turkish university . "
he says it 's open to all and wants to offer a chance in particular to those who lose out in the cut-throat competition for a decent education . immigrant kids losing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids from immigrants families are usually the losers when it comes to education and jobs most of the current misery plaguing children with immigrant backgrounds in germany reflects the country 's decades-long neglect when it came to integrating its immigrants , says tanyildiz . last month , a study by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- showed that germany is largely failing children from immigrant families .
the report said that only every tenth child from an immigrant family managed to get into a gymnasium , or high school that eventually leads to university .
while every third german studies at a university , only eight percent of immigrant children do so , the study found . " in the 1960s germany needed cheap labor that could do all the backbreaking work .
critical academics would have proved more of a burden , " said tanyildiz .
" they -lrb- cheap workers -rrb- were n't given a chance to educate themselves but rather were treated as ' guests ' for generations .
how do people who perhaps themselves ca n't read and write educate their children and tell them about the importance of a good education ? " tanyildiz says the key lies in language .
german courses at a pre-school age as well as more flexibility in germany 's current school system are crucial , said tanyildiz , since they would enable kids to develop their abilities and decide at a higher age if they wanted to go to university or opt for vocational training . tapping immigrant potential the turkish entrepreneur also pointed out that children from immigrant families had enormous potential - bilingualism and bicultural soft skills - which was often overlooked in germany .
at the ota , kids from such families are considered a benefit , not a deficit , tanyildiz said . " what we 're also doing is preparing a bit of the groundwork for turkey 's eu membership .
already there 's intensive economic cooperation between turkey and europe , " tanyildiz said .
" and there we need well-trained leaders who are familiar with several cultures and languages and are rooted in them . " people like fatih aslan are prime examples .

" instead i would like us to rubberstamp the idea that we feel good when we play in germany . " " we should benefit from playing so close to home , " van basten said as 15,000 fans turned out to watch the first public dutch training session in freiburg on thursday . " we sense this enthusiasm .
it is now for the players to take that onto the pitch , " said the coach who raised some eyebrows before the tournament when he ditched several of the old guard such as midfielders clarence seedorf and edgar davids , who were often linked with dressing room dissent . winger robben looking no further than opening game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first serbia & montenegro then the world for arjen robben robben admitted that group c was probably the toughest of the first stage and that a moment 's hesitation could prove fatal in deciding who progressed to the second round . " i do n't really want to think about the tournament as a whole at the moment but rather focus on the first match against serbia-montenegro , " said robben .
" they are a solid side with classy individuals .
but we also have a squad packed with quality .
we think together , we play really tightly and i am very confident . " " the dutch have players who can take us a long way in the tournament , " robben added .
" however we have to stay alert .
because in our group it may be the merest thing that makes the difference .
it will be a shame to play well but to lose everything because of a slip of concentration . " serb defender goran gavrancic , who plays for dynamo kiev , said : " it is realistic that we can record a good result against the netherlands .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.06.2006 latest census underlines multicultural german reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is waking up and smelling the coffee national census results released this week reveal that germany is fatter , lonelier - and more ethnically diverse than ever before .
it was the first census to cover health and immigration . the recently announced results of the 2005 national census in germany have given an official face to what has been fairly obvious : germans are getting fatter -lrb- 58 percent men and 42 percent of women are overweight -rrb- and more than a quarter of them still ca n't kick their smoking habit . who is german ? of greater political significance however , is the finding , presented on tuesday by president of the federal office of statistics johann hahlen , that nearly one fifth of all germans -lrb- 15.3 million people or 19 percent of the population -rrb- have an immigrant background .
this includes those who have immigrated to germany themselves and may or may not have a german passport , and those with at least one immigrant parent . these statistics , part of the annual census for the very first time , come after a wave of immigration-related discussions spurred by a recent attack on an ethiopian-german in potsdam .
they also follow a recent exposé on violence and poor conditions in schools with immigrant majorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is the key to integration not everyone fits the mould the census is yet another sign that germany has to tackle the burning issue of integration of immigration and face up to its serious failings in the matter in the past . for decades germany has been content to treat all immigrants like " gastarbeiter " - pretending they will return to their home country at some point . ethnic germans from the former soviet union were hastily given passports after world war two and expected to assimilate on their own . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coexisting is n't enough redefining family the ongoing evolution of the family is another matter raised by the census results , which has both social and political ramifications .
patchwork families , disillusionment with marriage and a lack of willing caretakers for elderly parents are neither new concerns nor are they unique to germany . according to the census , only 1 percent germany 's 39.2 million households have three or more generations . germans are having fewer children , but apparently they are n't caring for their parents .

" instead i would like us to rubberstamp the idea that we feel good when we play in germany . " " we should benefit from playing so close to home , " van basten said as 15,000 fans turned out to watch the first public dutch training session in freiburg on thursday . " we sense this enthusiasm .
it is now for the players to take that onto the pitch , " said the coach who raised some eyebrows before the tournament when he ditched several of the old guard such as midfielders clarence seedorf and edgar davids , who were often linked with dressing room dissent . winger robben looking no further than opening game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first serbia & montenegro then the world for arjen robben robben admitted that group c was probably the toughest of the first stage and that a moment 's hesitation could prove fatal in deciding who progressed to the second round . " i do n't really want to think about the tournament as a whole at the moment but rather focus on the first match against serbia-montenegro , " said robben .
" they are a solid side with classy individuals .
but we also have a squad packed with quality .
we think together , we play really tightly and i am very confident . " " the dutch have players who can take us a long way in the tournament , " robben added .
" however we have to stay alert .
because in our group it may be the merest thing that makes the difference .
it will be a shame to play well but to lose everything because of a slip of concentration . " serb defender goran gavrancic , who plays for dynamo kiev , said : " it is realistic that we can record a good result against the netherlands .
we have the best defense in the qualifiers , and the netherlands has the best attack .
we want to stop them showing it against us .

it was the first census to cover health and immigration . the recently announced results of the 2005 national census in germany have given an official face to what has been fairly obvious : germans are getting fatter -lrb- 58 percent men and 42 percent of women are overweight -rrb- and more than a quarter of them still ca n't kick their smoking habit . who is german ? of greater political significance however , is the finding , presented on tuesday by president of the federal office of statistics johann hahlen , that nearly one fifth of all germans -lrb- 15.3 million people or 19 percent of the population -rrb- have an immigrant background .
this includes those who have immigrated to germany themselves and may or may not have a german passport , and those with at least one immigrant parent . these statistics , part of the annual census for the very first time , come after a wave of immigration-related discussions spurred by a recent attack on an ethiopian-german in potsdam .
they also follow a recent exposé on violence and poor conditions in schools with immigrant majorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is the key to integration not everyone fits the mould the census is yet another sign that germany has to tackle the burning issue of integration of immigration and face up to its serious failings in the matter in the past . for decades germany has been content to treat all immigrants like " gastarbeiter " - pretending they will return to their home country at some point . ethnic germans from the former soviet union were hastily given passports after world war two and expected to assimilate on their own . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coexisting is n't enough redefining family the ongoing evolution of the family is another matter raised by the census results , which has both social and political ramifications .
patchwork families , disillusionment with marriage and a lack of willing caretakers for elderly parents are neither new concerns nor are they unique to germany . according to the census , only 1 percent germany 's 39.2 million households have three or more generations . germans are having fewer children , but apparently they are n't caring for their parents .
the elderly are n't living with their children -lrb- 22 percent of german households consist exclusively of individuals above the age of 65 -rrb- and nor are the middle-aged -lrb- 24 percent of couples live without children -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german men , especially divorced men , tend to smoke more than german women taking stock the census results bring warnings as well as reason for cautious optimism .
the country is rich in cultural diversity but is recognizing the need to rethink its immigration strategy . and even if smoking rates are high , they are down 2 percent than in 1999 .

it was the first census to cover health and immigration . the recently announced results of the 2005 national census in germany have given an official face to what has been fairly obvious : germans are getting fatter -lrb- 58 percent men and 42 percent of women are overweight -rrb- and more than a quarter of them still ca n't kick their smoking habit . who is german ? of greater political significance however , is the finding , presented on tuesday by president of the federal office of statistics johann hahlen , that nearly one fifth of all germans -lrb- 15.3 million people or 19 percent of the population -rrb- have an immigrant background .
this includes those who have immigrated to germany themselves and may or may not have a german passport , and those with at least one immigrant parent . these statistics , part of the annual census for the very first time , come after a wave of immigration-related discussions spurred by a recent attack on an ethiopian-german in potsdam .
they also follow a recent exposé on violence and poor conditions in schools with immigrant majorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is the key to integration not everyone fits the mould the census is yet another sign that germany has to tackle the burning issue of integration of immigration and face up to its serious failings in the matter in the past . for decades germany has been content to treat all immigrants like " gastarbeiter " - pretending they will return to their home country at some point . ethnic germans from the former soviet union were hastily given passports after world war two and expected to assimilate on their own . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coexisting is n't enough redefining family the ongoing evolution of the family is another matter raised by the census results , which has both social and political ramifications .
patchwork families , disillusionment with marriage and a lack of willing caretakers for elderly parents are neither new concerns nor are they unique to germany . according to the census , only 1 percent germany 's 39.2 million households have three or more generations . germans are having fewer children , but apparently they are n't caring for their parents .

one private university in berlin started by a turkish industrialist bucks the trend . bright corridors , potted plants on window sills , an assortment of newspapers and magazines and young people hurrying around with laptops under their arms - the ota private university in berlin is a far cry from the scruffy lecture halls seen in most universities across germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lecture halls are usually full at state-run german universities students here learn in small groups instead of in usually overflowing classrooms .

the study program costs about 600 euros a month - expensive by german standards , but worth every euro , says aslan . " my best friend is studying at a state-run university and i get to hear from him of how dry it is and far-removed from practical applications , " said aslan .
" here we have to constantly make presentations .
and that does motivate you because you have to always use the stuff you learn during your time here . " practical application is strongly emphasized at the ota .
most of the lecturers come from business and industry and in addition to the theory they teach , they give students glimpses into the real working world .
doing an internship of several months is the norm here . not a " turkish university " ota is the antithesis of a german state-run university , and the going was n't easy initially , said erman tanyildiz .
the turkish businessmen who came to germany to study in the 1970s set up his own successful business empire and ended up investing his fortune in the private university . " nobody rolled out the red carpet for me when i first came up with the idea , " said tanyildiz .
" it took about two years before the authorities took me seriously .
they were very skeptical when they saw that off all people , a turk wanted to invest four million dm in a foundation .
they probably thought it was for something bad . " at the same time tanyildiz does n't like the ota to be referred to as a " turkish university . "
he says it 's open to all and wants to offer a chance in particular to those who lose out in the cut-throat competition for a decent education . immigrant kids losing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids from immigrants families are usually the losers when it comes to education and jobs most of the current misery plaguing children with immigrant backgrounds in germany reflects the country 's decades-long neglect when it came to integrating its immigrants , says tanyildiz . last month , a study by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- showed that germany is largely failing children from immigrant families .
the report said that only every tenth child from an immigrant family managed to get into a gymnasium , or high school that eventually leads to university .
while every third german studies at a university , only eight percent of immigrant children do so , the study found . " in the 1960s germany needed cheap labor that could do all the backbreaking work .
critical academics would have proved more of a burden , " said tanyildiz .
" they -lrb- cheap workers -rrb- were n't given a chance to educate themselves but rather were treated as ' guests ' for generations .
how do people who perhaps themselves ca n't read and write educate their children and tell them about the importance of a good education ? " tanyildiz says the key lies in language .
german courses at a pre-school age as well as more flexibility in germany 's current school system are crucial , said tanyildiz , since they would enable kids to develop their abilities and decide at a higher age if they wanted to go to university or opt for vocational training . tapping immigrant potential the turkish entrepreneur also pointed out that children from immigrant families had enormous potential - bilingualism and bicultural soft skills - which was often overlooked in germany .
at the ota , kids from such families are considered a benefit , not a deficit , tanyildiz said . " what we 're also doing is preparing a bit of the groundwork for turkey 's eu membership .

dw-world.de spoke with national coach oleg blokhin about the country 's chances . appointed in 2003 as coach of the ukrainian national team , oleg blokhin is a world cup legend himself .
the ukrainian represented the soviet union in the world cup finals in 1982 and 1986 .
he is regarded as soviet soccer 's best player ever . dw-world.de : ukraine managed to qualify for the world cup for the first time .
what was the key to your success ? oleg blokhin : our single-mindedness and confidence were decisive .
when the world cup qualification rounds first began , no one believed that we would make it , in particular against strong teams such as european champion greece as well as denmark and turkey .
but i still managed to convince my boys that we were up to the challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ukrainian team celebrates after qualifying for the world cup for the first time is the world cup frenzy palpable in ukraine ? just like everywhere else in the world , you have been able to feel the world cup fever in ukraine for the past half year .
you notice it particularly with the growing number of journalists who want to interview me or the national players .
but we could completely focus on the world cup only after the ukrainian national league championships were over on may 14 .
the national team lost a week of preparation due to that .
we could have really used that week for a few players to relax fully before we began with the world cup training . what 's the atmosphere like within the team ?
do you think all that excitement can be damaging ? we 're prepared to perform well and we understand how important the world cup is for the image of our country as well for every individual player .
i notice that our players are slightly excited , but it 's important that we keep together .
the excitement should n't affect our performance ; it 's a normal condition for every player before each game .
if the player does n't feel any excitement , it means that he 's achieved everything and can end his career . which game in the preliminary round do you consider to be the most important ? the game against spain will be important because it 's the first one .
it will strongly determine the further constellation in our group .
but the two other games are equally important ; that 's why we 'll have to give every game our best .
there are no " games to fill the gap " in a world cup and no weak opponents . who 's the most dangerous opponent in group h ?
and why ? spain is one of the favorites of the tournament , and that 's why we 're preparing thoroughly for this game .
but i consider another team to be the most dangerous opponent and that 's tunisia . african teams are famous for springing surprises .

what was the key to your success ? oleg blokhin : our single-mindedness and confidence were decisive .

the excitement should n't affect our performance ; it 's a normal condition for every player before each game .
if the player does n't feel any excitement , it means that he 's achieved everything and can end his career . which game in the preliminary round do you consider to be the most important ? the game against spain will be important because it 's the first one .
it will strongly determine the further constellation in our group .

" instead i would like us to rubberstamp the idea that we feel good when we play in germany . " " we should benefit from playing so close to home , " van basten said as 15,000 fans turned out to watch the first public dutch training session in freiburg on thursday . " we sense this enthusiasm .
it is now for the players to take that onto the pitch , " said the coach who raised some eyebrows before the tournament when he ditched several of the old guard such as midfielders clarence seedorf and edgar davids , who were often linked with dressing room dissent . winger robben looking no further than opening game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first serbia & montenegro then the world for arjen robben robben admitted that group c was probably the toughest of the first stage and that a moment 's hesitation could prove fatal in deciding who progressed to the second round . " i do n't really want to think about the tournament as a whole at the moment but rather focus on the first match against serbia-montenegro , " said robben .
" they are a solid side with classy individuals .
but we also have a squad packed with quality .
we think together , we play really tightly and i am very confident . " " the dutch have players who can take us a long way in the tournament , " robben added .
" however we have to stay alert .
because in our group it may be the merest thing that makes the difference .
it will be a shame to play well but to lose everything because of a slip of concentration . " serb defender goran gavrancic , who plays for dynamo kiev , said : " it is realistic that we can record a good result against the netherlands .
we have the best defense in the qualifiers , and the netherlands has the best attack .

and studying here is a full-time job - students cram market models and economic theory from nine in the morning until five in the afternoon . practical application important fatih aslan , a student of turkish origin - like most of the around 100 students at ota - is studying for an mba and plans to do his bachelor 's degree in a year .
the study program costs about 600 euros a month - expensive by german standards , but worth every euro , says aslan . " my best friend is studying at a state-run university and i get to hear from him of how dry it is and far-removed from practical applications , " said aslan .
" here we have to constantly make presentations .
and that does motivate you because you have to always use the stuff you learn during your time here . " practical application is strongly emphasized at the ota .
most of the lecturers come from business and industry and in addition to the theory they teach , they give students glimpses into the real working world .
doing an internship of several months is the norm here . not a " turkish university " ota is the antithesis of a german state-run university , and the going was n't easy initially , said erman tanyildiz .
the turkish businessmen who came to germany to study in the 1970s set up his own successful business empire and ended up investing his fortune in the private university . " nobody rolled out the red carpet for me when i first came up with the idea , " said tanyildiz .
" it took about two years before the authorities took me seriously .
they were very skeptical when they saw that off all people , a turk wanted to invest four million dm in a foundation .
they probably thought it was for something bad . " at the same time tanyildiz does n't like the ota to be referred to as a " turkish university . "
he says it 's open to all and wants to offer a chance in particular to those who lose out in the cut-throat competition for a decent education . immigrant kids losing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids from immigrants families are usually the losers when it comes to education and jobs most of the current misery plaguing children with immigrant backgrounds in germany reflects the country 's decades-long neglect when it came to integrating its immigrants , says tanyildiz . last month , a study by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- showed that germany is largely failing children from immigrant families .
the report said that only every tenth child from an immigrant family managed to get into a gymnasium , or high school that eventually leads to university .
while every third german studies at a university , only eight percent of immigrant children do so , the study found . " in the 1960s germany needed cheap labor that could do all the backbreaking work .
critical academics would have proved more of a burden , " said tanyildiz .
" they -lrb- cheap workers -rrb- were n't given a chance to educate themselves but rather were treated as ' guests ' for generations .
how do people who perhaps themselves ca n't read and write educate their children and tell them about the importance of a good education ? " tanyildiz says the key lies in language .
german courses at a pre-school age as well as more flexibility in germany 's current school system are crucial , said tanyildiz , since they would enable kids to develop their abilities and decide at a higher age if they wanted to go to university or opt for vocational training . tapping immigrant potential the turkish entrepreneur also pointed out that children from immigrant families had enormous potential - bilingualism and bicultural soft skills - which was often overlooked in germany .
at the ota , kids from such families are considered a benefit , not a deficit , tanyildiz said . " what we 're also doing is preparing a bit of the groundwork for turkey 's eu membership .
already there 's intensive economic cooperation between turkey and europe , " tanyildiz said .
" and there we need well-trained leaders who are familiar with several cultures and languages and are rooted in them . " people like fatih aslan are prime examples .

sanchez 's availability for the game will depend on his mental and emotional state . the opening match is seen as critical to the hopes of both teams in a group which also contains portugal and angola . " this is the most important game .
we know the game against portugal will be really hard also so we really need to gain points in this game , " said iran skipper ali daei . mexico will hope to shrug off sanchez 's likely absence and their own unpromising build-up which saw them lose 2-1 to a second-string netherlands team . however a fourth-place finish in last year 's confederations cup - including a 1-0 win over brazil - and a 20-match unbeaten streak have instilled a strong sense of self-belief in ricardo lavolpe 's squad . " mexico are very compact , aggressive and fast - actually , they 're excellent , " said lavolpe 's opposite number branko ivankovic . " sometimes they 're playing very boring , but very successful . " mexico looking to justify top four ranking key player is barcelona rock rafael marquez , who will be looking to make amends for his red card in the knock-out defeat to the united states four years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talismanic jared borgetti -lrb- l . -rrb- has a point to prove mexico 's all-time top-scorer jared borgetti , who totted up a world-best 14 goals in qualifying , will be hoping to send a message to club manager sam allardyce who left him languishing on the bolton bench this season . mexico have qualified for 13 world cups but have never done better than the last eight on home ground in 1970 and 1986 , reaching the second round in the last three competitions . lavolpe , a member of argentina 's 1978 world cup-winning squad , has courted controversy by calling up naturalised mexicans guillermo franco and antonio naelson , while axing legendary striker cuauhtemoc blanco . iran 's walking wounded already at a disadvantage meanwhile iran , who have set their sights on making round two for the first time , look to have serious problems with several players either ruled out or recovering from injury . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's players who are fit face a tough time against mexico with key attackers ali karimi and mehdi mahdavikia coming back from ankle and back trouble respectively , defender sattar zare twisted a knee in training and midfielder fereydoon zandi also looks likely to miss out after coming down with a fever . however iran , who have plundered a mine of information on their opponents , remain optimistic that the asian giants could spring a surprise in their " most important game " . " our coaching staff is analysing mexico really well and every player is aware of the mexican players and their style of the game .
we know how to play against mexico , " said captain daei . " i think winning against mexico is not unreachable .

it was the first census to cover health and immigration . the recently announced results of the 2005 national census in germany have given an official face to what has been fairly obvious : germans are getting fatter -lrb- 58 percent men and 42 percent of women are overweight -rrb- and more than a quarter of them still ca n't kick their smoking habit . who is german ? of greater political significance however , is the finding , presented on tuesday by president of the federal office of statistics johann hahlen , that nearly one fifth of all germans -lrb- 15.3 million people or 19 percent of the population -rrb- have an immigrant background .
this includes those who have immigrated to germany themselves and may or may not have a german passport , and those with at least one immigrant parent . these statistics , part of the annual census for the very first time , come after a wave of immigration-related discussions spurred by a recent attack on an ethiopian-german in potsdam .
they also follow a recent exposé on violence and poor conditions in schools with immigrant majorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is the key to integration not everyone fits the mould the census is yet another sign that germany has to tackle the burning issue of integration of immigration and face up to its serious failings in the matter in the past . for decades germany has been content to treat all immigrants like " gastarbeiter " - pretending they will return to their home country at some point . ethnic germans from the former soviet union were hastily given passports after world war two and expected to assimilate on their own . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coexisting is n't enough redefining family the ongoing evolution of the family is another matter raised by the census results , which has both social and political ramifications .
patchwork families , disillusionment with marriage and a lack of willing caretakers for elderly parents are neither new concerns nor are they unique to germany . according to the census , only 1 percent germany 's 39.2 million households have three or more generations . germans are having fewer children , but apparently they are n't caring for their parents .
the elderly are n't living with their children -lrb- 22 percent of german households consist exclusively of individuals above the age of 65 -rrb- and nor are the middle-aged -lrb- 24 percent of couples live without children -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german men , especially divorced men , tend to smoke more than german women taking stock the census results bring warnings as well as reason for cautious optimism .
the country is rich in cultural diversity but is recognizing the need to rethink its immigration strategy . and even if smoking rates are high , they are down 2 percent than in 1999 .

the african nation would cherish being able to put their one-time colonial rulers at the bottom of group d. though all but the most devout of angola supporters do n't expect much more than the occasional goal , angolan players are n't willing to give in before the game gets underway . " sunday is a special game for us , " angolan striker love said .
" it 's the first time in the world cup , made all the more special with the great feeling and history between us and portugal .
there 's great excitement back home , the whole country will be watching this game . " portugal sailed through qualifying without losing a single game and are out to enhance their mixed record in the finals while being mindful of avoiding the fate that befell france , embarrassed by former colony senegal in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese refer to their coach simply as " big phil " but luis felipe scolari , who took over the euro 2004 runners-up after guiding brazil to the 2002 title , is not aiming to catch an early flight back to lisbon . portugal sights set on quarter-finals " what we want is to finish in the top eight .
that 's the minimum we 're looking for , " scolari said . " unfortunately in previous years , things did not go well for the portuguese squad , but obviously you also learn with your mistakes , " said defender nuno valente , adding he expects his team to move beyond the first round .

dw-world.de spoke with national coach oleg blokhin about the country 's chances . appointed in 2003 as coach of the ukrainian national team , oleg blokhin is a world cup legend himself .
the ukrainian represented the soviet union in the world cup finals in 1982 and 1986 .

what was the key to your success ? oleg blokhin : our single-mindedness and confidence were decisive .

you notice it particularly with the growing number of journalists who want to interview me or the national players .

the national team lost a week of preparation due to that .
we could have really used that week for a few players to relax fully before we began with the world cup training . what 's the atmosphere like within the team ?
do you think all that excitement can be damaging ? we 're prepared to perform well and we understand how important the world cup is for the image of our country as well for every individual player .
i notice that our players are slightly excited , but it 's important that we keep together .
the excitement should n't affect our performance ; it 's a normal condition for every player before each game .
if the player does n't feel any excitement , it means that he 's achieved everything and can end his career . which game in the preliminary round do you consider to be the most important ? the game against spain will be important because it 's the first one .
it will strongly determine the further constellation in our group .

i think a team that 's coached by roger lemerre is capable of surprises during the world cup 2006 . do you also reckon with stiff competition from saudi arabia ? saudi arabia had more time to prepare , and that does play a big role .
i think we do have to take this team seriously ; it certainly wo n't let itself be just a whipping boy . what is the main strength of the ukrainian team ? our strength lies in our team spirit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian star striker shevchenko , center , with teammates and what are your weaknesses ? they include personnel problems as well as injuries that have plagued us during our entire preparation phase .

dw-world.de spoke with national coach oleg blokhin about the country 's chances . appointed in 2003 as coach of the ukrainian national team , oleg blokhin is a world cup legend himself .
the ukrainian represented the soviet union in the world cup finals in 1982 and 1986 .
he is regarded as soviet soccer 's best player ever . dw-world.de : ukraine managed to qualify for the world cup for the first time .
what was the key to your success ? oleg blokhin : our single-mindedness and confidence were decisive .
when the world cup qualification rounds first began , no one believed that we would make it , in particular against strong teams such as european champion greece as well as denmark and turkey .
but i still managed to convince my boys that we were up to the challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ukrainian team celebrates after qualifying for the world cup for the first time is the world cup frenzy palpable in ukraine ? just like everywhere else in the world , you have been able to feel the world cup fever in ukraine for the past half year .
you notice it particularly with the growing number of journalists who want to interview me or the national players .
but we could completely focus on the world cup only after the ukrainian national league championships were over on may 14 .
the national team lost a week of preparation due to that .
we could have really used that week for a few players to relax fully before we began with the world cup training . what 's the atmosphere like within the team ?
do you think all that excitement can be damaging ? we 're prepared to perform well and we understand how important the world cup is for the image of our country as well for every individual player .
i notice that our players are slightly excited , but it 's important that we keep together .
the excitement should n't affect our performance ; it 's a normal condition for every player before each game .
if the player does n't feel any excitement , it means that he 's achieved everything and can end his career . which game in the preliminary round do you consider to be the most important ? the game against spain will be important because it 's the first one .
it will strongly determine the further constellation in our group .
but the two other games are equally important ; that 's why we 'll have to give every game our best .
there are no " games to fill the gap " in a world cup and no weak opponents . who 's the most dangerous opponent in group h ?
and why ? spain is one of the favorites of the tournament , and that 's why we 're preparing thoroughly for this game .
but i consider another team to be the most dangerous opponent and that 's tunisia . african teams are famous for springing surprises .
i think a team that 's coached by roger lemerre is capable of surprises during the world cup 2006 . do you also reckon with stiff competition from saudi arabia ? saudi arabia had more time to prepare , and that does play a big role .
i think we do have to take this team seriously ; it certainly wo n't let itself be just a whipping boy . what is the main strength of the ukrainian team ? our strength lies in our team spirit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian star striker shevchenko , center , with teammates and what are your weaknesses ? they include personnel problems as well as injuries that have plagued us during our entire preparation phase .
until now we have n't played any test games in the combination that i 'd like to see on the pitch .
andrei shevchenko , sergei rebrov as well as oleg gusev have only trained separately from the rest of the team until now .
our most important man in the defense line-up , sergei fiodorov , wo n't be there at all due to an injury .
four other players had to take part in the junior european championships in portugal until june 4 and are completely exhausted .
i ca n't rely on them 100 percent . which teams do you think have the best chances of making it to the finals ? brazil , italy and germany .
germany 's playing on home turf .
we have a saying : even the walls help you at home .
in addition , it could very well be that the referees are more partial towards the germans . many experts say the success of the ukrainian team depends on whether andrei shevchenko is fit .
is he the only key player in the team ? it 's true that shevchenko does lead the team .
but we 'll be in good form independent of whether he 'll be fit after his last injury and whether he 's in good shape or not .
our performance is n't only based on his dominating role though his talent , and charisma is really important to us and unpleasant to the opponents . what goals do you have at the world cup ? our first goal is to reach the round of 18 .
if we manage that , then we can identify further goals . tatiana petrenko interviewed oleg blokhin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .
could the amount of games played in a season threaten the prestige of future cups ?
would a compulsory winter break ensure more stars are fit ?

one private university in berlin started by a turkish industrialist bucks the trend . bright corridors , potted plants on window sills , an assortment of newspapers and magazines and young people hurrying around with laptops under their arms - the ota private university in berlin is a far cry from the scruffy lecture halls seen in most universities across germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lecture halls are usually full at state-run german universities students here learn in small groups instead of in usually overflowing classrooms .
and studying here is a full-time job - students cram market models and economic theory from nine in the morning until five in the afternoon . practical application important fatih aslan , a student of turkish origin - like most of the around 100 students at ota - is studying for an mba and plans to do his bachelor 's degree in a year .
the study program costs about 600 euros a month - expensive by german standards , but worth every euro , says aslan . " my best friend is studying at a state-run university and i get to hear from him of how dry it is and far-removed from practical applications , " said aslan .
" here we have to constantly make presentations .
and that does motivate you because you have to always use the stuff you learn during your time here . " practical application is strongly emphasized at the ota .
most of the lecturers come from business and industry and in addition to the theory they teach , they give students glimpses into the real working world .
doing an internship of several months is the norm here . not a " turkish university " ota is the antithesis of a german state-run university , and the going was n't easy initially , said erman tanyildiz .
the turkish businessmen who came to germany to study in the 1970s set up his own successful business empire and ended up investing his fortune in the private university . " nobody rolled out the red carpet for me when i first came up with the idea , " said tanyildiz .
" it took about two years before the authorities took me seriously .
they were very skeptical when they saw that off all people , a turk wanted to invest four million dm in a foundation .
they probably thought it was for something bad . " at the same time tanyildiz does n't like the ota to be referred to as a " turkish university . "
he says it 's open to all and wants to offer a chance in particular to those who lose out in the cut-throat competition for a decent education . immigrant kids losing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids from immigrants families are usually the losers when it comes to education and jobs most of the current misery plaguing children with immigrant backgrounds in germany reflects the country 's decades-long neglect when it came to integrating its immigrants , says tanyildiz . last month , a study by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- showed that germany is largely failing children from immigrant families .
the report said that only every tenth child from an immigrant family managed to get into a gymnasium , or high school that eventually leads to university .
while every third german studies at a university , only eight percent of immigrant children do so , the study found . " in the 1960s germany needed cheap labor that could do all the backbreaking work .
critical academics would have proved more of a burden , " said tanyildiz .
" they -lrb- cheap workers -rrb- were n't given a chance to educate themselves but rather were treated as ' guests ' for generations .
how do people who perhaps themselves ca n't read and write educate their children and tell them about the importance of a good education ? " tanyildiz says the key lies in language .
german courses at a pre-school age as well as more flexibility in germany 's current school system are crucial , said tanyildiz , since they would enable kids to develop their abilities and decide at a higher age if they wanted to go to university or opt for vocational training . tapping immigrant potential the turkish entrepreneur also pointed out that children from immigrant families had enormous potential - bilingualism and bicultural soft skills - which was often overlooked in germany .
at the ota , kids from such families are considered a benefit , not a deficit , tanyildiz said . " what we 're also doing is preparing a bit of the groundwork for turkey 's eu membership .
already there 's intensive economic cooperation between turkey and europe , " tanyildiz said .
" and there we need well-trained leaders who are familiar with several cultures and languages and are rooted in them . " people like fatih aslan are prime examples .

dw-world.de spoke with national coach oleg blokhin about the country 's chances . appointed in 2003 as coach of the ukrainian national team , oleg blokhin is a world cup legend himself .
the ukrainian represented the soviet union in the world cup finals in 1982 and 1986 .
he is regarded as soviet soccer 's best player ever . dw-world.de : ukraine managed to qualify for the world cup for the first time .
what was the key to your success ? oleg blokhin : our single-mindedness and confidence were decisive .
when the world cup qualification rounds first began , no one believed that we would make it , in particular against strong teams such as european champion greece as well as denmark and turkey .
but i still managed to convince my boys that we were up to the challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ukrainian team celebrates after qualifying for the world cup for the first time is the world cup frenzy palpable in ukraine ? just like everywhere else in the world , you have been able to feel the world cup fever in ukraine for the past half year .
you notice it particularly with the growing number of journalists who want to interview me or the national players .
but we could completely focus on the world cup only after the ukrainian national league championships were over on may 14 .
the national team lost a week of preparation due to that .
we could have really used that week for a few players to relax fully before we began with the world cup training . what 's the atmosphere like within the team ?
do you think all that excitement can be damaging ? we 're prepared to perform well and we understand how important the world cup is for the image of our country as well for every individual player .
i notice that our players are slightly excited , but it 's important that we keep together .
the excitement should n't affect our performance ; it 's a normal condition for every player before each game .
if the player does n't feel any excitement , it means that he 's achieved everything and can end his career . which game in the preliminary round do you consider to be the most important ? the game against spain will be important because it 's the first one .
it will strongly determine the further constellation in our group .
but the two other games are equally important ; that 's why we 'll have to give every game our best .
there are no " games to fill the gap " in a world cup and no weak opponents . who 's the most dangerous opponent in group h ?
and why ? spain is one of the favorites of the tournament , and that 's why we 're preparing thoroughly for this game .
but i consider another team to be the most dangerous opponent and that 's tunisia . african teams are famous for springing surprises .
i think a team that 's coached by roger lemerre is capable of surprises during the world cup 2006 . do you also reckon with stiff competition from saudi arabia ? saudi arabia had more time to prepare , and that does play a big role .
i think we do have to take this team seriously ; it certainly wo n't let itself be just a whipping boy . what is the main strength of the ukrainian team ? our strength lies in our team spirit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian star striker shevchenko , center , with teammates and what are your weaknesses ? they include personnel problems as well as injuries that have plagued us during our entire preparation phase .
until now we have n't played any test games in the combination that i 'd like to see on the pitch .
andrei shevchenko , sergei rebrov as well as oleg gusev have only trained separately from the rest of the team until now .
our most important man in the defense line-up , sergei fiodorov , wo n't be there at all due to an injury .
four other players had to take part in the junior european championships in portugal until june 4 and are completely exhausted .
i ca n't rely on them 100 percent . which teams do you think have the best chances of making it to the finals ? brazil , italy and germany .
germany 's playing on home turf .
we have a saying : even the walls help you at home .
in addition , it could very well be that the referees are more partial towards the germans . many experts say the success of the ukrainian team depends on whether andrei shevchenko is fit .
is he the only key player in the team ? it 's true that shevchenko does lead the team .
but we 'll be in good form independent of whether he 'll be fit after his last injury and whether he 's in good shape or not .
our performance is n't only based on his dominating role though his talent , and charisma is really important to us and unpleasant to the opponents . what goals do you have at the world cup ? our first goal is to reach the round of 18 .
if we manage that , then we can identify further goals . tatiana petrenko interviewed oleg blokhin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .

it was the first census to cover health and immigration . the recently announced results of the 2005 national census in germany have given an official face to what has been fairly obvious : germans are getting fatter -lrb- 58 percent men and 42 percent of women are overweight -rrb- and more than a quarter of them still ca n't kick their smoking habit . who is german ? of greater political significance however , is the finding , presented on tuesday by president of the federal office of statistics johann hahlen , that nearly one fifth of all germans -lrb- 15.3 million people or 19 percent of the population -rrb- have an immigrant background .
this includes those who have immigrated to germany themselves and may or may not have a german passport , and those with at least one immigrant parent . these statistics , part of the annual census for the very first time , come after a wave of immigration-related discussions spurred by a recent attack on an ethiopian-german in potsdam .
they also follow a recent exposé on violence and poor conditions in schools with immigrant majorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is the key to integration not everyone fits the mould the census is yet another sign that germany has to tackle the burning issue of integration of immigration and face up to its serious failings in the matter in the past . for decades germany has been content to treat all immigrants like " gastarbeiter " - pretending they will return to their home country at some point . ethnic germans from the former soviet union were hastily given passports after world war two and expected to assimilate on their own . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coexisting is n't enough redefining family the ongoing evolution of the family is another matter raised by the census results , which has both social and political ramifications .
patchwork families , disillusionment with marriage and a lack of willing caretakers for elderly parents are neither new concerns nor are they unique to germany . according to the census , only 1 percent germany 's 39.2 million households have three or more generations . germans are having fewer children , but apparently they are n't caring for their parents .
the elderly are n't living with their children -lrb- 22 percent of german households consist exclusively of individuals above the age of 65 -rrb- and nor are the middle-aged -lrb- 24 percent of couples live without children -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german men , especially divorced men , tend to smoke more than german women taking stock the census results bring warnings as well as reason for cautious optimism .
the country is rich in cultural diversity but is recognizing the need to rethink its immigration strategy . and even if smoking rates are high , they are down 2 percent than in 1999 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de match reports -pipe- 11.06.2006 crunch time comes early for iran against seeded mexico großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 'll be no lack of support for iran as the team aims to escape the group stage mexico will be looking to kill off iran 's world cup hopes at the first hurdle on sunday as the world number four begin their campaign to make it past the quarter-finals for the first time . the surprise group d seeds , who have a point to prove after some unflattering reaction to their exalted status , will have been buoyed by iran 's injury problems and indifferent recent form . however they might also take the field without top-rated goalkeeper oswaldo sanchez , who has flown home following his father 's sudden death and is expected to be back hours before the match .
sanchez 's availability for the game will depend on his mental and emotional state . the opening match is seen as critical to the hopes of both teams in a group which also contains portugal and angola . " this is the most important game .
we know the game against portugal will be really hard also so we really need to gain points in this game , " said iran skipper ali daei . mexico will hope to shrug off sanchez 's likely absence and their own unpromising build-up which saw them lose 2-1 to a second-string netherlands team . however a fourth-place finish in last year 's confederations cup - including a 1-0 win over brazil - and a 20-match unbeaten streak have instilled a strong sense of self-belief in ricardo lavolpe 's squad . " mexico are very compact , aggressive and fast - actually , they 're excellent , " said lavolpe 's opposite number branko ivankovic . " sometimes they 're playing very boring , but very successful .

sanchez 's availability for the game will depend on his mental and emotional state . the opening match is seen as critical to the hopes of both teams in a group which also contains portugal and angola . " this is the most important game .

dw-world.de spoke with national coach oleg blokhin about the country 's chances . appointed in 2003 as coach of the ukrainian national team , oleg blokhin is a world cup legend himself .
the ukrainian represented the soviet union in the world cup finals in 1982 and 1986 .
he is regarded as soviet soccer 's best player ever . dw-world.de : ukraine managed to qualify for the world cup for the first time .
what was the key to your success ? oleg blokhin : our single-mindedness and confidence were decisive .
when the world cup qualification rounds first began , no one believed that we would make it , in particular against strong teams such as european champion greece as well as denmark and turkey .
but i still managed to convince my boys that we were up to the challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ukrainian team celebrates after qualifying for the world cup for the first time is the world cup frenzy palpable in ukraine ? just like everywhere else in the world , you have been able to feel the world cup fever in ukraine for the past half year .
you notice it particularly with the growing number of journalists who want to interview me or the national players .
but we could completely focus on the world cup only after the ukrainian national league championships were over on may 14 .
the national team lost a week of preparation due to that .
we could have really used that week for a few players to relax fully before we began with the world cup training . what 's the atmosphere like within the team ?
do you think all that excitement can be damaging ? we 're prepared to perform well and we understand how important the world cup is for the image of our country as well for every individual player .
i notice that our players are slightly excited , but it 's important that we keep together .
the excitement should n't affect our performance ; it 's a normal condition for every player before each game .
if the player does n't feel any excitement , it means that he 's achieved everything and can end his career . which game in the preliminary round do you consider to be the most important ? the game against spain will be important because it 's the first one .
it will strongly determine the further constellation in our group .
but the two other games are equally important ; that 's why we 'll have to give every game our best .
there are no " games to fill the gap " in a world cup and no weak opponents . who 's the most dangerous opponent in group h ?
and why ? spain is one of the favorites of the tournament , and that 's why we 're preparing thoroughly for this game .
but i consider another team to be the most dangerous opponent and that 's tunisia . african teams are famous for springing surprises .
i think a team that 's coached by roger lemerre is capable of surprises during the world cup 2006 . do you also reckon with stiff competition from saudi arabia ? saudi arabia had more time to prepare , and that does play a big role .
i think we do have to take this team seriously ; it certainly wo n't let itself be just a whipping boy . what is the main strength of the ukrainian team ? our strength lies in our team spirit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian star striker shevchenko , center , with teammates and what are your weaknesses ? they include personnel problems as well as injuries that have plagued us during our entire preparation phase .
until now we have n't played any test games in the combination that i 'd like to see on the pitch .
andrei shevchenko , sergei rebrov as well as oleg gusev have only trained separately from the rest of the team until now .
our most important man in the defense line-up , sergei fiodorov , wo n't be there at all due to an injury .
four other players had to take part in the junior european championships in portugal until june 4 and are completely exhausted .
i ca n't rely on them 100 percent . which teams do you think have the best chances of making it to the finals ? brazil , italy and germany .
germany 's playing on home turf .
we have a saying : even the walls help you at home .
in addition , it could very well be that the referees are more partial towards the germans . many experts say the success of the ukrainian team depends on whether andrei shevchenko is fit .
is he the only key player in the team ? it 's true that shevchenko does lead the team .
but we 'll be in good form independent of whether he 'll be fit after his last injury and whether he 's in good shape or not .
our performance is n't only based on his dominating role though his talent , and charisma is really important to us and unpleasant to the opponents . what goals do you have at the world cup ? our first goal is to reach the round of 18 .
if we manage that , then we can identify further goals . tatiana petrenko interviewed oleg blokhin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .

" mexico looking to justify top four ranking key player is barcelona rock rafael marquez , who will be looking to make amends for his red card in the knock-out defeat to the united states four years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talismanic jared borgetti -lrb- l . -rrb- has a point to prove mexico 's all-time top-scorer jared borgetti , who totted up a world-best 14 goals in qualifying , will be hoping to send a message to club manager sam allardyce who left him languishing on the bolton bench this season . mexico have qualified for 13 world cups but have never done better than the last eight on home ground in 1970 and 1986 , reaching the second round in the last three competitions . lavolpe , a member of argentina 's 1978 world cup-winning squad , has courted controversy by calling up naturalised mexicans guillermo franco and antonio naelson , while axing legendary striker cuauhtemoc blanco . iran 's walking wounded already at a disadvantage meanwhile iran , who have set their sights on making round two for the first time , look to have serious problems with several players either ruled out or recovering from injury . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's players who are fit face a tough time against mexico with key attackers ali karimi and mehdi mahdavikia coming back from ankle and back trouble respectively , defender sattar zare twisted a knee in training and midfielder fereydoon zandi also looks likely to miss out after coming down with a fever . however iran , who have plundered a mine of information on their opponents , remain optimistic that the asian giants could spring a surprise in their " most important game " . " our coaching staff is analysing mexico really well and every player is aware of the mexican players and their style of the game .
we know how to play against mexico , " said captain daei . " i think winning against mexico is not unreachable .
mexico is a very good team but it 's not unbeatable .

" instead i would like us to rubberstamp the idea that we feel good when we play in germany . " " we should benefit from playing so close to home , " van basten said as 15,000 fans turned out to watch the first public dutch training session in freiburg on thursday . " we sense this enthusiasm .
it is now for the players to take that onto the pitch , " said the coach who raised some eyebrows before the tournament when he ditched several of the old guard such as midfielders clarence seedorf and edgar davids , who were often linked with dressing room dissent . winger robben looking no further than opening game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first serbia & montenegro then the world for arjen robben robben admitted that group c was probably the toughest of the first stage and that a moment 's hesitation could prove fatal in deciding who progressed to the second round . " i do n't really want to think about the tournament as a whole at the moment but rather focus on the first match against serbia-montenegro , " said robben .
" they are a solid side with classy individuals .
but we also have a squad packed with quality .
we think together , we play really tightly and i am very confident . " " the dutch have players who can take us a long way in the tournament , " robben added .
" however we have to stay alert .
because in our group it may be the merest thing that makes the difference .
it will be a shame to play well but to lose everything because of a slip of concentration . " serb defender goran gavrancic , who plays for dynamo kiev , said : " it is realistic that we can record a good result against the netherlands .
we have the best defense in the qualifiers , and the netherlands has the best attack .

dw-world.de spoke with national coach oleg blokhin about the country 's chances . appointed in 2003 as coach of the ukrainian national team , oleg blokhin is a world cup legend himself .
the ukrainian represented the soviet union in the world cup finals in 1982 and 1986 .
he is regarded as soviet soccer 's best player ever . dw-world.de : ukraine managed to qualify for the world cup for the first time .
what was the key to your success ? oleg blokhin : our single-mindedness and confidence were decisive .
when the world cup qualification rounds first began , no one believed that we would make it , in particular against strong teams such as european champion greece as well as denmark and turkey .
but i still managed to convince my boys that we were up to the challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ukrainian team celebrates after qualifying for the world cup for the first time is the world cup frenzy palpable in ukraine ? just like everywhere else in the world , you have been able to feel the world cup fever in ukraine for the past half year .
you notice it particularly with the growing number of journalists who want to interview me or the national players .
but we could completely focus on the world cup only after the ukrainian national league championships were over on may 14 .
the national team lost a week of preparation due to that .
we could have really used that week for a few players to relax fully before we began with the world cup training . what 's the atmosphere like within the team ?
do you think all that excitement can be damaging ? we 're prepared to perform well and we understand how important the world cup is for the image of our country as well for every individual player .
i notice that our players are slightly excited , but it 's important that we keep together .
the excitement should n't affect our performance ; it 's a normal condition for every player before each game .
if the player does n't feel any excitement , it means that he 's achieved everything and can end his career . which game in the preliminary round do you consider to be the most important ? the game against spain will be important because it 's the first one .
it will strongly determine the further constellation in our group .
but the two other games are equally important ; that 's why we 'll have to give every game our best .
there are no " games to fill the gap " in a world cup and no weak opponents . who 's the most dangerous opponent in group h ?
and why ? spain is one of the favorites of the tournament , and that 's why we 're preparing thoroughly for this game .
but i consider another team to be the most dangerous opponent and that 's tunisia . african teams are famous for springing surprises .
i think a team that 's coached by roger lemerre is capable of surprises during the world cup 2006 . do you also reckon with stiff competition from saudi arabia ? saudi arabia had more time to prepare , and that does play a big role .
i think we do have to take this team seriously ; it certainly wo n't let itself be just a whipping boy . what is the main strength of the ukrainian team ? our strength lies in our team spirit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian star striker shevchenko , center , with teammates and what are your weaknesses ? they include personnel problems as well as injuries that have plagued us during our entire preparation phase .
until now we have n't played any test games in the combination that i 'd like to see on the pitch .
andrei shevchenko , sergei rebrov as well as oleg gusev have only trained separately from the rest of the team until now .
our most important man in the defense line-up , sergei fiodorov , wo n't be there at all due to an injury .
four other players had to take part in the junior european championships in portugal until june 4 and are completely exhausted .
i ca n't rely on them 100 percent . which teams do you think have the best chances of making it to the finals ? brazil , italy and germany .
germany 's playing on home turf .
we have a saying : even the walls help you at home .
in addition , it could very well be that the referees are more partial towards the germans . many experts say the success of the ukrainian team depends on whether andrei shevchenko is fit .
is he the only key player in the team ? it 's true that shevchenko does lead the team .
but we 'll be in good form independent of whether he 'll be fit after his last injury and whether he 's in good shape or not .
our performance is n't only based on his dominating role though his talent , and charisma is really important to us and unpleasant to the opponents . what goals do you have at the world cup ? our first goal is to reach the round of 18 .
if we manage that , then we can identify further goals . tatiana petrenko interviewed oleg blokhin -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .

they could have jumped to the lead in the 11th minute , but striker vahid hashemian twice failed to find the net from short range . mexico looked nervous , as though they were afraid of not living up to their role as group favorites behind portugal .
it took them around 20 minutes to settle down and create viable chances on goal , especially on set plays . in the 27th minute they took the lead .
omar bravo directed the ball into the net , after guillermo franco headed on a pavel pardo free-kick . iran struck back some eight minutes later .

they could have jumped to the lead in the 11th minute , but striker vahid hashemian twice failed to find the net from short range . mexico looked nervous , as though they were afraid of not living up to their role as group favorites behind portugal .
it took them around 20 minutes to settle down and create viable chances on goal , especially on set plays . in the 27th minute they took the lead .

bavarian state interior minister günther beckstein said the demonstration was not targeted against the iranian team or the iranian people but against " a man who has placed himself outside civilization . " " a criminal like ahmadinejad is not welcome -lrb- in germany -rrb- , " he said . " let us show that bavaria and germany as well as the entire western world stand firmly by israel and our jewish fellow citizens . " police said the event went off without incident . ahmadinejad condemned for holocaust comments ahmadinejad has been widely condemned for describing the holocaust as a " myth " and calling for israel to be " wiped off the map " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's comments about the holocaust have sparked anger worldwide he has said he would like to attend the soccer ball extravaganza running through july 9 but has made no firm plans .
a source close to him said he would be watching sunday 's game on television in his office in tehran . iranian vice president mohammad aliabadi was granted a german visa and visited the iranian team in nuremberg saturday ahead of their first world cup match sunday . michel friedman , a television presenter and high-profile member of germany 's jewish community , told the rally it was scandalous that aliabadi had been allowed to enter the country . knobloch warns of " anti-semitic alliance " charlotte knobloch , the newly appointed head of germany 's central council of jews said she was worried about an " explosive anti-semitic alliance . " writing in an article in bild am sonntag , knobloch pointed out that neo-nazis in germany wanted to use a game between iran and angola on june 21 in leipzig to " declare their solidarity with the tyrant from tehran . "
knobloch warned that germany could n't just watch events idly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch " we have to prevent that the enemies of the constitution and the iranian dictator do n't join forces to form an anti-semitic alliance , " knobloch wrote . earlier , police broke up a pro-iranian rally by neo-nazis in nuremberg , a former nazi stronghold . the 16 men and women there were dressed in iranian jerseys , hoisting iranian flags and distributing flyers demanding that the demonstration against ahmadinejad be banned , police spokesman peter grösch .
amid the controversy , iran coach branko ivankovic told reporters saturday to stop asking him about politics .
" these political questions are not for me .
i think it 's not for me and it 's not for people here .
please just ask about my team against mexico , " said the croatian . standing up against racism separately , german politicians and celebrities joined thousands of citizens and activists in the western german city of gelsenkirchen on saturday to send a strong message against neo-nazism and xenophobia . the gelsenkirchen event was meant to counter a march planned by the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- on saturday , a day after the city of gelsenkirchen hosted an opening world cup game between poland and ecuador . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and the ambassador of ecuador horacio sevilla borja addressing the estimated 5,000 people who gathered in gelsenkirchen to protest against the far-right , germany 's vice chancellor franz müntefering accused the npd of wanting to hijack the soccer world cup in germany to sow xenophobia . " this brown sauce should never again get a chance in germany , never again , " said müntefering .
" we want all people to be able to live here in germany irrespective of their skin color , passport , name and religion .
no one should be scared , " he said . racism debate in germany müntefering 's comments follow warnings last month by a former government spokesman who now heads an anti-racist organization that black soccer fans visiting the country during the world cup should avoid going to areas where neo-nazi attacks had taken place . his remarks triggered fierce debate in germany about so-called no-go areas for dark-skinned foreigners and were followed by a suspected racist attack on a politician of turkish-kurdish origin in eastern berlin . a string of other racist attacks in the east of the country have also put the country on edge . " world attention focused on germany " president of germany 's parliament , the bundestag , norbert lammert , underscored the importance of the anti-neo-nazi demonstration on saturday at a time when the world is looking at germany and particularly gelsenkirchen which hosts a number of world cup games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans from all over the world are in germany for the world cup " world attention wo n't focused on germany in the next few years the way that it is at present and in the coming weeks , " lammert said . " that 's why we have to lay emphasis on germany presenting itself the way it is : open to the world , tolerant and naturally friendly to foreigners , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leaders say germany open to the world , but urge caution days before the world cup kicks off , leading politicians have underlined germany 's open and tolerant nature .
but chancellor merkel has warned the country must remain vigilant to the threat of attacks against foreigners .
-lrb- june 6 , 2006 -rrb- can the world cup withstand heated race debate ?
germany is working hard to prevent the far right from hijacking the soccer world cup and promote a positive image weeks before the event opens .

bavarian state interior minister günther beckstein said the demonstration was not targeted against the iranian team or the iranian people but against " a man who has placed himself outside civilization . " " a criminal like ahmadinejad is not welcome -lrb- in germany -rrb- , " he said . " let us show that bavaria and germany as well as the entire western world stand firmly by israel and our jewish fellow citizens . " police said the event went off without incident . ahmadinejad condemned for holocaust comments ahmadinejad has been widely condemned for describing the holocaust as a " myth " and calling for israel to be " wiped off the map " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's comments about the holocaust have sparked anger worldwide he has said he would like to attend the soccer ball extravaganza running through july 9 but has made no firm plans .
a source close to him said he would be watching sunday 's game on television in his office in tehran . iranian vice president mohammad aliabadi was granted a german visa and visited the iranian team in nuremberg saturday ahead of their first world cup match sunday . michel friedman , a television presenter and high-profile member of germany 's jewish community , told the rally it was scandalous that aliabadi had been allowed to enter the country . knobloch warns of " anti-semitic alliance " charlotte knobloch , the newly appointed head of germany 's central council of jews said she was worried about an " explosive anti-semitic alliance . " writing in an article in bild am sonntag , knobloch pointed out that neo-nazis in germany wanted to use a game between iran and angola on june 21 in leipzig to " declare their solidarity with the tyrant from tehran . "
knobloch warned that germany could n't just watch events idly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch " we have to prevent that the enemies of the constitution and the iranian dictator do n't join forces to form an anti-semitic alliance , " knobloch wrote . earlier , police broke up a pro-iranian rally by neo-nazis in nuremberg , a former nazi stronghold . the 16 men and women there were dressed in iranian jerseys , hoisting iranian flags and distributing flyers demanding that the demonstration against ahmadinejad be banned , police spokesman peter grösch .
amid the controversy , iran coach branko ivankovic told reporters saturday to stop asking him about politics .
" these political questions are not for me .
i think it 's not for me and it 's not for people here .
please just ask about my team against mexico , " said the croatian . standing up against racism separately , german politicians and celebrities joined thousands of citizens and activists in the western german city of gelsenkirchen on saturday to send a strong message against neo-nazism and xenophobia . the gelsenkirchen event was meant to counter a march planned by the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- on saturday , a day after the city of gelsenkirchen hosted an opening world cup game between poland and ecuador . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and the ambassador of ecuador horacio sevilla borja addressing the estimated 5,000 people who gathered in gelsenkirchen to protest against the far-right , germany 's vice chancellor franz müntefering accused the npd of wanting to hijack the soccer world cup in germany to sow xenophobia . " this brown sauce should never again get a chance in germany , never again , " said müntefering .
" we want all people to be able to live here in germany irrespective of their skin color , passport , name and religion .
no one should be scared , " he said . racism debate in germany müntefering 's comments follow warnings last month by a former government spokesman who now heads an anti-racist organization that black soccer fans visiting the country during the world cup should avoid going to areas where neo-nazi attacks had taken place . his remarks triggered fierce debate in germany about so-called no-go areas for dark-skinned foreigners and were followed by a suspected racist attack on a politician of turkish-kurdish origin in eastern berlin . a string of other racist attacks in the east of the country have also put the country on edge . " world attention focused on germany " president of germany 's parliament , the bundestag , norbert lammert , underscored the importance of the anti-neo-nazi demonstration on saturday at a time when the world is looking at germany and particularly gelsenkirchen which hosts a number of world cup games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans from all over the world are in germany for the world cup " world attention wo n't focused on germany in the next few years the way that it is at present and in the coming weeks , " lammert said .

angola play their former colonial rulers portugal in day 's second group d game .
who will be on the field ?
here is a look at the starting lineups : angola : 1-joao ricardo ; 20-loco , 3-jamba , 5-kali , 21-delgado ; 8-andre macanga , 7-paulo figueiredo , 14-mendonca , 11-mateus ; 10-akwa -lrb- c -rrb- , 17-ze kalanga coach : luis oliveira goncalves portugal : 1-ricardo ; 13-miguel , 16-ricardo carvalho , 5-fernando meira , 14-nunovalente ; 19-tiago , 11-sabrosa , 8-petit ; 7-luis figo -lrb- c -rrb- , 9-pauleta , 17-cristiano ronaldo coach : luis felipe scolari referee : jorge larrionda -lrb- uruguay -rrb- an underdog in the truest sense of the term , expect angola to hang back and defend against an aggressively oriented portugal .
1. min .
we 're off portugal starts with the ball .
1. min .
what a start it is ! 14 seconds into the game and the ball is already rolling past the far post .
pauleta nearly got possibly the fastest goal in world cup history .
3. min .
figo crosses and angolan keeper joao ricardo gets his hands on the ball that was too close to his goal for portugal to make anything of .
3. min .
goal portugal ! 4. min .
pauleta did n't waste any time taking the pass from figo , who drew two defenders toward him , and drilling it into the back of the net .
7. min .
cutting the whole defense c. ronaldo dribbles through half the angola defense and is only stopped by stepping on the ball himself .
8. min .
corner angola akwa gives ricardo a bit of push while going up to head the ball away from the goalie and is called for a foul .
10. min .
akwa goes down after giving up one goal , angola push forward with a drive down the right side and akwa is able to head a weak ball towards to goal before falling to the ground .
12. min .
portugal line up a free kick .
12. min .
petit fires a shot that will certainly leave a bruise into the 4-man wall .
15. min .
joao ricardo hit in the stomach a collision between pauleta 's shin and the angolan keeper 's midsection has ricardo on the ground .
hopefully he 's only had the wind knocked out of him .
16. min .
with a bit of ice and a stretch , he 's ready to continue between the pipes .
18. min .
delgado tosses in a short throw-in ; miguel is there first to clear it to midfield .
19. min .
portugal are slowing down the portuguese players are slowing down the game 's tempo , making the rough and tumble angolans look decent .
22. min .
lonely in the back the portuguese defenders have moved up to midfield , leaving goalkeeper ricardo with only the fans in the stands behind the goal to chat to .
24. min .
simano and figo pass between each other , and simano puts the ball over goal , much to ronaldo 's chagrin as he was wide open on the flank .
24. min .
angola shoots mateus unloads from 35 yards out .
the ball sails over the crossbar , but it was enough for fans of both teams to take a gasp .
25. min .
akwa earns praise a bike kick inside the penalty area and now the portuguese defenders are beginning to pull at the forward 's jersey . maybe angola is n't as harmless as everyone thought ? 26. min .
yellow for c. ronaldo the ref warns ronaldo that he is n't at a judo match and gives yellow for a violent kick .
28. min .
this time jamba gets yellow a late tackle earns a booking for the angolan defender .
30. min .
half and hour into the game and angola are showing their passion for soccer with drives forward and aggressive attacks on every 50-50 ball .
32. min .
surprised that the ball landed in front of him , ronaldo is n't able to convert on a cross alone at goal .
34. min .
figueiredo tries his luck at a long-range shot , but it floats well-wide of the post .
35. min .
ding !
ronaldo hammers a header off a figo corner solidly into the crossbar and grabs at his hair in desperation .
37. min .
stymied by delgado 's arm , ronaldo , a well-known hot head who has already been booked once , works to keep his emotions in check .
38. min .
pauleta does n't get any power behind his header and joao ricardo collects it and send the ball to soaring to the center circle .
40. min .
simano slips at the edge of the box , the fans want a penalty kick , but the portuguese player does n't give the referee a look .
42. min .
ronaldo fouled again .
are the angolans trying to provoke him into getting another card and tossed out of the game ? 43. min .
macanga rifles a shot at goal that ricardo can only block over the end line .
nothing comes of the resulting corner .
45. min .
ronaldo rockets a shot after receiving the back pass and ricardo parries it in all-star style .
another case of bad luck for the portuguese .
two minutes of injury time in cologne .
45 + 2. min .

they could have jumped to the lead in the 11th minute , but striker vahid hashemian twice failed to find the net from short range . mexico looked nervous , as though they were afraid of not living up to their role as group favorites behind portugal .
it took them around 20 minutes to settle down and create viable chances on goal , especially on set plays . in the 27th minute they took the lead .
omar bravo directed the ball into the net , after guillermo franco headed on a pavel pardo free-kick . iran struck back some eight minutes later .
yahya golmohammadi slotted home a corner-kick by midfielder mehdi mahdavikia to level the match up as the first half whistle blew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bravo should have raised two fingers for his pair of goals mexico make game clear in second half mexico started the second half with a shock , when their top striker jared borgetti limped off the pitch in the 51st minute .
still , the mexicans proved to be the better team , having much more of the ball and pinning the iranians in their own half of the field . but mexico needed a bit of help to regain the lead .
mistakes by iranian keeper ebrahim mirzapour and defender rahman rezaei gifted the ball to mexican substitute sinha in the 76th minute .
he quickly found bravo , who put mexico back on top with his second goal of the day . iran looked exhausted , and a couple of minutes later , they allowed sinha to sprint into the penalty area and put the game away with a nifty header .
iran was done .

they could have jumped to the lead in the 11th minute , but striker vahid hashemian twice failed to find the net from short range . mexico looked nervous , as though they were afraid of not living up to their role as group favorites behind portugal .
it took them around 20 minutes to settle down and create viable chances on goal , especially on set plays . in the 27th minute they took the lead .
omar bravo directed the ball into the net , after guillermo franco headed on a pavel pardo free-kick . iran struck back some eight minutes later .
yahya golmohammadi slotted home a corner-kick by midfielder mehdi mahdavikia to level the match up as the first half whistle blew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bravo should have raised two fingers for his pair of goals mexico make game clear in second half mexico started the second half with a shock , when their top striker jared borgetti limped off the pitch in the 51st minute .
still , the mexicans proved to be the better team , having much more of the ball and pinning the iranians in their own half of the field . but mexico needed a bit of help to regain the lead .
mistakes by iranian keeper ebrahim mirzapour and defender rahman rezaei gifted the ball to mexican substitute sinha in the 76th minute .
he quickly found bravo , who put mexico back on top with his second goal of the day . iran looked exhausted , and a couple of minutes later , they allowed sinha to sprint into the penalty area and put the game away with a nifty header .
iran was done .

bavarian state interior minister günther beckstein said the demonstration was not targeted against the iranian team or the iranian people but against " a man who has placed himself outside civilization . " " a criminal like ahmadinejad is not welcome -lrb- in germany -rrb- , " he said . " let us show that bavaria and germany as well as the entire western world stand firmly by israel and our jewish fellow citizens . " police said the event went off without incident . ahmadinejad condemned for holocaust comments ahmadinejad has been widely condemned for describing the holocaust as a " myth " and calling for israel to be " wiped off the map " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's comments about the holocaust have sparked anger worldwide he has said he would like to attend the soccer ball extravaganza running through july 9 but has made no firm plans .
a source close to him said he would be watching sunday 's game on television in his office in tehran . iranian vice president mohammad aliabadi was granted a german visa and visited the iranian team in nuremberg saturday ahead of their first world cup match sunday . michel friedman , a television presenter and high-profile member of germany 's jewish community , told the rally it was scandalous that aliabadi had been allowed to enter the country . knobloch warns of " anti-semitic alliance " charlotte knobloch , the newly appointed head of germany 's central council of jews said she was worried about an " explosive anti-semitic alliance . " writing in an article in bild am sonntag , knobloch pointed out that neo-nazis in germany wanted to use a game between iran and angola on june 21 in leipzig to " declare their solidarity with the tyrant from tehran . "
knobloch warned that germany could n't just watch events idly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch " we have to prevent that the enemies of the constitution and the iranian dictator do n't join forces to form an anti-semitic alliance , " knobloch wrote . earlier , police broke up a pro-iranian rally by neo-nazis in nuremberg , a former nazi stronghold . the 16 men and women there were dressed in iranian jerseys , hoisting iranian flags and distributing flyers demanding that the demonstration against ahmadinejad be banned , police spokesman peter grösch .
amid the controversy , iran coach branko ivankovic told reporters saturday to stop asking him about politics .
" these political questions are not for me .
i think it 's not for me and it 's not for people here .
please just ask about my team against mexico , " said the croatian . standing up against racism separately , german politicians and celebrities joined thousands of citizens and activists in the western german city of gelsenkirchen on saturday to send a strong message against neo-nazism and xenophobia . the gelsenkirchen event was meant to counter a march planned by the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- on saturday , a day after the city of gelsenkirchen hosted an opening world cup game between poland and ecuador . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and the ambassador of ecuador horacio sevilla borja addressing the estimated 5,000 people who gathered in gelsenkirchen to protest against the far-right , germany 's vice chancellor franz müntefering accused the npd of wanting to hijack the soccer world cup in germany to sow xenophobia . " this brown sauce should never again get a chance in germany , never again , " said müntefering .
" we want all people to be able to live here in germany irrespective of their skin color , passport , name and religion .
no one should be scared , " he said . racism debate in germany müntefering 's comments follow warnings last month by a former government spokesman who now heads an anti-racist organization that black soccer fans visiting the country during the world cup should avoid going to areas where neo-nazi attacks had taken place . his remarks triggered fierce debate in germany about so-called no-go areas for dark-skinned foreigners and were followed by a suspected racist attack on a politician of turkish-kurdish origin in eastern berlin . a string of other racist attacks in the east of the country have also put the country on edge . " world attention focused on germany " president of germany 's parliament , the bundestag , norbert lammert , underscored the importance of the anti-neo-nazi demonstration on saturday at a time when the world is looking at germany and particularly gelsenkirchen which hosts a number of world cup games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans from all over the world are in germany for the world cup " world attention wo n't focused on germany in the next few years the way that it is at present and in the coming weeks , " lammert said . " that 's why we have to lay emphasis on germany presenting itself the way it is : open to the world , tolerant and naturally friendly to foreigners , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leaders say germany open to the world , but urge caution days before the world cup kicks off , leading politicians have underlined germany 's open and tolerant nature .
but chancellor merkel has warned the country must remain vigilant to the threat of attacks against foreigners .

the scottish qualifications authority , which has been dealing with more than 200 claims of malpractice , said web cheating was a growing problem .
the sqa has also had reports of pupils taking electronic devices into exam halls and more traditional scams of students writing on their bodies .
overall , however , it said cheating remained a small problem .
scotland 's exams season for secondary school pupils ran from 2 may to 9 june , with 140,000 candidates tackling a range of 575 exams at standard grade , intermediate 1 and intermediate 2 , higher and advanced higher levels .
the sqa said it had seen reports of suspected cheating increase by about a third this year to 221 cases and its malpractice unit has been dealing with 83 allegations of plagiarism , compared with 41 last year .
' remarkable similarities ' these cases all related to course work which goes towards the final grades .
mike haggerty , the sqa 's director of communications , told the scotland on sunday newspaper : " the main difficulty we have had is that pupils have lifted and copied work from the internet and attempted to pass it off as their own .
" a couple of candidates have also been reported after remarkable similarities in their coursework .
" plagiarism is not going away but nor is our vigilance .
our markers know their subjects better than pupils and they will always discover if cheating is going on . "
the sqa said all cases are thoroughly investigated and out of the 41 cases of plagiarism last year , only 11 were upheld .
mr haggerty said pupils continue to bring mobile phones into exam halls , despite clear warnings and while in most of the 119 cases this year the breach was accidental , " some definitely are not " .

the scottish qualifications authority , which has been dealing with more than 200 claims of malpractice , said web cheating was a growing problem .
the sqa has also had reports of pupils taking electronic devices into exam halls and more traditional scams of students writing on their bodies .
overall , however , it said cheating remained a small problem .
scotland 's exams season for secondary school pupils ran from 2 may to 9 june , with 140,000 candidates tackling a range of 575 exams at standard grade , intermediate 1 and intermediate 2 , higher and advanced higher levels .
the sqa said it had seen reports of suspected cheating increase by about a third this year to 221 cases and its malpractice unit has been dealing with 83 allegations of plagiarism , compared with 41 last year .
' remarkable similarities ' these cases all related to course work which goes towards the final grades .
mike haggerty , the sqa 's director of communications , told the scotland on sunday newspaper : " the main difficulty we have had is that pupils have lifted and copied work from the internet and attempted to pass it off as their own .
" a couple of candidates have also been reported after remarkable similarities in their coursework .
" plagiarism is not going away but nor is our vigilance .
our markers know their subjects better than pupils and they will always discover if cheating is going on . "
the sqa said all cases are thoroughly investigated and out of the 41 cases of plagiarism last year , only 11 were upheld .
mr haggerty said pupils continue to bring mobile phones into exam halls , despite clear warnings and while in most of the 119 cases this year the breach was accidental , " some definitely are not " .

opponents of the pipe linking liquefied natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- plants in west wales with gloucestershire have set up a group called safe haven network .
the group will lobby landowners along the route of the proposed pipeline .
the national grid said compulsory purchasing was sometimes necessary when constructing very important projects .
the campaign group , which met in carmarthen on saturday , is an offshoot of safe haven - which failed in its attempts to stop the construction of two lng terminals in pembrokeshire .

adam price , plaid cymru mp for carmarthen east and dinefwr , said there appeared to be an " unseemly haste " by the uk government and the company to get the project through .
he told bbc wales : " that 's driven not by wales ' needs , it 's driven by the energy needs as they 're perceived here down in london .

a spokesman for the company said the pipeline was a " a very important project for wales and for the united kingdom which is in the national need " .
" sometimes , unfortunately , compulsory purchase orders are needed , " he said .

for many years , people have been in search of the almost mythical port , known as vanchi to locals .
much-recorded in roman times , muziris was a major centre for trade between rome and southern india - but appeared to have simply disappeared .
now , however , an investigation by two archaeologists - kp shajan and v selvakumar - has placed the ancient port as having existed where the small town of pattanam now stands , on india 's south-west malabar coast .
" it is the first time these remains have been found on this coast , " dr sharjan told bbc world service 's discovery programme .
" we believe it could be muziris . "
key evidence pattanam is the only site in the region to produce architectural features and material contemporary to the period .
" no other site in india has yielded this much archaeological evidence , " said dr roberta tomber , of the british museum .
" we knew it was very important , and we knew if we could find it , there should be roman and other western artefacts there - but we had n't been able to locate it on the ground . "
" muziris is located on a river , distant from tindis - by river and sea , 500 stadia ; and by river from the shore , 20 stadia " roman description of the location of muziris until recently , the best guesses for the location of muziris centred on the mouth of the periyar river , at a place called kodungallor - but now the evidence suggests a smaller town nearby , pattanam , is the real location .
drs shajan and selvakumar now meet locals on a regular basis as they continue their work , with some older people in particular remembering picking up glass beads and pottery after heavy rains .
undoubtedly , they told discovery , the many pieces of amphora are from the mediterranean - a key to establishing pattanam as the place where muziris once stood .
" these amphora are so common , " dr shajan said .
" we have hundreds of shards of mediterranean pottery . "
mystery disappearance muziris became important because of the romans ' interest in trading , and their desire to have contact with regions beyond the reach of conquest and set up trading routes with these places .
" india had a long fascination for the romans , going back to alexander the great , " dr tomber said .
" alexander was a huge model for succeeding roman emperors , and the fact that he had been in india and brought back tales of the fantastic things , the people and products there , heightened the roman desire to continue that association . "
what is known , from a 1st century document , is that the harbour was " exceptionally important for trade . "
clues to its location are provided in ancient indian texts .
professor rajan gerta , from mahatma gandhi university in kerala , said that there are many references to " ships coming with gold , and going back with ' black gold " ' - pepper .
" these ships went back with a whole lot of pepper and various aromatic spices , collected from the forests , " he added .
merchants from a number of different cultures are believed to have operated in the port , and there are numerous indian finds from the time as well as roman ones .
in 1983 , a large hoard of roman coins was found at a site around six miles from pattanam .
however , even if muziris has been found , one mystery remains - how it disappeared so completely in the first place .
dr tomber said that it has always been presumed that the flow of the trade between rome and india lasted between the 1st century bc through to the end of the 1st century ad , but that there is growing evidence that this trade continued much longer , into the 6th and early 7th century - although not necessarily continually .
" we 're not quite clear how long it went on in muziris , and the more evidence we can gather from the artefacts , the clearer the picture that will build up , " she added .
" what is interesting is that in the 6th century , a greek writer , writing about the indian ocean , wrote that the malabar coast was still a thriving centre for the export of pepper - but he does n't mention muziris . "

for many years , people have been in search of the almost mythical port , known as vanchi to locals .
much-recorded in roman times , muziris was a major centre for trade between rome and southern india - but appeared to have simply disappeared .
now , however , an investigation by two archaeologists - kp shajan and v selvakumar - has placed the ancient port as having existed where the small town of pattanam now stands , on india 's south-west malabar coast .
" it is the first time these remains have been found on this coast , " dr sharjan told bbc world service 's discovery programme .
" we believe it could be muziris . "
key evidence pattanam is the only site in the region to produce architectural features and material contemporary to the period .
" no other site in india has yielded this much archaeological evidence , " said dr roberta tomber , of the british museum .
" we knew it was very important , and we knew if we could find it , there should be roman and other western artefacts there - but we had n't been able to locate it on the ground . "
muziris is located on a river , distant from tindis - by river and sea , 500 stadia ; and by river from the shore , 20 stadia roman description of the location of muziris until recently , the best guesses for the location of muziris centred on the mouth of the periyar river , at a place called kodungallor - but now the evidence suggests a smaller town nearby , pattanam , is the real location .
drs shajan and selvakumar now meet locals on a regular basis as they continue their work , with some older people in particular remembering picking up glass beads and pottery after heavy rains .
undoubtedly , they told discovery , the many pieces of amphora are from the mediterranean - a key to establishing pattanam as the place where muziris once stood .
" these amphora are so common , " dr shajan said .
" we have hundreds of shards of mediterranean pottery . "
mystery disappearance muziris became important because of the romans ' interest in trading , and their desire to have contact with regions beyond the reach of conquest and set up trading routes with these places .
" india had a long fascination for the romans , going back to alexander the great , " dr tomber said .
glass and precious stones are key finds in the site area " alexander was a huge model for succeeding roman emperors , and the fact that he had been in india and brought back tales of the fantastic things , the people and products there , heightened the roman desire to continue that association . "
what is known , from a 1st century document , is that the harbour was " exceptionally important for trade . "
clues to its location are provided in ancient indian texts .
professor rajan gerta , from mahatma gandhi university in kerala , said that there are many references to " ships coming with gold , and going back with ' black gold " ' - pepper .
" these ships went back with a whole lot of pepper and various aromatic spices , collected from the forests , " he added .
merchants from a number of different cultures are believed to have operated in the port , and there are numerous indian finds from the time as well as roman ones .
in 1983 , a large hoard of roman coins was found at a site around six miles from pattanam .
however , even if muziris has been found , one mystery remains - how it disappeared so completely in the first place .
dr tomber said that it has always been presumed that the flow of the trade between rome and india lasted between the 1st century bc through to the end of the 1st century ad , but that there is growing evidence that this trade continued much longer , into the 6th and early 7th century - although not necessarily continually .
" we 're not quite clear how long it went on in muziris , and the more evidence we can gather from the artefacts , the clearer the picture that will build up , " she added .
" what is interesting is that in the 6th century , a greek writer , writing about the indian ocean , wrote that the malabar coast was still a thriving centre for the export of pepper - but he does n't mention muziris . "
