then the first high-ranking priest admitted he was involved . at first , michal czajkowski , a leading church figure known for his work on catholic-jewish relations , rejected the accusations made against him .
but in july , he admitted to spying on his colleagues for 24 years , beginning in 1960 .
soon after , he quit as co-chairman of the polish christian-jewish council . church collaboration hits poland especially hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czajkowski is known for his work on catholic-jewish relations " i want to apologize and ask for forgiveness , especially for those whom i have hurt - i displayed a weakness of character , " czajkowski wrote in a statement printed by polish newspapers .
" i have already expressed my regret toward god .
now i am doing it toward people . " in other former communist countries still grappling with their past , such admissions may be surprising .
but they do n't have the power to shock as in poland , where during four decades of communist rule , the church remained stronger than anywhere else in the bloc and was seen as the focal point to passive resistance and opposition to the regime . in the former communist czechoslovakia , for example , the church played a smaller role in society , and even today , the czechs are among the least devout nations in europe .
in hungary , the catholic church has also admitted that dozens of its priests spied on their colleagues without raising the same level of public shock seen in poland . germany still investigating its own past like other states behind the iron curtain , the churches in the former east germany have had to deal with allegations that their clergy , especially in the protestant church , appeased or supported communist officials . michael zöller , a professor of sociology and religion at the university of bayreuth said collaboration with the communists was more prevalent in the protestant church in the former east germany . " the catholic church was more protected because the gdr wanted to be on good terms with the vatican , " zöller said .
" protestants were more forced to cooperate , especially to be able to get some leeway in their activities . " some clergy members thought of it as a progressive alliance because there was an affinity between church doctrine and socialism - it even attracted clergy from west germany , such as angela merkel 's father , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stolpe has been accused of collaborating with the communists in germany , the opening of the east german secret police , or stasi , archives brought up a number of allegations against east german church officials most famously , former brandenburg premier manfred stolpe , who also served as germany 's minister of transportation , building and housing until 2005 .
stolpe was a high-ranking official of the gdr 's evangelical church and has denied the charges . zöller said he believes that issues of collaboration among the clergy will continue to come up , as historians continue to pore through the stasi files . " officials are still processing documents , " he said .
" who knows yet what information they contain . " over 10 percent of polish priests collaborated polish priest czajkowski was a willing spy , according to the warsaw-based national remembrance institute , which manages communist archives and investigates crimes of that era .
the institute said he reported on the church 's and clergy 's pro-democracy activities and only stopped after regime agents murdered the chaplain of the solidarity trade union , jerzy popieluszko , whom czajkowski is accused of spying on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands in poland mourned pope john paul ii 's death poland 's catholic church , including former pope john paul ii , is widely credited with the rise of solidarity , the movement that brought down the communists and took control of poland in 1989 .
even though the church openly supported the group , the national remembrance institute said about 10 percent to 15 percent of the clergy collaborated with the communists . until recently , the church has refused to cooperate with investigations or provide names regarding collaborators among the clergy .
however , last year after similar allegations against an aide to pope john paul ii , konrad hejmo , surfaced , and the church suspended him .
hejmo denied the charges , which include spying on the late pope . coming to terms with the past now the catholic church in poland is working at coming to terms with its role in communist times .
earlier this year , church officials said they would begin investigating members of the clergy for collaborating with the communists .
soon after , the polish conference of catholic bishops issued an official apology to the public . " priests and others linked with the church who collaborated with the security services of the communist state cast a shadow on the catholic church 's heroic history under communist rule , " the bishops wrote , adding that an initiative to make public its complete list of collaborators is moving forward . the actions of a few priests also should not diminish the church 's role in promoting democracy , according to wojtek muszynski of the national remembrance institute . " the polish catholic church was still a hero , " he said .
" no matter how hard the secret service tried , they did n't break down 85 to 90 percent of the priests .

then the first high-ranking priest admitted he was involved . at first , michal czajkowski , a leading church figure known for his work on catholic-jewish relations , rejected the accusations made against him .

but they do n't have the power to shock as in poland , where during four decades of communist rule , the church remained stronger than anywhere else in the bloc and was seen as the focal point to passive resistance and opposition to the regime . in the former communist czechoslovakia , for example , the church played a smaller role in society , and even today , the czechs are among the least devout nations in europe .
in hungary , the catholic church has also admitted that dozens of its priests spied on their colleagues without raising the same level of public shock seen in poland . germany still investigating its own past like other states behind the iron curtain , the churches in the former east germany have had to deal with allegations that their clergy , especially in the protestant church , appeased or supported communist officials . michael zöller , a professor of sociology and religion at the university of bayreuth said collaboration with the communists was more prevalent in the protestant church in the former east germany . " the catholic church was more protected because the gdr wanted to be on good terms with the vatican , " zöller said .
" protestants were more forced to cooperate , especially to be able to get some leeway in their activities .

" officials are still processing documents , " he said .
" who knows yet what information they contain . " over 10 percent of polish priests collaborated polish priest czajkowski was a willing spy , according to the warsaw-based national remembrance institute , which manages communist archives and investigates crimes of that era .

gerhard richter 's current project is a modern 11,200-piece stained glass window for cologne 's gothic cathedral . the cologne cathedral 's new stained glass window by acclaimed german artist gerhard richter ca n't be overlooked , not only because of its immense size and conspicuous location but also because of its non-traditional approach . " the window will be a significant contribution of modern art to the cologne cathedral , " said barbara schock-werner , the cathedral 's master builder . gerhard richter is considered one of the most significant painters of our time .
his works adorn museum walls around the world and collectors drop millions to snap up his canvases .
the 74-year cologne-based artist is planning to unveil his monumental , 11,200-piece glass window in spring 2007 . gerhard richter has offered to craft the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184-square-foot -rrb- glass window as a gift to the city of cologne , the cathedral and its visitors .
donations will cover the production costs , which amount to some 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 447,000 -rrb- . a modern masterpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cologne cathedral attracts some 2.5 million visitors per year " the most important thing for me was to integrate this window into the cycle of historical windows , particularly as far as color goes , " schock-werner said .
richter 's window does n't prolong the existing tradition but develops it with his abstract use of color . glass squares in 80 different shades will replace a nearly transparent piece of glass that was inserted in the 1950 's after original window was destroyed during world war ii .
the plans for the damaged window , created in 1863 , had been lost so it could not be reproduced . the less-artistic interim piece needs to go because it lets too much light into the church and does n't correspond stylistically to the gothic cathedral , provost norbert feldhoff told german news source dpa . " the order of the individual colors is random , " said schock-werner , describing the all-over pattern of the squares , which measure 9.4 centimeters -lrb- 3.7 inches -rrb- on each side . the glass itself is not colored all the way through .
instead , colored pieces are attached to the outer surface of plain glass with the help of silicone . breaking a sacred art tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artist and his " abstract picture " from 1984 traditionally , church windows depicted biblical scenes .
long before computer books were printed , the panes told bible stories to illiterate parishioners by presenting them in brightly colored , larger-than-life images . however , richter 's window makes an intentional break from tradition .
it does n't render daniel in a den of lions , the flight of the egyptians , jesus ' birth , or the crucifixion .
in a sense , the church took a step of faith in abandoning a long-standing tradition and accepting a piece of art that is not explicitly religious . when asked if the window is a religious work of art , richter said , " oh , that 's hard to say .
art always has something to do with that . " even if christian motifs do n't appear in his latest glass work , crosses and other christian symbols are visible in many of his other works .
so it 's not without reason that richter received the german catholic art and culture prize two years ago . the making of an artist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richter painted milan 's gothic cathedral , which has similarities to cologne 's but is much larger this is n't the first time the internationally known artist has chosen colored glass as his medium .
in 1991 , for example , he created artistic accents for the hypobank in düsseldorf , which was designed by cologne architect oswald mathias ungers . richter became well known in the 1960s for modeling his paintings on photographs while using indistinct lines .
his works , which span a career of over 40 years , are stylistically diverse , as new york 's museum of modern art showed in 2002 .

gerhard richter 's current project is a modern 11,200-piece stained glass window for cologne 's gothic cathedral . the cologne cathedral 's new stained glass window by acclaimed german artist gerhard richter ca n't be overlooked , not only because of its immense size and conspicuous location but also because of its non-traditional approach . " the window will be a significant contribution of modern art to the cologne cathedral , " said barbara schock-werner , the cathedral 's master builder . gerhard richter is considered one of the most significant painters of our time .
his works adorn museum walls around the world and collectors drop millions to snap up his canvases .
the 74-year cologne-based artist is planning to unveil his monumental , 11,200-piece glass window in spring 2007 . gerhard richter has offered to craft the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184-square-foot -rrb- glass window as a gift to the city of cologne , the cathedral and its visitors .
donations will cover the production costs , which amount to some 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 447,000 -rrb- . a modern masterpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cologne cathedral attracts some 2.5 million visitors per year " the most important thing for me was to integrate this window into the cycle of historical windows , particularly as far as color goes , " schock-werner said .
richter 's window does n't prolong the existing tradition but develops it with his abstract use of color . glass squares in 80 different shades will replace a nearly transparent piece of glass that was inserted in the 1950 's after original window was destroyed during world war ii .
the plans for the damaged window , created in 1863 , had been lost so it could not be reproduced . the less-artistic interim piece needs to go because it lets too much light into the church and does n't correspond stylistically to the gothic cathedral , provost norbert feldhoff told german news source dpa . " the order of the individual colors is random , " said schock-werner , describing the all-over pattern of the squares , which measure 9.4 centimeters -lrb- 3.7 inches -rrb- on each side . the glass itself is not colored all the way through .
instead , colored pieces are attached to the outer surface of plain glass with the help of silicone . breaking a sacred art tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artist and his " abstract picture " from 1984 traditionally , church windows depicted biblical scenes .
long before computer books were printed , the panes told bible stories to illiterate parishioners by presenting them in brightly colored , larger-than-life images . however , richter 's window makes an intentional break from tradition .
it does n't render daniel in a den of lions , the flight of the egyptians , jesus ' birth , or the crucifixion .
in a sense , the church took a step of faith in abandoning a long-standing tradition and accepting a piece of art that is not explicitly religious . when asked if the window is a religious work of art , richter said , " oh , that 's hard to say .
art always has something to do with that . " even if christian motifs do n't appear in his latest glass work , crosses and other christian symbols are visible in many of his other works .
so it 's not without reason that richter received the german catholic art and culture prize two years ago . the making of an artist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richter painted milan 's gothic cathedral , which has similarities to cologne 's but is much larger this is n't the first time the internationally known artist has chosen colored glass as his medium .
in 1991 , for example , he created artistic accents for the hypobank in düsseldorf , which was designed by cologne architect oswald mathias ungers . richter became well known in the 1960s for modeling his paintings on photographs while using indistinct lines .
his works , which span a career of over 40 years , are stylistically diverse , as new york 's museum of modern art showed in 2002 .
in honor of the dresden native 's 70th birthday , the museum organized the largest retrospective exhibition ever done for a living artist . michael köhler / dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trash art litters cologne some say german artist ha schult likes to provoke .

31 or face the threat of sanctions .
germany and the united states applauded the measure .
but it was immediately rejected by tehran . united nations resolution 1696 expressed " serious concern " at iran 's refusal to comply with international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- orders to halt uranium enrichment and other work that could help build a nuclear bomb . the text did not include an immediate threat of sanctions , opposed by russia and china , and said punitive action would be the subject of further discussions .
but iaea director mohammed elbaradei will have to give a report on iran 's action by aug .
31 .
if iran does not suspend its nuclear work , the council would consider adopting " appropriate measures , " which could be economic and political sanctions . the resolution was passed by a 14-1 vote with qatar in opposition .
it was welcomed by the united states and its allies , but iran 's un ambassador javad zarif said it was " destructive and totally unwarranted " in a long speech to the council . " i would suggest to you that this approach will not lead to any productive outcome .
it can only exacerbate the situation , " zarif told the council .
he said iran was only ready for " serious and non-discriminatory " negotiations . " the door to negotiations is open . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the international community was setting a firm sign of its unity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un hopes diplomacy can still solve the iran conflict " it 's up to iran now to fulfil these binding demands of the international community and dispel the existing doubts about the peaceful nature of its nuclear program , " steinmeier said in a statement on monday .
" iran has the choice .
the door to negotiations is open . " us secretary of state condoleezza rice said the resolution 's wording meant iran still had time to cooperate with world powers on its nuclear program and avoid an all-out confrontation . " i want to be very clear that this does n't close the door to diplomacy , " rice told reporters on her way back to washington from a middle east peace mission . both rice and steinmeier said the extensive six-party package - worked out by germany , france , britain , the united states , russia and china - was still on the table . " our top goal remains finding an amicable diplomatic solution , " steinmeier said .
" i appeal to the leaders in tehran to take this opportunity and create the conditions for a return to the negotiating table . " iran is a potential volcano signals from tehran do not indicate that iran will comply to the un demands . " the security council resolution is unacceptable and is shifting the climate down a path which will help no one , " kazem jalali , spokesman for the iranian parliament 's foreign affairs commission , was quoted as saying by the isna news agency late monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar cast the lone dissenting vote qatar was the only council member to oppose the iran resolution .
it said it was too confrontational . " do we really want to see another volcano erupting in this region ? " said qatari un ambassador nassir abdulaziz al-nasser . russia and china gave their backing , though both said that there was no immediate threat of sanctions .
russian ambassador vitaly churkin said that even the next stage precluded any threat of military action . japan on tuesday welcomed the un resolution and said its position was unaffected by its close trade ties with the oil producer .
japan , a non-permanent member of the security council , is a close us ally but has also been a major investor in iran 's energy sector .
asia 's largest economy is heavily dependent on middle eastern oil . china said diplomacy was crucial in resolving the iran nuclear crisis . " china hopes the resolution on iran 's nuclear issue would serve the ongoing diplomatic efforts to settle the standoff , " the official xinhua news agency quoted foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao as saying tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.08.2006 fischer visits iran as calls for a diplomatic role gather pace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gone but not forgotten : some believe fischer 's middle east expertise should be used former german foreign minister joschka fischer began a four-day visit to iran monday as the guest of a tehran think-tank with a growing chorus calling for him to return to the middle east in a more official capacity . " i am not coming back , " joschka fischer said at the end of june , brushing aside suggestions he could return to fight another day for germany 's green party .
" the door is closed ; the key has been turned and thrown away . " the new professor of international economic policy at princeton university 's woodrow wilson school of public and international affairs may have meant every word he said when stepping down from government to concentrate on his new teaching position in the united states .
but in the space of almost a month , the former german foreign minister 's expertise in the middle east has become a more valuable commodity ; one which some wish to use again . the war in lebanon and the rapidly disintegrating relationship between the west and iran over the islamic republic 's nuclear ambitions have turned up the heat in the pressure cooker region , with diplomats from all nations struggling to find viable solutions to the problems in the middle east . a respected middle east expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer with the late palestinian leader yasser arafat some believe fischer , as an expert on the middle east who won the confidence of both jews and palestinians during his seven years as foreign minister , could prove to be an important player again in any negotiations - be it in an official or unofficial capacity . and while no official offer has been made for him to join germany 's efforts in ending the israel-hezbollah conflict or the nuclear stand-off with iran , fischer has been touted as a possible mediator in both crises , either as a german or european union representative . " as a proven international politician , respected both in israel and palestine , joschka fischer would be ideally placed to play a mediating role , as an eu envoy , aimed at negotiating a ceasefire -lrb- in lebanon -rrb- , " leading green meps daniel cohn-bendit from germany and italian monica frassoni said in a statement .
the german government and fischer himself have not responded to calls for such involvement in either the lebanon or iran crises .
however , fischer started a four-day visit to iran on monday where he will take part in a round table debate organized by tehran 's center for strategic studies after being invited by hassan rohani , iran 's former chief negotiator on its nuclear program . invitation shows fischer 's standing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rohani and fischer have a mutual respect although the private visit had been organized for some time , his inclusion in the debate shows that his regular visits to iran and the middle east during his tenure as germany 's top diplomat built many important working relationships and earned him respect in the region . and as the united nations security council prepares to set tehran a deadline for the suspension of its uranium enrichment program with sanctions seemingly unavoidable given iran 's belligerent stance , a man such as fischer who the iranians can trust could pave the way for talks to reopen .
he himself believes that negotiation with iran is the only way to secure a peaceful resolution to this and the wider problems in the region . " if an understanding can be found with tehran about its nuclear program and uranium enrichment , the situation in the middle east will change , " he recently told die zeit newspaper .
" if not , we are heading for an enormous crisis with unforeseeable consequences . " taking a different line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer at the un as for lebanon , fischer has already voiced his opinions and they differ from the current line of thinking .
while many diplomats believe a un force in lebanon is the way forward , fischer has said it would make " little sense " to deploy a larger un contingent to stabilize the country . " another blue-helmet mandate will make little sense , " fischer said .
" only a robust force with a robust mandate could perhaps achieve something positive .
but the risks are enormous .
i think it is far more important to put political pressure on the radicals and to commit ourselves to new peace negotiations . " fischer said the violence had been " orchestrated by foreign leaders of hamas as part of their struggle with the moderate elements in the movement . "
but iran and syria also had a hand in events , he added . he also accused the west , russia and the united nations of neglecting the middle east peace process . " never before has the west , the us , neglected this volatile conflict so dangerously , never before has the so-called middle east quartet , namely the us , the eu , the un and russia , shown so little commitment , " he said .
" this is a tragedy . " fischer 's supporters have urged the international community to " think outside the box " to solve the middle east crisis .
dispatching a former left-wing radical , self-styled rock 'n'roll politician and ex-german foreign minister to the region may be a viable alternative to the current efforts to secure peace . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de middle east cease-fire and un deployment on eu crisis agenda european union foreign ministers will hold a crisis meeting tuesday on the middle east , seeking to exploit a window of opportunity presented by israel 's 48-hour suspension of air strikes to push for a full cease-fire .

" i am not coming back , " joschka fischer said at the end of june , brushing aside suggestions he could return to fight another day for germany 's green party .
" the door is closed ; the key has been turned and thrown away .

but in the space of almost a month , the former german foreign minister 's expertise in the middle east has become a more valuable commodity ; one which some wish to use again . the war in lebanon and the rapidly disintegrating relationship between the west and iran over the islamic republic 's nuclear ambitions have turned up the heat in the pressure cooker region , with diplomats from all nations struggling to find viable solutions to the problems in the middle east . a respected middle east expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer with the late palestinian leader yasser arafat some believe fischer , as an expert on the middle east who won the confidence of both jews and palestinians during his seven years as foreign minister , could prove to be an important player again in any negotiations - be it in an official or unofficial capacity . and while no official offer has been made for him to join germany 's efforts in ending the israel-hezbollah conflict or the nuclear stand-off with iran , fischer has been touted as a possible mediator in both crises , either as a german or european union representative .

the german government and fischer himself have not responded to calls for such involvement in either the lebanon or iran crises .
however , fischer started a four-day visit to iran on monday where he will take part in a round table debate organized by tehran 's center for strategic studies after being invited by hassan rohani , iran 's former chief negotiator on its nuclear program . invitation shows fischer 's standing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rohani and fischer have a mutual respect although the private visit had been organized for some time , his inclusion in the debate shows that his regular visits to iran and the middle east during his tenure as germany 's top diplomat built many important working relationships and earned him respect in the region . and as the united nations security council prepares to set tehran a deadline for the suspension of its uranium enrichment program with sanctions seemingly unavoidable given iran 's belligerent stance , a man such as fischer who the iranians can trust could pave the way for talks to reopen .
he himself believes that negotiation with iran is the only way to secure a peaceful resolution to this and the wider problems in the region . " if an understanding can be found with tehran about its nuclear program and uranium enrichment , the situation in the middle east will change , " he recently told die zeit newspaper .

" taking a different line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer at the un as for lebanon , fischer has already voiced his opinions and they differ from the current line of thinking .
while many diplomats believe a un force in lebanon is the way forward , fischer has said it would make " little sense " to deploy a larger un contingent to stabilize the country . " another blue-helmet mandate will make little sense , " fischer said .
" only a robust force with a robust mandate could perhaps achieve something positive .
but the risks are enormous .
i think it is far more important to put political pressure on the radicals and to commit ourselves to new peace negotiations . " fischer said the violence had been " orchestrated by foreign leaders of hamas as part of their struggle with the moderate elements in the movement . "
but iran and syria also had a hand in events , he added . he also accused the west , russia and the united nations of neglecting the middle east peace process . " never before has the west , the us , neglected this volatile conflict so dangerously , never before has the so-called middle east quartet , namely the us , the eu , the un and russia , shown so little commitment , " he said .
" this is a tragedy . " fischer 's supporters have urged the international community to " think outside the box " to solve the middle east crisis .

" i am not coming back , " joschka fischer said at the end of june , brushing aside suggestions he could return to fight another day for germany 's green party .
" the door is closed ; the key has been turned and thrown away . " the new professor of international economic policy at princeton university 's woodrow wilson school of public and international affairs may have meant every word he said when stepping down from government to concentrate on his new teaching position in the united states .
but in the space of almost a month , the former german foreign minister 's expertise in the middle east has become a more valuable commodity ; one which some wish to use again . the war in lebanon and the rapidly disintegrating relationship between the west and iran over the islamic republic 's nuclear ambitions have turned up the heat in the pressure cooker region , with diplomats from all nations struggling to find viable solutions to the problems in the middle east . a respected middle east expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer with the late palestinian leader yasser arafat some believe fischer , as an expert on the middle east who won the confidence of both jews and palestinians during his seven years as foreign minister , could prove to be an important player again in any negotiations - be it in an official or unofficial capacity . and while no official offer has been made for him to join germany 's efforts in ending the israel-hezbollah conflict or the nuclear stand-off with iran , fischer has been touted as a possible mediator in both crises , either as a german or european union representative . " as a proven international politician , respected both in israel and palestine , joschka fischer would be ideally placed to play a mediating role , as an eu envoy , aimed at negotiating a ceasefire -lrb- in lebanon -rrb- , " leading green meps daniel cohn-bendit from germany and italian monica frassoni said in a statement .
the german government and fischer himself have not responded to calls for such involvement in either the lebanon or iran crises .
however , fischer started a four-day visit to iran on monday where he will take part in a round table debate organized by tehran 's center for strategic studies after being invited by hassan rohani , iran 's former chief negotiator on its nuclear program . invitation shows fischer 's standing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rohani and fischer have a mutual respect although the private visit had been organized for some time , his inclusion in the debate shows that his regular visits to iran and the middle east during his tenure as germany 's top diplomat built many important working relationships and earned him respect in the region . and as the united nations security council prepares to set tehran a deadline for the suspension of its uranium enrichment program with sanctions seemingly unavoidable given iran 's belligerent stance , a man such as fischer who the iranians can trust could pave the way for talks to reopen .
he himself believes that negotiation with iran is the only way to secure a peaceful resolution to this and the wider problems in the region . " if an understanding can be found with tehran about its nuclear program and uranium enrichment , the situation in the middle east will change , " he recently told die zeit newspaper .
" if not , we are heading for an enormous crisis with unforeseeable consequences . " taking a different line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer at the un as for lebanon , fischer has already voiced his opinions and they differ from the current line of thinking .
while many diplomats believe a un force in lebanon is the way forward , fischer has said it would make " little sense " to deploy a larger un contingent to stabilize the country . " another blue-helmet mandate will make little sense , " fischer said .
" only a robust force with a robust mandate could perhaps achieve something positive .
but the risks are enormous .
i think it is far more important to put political pressure on the radicals and to commit ourselves to new peace negotiations . " fischer said the violence had been " orchestrated by foreign leaders of hamas as part of their struggle with the moderate elements in the movement . "
but iran and syria also had a hand in events , he added . he also accused the west , russia and the united nations of neglecting the middle east peace process . " never before has the west , the us , neglected this volatile conflict so dangerously , never before has the so-called middle east quartet , namely the us , the eu , the un and russia , shown so little commitment , " he said .
" this is a tragedy . " fischer 's supporters have urged the international community to " think outside the box " to solve the middle east crisis .

he is also part of the committee on foreign relations . dw-world.de : after the middle east conference in rome , crisis diplomacy was in full gear - but there is still no unified demand for a hasty end to the violence .
how would you assess the rome conference ? rolf mützenich : i had hoped for more .
however , it was good that important states and international organizations were able to agree on common terminology at the rome conference .
this can only be evaluated in the context of the g8 summit , the eu foreign minister conferences and deliberations in the un security council . therein lies the bottom line : we need a lasting cease-fire as quickly as possible .
the use of military violence must be stopped . israel sees the concluding declaration from the rome conference as a carte blanche to continue its lebanon offensive , while german foreign minister steinmeier spoke of a " great misunderstanding . "
did the international community , particularly the european union , contribute to the legitimization of this legally questionable campaign ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf mützenich is a historian and political scientist the interpretation of israel 's justice minister is completely absurd .
the legitimization of the disproportionate use of violence is not the issue here .
both sides have harmed the civilian population with military means , which finally has to stop . what we need is a stepwise process : a cease-fire for humanitarian aid and a solution to prevent further escalations in this region . political observers and middle east experts have criticized germany 's passivity since the beginning of the middle east crisis .
is the german stance breaking down unity within the eu ?
and how can the eu be a counterweight to the pro-israel position that the us is taking ? i do n't see any passivity .
other european capitals that have a colonial past in the region could be accused of passivity .
but the german foreign minister is doing quite a lot , both within the region and outside of it .
he was not only in israel , egypt and palestine , he also sent representatives to beirut , damascus and new york .
this is very active diplomacy . however , our influence remains marginal , especially as the american foreign policy is too hesitant .
i do n't at all share the american secretary of state 's perspective that a new middle east emerging .
it makes me dizzy to think that new structures should be formed by violent means .
that is a perception that belongs in the past . the then-ruling coalition between the social democrats and the greens was supported by the population in 2003 when the it rejected the iraq war as contrary to international law .
in the current conflict , the german people seem to view israel 's conduct with increasingly sharper criticism than the elite decision makers , particularly in light of civilian suffering .
is this a sign of a significant discrepancy between the political elite and the general population ? it 's not as clear-cut as you imply .
there are some differences between the two cases .
first of all , israel was actively attacked .
soldiers were abducted in gaza and on the lebanese-israeli border .
israel believes its very existence is in danger , and as the iranian president does not miss any opportunity to make anti-israeli and anti-semitic comments , it is completely understandable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mützenich said the war came just as improvement in lebanon was beginning however , israel is committing unrestrained violence against large parts of lebanon and the lebanese population that do not have anything to do with the current crisis .
the tragedy becomes even more depressing when we consider that a new lebanon with an active public society was just beginning to show itself in the past few months . of course , these are not singular events in region that has known violence for decades .
it 's bitter that - with israel 's bombardment , the abduction of the soldiers , the arrest of freely elected palestinian delegates and ministers and israel 's military campaign - the process in palestine was ended . perhaps part of the hamas would have gone down the path that fatah took - that is , recognizing israel 's right to existence and abstaining from violence .
the prisoners ' paper opened a new window for peace a few weeks ago .
but extremists did n't want this solution .
even groups in israel were n't happy to see this kind of solution to the negotiations . loay mudhoon interviewed rolf mützenich -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click on the links to read dw-world.de 's compilation of articles on the conflict and the search for peace .

he is also part of the committee on foreign relations . dw-world.de : after the middle east conference in rome , crisis diplomacy was in full gear - but there is still no unified demand for a hasty end to the violence .
how would you assess the rome conference ? rolf mützenich : i had hoped for more .
however , it was good that important states and international organizations were able to agree on common terminology at the rome conference .
this can only be evaluated in the context of the g8 summit , the eu foreign minister conferences and deliberations in the un security council . therein lies the bottom line : we need a lasting cease-fire as quickly as possible .
the use of military violence must be stopped . israel sees the concluding declaration from the rome conference as a carte blanche to continue its lebanon offensive , while german foreign minister steinmeier spoke of a " great misunderstanding . "
did the international community , particularly the european union , contribute to the legitimization of this legally questionable campaign ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf mützenich is a historian and political scientist the interpretation of israel 's justice minister is completely absurd .
the legitimization of the disproportionate use of violence is not the issue here .
both sides have harmed the civilian population with military means , which finally has to stop . what we need is a stepwise process : a cease-fire for humanitarian aid and a solution to prevent further escalations in this region . political observers and middle east experts have criticized germany 's passivity since the beginning of the middle east crisis .
is the german stance breaking down unity within the eu ?
and how can the eu be a counterweight to the pro-israel position that the us is taking ? i do n't see any passivity .
other european capitals that have a colonial past in the region could be accused of passivity .
but the german foreign minister is doing quite a lot , both within the region and outside of it .
he was not only in israel , egypt and palestine , he also sent representatives to beirut , damascus and new york .
this is very active diplomacy . however , our influence remains marginal , especially as the american foreign policy is too hesitant .
i do n't at all share the american secretary of state 's perspective that a new middle east emerging .
it makes me dizzy to think that new structures should be formed by violent means .
that is a perception that belongs in the past . the then-ruling coalition between the social democrats and the greens was supported by the population in 2003 when the it rejected the iraq war as contrary to international law .
in the current conflict , the german people seem to view israel 's conduct with increasingly sharper criticism than the elite decision makers , particularly in light of civilian suffering .
is this a sign of a significant discrepancy between the political elite and the general population ? it 's not as clear-cut as you imply .
there are some differences between the two cases .
first of all , israel was actively attacked .
soldiers were abducted in gaza and on the lebanese-israeli border .
israel believes its very existence is in danger , and as the iranian president does not miss any opportunity to make anti-israeli and anti-semitic comments , it is completely understandable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mützenich said the war came just as improvement in lebanon was beginning however , israel is committing unrestrained violence against large parts of lebanon and the lebanese population that do not have anything to do with the current crisis .
the tragedy becomes even more depressing when we consider that a new lebanon with an active public society was just beginning to show itself in the past few months . of course , these are not singular events in region that has known violence for decades .
it 's bitter that - with israel 's bombardment , the abduction of the soldiers , the arrest of freely elected palestinian delegates and ministers and israel 's military campaign - the process in palestine was ended . perhaps part of the hamas would have gone down the path that fatah took - that is , recognizing israel 's right to existence and abstaining from violence .
the prisoners ' paper opened a new window for peace a few weeks ago .
but extremists did n't want this solution .

israel suspends air strikes for 48-hours but says war goes on israel has finally agreed to a limited ceasefire in lebanon with a 48-hour suspension of air strikes but israeli justice minister haim ramon said it did n't mean that the jewish state was ending its war against hezbollah .

this is very active diplomacy . however , our influence remains marginal , especially as the american foreign policy is too hesitant .
i do n't at all share the american secretary of state 's perspective that a new middle east emerging .
it makes me dizzy to think that new structures should be formed by violent means .
that is a perception that belongs in the past . the then-ruling coalition between the social democrats and the greens was supported by the population in 2003 when the it rejected the iraq war as contrary to international law .
in the current conflict , the german people seem to view israel 's conduct with increasingly sharper criticism than the elite decision makers , particularly in light of civilian suffering .
is this a sign of a significant discrepancy between the political elite and the general population ? it 's not as clear-cut as you imply .
there are some differences between the two cases .
first of all , israel was actively attacked .
soldiers were abducted in gaza and on the lebanese-israeli border .
israel believes its very existence is in danger , and as the iranian president does not miss any opportunity to make anti-israeli and anti-semitic comments , it is completely understandable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mützenich said the war came just as improvement in lebanon was beginning however , israel is committing unrestrained violence against large parts of lebanon and the lebanese population that do not have anything to do with the current crisis .
the tragedy becomes even more depressing when we consider that a new lebanon with an active public society was just beginning to show itself in the past few months . of course , these are not singular events in region that has known violence for decades .
it 's bitter that - with israel 's bombardment , the abduction of the soldiers , the arrest of freely elected palestinian delegates and ministers and israel 's military campaign - the process in palestine was ended . perhaps part of the hamas would have gone down the path that fatah took - that is , recognizing israel 's right to existence and abstaining from violence .
the prisoners ' paper opened a new window for peace a few weeks ago .
but extremists did n't want this solution .
even groups in israel were n't happy to see this kind of solution to the negotiations . loay mudhoon interviewed rolf mützenich -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click on the links to read dw-world.de 's compilation of articles on the conflict and the search for peace .
israel suspends air strikes for 48-hours but says war goes on israel has finally agreed to a limited ceasefire in lebanon with a 48-hour suspension of air strikes but israeli justice minister haim ramon said it did n't mean that the jewish state was ending its war against hezbollah .
-lrb- july 31 , 2006 -rrb- german government criticized for stance on lebanese refugees after germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble said it would be " premature " and " misguided " for germany to take in lebanese refugees , opposition politicians and humanitarian organizations responded with anger .

groom and groom or bride and bride became possible due to a new law on same-sex registered partnerships . it was actually just over five years ago that one of klaus jetz 's long-sought-after goals was realized .
after long debate and much lobbying from the organization he directs , the lesbian and gay association of germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , the german parliament passed the " registered partnership " bill , which gave gay and lesbian couples new status in the eyes of the state , one that had many of the advantages of marriage .
the law he had fought so hard for went into effect on aug .
1 , 2001 . " since the early 90s , the lsvd had fought for this , and back then , it all seemed so far off , " he said .
" then with the change of government in 1998 , the chance to make it a reality arrived . " for many long-time same-sex couples , whose daily reality had looked pretty much like a marriage , their relationships were now sanctioned by the coalition government of left-of-center social democrats and greens under gerhard schröder .
the law entitles gay and lesbian couples who registered their partnerships some of the advantages heterosexual married couples enjoy . same-sex couples can now share a last name , refuse to testify against one another in court and have same inheritance and tenants ' rights as heterosexual spouses .
a foreigner legally joined in a gay partnership to a german can apply for the right to citizenship .
partners also take on a responsibility to maintain and support the other in the case of financial difficulties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another happy couple on jan .
1 , 2005 , the law was amended , giving one partner the right to adopt the other partner 's biological child , so-called stepchild adoption .
other rights were expanded , such as the area of property rights , which moved registered partnerships closer to heterosexual marriage . but attempts to give same-sex partners the same tax and welfare benefits as those enjoyed by heterosexual couples were defeated in the conservative-dominated upper house of the german parliament . almost " normal " while it is difficult to know exactly how many same-sex couples have registered their partnerships over the five years of the law because of different recording criteria in germany 's federal states , estimates range between 14,000 and 20,000 . " in 2001 , there were many same-sex couples who knew they wanted to become registered partners and were just waiting for the ink of this law to be dry , " said ute terwedow from the civil registry office in cologne .
" that accounts for the large numbers we saw at the outset .
now the whole thing has become very normal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lsvd 's axel blumenthal , left , and green politician volker beck , signaled their optimism that the constitutional court would rule in their favor in 2002 in cologne in 2002 , 285 same-sex couples registered their partnerships - a " record year , " according to terwedow .
since then , between 170 and 180 couples have tied the knot every year .
according to a survey by the dpa news agency , gay men are saying " i do " much more often than lesbians .
in cologne , only a third of same-sex couples at the registry office are women . when " gay marriage " was under debate in germany , some talked about it being a danger to the nation 's culture fabric and there were fears that it would undermine traditional marriage .
several states led by the conservative union political parties asked the law to be reviewed by the constitutional court , in the hope it would declared unconstitutional .
it was not .
five years later , however , same-sex unions have gained a societal acceptance that exceeds even what optimists had predicted . discriminatory even though klaus jetz celebrated the law 's coming into effect five years ago , he and his partner of 11 years have chosen not to tie the knot at the registry office .
while he said the current law marks progress in the area of gay and lesbian rights , he still finds parts of it unacceptable , since a registered partnership is not the same thing as a marriage .
some have called it marriage " light , " since it has most of traditional marriage 's responsibilities , but fewer of its advantages . there are differences regarding income taxes , joint tax assessments , and inheritance taxes .
for example , it is almost impossible to inherit an apartment from a deceased partner , jetz says , because of the high inheritance taxes that would have to be paid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain legalized gay marriage in 2005 in the face of opposition from the church and conservatives heterosexual married couples , on the other hand , enjoy a tax exemption of 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 635,000 -rrb- .
same-sex couples do not .
and unlike heterosexuals , or gay couples in the neighboring netherlands , german couples will not have the right to adopt .

he would like to see the government take up the issue again , but said the current coalition under conservative chancellor angela merkel is not likely to .

groom and groom or bride and bride became possible due to a new law on same-sex registered partnerships . it was actually just over five years ago that one of klaus jetz 's long-sought-after goals was realized .
after long debate and much lobbying from the organization he directs , the lesbian and gay association of germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , the german parliament passed the " registered partnership " bill , which gave gay and lesbian couples new status in the eyes of the state , one that had many of the advantages of marriage .
the law he had fought so hard for went into effect on aug .
1 , 2001 . " since the early 90s , the lsvd had fought for this , and back then , it all seemed so far off , " he said .
" then with the change of government in 1998 , the chance to make it a reality arrived . " for many long-time same-sex couples , whose daily reality had looked pretty much like a marriage , their relationships were now sanctioned by the coalition government of left-of-center social democrats and greens under gerhard schröder .
the law entitles gay and lesbian couples who registered their partnerships some of the advantages heterosexual married couples enjoy . same-sex couples can now share a last name , refuse to testify against one another in court and have same inheritance and tenants ' rights as heterosexual spouses .
a foreigner legally joined in a gay partnership to a german can apply for the right to citizenship .
partners also take on a responsibility to maintain and support the other in the case of financial difficulties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another happy couple on jan .
1 , 2005 , the law was amended , giving one partner the right to adopt the other partner 's biological child , so-called stepchild adoption .
other rights were expanded , such as the area of property rights , which moved registered partnerships closer to heterosexual marriage . but attempts to give same-sex partners the same tax and welfare benefits as those enjoyed by heterosexual couples were defeated in the conservative-dominated upper house of the german parliament . almost " normal " while it is difficult to know exactly how many same-sex couples have registered their partnerships over the five years of the law because of different recording criteria in germany 's federal states , estimates range between 14,000 and 20,000 . " in 2001 , there were many same-sex couples who knew they wanted to become registered partners and were just waiting for the ink of this law to be dry , " said ute terwedow from the civil registry office in cologne .
" that accounts for the large numbers we saw at the outset .
now the whole thing has become very normal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lsvd 's axel blumenthal , left , and green politician volker beck , signaled their optimism that the constitutional court would rule in their favor in 2002 in cologne in 2002 , 285 same-sex couples registered their partnerships - a " record year , " according to terwedow .
since then , between 170 and 180 couples have tied the knot every year .
according to a survey by the dpa news agency , gay men are saying " i do " much more often than lesbians .
in cologne , only a third of same-sex couples at the registry office are women . when " gay marriage " was under debate in germany , some talked about it being a danger to the nation 's culture fabric and there were fears that it would undermine traditional marriage .
several states led by the conservative union political parties asked the law to be reviewed by the constitutional court , in the hope it would declared unconstitutional .
it was not .
five years later , however , same-sex unions have gained a societal acceptance that exceeds even what optimists had predicted . discriminatory even though klaus jetz celebrated the law 's coming into effect five years ago , he and his partner of 11 years have chosen not to tie the knot at the registry office .
while he said the current law marks progress in the area of gay and lesbian rights , he still finds parts of it unacceptable , since a registered partnership is not the same thing as a marriage .
some have called it marriage " light , " since it has most of traditional marriage 's responsibilities , but fewer of its advantages . there are differences regarding income taxes , joint tax assessments , and inheritance taxes .
for example , it is almost impossible to inherit an apartment from a deceased partner , jetz says , because of the high inheritance taxes that would have to be paid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain legalized gay marriage in 2005 in the face of opposition from the church and conservatives heterosexual married couples , on the other hand , enjoy a tax exemption of 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 635,000 -rrb- .

and unlike heterosexuals , or gay couples in the neighboring netherlands , german couples will not have the right to adopt . " in germany we are still far away from complete equality for homosexual partnerships , " said volker beck , a green parliamentarian who has been a major backer of the law . the discrepancies came about because the registered partnership bill was split into two parts when it went through parliament .
the section that dealt with many of the financial aspects , such as tax law , would have had to be approved by the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
because that body was dominated by conservatives , the left-of-center government did not try to push it through , since it would have gone down to defeat . " now we need to take a new run at the partnership law to complete it , " jetz said . but he does n't want to downplay the importance of the law , calling it a paradigm change in germany , something that was almost inconceivable just 15 years ago .
he would like to see the government take up the issue again , but said the current coalition under conservative chancellor angela merkel is not likely to .

but , several cities there are vying to be the first to produce a similar rail system . news reports that china is building its first magnetic-levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- rail system have been circulating in the media for months .
a report published this week in the newspaper china daily said the north-eastern port city dalian planned to construct the first commercial chinese-made maglev train test line this year .
" lines such as these are being built in great numbers in china , " said petra aldenrath , the china correspondent in beijing for german public radio network ard .
" they are all only short test stretches so far and the trains can not be compared to those of transrapid by the siemens-thyssenkrupp consortium . " a report in the china business daily confirmed that the german transrapid was superior to its chinese competition .
the publication compared five transrapid models developed in china . " our media mix truth and fiction .
none of the models developed in china are ready for use , " the paper quoted a chinese maglev train expert as saying . chinese technology is illusory the world 's only commercial maglev system in the world links shanghai 's financial district and its pudong airport .
instead of mechanical components such as wheels and rails , the transrapid system uses electronics : non-contact electromagnetic levitation , guidance , and propulsion systems .

this system will also be less expensive , he said . " combined with the abundant resources of permanent magnetic materials in china , our technology will be about 50 percent cheaper than that of foreign countries , " li said in the china daily . the dalian train would reach speeds of 220 kilometers per hour , li said . but the technology based on such an engine was by far not as complicated as the transrapid , said aldenrath . " it is illusory to think you can go 220 kilometers per hour on just three kilometers of tracks , " said transrapid spokesman peter wiegelmann .
" you would need rocket propulsion for that . " china wants technology in exchange for contract china is planning an extension of its shanghai connection to the city of hangzhou , 180 kilometers away . earlier this year , germany rejected china 's demands for access to sensitive maglev technology in exchange for building this $ 4.3 billion high-tech rail link .

an estimated 45 per cent of the internally displaced are children . the lebanese health ministry estimated that 750 people have been killed and more than 2,000 wounded in lebanon .

for those at the acclaimed architecture firm gerkan , marg and partners -lrb- gmp -rrb- , the dream has come true yet again - this time in south africa . berlin architects meinhard von gerkan , volkwin marg and their colleagues were commissioned to build three of the five new stadiums planned for the 2010 world cup soccer championship in south africa .
they introduced their plans recently , just weeks after the conclusion of the 2006 world cup in germany . " it even surprised us , " said architect hubert nienhoff from gmp , whose firm has been working on stadiums in cape town , durban and port elizabeth . an arch for the durban skyline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the durban stadium will sit near the indian ocean gerkan , marg and partners also rebuilt stadiums in frankfurt , cologne and berlin in preparation for this year 's world cup .
they 're not novices and it shows . it was the creative touch of nienhoff 's team that won his firm the contract in south africa .
the durban stadium 's facade , which is made up of slats , will protect against sun and rain while not obstructing the view to the outside .
the highlight of the new building is an arch that will span across the stadium .
it will be visible from afar and is expected to enrich the city 's skyline . organizers wanted " to put durban on the map " with the new stadium construction , said nienhoff , which is largely why his team 's unique design was selected . short on time and money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the remodeling of berlin 's olympic stadium is on the firm 's impressive resume though the three new south african stadiums are meant to outlive the 2010 world cup and make a lasting impact on the respective cities , the budget for their remodeling is relatively low compared to similar projects in other countries . only a quarter of the funds invested in the remodeling of the olympic stadium in berlin has been budgeted for the updated port elizabeth stadium , for example . money , however , is less problematic than time . " the decision to start with the construction of the stadiums now is actually too late for us germans , " nienhoff said . it 's no secret that the south african 's have a different relationship with time than the germans do .
international soccer association fifa allegedly discussed behind closed doors the possibility of pulling the 2010 championship from south africa due to the country 's less than timely preparation schedule . up for the challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have a hand in the next world cup " one thing is for sure : the south africans are incredibly proud of their country and are n't going to let anyone doubt that they can pull it off , " nienhoff said . despite the difficulties that inevitably accompany a project of this magnitude , nienhoff is confident of success .
his hope is that people will enjoy coming to the three new stadiums and that the german architecture will touch other parts of africa too . nina werkhäuser -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup scores goal for german economy since the world cup ended , host nation germany has been counting the immediate economic benefits for businesses during the month-long event .

then the first high-ranking priest admitted he was involved . at first , michal czajkowski , a leading church figure known for his work on catholic-jewish relations , rejected the accusations made against him .
but in july , he admitted to spying on his colleagues for 24 years , beginning in 1960 .
soon after , he quit as co-chairman of the polish christian-jewish council . church collaboration hits poland especially hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czajkowski is known for his work on catholic-jewish relations " i want to apologize and ask for forgiveness , especially for those whom i have hurt - i displayed a weakness of character , " czajkowski wrote in a statement printed by polish newspapers .
" i have already expressed my regret toward god .
now i am doing it toward people . " in other former communist countries still grappling with their past , such admissions may be surprising .
but they do n't have the power to shock as in poland , where during four decades of communist rule , the church remained stronger than anywhere else in the bloc and was seen as the focal point to passive resistance and opposition to the regime . in the former communist czechoslovakia , for example , the church played a smaller role in society , and even today , the czechs are among the least devout nations in europe .
in hungary , the catholic church has also admitted that dozens of its priests spied on their colleagues without raising the same level of public shock seen in poland . germany still investigating its own past like other states behind the iron curtain , the churches in the former east germany have had to deal with allegations that their clergy , especially in the protestant church , appeased or supported communist officials . michael zöller , a professor of sociology and religion at the university of bayreuth said collaboration with the communists was more prevalent in the protestant church in the former east germany . " the catholic church was more protected because the gdr wanted to be on good terms with the vatican , " zöller said .
" protestants were more forced to cooperate , especially to be able to get some leeway in their activities . " some clergy members thought of it as a progressive alliance because there was an affinity between church doctrine and socialism - it even attracted clergy from west germany , such as angela merkel 's father , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stolpe has been accused of collaborating with the communists in germany , the opening of the east german secret police , or stasi , archives brought up a number of allegations against east german church officials most famously , former brandenburg premier manfred stolpe , who also served as germany 's minister of transportation , building and housing until 2005 .
stolpe was a high-ranking official of the gdr 's evangelical church and has denied the charges . zöller said he believes that issues of collaboration among the clergy will continue to come up , as historians continue to pore through the stasi files . " officials are still processing documents , " he said .
" who knows yet what information they contain . " over 10 percent of polish priests collaborated polish priest czajkowski was a willing spy , according to the warsaw-based national remembrance institute , which manages communist archives and investigates crimes of that era .
the institute said he reported on the church 's and clergy 's pro-democracy activities and only stopped after regime agents murdered the chaplain of the solidarity trade union , jerzy popieluszko , whom czajkowski is accused of spying on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands in poland mourned pope john paul ii 's death poland 's catholic church , including former pope john paul ii , is widely credited with the rise of solidarity , the movement that brought down the communists and took control of poland in 1989 .
even though the church openly supported the group , the national remembrance institute said about 10 percent to 15 percent of the clergy collaborated with the communists . until recently , the church has refused to cooperate with investigations or provide names regarding collaborators among the clergy .
however , last year after similar allegations against an aide to pope john paul ii , konrad hejmo , surfaced , and the church suspended him .
hejmo denied the charges , which include spying on the late pope . coming to terms with the past now the catholic church in poland is working at coming to terms with its role in communist times .
earlier this year , church officials said they would begin investigating members of the clergy for collaborating with the communists .
soon after , the polish conference of catholic bishops issued an official apology to the public . " priests and others linked with the church who collaborated with the security services of the communist state cast a shadow on the catholic church 's heroic history under communist rule , " the bishops wrote , adding that an initiative to make public its complete list of collaborators is moving forward . the actions of a few priests also should not diminish the church 's role in promoting democracy , according to wojtek muszynski of the national remembrance institute .

then the first high-ranking priest admitted he was involved . at first , michal czajkowski , a leading church figure known for his work on catholic-jewish relations , rejected the accusations made against him .
but in july , he admitted to spying on his colleagues for 24 years , beginning in 1960 .
soon after , he quit as co-chairman of the polish christian-jewish council . church collaboration hits poland especially hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czajkowski is known for his work on catholic-jewish relations " i want to apologize and ask for forgiveness , especially for those whom i have hurt - i displayed a weakness of character , " czajkowski wrote in a statement printed by polish newspapers .
" i have already expressed my regret toward god .
now i am doing it toward people . " in other former communist countries still grappling with their past , such admissions may be surprising .
but they do n't have the power to shock as in poland , where during four decades of communist rule , the church remained stronger than anywhere else in the bloc and was seen as the focal point to passive resistance and opposition to the regime . in the former communist czechoslovakia , for example , the church played a smaller role in society , and even today , the czechs are among the least devout nations in europe .
in hungary , the catholic church has also admitted that dozens of its priests spied on their colleagues without raising the same level of public shock seen in poland . germany still investigating its own past like other states behind the iron curtain , the churches in the former east germany have had to deal with allegations that their clergy , especially in the protestant church , appeased or supported communist officials . michael zöller , a professor of sociology and religion at the university of bayreuth said collaboration with the communists was more prevalent in the protestant church in the former east germany . " the catholic church was more protected because the gdr wanted to be on good terms with the vatican , " zöller said .
" protestants were more forced to cooperate , especially to be able to get some leeway in their activities . " some clergy members thought of it as a progressive alliance because there was an affinity between church doctrine and socialism - it even attracted clergy from west germany , such as angela merkel 's father , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stolpe has been accused of collaborating with the communists in germany , the opening of the east german secret police , or stasi , archives brought up a number of allegations against east german church officials most famously , former brandenburg premier manfred stolpe , who also served as germany 's minister of transportation , building and housing until 2005 .
stolpe was a high-ranking official of the gdr 's evangelical church and has denied the charges . zöller said he believes that issues of collaboration among the clergy will continue to come up , as historians continue to pore through the stasi files . " officials are still processing documents , " he said .
" who knows yet what information they contain . " over 10 percent of polish priests collaborated polish priest czajkowski was a willing spy , according to the warsaw-based national remembrance institute , which manages communist archives and investigates crimes of that era .
the institute said he reported on the church 's and clergy 's pro-democracy activities and only stopped after regime agents murdered the chaplain of the solidarity trade union , jerzy popieluszko , whom czajkowski is accused of spying on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands in poland mourned pope john paul ii 's death poland 's catholic church , including former pope john paul ii , is widely credited with the rise of solidarity , the movement that brought down the communists and took control of poland in 1989 .
even though the church openly supported the group , the national remembrance institute said about 10 percent to 15 percent of the clergy collaborated with the communists . until recently , the church has refused to cooperate with investigations or provide names regarding collaborators among the clergy .
however , last year after similar allegations against an aide to pope john paul ii , konrad hejmo , surfaced , and the church suspended him .
hejmo denied the charges , which include spying on the late pope . coming to terms with the past now the catholic church in poland is working at coming to terms with its role in communist times .
earlier this year , church officials said they would begin investigating members of the clergy for collaborating with the communists .
soon after , the polish conference of catholic bishops issued an official apology to the public . " priests and others linked with the church who collaborated with the security services of the communist state cast a shadow on the catholic church 's heroic history under communist rule , " the bishops wrote , adding that an initiative to make public its complete list of collaborators is moving forward . the actions of a few priests also should not diminish the church 's role in promoting democracy , according to wojtek muszynski of the national remembrance institute . " the polish catholic church was still a hero , " he said .
" no matter how hard the secret service tried , they did n't break down 85 to 90 percent of the priests .

for those at the acclaimed architecture firm gerkan , marg and partners -lrb- gmp -rrb- , the dream has come true yet again - this time in south africa . berlin architects meinhard von gerkan , volkwin marg and their colleagues were commissioned to build three of the five new stadiums planned for the 2010 world cup soccer championship in south africa .
they introduced their plans recently , just weeks after the conclusion of the 2006 world cup in germany . " it even surprised us , " said architect hubert nienhoff from gmp , whose firm has been working on stadiums in cape town , durban and port elizabeth . an arch for the durban skyline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the durban stadium will sit near the indian ocean gerkan , marg and partners also rebuilt stadiums in frankfurt , cologne and berlin in preparation for this year 's world cup .
they 're not novices and it shows . it was the creative touch of nienhoff 's team that won his firm the contract in south africa .
the durban stadium 's facade , which is made up of slats , will protect against sun and rain while not obstructing the view to the outside .
the highlight of the new building is an arch that will span across the stadium .
it will be visible from afar and is expected to enrich the city 's skyline . organizers wanted " to put durban on the map " with the new stadium construction , said nienhoff , which is largely why his team 's unique design was selected . short on time and money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the remodeling of berlin 's olympic stadium is on the firm 's impressive resume though the three new south african stadiums are meant to outlive the 2010 world cup and make a lasting impact on the respective cities , the budget for their remodeling is relatively low compared to similar projects in other countries . only a quarter of the funds invested in the remodeling of the olympic stadium in berlin has been budgeted for the updated port elizabeth stadium , for example . money , however , is less problematic than time . " the decision to start with the construction of the stadiums now is actually too late for us germans , " nienhoff said . it 's no secret that the south african 's have a different relationship with time than the germans do .
international soccer association fifa allegedly discussed behind closed doors the possibility of pulling the 2010 championship from south africa due to the country 's less than timely preparation schedule . up for the challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have a hand in the next world cup " one thing is for sure : the south africans are incredibly proud of their country and are n't going to let anyone doubt that they can pull it off , " nienhoff said . despite the difficulties that inevitably accompany a project of this magnitude , nienhoff is confident of success .
his hope is that people will enjoy coming to the three new stadiums and that the german architecture will touch other parts of africa too . nina werkhäuser -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup scores goal for german economy since the world cup ended , host nation germany has been counting the immediate economic benefits for businesses during the month-long event .

germany and the united states applauded the measure .
but it was immediately rejected by tehran . united nations resolution 1696 expressed " serious concern " at iran 's refusal to comply with international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- orders to halt uranium enrichment and other work that could help build a nuclear bomb . the text did not include an immediate threat of sanctions , opposed by russia and china , and said punitive action would be the subject of further discussions .
but iaea director mohammed elbaradei will have to give a report on iran 's action by aug .
31 .
if iran does not suspend its nuclear work , the council would consider adopting " appropriate measures , " which could be economic and political sanctions . the resolution was passed by a 14-1 vote with qatar in opposition .
it was welcomed by the united states and its allies , but iran 's un ambassador javad zarif said it was " destructive and totally unwarranted " in a long speech to the council . " i would suggest to you that this approach will not lead to any productive outcome .
it can only exacerbate the situation , " zarif told the council .

" iran has the choice .
the door to negotiations is open . " us secretary of state condoleezza rice said the resolution 's wording meant iran still had time to cooperate with world powers on its nuclear program and avoid an all-out confrontation . " i want to be very clear that this does n't close the door to diplomacy , " rice told reporters on her way back to washington from a middle east peace mission . both rice and steinmeier said the extensive six-party package - worked out by germany , france , britain , the united states , russia and china - was still on the table . " our top goal remains finding an amicable diplomatic solution , " steinmeier said .
" i appeal to the leaders in tehran to take this opportunity and create the conditions for a return to the negotiating table .

it said it was too confrontational . " do we really want to see another volcano erupting in this region ? " said qatari un ambassador nassir abdulaziz al-nasser . russia and china gave their backing , though both said that there was no immediate threat of sanctions .
russian ambassador vitaly churkin said that even the next stage precluded any threat of military action . japan on tuesday welcomed the un resolution and said its position was unaffected by its close trade ties with the oil producer .
japan , a non-permanent member of the security council , is a close us ally but has also been a major investor in iran 's energy sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 01.08.2006 gothic meets modern in gerhard richter 's glass window großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richter 's multihued window will be finished early next year he 's been called a modern-day picasso and recently became the most expensive living painter .
gerhard richter 's current project is a modern 11,200-piece stained glass window for cologne 's gothic cathedral . the cologne cathedral 's new stained glass window by acclaimed german artist gerhard richter ca n't be overlooked , not only because of its immense size and conspicuous location but also because of its non-traditional approach . " the window will be a significant contribution of modern art to the cologne cathedral , " said barbara schock-werner , the cathedral 's master builder . gerhard richter is considered one of the most significant painters of our time .
his works adorn museum walls around the world and collectors drop millions to snap up his canvases .
the 74-year cologne-based artist is planning to unveil his monumental , 11,200-piece glass window in spring 2007 . gerhard richter has offered to craft the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184-square-foot -rrb- glass window as a gift to the city of cologne , the cathedral and its visitors .
donations will cover the production costs , which amount to some 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 447,000 -rrb- . a modern masterpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cologne cathedral attracts some 2.5 million visitors per year " the most important thing for me was to integrate this window into the cycle of historical windows , particularly as far as color goes , " schock-werner said .
richter 's window does n't prolong the existing tradition but develops it with his abstract use of color . glass squares in 80 different shades will replace a nearly transparent piece of glass that was inserted in the 1950 's after original window was destroyed during world war ii .
the plans for the damaged window , created in 1863 , had been lost so it could not be reproduced . the less-artistic interim piece needs to go because it lets too much light into the church and does n't correspond stylistically to the gothic cathedral , provost norbert feldhoff told german news source dpa . " the order of the individual colors is random , " said schock-werner , describing the all-over pattern of the squares , which measure 9.4 centimeters -lrb- 3.7 inches -rrb- on each side . the glass itself is not colored all the way through .
instead , colored pieces are attached to the outer surface of plain glass with the help of silicone . breaking a sacred art tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artist and his " abstract picture " from 1984 traditionally , church windows depicted biblical scenes .
long before computer books were printed , the panes told bible stories to illiterate parishioners by presenting them in brightly colored , larger-than-life images . however , richter 's window makes an intentional break from tradition .
it does n't render daniel in a den of lions , the flight of the egyptians , jesus ' birth , or the crucifixion .
in a sense , the church took a step of faith in abandoning a long-standing tradition and accepting a piece of art that is not explicitly religious . when asked if the window is a religious work of art , richter said , " oh , that 's hard to say .
art always has something to do with that . " even if christian motifs do n't appear in his latest glass work , crosses and other christian symbols are visible in many of his other works .
so it 's not without reason that richter received the german catholic art and culture prize two years ago . the making of an artist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richter painted milan 's gothic cathedral , which has similarities to cologne 's but is much larger this is n't the first time the internationally known artist has chosen colored glass as his medium .
in 1991 , for example , he created artistic accents for the hypobank in düsseldorf , which was designed by cologne architect oswald mathias ungers . richter became well known in the 1960s for modeling his paintings on photographs while using indistinct lines .
his works , which span a career of over 40 years , are stylistically diverse , as new york 's museum of modern art showed in 2002 .
in honor of the dresden native 's 70th birthday , the museum organized the largest retrospective exhibition ever done for a living artist . michael köhler / dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trash art litters cologne some say german artist ha schult likes to provoke .

richter 's window does n't prolong the existing tradition but develops it with his abstract use of color . glass squares in 80 different shades will replace a nearly transparent piece of glass that was inserted in the 1950 's after original window was destroyed during world war ii .
the plans for the damaged window , created in 1863 , had been lost so it could not be reproduced . the less-artistic interim piece needs to go because it lets too much light into the church and does n't correspond stylistically to the gothic cathedral , provost norbert feldhoff told german news source dpa . " the order of the individual colors is random , " said schock-werner , describing the all-over pattern of the squares , which measure 9.4 centimeters -lrb- 3.7 inches -rrb- on each side . the glass itself is not colored all the way through .
instead , colored pieces are attached to the outer surface of plain glass with the help of silicone . breaking a sacred art tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artist and his " abstract picture " from 1984 traditionally , church windows depicted biblical scenes .
long before computer books were printed , the panes told bible stories to illiterate parishioners by presenting them in brightly colored , larger-than-life images . however , richter 's window makes an intentional break from tradition .
it does n't render daniel in a den of lions , the flight of the egyptians , jesus ' birth , or the crucifixion .
in a sense , the church took a step of faith in abandoning a long-standing tradition and accepting a piece of art that is not explicitly religious . when asked if the window is a religious work of art , richter said , " oh , that 's hard to say .
art always has something to do with that . " even if christian motifs do n't appear in his latest glass work , crosses and other christian symbols are visible in many of his other works .
so it 's not without reason that richter received the german catholic art and culture prize two years ago . the making of an artist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richter painted milan 's gothic cathedral , which has similarities to cologne 's but is much larger this is n't the first time the internationally known artist has chosen colored glass as his medium .

" it would be not just premature but also objectively misguided if germany or even individual -lrb- german -rrb- states offered ' refugee protection ' of their own accord , " schäuble was quoted as saying . helping locally according to the german interior minister , european countries could , in principle , offer shelter " in case of a massive influx , " but the current situation did not warrant such a response . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble " experts at this point do not expect a mass influx to europe , " schäuble said .
" for that reason , i am very much in favor of not luring people to europe with promises and spreading them widely , but rather of supporting them on the spot , in the region , " he said .
in a statement issued on monday , pro asyl - a non-profit human rights organization for refugees - urged the german government to take the initiative and lobby on the european level for the eu to open its gates to lebanese refugees . germany should at least help with the evacuation of the lebanese refugees who have relatives in germany , the group said . a humanitarian catastrophe there are around 40,000 lebanese living in germany along with numerous german citizens of lebanese origin .

is this a sign of a significant discrepancy between the political elite and the general population ? it 's not as clear-cut as you imply .
there are some differences between the two cases .
first of all , israel was actively attacked .

the tragedy becomes even more depressing when we consider that a new lebanon with an active public society was just beginning to show itself in the past few months . of course , these are not singular events in region that has known violence for decades .
it 's bitter that - with israel 's bombardment , the abduction of the soldiers , the arrest of freely elected palestinian delegates and ministers and israel 's military campaign - the process in palestine was ended . perhaps part of the hamas would have gone down the path that fatah took - that is , recognizing israel 's right to existence and abstaining from violence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 01.08.2006 gothic meets modern in gerhard richter 's glass window großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richter 's multihued window will be finished early next year he 's been called a modern-day picasso and recently became the most expensive living painter .
gerhard richter 's current project is a modern 11,200-piece stained glass window for cologne 's gothic cathedral . the cologne cathedral 's new stained glass window by acclaimed german artist gerhard richter ca n't be overlooked , not only because of its immense size and conspicuous location but also because of its non-traditional approach . " the window will be a significant contribution of modern art to the cologne cathedral , " said barbara schock-werner , the cathedral 's master builder . gerhard richter is considered one of the most significant painters of our time .
his works adorn museum walls around the world and collectors drop millions to snap up his canvases .
the 74-year cologne-based artist is planning to unveil his monumental , 11,200-piece glass window in spring 2007 . gerhard richter has offered to craft the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184-square-foot -rrb- glass window as a gift to the city of cologne , the cathedral and its visitors .
donations will cover the production costs , which amount to some 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 447,000 -rrb- . a modern masterpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cologne cathedral attracts some 2.5 million visitors per year " the most important thing for me was to integrate this window into the cycle of historical windows , particularly as far as color goes , " schock-werner said .
richter 's window does n't prolong the existing tradition but develops it with his abstract use of color . glass squares in 80 different shades will replace a nearly transparent piece of glass that was inserted in the 1950 's after original window was destroyed during world war ii .
the plans for the damaged window , created in 1863 , had been lost so it could not be reproduced . the less-artistic interim piece needs to go because it lets too much light into the church and does n't correspond stylistically to the gothic cathedral , provost norbert feldhoff told german news source dpa . " the order of the individual colors is random , " said schock-werner , describing the all-over pattern of the squares , which measure 9.4 centimeters -lrb- 3.7 inches -rrb- on each side . the glass itself is not colored all the way through .
instead , colored pieces are attached to the outer surface of plain glass with the help of silicone . breaking a sacred art tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artist and his " abstract picture " from 1984 traditionally , church windows depicted biblical scenes .
long before computer books were printed , the panes told bible stories to illiterate parishioners by presenting them in brightly colored , larger-than-life images . however , richter 's window makes an intentional break from tradition .
it does n't render daniel in a den of lions , the flight of the egyptians , jesus ' birth , or the crucifixion .
in a sense , the church took a step of faith in abandoning a long-standing tradition and accepting a piece of art that is not explicitly religious . when asked if the window is a religious work of art , richter said , " oh , that 's hard to say .
art always has something to do with that . " even if christian motifs do n't appear in his latest glass work , crosses and other christian symbols are visible in many of his other works .
so it 's not without reason that richter received the german catholic art and culture prize two years ago . the making of an artist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richter painted milan 's gothic cathedral , which has similarities to cologne 's but is much larger this is n't the first time the internationally known artist has chosen colored glass as his medium .
in 1991 , for example , he created artistic accents for the hypobank in düsseldorf , which was designed by cologne architect oswald mathias ungers . richter became well known in the 1960s for modeling his paintings on photographs while using indistinct lines .
his works , which span a career of over 40 years , are stylistically diverse , as new york 's museum of modern art showed in 2002 .
in honor of the dresden native 's 70th birthday , the museum organized the largest retrospective exhibition ever done for a living artist . michael köhler / dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trash art litters cologne some say german artist ha schult likes to provoke .

" it would be not just premature but also objectively misguided if germany or even individual -lrb- german -rrb- states offered ' refugee protection ' of their own accord , " schäuble was quoted as saying . helping locally according to the german interior minister , european countries could , in principle , offer shelter " in case of a massive influx , " but the current situation did not warrant such a response . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble " experts at this point do not expect a mass influx to europe , " schäuble said .
" for that reason , i am very much in favor of not luring people to europe with promises and spreading them widely , but rather of supporting them on the spot , in the region , " he said .
in a statement issued on monday , pro asyl - a non-profit human rights organization for refugees - urged the german government to take the initiative and lobby on the european level for the eu to open its gates to lebanese refugees . germany should at least help with the evacuation of the lebanese refugees who have relatives in germany , the group said . a humanitarian catastrophe there are around 40,000 lebanese living in germany along with numerous german citizens of lebanese origin .
over 6,000 german citizens have been evacuated from lebanon since the beginning of the conflict there , according to the german foreign ministry . " that interior minister schäuble is rattling down his credo about refugees having to be taken care of in the region is an attempt to relieve himself of responsibility , said bernd mesovic of pro asyl . the un has estimated that up to 800,000 lebanese have been internally displaced since the israeli bombing started. with an estimated 119,625 people living in 652 schools and public gardens in and around beirut .
an estimated 45 per cent of the internally displaced are children . the lebanese health ministry estimated that 750 people have been killed and more than 2,000 wounded in lebanon .

he is also part of the committee on foreign relations . dw-world.de : after the middle east conference in rome , crisis diplomacy was in full gear - but there is still no unified demand for a hasty end to the violence .
how would you assess the rome conference ? rolf mützenich : i had hoped for more .
however , it was good that important states and international organizations were able to agree on common terminology at the rome conference .
this can only be evaluated in the context of the g8 summit , the eu foreign minister conferences and deliberations in the un security council . therein lies the bottom line : we need a lasting cease-fire as quickly as possible .
the use of military violence must be stopped . israel sees the concluding declaration from the rome conference as a carte blanche to continue its lebanon offensive , while german foreign minister steinmeier spoke of a " great misunderstanding . "
did the international community , particularly the european union , contribute to the legitimization of this legally questionable campaign ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf mützenich is a historian and political scientist the interpretation of israel 's justice minister is completely absurd .
the legitimization of the disproportionate use of violence is not the issue here .
both sides have harmed the civilian population with military means , which finally has to stop . what we need is a stepwise process : a cease-fire for humanitarian aid and a solution to prevent further escalations in this region . political observers and middle east experts have criticized germany 's passivity since the beginning of the middle east crisis .
is the german stance breaking down unity within the eu ?
and how can the eu be a counterweight to the pro-israel position that the us is taking ? i do n't see any passivity .
other european capitals that have a colonial past in the region could be accused of passivity .
but the german foreign minister is doing quite a lot , both within the region and outside of it .
he was not only in israel , egypt and palestine , he also sent representatives to beirut , damascus and new york .
this is very active diplomacy . however , our influence remains marginal , especially as the american foreign policy is too hesitant .
i do n't at all share the american secretary of state 's perspective that a new middle east emerging .
it makes me dizzy to think that new structures should be formed by violent means .
that is a perception that belongs in the past . the then-ruling coalition between the social democrats and the greens was supported by the population in 2003 when the it rejected the iraq war as contrary to international law .
in the current conflict , the german people seem to view israel 's conduct with increasingly sharper criticism than the elite decision makers , particularly in light of civilian suffering .
is this a sign of a significant discrepancy between the political elite and the general population ? it 's not as clear-cut as you imply .
there are some differences between the two cases .
first of all , israel was actively attacked .
soldiers were abducted in gaza and on the lebanese-israeli border .
israel believes its very existence is in danger , and as the iranian president does not miss any opportunity to make anti-israeli and anti-semitic comments , it is completely understandable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mützenich said the war came just as improvement in lebanon was beginning however , israel is committing unrestrained violence against large parts of lebanon and the lebanese population that do not have anything to do with the current crisis .
the tragedy becomes even more depressing when we consider that a new lebanon with an active public society was just beginning to show itself in the past few months . of course , these are not singular events in region that has known violence for decades .
it 's bitter that - with israel 's bombardment , the abduction of the soldiers , the arrest of freely elected palestinian delegates and ministers and israel 's military campaign - the process in palestine was ended . perhaps part of the hamas would have gone down the path that fatah took - that is , recognizing israel 's right to existence and abstaining from violence .
the prisoners ' paper opened a new window for peace a few weeks ago .
but extremists did n't want this solution .
even groups in israel were n't happy to see this kind of solution to the negotiations . loay mudhoon interviewed rolf mützenich -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click on the links to read dw-world.de 's compilation of articles on the conflict and the search for peace .

he is also part of the committee on foreign relations . dw-world.de : after the middle east conference in rome , crisis diplomacy was in full gear - but there is still no unified demand for a hasty end to the violence .
how would you assess the rome conference ? rolf mützenich : i had hoped for more .
however , it was good that important states and international organizations were able to agree on common terminology at the rome conference .
this can only be evaluated in the context of the g8 summit , the eu foreign minister conferences and deliberations in the un security council . therein lies the bottom line : we need a lasting cease-fire as quickly as possible .
the use of military violence must be stopped . israel sees the concluding declaration from the rome conference as a carte blanche to continue its lebanon offensive , while german foreign minister steinmeier spoke of a " great misunderstanding . "
did the international community , particularly the european union , contribute to the legitimization of this legally questionable campaign ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf mützenich is a historian and political scientist the interpretation of israel 's justice minister is completely absurd .
the legitimization of the disproportionate use of violence is not the issue here .
both sides have harmed the civilian population with military means , which finally has to stop . what we need is a stepwise process : a cease-fire for humanitarian aid and a solution to prevent further escalations in this region . political observers and middle east experts have criticized germany 's passivity since the beginning of the middle east crisis .
is the german stance breaking down unity within the eu ?
and how can the eu be a counterweight to the pro-israel position that the us is taking ? i do n't see any passivity .
other european capitals that have a colonial past in the region could be accused of passivity .
but the german foreign minister is doing quite a lot , both within the region and outside of it .
he was not only in israel , egypt and palestine , he also sent representatives to beirut , damascus and new york .
this is very active diplomacy . however , our influence remains marginal , especially as the american foreign policy is too hesitant .
i do n't at all share the american secretary of state 's perspective that a new middle east emerging .
it makes me dizzy to think that new structures should be formed by violent means .
that is a perception that belongs in the past . the then-ruling coalition between the social democrats and the greens was supported by the population in 2003 when the it rejected the iraq war as contrary to international law .
in the current conflict , the german people seem to view israel 's conduct with increasingly sharper criticism than the elite decision makers , particularly in light of civilian suffering .
is this a sign of a significant discrepancy between the political elite and the general population ? it 's not as clear-cut as you imply .
there are some differences between the two cases .
first of all , israel was actively attacked .
soldiers were abducted in gaza and on the lebanese-israeli border .
israel believes its very existence is in danger , and as the iranian president does not miss any opportunity to make anti-israeli and anti-semitic comments , it is completely understandable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mützenich said the war came just as improvement in lebanon was beginning however , israel is committing unrestrained violence against large parts of lebanon and the lebanese population that do not have anything to do with the current crisis .
the tragedy becomes even more depressing when we consider that a new lebanon with an active public society was just beginning to show itself in the past few months . of course , these are not singular events in region that has known violence for decades .
it 's bitter that - with israel 's bombardment , the abduction of the soldiers , the arrest of freely elected palestinian delegates and ministers and israel 's military campaign - the process in palestine was ended . perhaps part of the hamas would have gone down the path that fatah took - that is , recognizing israel 's right to existence and abstaining from violence .
the prisoners ' paper opened a new window for peace a few weeks ago .
but extremists did n't want this solution .
even groups in israel were n't happy to see this kind of solution to the negotiations . loay mudhoon interviewed rolf mützenich -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click on the links to read dw-world.de 's compilation of articles on the conflict and the search for peace .
israel suspends air strikes for 48-hours but says war goes on israel has finally agreed to a limited ceasefire in lebanon with a 48-hour suspension of air strikes but israeli justice minister haim ramon said it did n't mean that the jewish state was ending its war against hezbollah .
-lrb- july 31 , 2006 -rrb- german government criticized for stance on lebanese refugees after germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble said it would be " premature " and " misguided " for germany to take in lebanese refugees , opposition politicians and humanitarian organizations responded with anger .

then the first high-ranking priest admitted he was involved . at first , michal czajkowski , a leading church figure known for his work on catholic-jewish relations , rejected the accusations made against him .
but in july , he admitted to spying on his colleagues for 24 years , beginning in 1960 .
soon after , he quit as co-chairman of the polish christian-jewish council . church collaboration hits poland especially hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czajkowski is known for his work on catholic-jewish relations " i want to apologize and ask for forgiveness , especially for those whom i have hurt - i displayed a weakness of character , " czajkowski wrote in a statement printed by polish newspapers .
" i have already expressed my regret toward god .
now i am doing it toward people . " in other former communist countries still grappling with their past , such admissions may be surprising .
but they do n't have the power to shock as in poland , where during four decades of communist rule , the church remained stronger than anywhere else in the bloc and was seen as the focal point to passive resistance and opposition to the regime . in the former communist czechoslovakia , for example , the church played a smaller role in society , and even today , the czechs are among the least devout nations in europe .
in hungary , the catholic church has also admitted that dozens of its priests spied on their colleagues without raising the same level of public shock seen in poland . germany still investigating its own past like other states behind the iron curtain , the churches in the former east germany have had to deal with allegations that their clergy , especially in the protestant church , appeased or supported communist officials . michael zöller , a professor of sociology and religion at the university of bayreuth said collaboration with the communists was more prevalent in the protestant church in the former east germany . " the catholic church was more protected because the gdr wanted to be on good terms with the vatican , " zöller said .
" protestants were more forced to cooperate , especially to be able to get some leeway in their activities . " some clergy members thought of it as a progressive alliance because there was an affinity between church doctrine and socialism - it even attracted clergy from west germany , such as angela merkel 's father , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stolpe has been accused of collaborating with the communists in germany , the opening of the east german secret police , or stasi , archives brought up a number of allegations against east german church officials most famously , former brandenburg premier manfred stolpe , who also served as germany 's minister of transportation , building and housing until 2005 .
stolpe was a high-ranking official of the gdr 's evangelical church and has denied the charges . zöller said he believes that issues of collaboration among the clergy will continue to come up , as historians continue to pore through the stasi files . " officials are still processing documents , " he said .
" who knows yet what information they contain . " over 10 percent of polish priests collaborated polish priest czajkowski was a willing spy , according to the warsaw-based national remembrance institute , which manages communist archives and investigates crimes of that era .
the institute said he reported on the church 's and clergy 's pro-democracy activities and only stopped after regime agents murdered the chaplain of the solidarity trade union , jerzy popieluszko , whom czajkowski is accused of spying on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands in poland mourned pope john paul ii 's death poland 's catholic church , including former pope john paul ii , is widely credited with the rise of solidarity , the movement that brought down the communists and took control of poland in 1989 .
even though the church openly supported the group , the national remembrance institute said about 10 percent to 15 percent of the clergy collaborated with the communists . until recently , the church has refused to cooperate with investigations or provide names regarding collaborators among the clergy .
however , last year after similar allegations against an aide to pope john paul ii , konrad hejmo , surfaced , and the church suspended him .
hejmo denied the charges , which include spying on the late pope . coming to terms with the past now the catholic church in poland is working at coming to terms with its role in communist times .
earlier this year , church officials said they would begin investigating members of the clergy for collaborating with the communists .
soon after , the polish conference of catholic bishops issued an official apology to the public . " priests and others linked with the church who collaborated with the security services of the communist state cast a shadow on the catholic church 's heroic history under communist rule , " the bishops wrote , adding that an initiative to make public its complete list of collaborators is moving forward . the actions of a few priests also should not diminish the church 's role in promoting democracy , according to wojtek muszynski of the national remembrance institute .

how would you assess the rome conference ? rolf mützenich : i had hoped for more .
however , it was good that important states and international organizations were able to agree on common terminology at the rome conference .
this can only be evaluated in the context of the g8 summit , the eu foreign minister conferences and deliberations in the un security council . therein lies the bottom line : we need a lasting cease-fire as quickly as possible .
the use of military violence must be stopped . israel sees the concluding declaration from the rome conference as a carte blanche to continue its lebanon offensive , while german foreign minister steinmeier spoke of a " great misunderstanding . "
did the international community , particularly the european union , contribute to the legitimization of this legally questionable campaign ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf mützenich is a historian and political scientist the interpretation of israel 's justice minister is completely absurd .
the legitimization of the disproportionate use of violence is not the issue here .
both sides have harmed the civilian population with military means , which finally has to stop . what we need is a stepwise process : a cease-fire for humanitarian aid and a solution to prevent further escalations in this region . political observers and middle east experts have criticized germany 's passivity since the beginning of the middle east crisis .
is the german stance breaking down unity within the eu ?
and how can the eu be a counterweight to the pro-israel position that the us is taking ? i do n't see any passivity .
other european capitals that have a colonial past in the region could be accused of passivity .
but the german foreign minister is doing quite a lot , both within the region and outside of it .
he was not only in israel , egypt and palestine , he also sent representatives to beirut , damascus and new york .
this is very active diplomacy . however , our influence remains marginal , especially as the american foreign policy is too hesitant .
i do n't at all share the american secretary of state 's perspective that a new middle east emerging .
it makes me dizzy to think that new structures should be formed by violent means .
that is a perception that belongs in the past . the then-ruling coalition between the social democrats and the greens was supported by the population in 2003 when the it rejected the iraq war as contrary to international law .
in the current conflict , the german people seem to view israel 's conduct with increasingly sharper criticism than the elite decision makers , particularly in light of civilian suffering .
is this a sign of a significant discrepancy between the political elite and the general population ? it 's not as clear-cut as you imply .
there are some differences between the two cases .
first of all , israel was actively attacked .
soldiers were abducted in gaza and on the lebanese-israeli border .
israel believes its very existence is in danger , and as the iranian president does not miss any opportunity to make anti-israeli and anti-semitic comments , it is completely understandable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mützenich said the war came just as improvement in lebanon was beginning however , israel is committing unrestrained violence against large parts of lebanon and the lebanese population that do not have anything to do with the current crisis .
the tragedy becomes even more depressing when we consider that a new lebanon with an active public society was just beginning to show itself in the past few months . of course , these are not singular events in region that has known violence for decades .
it 's bitter that - with israel 's bombardment , the abduction of the soldiers , the arrest of freely elected palestinian delegates and ministers and israel 's military campaign - the process in palestine was ended . perhaps part of the hamas would have gone down the path that fatah took - that is , recognizing israel 's right to existence and abstaining from violence .
the prisoners ' paper opened a new window for peace a few weeks ago .

for those at the acclaimed architecture firm gerkan , marg and partners -lrb- gmp -rrb- , the dream has come true yet again - this time in south africa . berlin architects meinhard von gerkan , volkwin marg and their colleagues were commissioned to build three of the five new stadiums planned for the 2010 world cup soccer championship in south africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.08.2006 fischer visits iran as calls for a diplomatic role gather pace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gone but not forgotten : some believe fischer 's middle east expertise should be used former german foreign minister joschka fischer began a four-day visit to iran monday as the guest of a tehran think-tank with a growing chorus calling for him to return to the middle east in a more official capacity . " i am not coming back , " joschka fischer said at the end of june , brushing aside suggestions he could return to fight another day for germany 's green party .
" the door is closed ; the key has been turned and thrown away . " the new professor of international economic policy at princeton university 's woodrow wilson school of public and international affairs may have meant every word he said when stepping down from government to concentrate on his new teaching position in the united states .
but in the space of almost a month , the former german foreign minister 's expertise in the middle east has become a more valuable commodity ; one which some wish to use again . the war in lebanon and the rapidly disintegrating relationship between the west and iran over the islamic republic 's nuclear ambitions have turned up the heat in the pressure cooker region , with diplomats from all nations struggling to find viable solutions to the problems in the middle east . a respected middle east expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer with the late palestinian leader yasser arafat some believe fischer , as an expert on the middle east who won the confidence of both jews and palestinians during his seven years as foreign minister , could prove to be an important player again in any negotiations - be it in an official or unofficial capacity . and while no official offer has been made for him to join germany 's efforts in ending the israel-hezbollah conflict or the nuclear stand-off with iran , fischer has been touted as a possible mediator in both crises , either as a german or european union representative . " as a proven international politician , respected both in israel and palestine , joschka fischer would be ideally placed to play a mediating role , as an eu envoy , aimed at negotiating a ceasefire -lrb- in lebanon -rrb- , " leading green meps daniel cohn-bendit from germany and italian monica frassoni said in a statement .
the german government and fischer himself have not responded to calls for such involvement in either the lebanon or iran crises .
however , fischer started a four-day visit to iran on monday where he will take part in a round table debate organized by tehran 's center for strategic studies after being invited by hassan rohani , iran 's former chief negotiator on its nuclear program . invitation shows fischer 's standing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rohani and fischer have a mutual respect although the private visit had been organized for some time , his inclusion in the debate shows that his regular visits to iran and the middle east during his tenure as germany 's top diplomat built many important working relationships and earned him respect in the region . and as the united nations security council prepares to set tehran a deadline for the suspension of its uranium enrichment program with sanctions seemingly unavoidable given iran 's belligerent stance , a man such as fischer who the iranians can trust could pave the way for talks to reopen .
he himself believes that negotiation with iran is the only way to secure a peaceful resolution to this and the wider problems in the region . " if an understanding can be found with tehran about its nuclear program and uranium enrichment , the situation in the middle east will change , " he recently told die zeit newspaper .
" if not , we are heading for an enormous crisis with unforeseeable consequences . " taking a different line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer at the un as for lebanon , fischer has already voiced his opinions and they differ from the current line of thinking .
while many diplomats believe a un force in lebanon is the way forward , fischer has said it would make " little sense " to deploy a larger un contingent to stabilize the country . " another blue-helmet mandate will make little sense , " fischer said .
" only a robust force with a robust mandate could perhaps achieve something positive .
but the risks are enormous .
i think it is far more important to put political pressure on the radicals and to commit ourselves to new peace negotiations . " fischer said the violence had been " orchestrated by foreign leaders of hamas as part of their struggle with the moderate elements in the movement . "
but iran and syria also had a hand in events , he added . he also accused the west , russia and the united nations of neglecting the middle east peace process . " never before has the west , the us , neglected this volatile conflict so dangerously , never before has the so-called middle east quartet , namely the us , the eu , the un and russia , shown so little commitment , " he said .

" i am not coming back , " joschka fischer said at the end of june , brushing aside suggestions he could return to fight another day for germany 's green party .
" the door is closed ; the key has been turned and thrown away . " the new professor of international economic policy at princeton university 's woodrow wilson school of public and international affairs may have meant every word he said when stepping down from government to concentrate on his new teaching position in the united states .
but in the space of almost a month , the former german foreign minister 's expertise in the middle east has become a more valuable commodity ; one which some wish to use again . the war in lebanon and the rapidly disintegrating relationship between the west and iran over the islamic republic 's nuclear ambitions have turned up the heat in the pressure cooker region , with diplomats from all nations struggling to find viable solutions to the problems in the middle east . a respected middle east expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer with the late palestinian leader yasser arafat some believe fischer , as an expert on the middle east who won the confidence of both jews and palestinians during his seven years as foreign minister , could prove to be an important player again in any negotiations - be it in an official or unofficial capacity . and while no official offer has been made for him to join germany 's efforts in ending the israel-hezbollah conflict or the nuclear stand-off with iran , fischer has been touted as a possible mediator in both crises , either as a german or european union representative . " as a proven international politician , respected both in israel and palestine , joschka fischer would be ideally placed to play a mediating role , as an eu envoy , aimed at negotiating a ceasefire -lrb- in lebanon -rrb- , " leading green meps daniel cohn-bendit from germany and italian monica frassoni said in a statement .
the german government and fischer himself have not responded to calls for such involvement in either the lebanon or iran crises .
however , fischer started a four-day visit to iran on monday where he will take part in a round table debate organized by tehran 's center for strategic studies after being invited by hassan rohani , iran 's former chief negotiator on its nuclear program . invitation shows fischer 's standing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rohani and fischer have a mutual respect although the private visit had been organized for some time , his inclusion in the debate shows that his regular visits to iran and the middle east during his tenure as germany 's top diplomat built many important working relationships and earned him respect in the region . and as the united nations security council prepares to set tehran a deadline for the suspension of its uranium enrichment program with sanctions seemingly unavoidable given iran 's belligerent stance , a man such as fischer who the iranians can trust could pave the way for talks to reopen .
he himself believes that negotiation with iran is the only way to secure a peaceful resolution to this and the wider problems in the region . " if an understanding can be found with tehran about its nuclear program and uranium enrichment , the situation in the middle east will change , " he recently told die zeit newspaper .
" if not , we are heading for an enormous crisis with unforeseeable consequences . " taking a different line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer at the un as for lebanon , fischer has already voiced his opinions and they differ from the current line of thinking .
while many diplomats believe a un force in lebanon is the way forward , fischer has said it would make " little sense " to deploy a larger un contingent to stabilize the country . " another blue-helmet mandate will make little sense , " fischer said .
" only a robust force with a robust mandate could perhaps achieve something positive .
but the risks are enormous .
i think it is far more important to put political pressure on the radicals and to commit ourselves to new peace negotiations . " fischer said the violence had been " orchestrated by foreign leaders of hamas as part of their struggle with the moderate elements in the movement . "
but iran and syria also had a hand in events , he added . he also accused the west , russia and the united nations of neglecting the middle east peace process . " never before has the west , the us , neglected this volatile conflict so dangerously , never before has the so-called middle east quartet , namely the us , the eu , the un and russia , shown so little commitment , " he said .

groom and groom or bride and bride became possible due to a new law on same-sex registered partnerships . it was actually just over five years ago that one of klaus jetz 's long-sought-after goals was realized .
after long debate and much lobbying from the organization he directs , the lesbian and gay association of germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , the german parliament passed the " registered partnership " bill , which gave gay and lesbian couples new status in the eyes of the state , one that had many of the advantages of marriage .
the law he had fought so hard for went into effect on aug .
1 , 2001 . " since the early 90s , the lsvd had fought for this , and back then , it all seemed so far off , " he said .
" then with the change of government in 1998 , the chance to make it a reality arrived . " for many long-time same-sex couples , whose daily reality had looked pretty much like a marriage , their relationships were now sanctioned by the coalition government of left-of-center social democrats and greens under gerhard schröder .
the law entitles gay and lesbian couples who registered their partnerships some of the advantages heterosexual married couples enjoy . same-sex couples can now share a last name , refuse to testify against one another in court and have same inheritance and tenants ' rights as heterosexual spouses .
a foreigner legally joined in a gay partnership to a german can apply for the right to citizenship .
partners also take on a responsibility to maintain and support the other in the case of financial difficulties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another happy couple on jan .
1 , 2005 , the law was amended , giving one partner the right to adopt the other partner 's biological child , so-called stepchild adoption .
other rights were expanded , such as the area of property rights , which moved registered partnerships closer to heterosexual marriage . but attempts to give same-sex partners the same tax and welfare benefits as those enjoyed by heterosexual couples were defeated in the conservative-dominated upper house of the german parliament . almost " normal " while it is difficult to know exactly how many same-sex couples have registered their partnerships over the five years of the law because of different recording criteria in germany 's federal states , estimates range between 14,000 and 20,000 . " in 2001 , there were many same-sex couples who knew they wanted to become registered partners and were just waiting for the ink of this law to be dry , " said ute terwedow from the civil registry office in cologne .
" that accounts for the large numbers we saw at the outset .
now the whole thing has become very normal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lsvd 's axel blumenthal , left , and green politician volker beck , signaled their optimism that the constitutional court would rule in their favor in 2002 in cologne in 2002 , 285 same-sex couples registered their partnerships - a " record year , " according to terwedow .
since then , between 170 and 180 couples have tied the knot every year .
according to a survey by the dpa news agency , gay men are saying " i do " much more often than lesbians .
in cologne , only a third of same-sex couples at the registry office are women . when " gay marriage " was under debate in germany , some talked about it being a danger to the nation 's culture fabric and there were fears that it would undermine traditional marriage .
several states led by the conservative union political parties asked the law to be reviewed by the constitutional court , in the hope it would declared unconstitutional .
it was not .
five years later , however , same-sex unions have gained a societal acceptance that exceeds even what optimists had predicted . discriminatory even though klaus jetz celebrated the law 's coming into effect five years ago , he and his partner of 11 years have chosen not to tie the knot at the registry office .
while he said the current law marks progress in the area of gay and lesbian rights , he still finds parts of it unacceptable , since a registered partnership is not the same thing as a marriage .
some have called it marriage " light , " since it has most of traditional marriage 's responsibilities , but fewer of its advantages . there are differences regarding income taxes , joint tax assessments , and inheritance taxes .
for example , it is almost impossible to inherit an apartment from a deceased partner , jetz says , because of the high inheritance taxes that would have to be paid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain legalized gay marriage in 2005 in the face of opposition from the church and conservatives heterosexual married couples , on the other hand , enjoy a tax exemption of 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 635,000 -rrb- .
same-sex couples do not .
and unlike heterosexuals , or gay couples in the neighboring netherlands , german couples will not have the right to adopt . " in germany we are still far away from complete equality for homosexual partnerships , " said volker beck , a green parliamentarian who has been a major backer of the law . the discrepancies came about because the registered partnership bill was split into two parts when it went through parliament .
the section that dealt with many of the financial aspects , such as tax law , would have had to be approved by the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
because that body was dominated by conservatives , the left-of-center government did not try to push it through , since it would have gone down to defeat . " now we need to take a new run at the partnership law to complete it , " jetz said . but he does n't want to downplay the importance of the law , calling it a paradigm change in germany , something that was almost inconceivable just 15 years ago .
he would like to see the government take up the issue again , but said the current coalition under conservative chancellor angela merkel is not likely to . " but even in the netherlands and denmark it took 10 years until lesbian and gay partnerships were made 100 percent equal to heterosexual ones , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain approves gay marriage , adoption days after the election of a staunchly conservative new pope , predominantly roman catholic spain is set to allow homosexuals to marry and adopt children .

while he said the current law marks progress in the area of gay and lesbian rights , he still finds parts of it unacceptable , since a registered partnership is not the same thing as a marriage .

but , several cities there are vying to be the first to produce a similar rail system . news reports that china is building its first magnetic-levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- rail system have been circulating in the media for months .
a report published this week in the newspaper china daily said the north-eastern port city dalian planned to construct the first commercial chinese-made maglev train test line this year .
" lines such as these are being built in great numbers in china , " said petra aldenrath , the china correspondent in beijing for german public radio network ard .
" they are all only short test stretches so far and the trains can not be compared to those of transrapid by the siemens-thyssenkrupp consortium . " a report in the china business daily confirmed that the german transrapid was superior to its chinese competition .
the publication compared five transrapid models developed in china . " our media mix truth and fiction .
none of the models developed in china are ready for use , " the paper quoted a chinese maglev train expert as saying . chinese technology is illusory the world 's only commercial maglev system in the world links shanghai 's financial district and its pudong airport .
instead of mechanical components such as wheels and rails , the transrapid system uses electronics : non-contact electromagnetic levitation , guidance , and propulsion systems .
with an operating speed of 430 km / h , it travels the 30-kilometer stretch in some eight minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid in shanghai only needs eight minutes for 30 kilometers the core technologies that have now been developed in china are based on a magnetic engine , which will drive the train on a three-kilometer railway to be built in the city 's development zone , said li lingqun , chief engineer of the maglev team in dalian .
this system will also be less expensive , he said . " combined with the abundant resources of permanent magnetic materials in china , our technology will be about 50 percent cheaper than that of foreign countries , " li said in the china daily . the dalian train would reach speeds of 220 kilometers per hour , li said . but the technology based on such an engine was by far not as complicated as the transrapid , said aldenrath . " it is illusory to think you can go 220 kilometers per hour on just three kilometers of tracks , " said transrapid spokesman peter wiegelmann .
" you would need rocket propulsion for that . " china wants technology in exchange for contract china is planning an extension of its shanghai connection to the city of hangzhou , 180 kilometers away . earlier this year , germany rejected china 's demands for access to sensitive maglev technology in exchange for building this $ 4.3 billion high-tech rail link .
chinese officials approved the building of the track in march .
but discussions with the companies have been going slowly as beijing is looking for significant technology transfers and funding as the price of admission . " we are optimistic that our transrapid will be employed on this stretch , " wiegelmann said . germany provided 10 percent of the $ 1 billion budget for the shanghai airport link . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china masters german train technology , will cut costs china has mastered a key part of the german technology to build high-speed magnetic levitation trains and is now aiming to cut the costs of its new line by one third , according to state press .

a combination of record sunshine , heat and the world cup had beer thirst in germany skyrocketing .
now , the beck 's brewery is scrambling to meet its orders as a result . the combination of heat , sun and a good world cup soccer game this summer was enough to make most people in germany crave a nice cold beer .
well , it seems as if quite a few people did n't just stick to one or two .
one of germany 's top international brands , beck 's , ran out of its highly-desired barley brew in july . you 'd think germany would have known better .
inviting large numbers of soccer fans - including some notorious drinkers -lrb- no need to name names here -rrb- - in the middle of the summer and then this !

" the window will be a significant contribution of modern art to the cologne cathedral , " said barbara schock-werner , the cathedral 's master builder . gerhard richter is considered one of the most significant painters of our time .
his works adorn museum walls around the world and collectors drop millions to snap up his canvases .
the 74-year cologne-based artist is planning to unveil his monumental , 11,200-piece glass window in spring 2007 . gerhard richter has offered to craft the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184-square-foot -rrb- glass window as a gift to the city of cologne , the cathedral and its visitors .
donations will cover the production costs , which amount to some 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 447,000 -rrb- . a modern masterpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cologne cathedral attracts some 2.5 million visitors per year " the most important thing for me was to integrate this window into the cycle of historical windows , particularly as far as color goes , " schock-werner said .
richter 's window does n't prolong the existing tradition but develops it with his abstract use of color . glass squares in 80 different shades will replace a nearly transparent piece of glass that was inserted in the 1950 's after original window was destroyed during world war ii .
the plans for the damaged window , created in 1863 , had been lost so it could not be reproduced . the less-artistic interim piece needs to go because it lets too much light into the church and does n't correspond stylistically to the gothic cathedral , provost norbert feldhoff told german news source dpa . " the order of the individual colors is random , " said schock-werner , describing the all-over pattern of the squares , which measure 9.4 centimeters -lrb- 3.7 inches -rrb- on each side . the glass itself is not colored all the way through .
instead , colored pieces are attached to the outer surface of plain glass with the help of silicone . breaking a sacred art tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artist and his " abstract picture " from 1984 traditionally , church windows depicted biblical scenes .
long before computer books were printed , the panes told bible stories to illiterate parishioners by presenting them in brightly colored , larger-than-life images . however , richter 's window makes an intentional break from tradition .
it does n't render daniel in a den of lions , the flight of the egyptians , jesus ' birth , or the crucifixion .
in a sense , the church took a step of faith in abandoning a long-standing tradition and accepting a piece of art that is not explicitly religious . when asked if the window is a religious work of art , richter said , " oh , that 's hard to say .
art always has something to do with that . " even if christian motifs do n't appear in his latest glass work , crosses and other christian symbols are visible in many of his other works .
so it 's not without reason that richter received the german catholic art and culture prize two years ago . the making of an artist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richter painted milan 's gothic cathedral , which has similarities to cologne 's but is much larger this is n't the first time the internationally known artist has chosen colored glass as his medium .
in 1991 , for example , he created artistic accents for the hypobank in düsseldorf , which was designed by cologne architect oswald mathias ungers . richter became well known in the 1960s for modeling his paintings on photographs while using indistinct lines .
his works , which span a career of over 40 years , are stylistically diverse , as new york 's museum of modern art showed in 2002 .
in honor of the dresden native 's 70th birthday , the museum organized the largest retrospective exhibition ever done for a living artist . michael köhler / dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trash art litters cologne some say german artist ha schult likes to provoke .

groom and groom or bride and bride became possible due to a new law on same-sex registered partnerships . it was actually just over five years ago that one of klaus jetz 's long-sought-after goals was realized .
after long debate and much lobbying from the organization he directs , the lesbian and gay association of germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , the german parliament passed the " registered partnership " bill , which gave gay and lesbian couples new status in the eyes of the state , one that had many of the advantages of marriage .
the law he had fought so hard for went into effect on aug .
1 , 2001 . " since the early 90s , the lsvd had fought for this , and back then , it all seemed so far off , " he said .
" then with the change of government in 1998 , the chance to make it a reality arrived . " for many long-time same-sex couples , whose daily reality had looked pretty much like a marriage , their relationships were now sanctioned by the coalition government of left-of-center social democrats and greens under gerhard schröder .
the law entitles gay and lesbian couples who registered their partnerships some of the advantages heterosexual married couples enjoy . same-sex couples can now share a last name , refuse to testify against one another in court and have same inheritance and tenants ' rights as heterosexual spouses .
a foreigner legally joined in a gay partnership to a german can apply for the right to citizenship .
partners also take on a responsibility to maintain and support the other in the case of financial difficulties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another happy couple on jan .
1 , 2005 , the law was amended , giving one partner the right to adopt the other partner 's biological child , so-called stepchild adoption .
other rights were expanded , such as the area of property rights , which moved registered partnerships closer to heterosexual marriage . but attempts to give same-sex partners the same tax and welfare benefits as those enjoyed by heterosexual couples were defeated in the conservative-dominated upper house of the german parliament . almost " normal " while it is difficult to know exactly how many same-sex couples have registered their partnerships over the five years of the law because of different recording criteria in germany 's federal states , estimates range between 14,000 and 20,000 . " in 2001 , there were many same-sex couples who knew they wanted to become registered partners and were just waiting for the ink of this law to be dry , " said ute terwedow from the civil registry office in cologne .
" that accounts for the large numbers we saw at the outset .
now the whole thing has become very normal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lsvd 's axel blumenthal , left , and green politician volker beck , signaled their optimism that the constitutional court would rule in their favor in 2002 in cologne in 2002 , 285 same-sex couples registered their partnerships - a " record year , " according to terwedow .
since then , between 170 and 180 couples have tied the knot every year .
according to a survey by the dpa news agency , gay men are saying " i do " much more often than lesbians .
in cologne , only a third of same-sex couples at the registry office are women . when " gay marriage " was under debate in germany , some talked about it being a danger to the nation 's culture fabric and there were fears that it would undermine traditional marriage .
several states led by the conservative union political parties asked the law to be reviewed by the constitutional court , in the hope it would declared unconstitutional .
it was not .
five years later , however , same-sex unions have gained a societal acceptance that exceeds even what optimists had predicted . discriminatory even though klaus jetz celebrated the law 's coming into effect five years ago , he and his partner of 11 years have chosen not to tie the knot at the registry office .
while he said the current law marks progress in the area of gay and lesbian rights , he still finds parts of it unacceptable , since a registered partnership is not the same thing as a marriage .
some have called it marriage " light , " since it has most of traditional marriage 's responsibilities , but fewer of its advantages . there are differences regarding income taxes , joint tax assessments , and inheritance taxes .
for example , it is almost impossible to inherit an apartment from a deceased partner , jetz says , because of the high inheritance taxes that would have to be paid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain legalized gay marriage in 2005 in the face of opposition from the church and conservatives heterosexual married couples , on the other hand , enjoy a tax exemption of 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 635,000 -rrb- .
same-sex couples do not .
and unlike heterosexuals , or gay couples in the neighboring netherlands , german couples will not have the right to adopt . " in germany we are still far away from complete equality for homosexual partnerships , " said volker beck , a green parliamentarian who has been a major backer of the law . the discrepancies came about because the registered partnership bill was split into two parts when it went through parliament .
the section that dealt with many of the financial aspects , such as tax law , would have had to be approved by the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
because that body was dominated by conservatives , the left-of-center government did not try to push it through , since it would have gone down to defeat . " now we need to take a new run at the partnership law to complete it , " jetz said . but he does n't want to downplay the importance of the law , calling it a paradigm change in germany , something that was almost inconceivable just 15 years ago .
he would like to see the government take up the issue again , but said the current coalition under conservative chancellor angela merkel is not likely to . " but even in the netherlands and denmark it took 10 years until lesbian and gay partnerships were made 100 percent equal to heterosexual ones , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain approves gay marriage , adoption days after the election of a staunchly conservative new pope , predominantly roman catholic spain is set to allow homosexuals to marry and adopt children .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.08.2006 german gay marriage law marks fifth anniversary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first " gay marriage " in hanover in 2001 five years ago , the bride-and-groom grouping lost its monopoly on the church aisle or the top of the wedding cake .
groom and groom or bride and bride became possible due to a new law on same-sex registered partnerships . it was actually just over five years ago that one of klaus jetz 's long-sought-after goals was realized .
after long debate and much lobbying from the organization he directs , the lesbian and gay association of germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , the german parliament passed the " registered partnership " bill , which gave gay and lesbian couples new status in the eyes of the state , one that had many of the advantages of marriage .
the law he had fought so hard for went into effect on aug .
1 , 2001 . " since the early 90s , the lsvd had fought for this , and back then , it all seemed so far off , " he said .
" then with the change of government in 1998 , the chance to make it a reality arrived . " for many long-time same-sex couples , whose daily reality had looked pretty much like a marriage , their relationships were now sanctioned by the coalition government of left-of-center social democrats and greens under gerhard schröder .
the law entitles gay and lesbian couples who registered their partnerships some of the advantages heterosexual married couples enjoy . same-sex couples can now share a last name , refuse to testify against one another in court and have same inheritance and tenants ' rights as heterosexual spouses .
a foreigner legally joined in a gay partnership to a german can apply for the right to citizenship .
partners also take on a responsibility to maintain and support the other in the case of financial difficulties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another happy couple on jan .
1 , 2005 , the law was amended , giving one partner the right to adopt the other partner 's biological child , so-called stepchild adoption .
other rights were expanded , such as the area of property rights , which moved registered partnerships closer to heterosexual marriage . but attempts to give same-sex partners the same tax and welfare benefits as those enjoyed by heterosexual couples were defeated in the conservative-dominated upper house of the german parliament . almost " normal " while it is difficult to know exactly how many same-sex couples have registered their partnerships over the five years of the law because of different recording criteria in germany 's federal states , estimates range between 14,000 and 20,000 . " in 2001 , there were many same-sex couples who knew they wanted to become registered partners and were just waiting for the ink of this law to be dry , " said ute terwedow from the civil registry office in cologne .
" that accounts for the large numbers we saw at the outset .
now the whole thing has become very normal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lsvd 's axel blumenthal , left , and green politician volker beck , signaled their optimism that the constitutional court would rule in their favor in 2002 in cologne in 2002 , 285 same-sex couples registered their partnerships - a " record year , " according to terwedow .

" the council -lrb- of eu ministers -rrb- calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities to be followed by a sustainable ceasefire , " said finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erkki tuomioja he was speaking to reporters after ministers wrangled for three and a half hours over the exact wording of the joint eu declaration , and as israel escalated attacks on hezbollah guerillas and vowed to step up ground operations . " it 's important to get the words and concepts right , " he said , adding : " there are no divisions in the european union . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the agreement did not mean an immediate ceasefire , since cessation of hostilities was not the same as a ceasefire . " a ceasefire can perhaps be achieved later , " he said .
" we can now only ask the un security council and put pressure on it and not to waste any more time . " division despite tuomioja 's statement , the eu talks did come amid sharp disagreement within the bloc about whether to call for an immediate ceasefire . france has led calls for an immediate ceasefire , but britain and germany have pushed for a un accord to deploy an international force to secure the israeli-lebanon border and ensure that any truce is sustainable . french foreign ministe philippe douste-blazy welcomed the eu agreement , saying the bloc had spoken with " one voice . " " it is an important step .
the european union is supporting the resolution proposed by france to the un security council , " he said , denying any difference of opinion between paris and berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik arriving at the emergency meeting the finnish minister meanwhile underlined the need for urgent action at the un security council to provide the framework for a sustainable ceasefire , notably agreement on an international stabilization force . " once such a framework has been established - and we are hopefully talking more about days rather than weeks - eu member states have indicated their readiness to contribute to such an operation , " he said . no to terror list the finnish eu president also said the bloc does not intend on adding hezbollah to its list of terrorist organizations at the present time . " given the sensitive situation , i do n't think this is something we will be acting on now , tuomioja told the news conference after the meeting . his remarks were in response to a letter signed by 213 members of the united states congress , which was sent to eu foreign policy chief javier solana .

" i am not coming back , " joschka fischer said at the end of june , brushing aside suggestions he could return to fight another day for germany 's green party .
" the door is closed ; the key has been turned and thrown away . " the new professor of international economic policy at princeton university 's woodrow wilson school of public and international affairs may have meant every word he said when stepping down from government to concentrate on his new teaching position in the united states .
but in the space of almost a month , the former german foreign minister 's expertise in the middle east has become a more valuable commodity ; one which some wish to use again . the war in lebanon and the rapidly disintegrating relationship between the west and iran over the islamic republic 's nuclear ambitions have turned up the heat in the pressure cooker region , with diplomats from all nations struggling to find viable solutions to the problems in the middle east . a respected middle east expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer with the late palestinian leader yasser arafat some believe fischer , as an expert on the middle east who won the confidence of both jews and palestinians during his seven years as foreign minister , could prove to be an important player again in any negotiations - be it in an official or unofficial capacity . and while no official offer has been made for him to join germany 's efforts in ending the israel-hezbollah conflict or the nuclear stand-off with iran , fischer has been touted as a possible mediator in both crises , either as a german or european union representative . " as a proven international politician , respected both in israel and palestine , joschka fischer would be ideally placed to play a mediating role , as an eu envoy , aimed at negotiating a ceasefire -lrb- in lebanon -rrb- , " leading green meps daniel cohn-bendit from germany and italian monica frassoni said in a statement .
the german government and fischer himself have not responded to calls for such involvement in either the lebanon or iran crises .
however , fischer started a four-day visit to iran on monday where he will take part in a round table debate organized by tehran 's center for strategic studies after being invited by hassan rohani , iran 's former chief negotiator on its nuclear program . invitation shows fischer 's standing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rohani and fischer have a mutual respect although the private visit had been organized for some time , his inclusion in the debate shows that his regular visits to iran and the middle east during his tenure as germany 's top diplomat built many important working relationships and earned him respect in the region . and as the united nations security council prepares to set tehran a deadline for the suspension of its uranium enrichment program with sanctions seemingly unavoidable given iran 's belligerent stance , a man such as fischer who the iranians can trust could pave the way for talks to reopen .
he himself believes that negotiation with iran is the only way to secure a peaceful resolution to this and the wider problems in the region . " if an understanding can be found with tehran about its nuclear program and uranium enrichment , the situation in the middle east will change , " he recently told die zeit newspaper .
" if not , we are heading for an enormous crisis with unforeseeable consequences . " taking a different line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer at the un as for lebanon , fischer has already voiced his opinions and they differ from the current line of thinking .
while many diplomats believe a un force in lebanon is the way forward , fischer has said it would make " little sense " to deploy a larger un contingent to stabilize the country . " another blue-helmet mandate will make little sense , " fischer said .
" only a robust force with a robust mandate could perhaps achieve something positive .
but the risks are enormous .
i think it is far more important to put political pressure on the radicals and to commit ourselves to new peace negotiations . " fischer said the violence had been " orchestrated by foreign leaders of hamas as part of their struggle with the moderate elements in the movement . "
but iran and syria also had a hand in events , he added . he also accused the west , russia and the united nations of neglecting the middle east peace process . " never before has the west , the us , neglected this volatile conflict so dangerously , never before has the so-called middle east quartet , namely the us , the eu , the un and russia , shown so little commitment , " he said .
" this is a tragedy . " fischer 's supporters have urged the international community to " think outside the box " to solve the middle east crisis .

31 or face the threat of sanctions .
germany and the united states applauded the measure .
but it was immediately rejected by tehran . united nations resolution 1696 expressed " serious concern " at iran 's refusal to comply with international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- orders to halt uranium enrichment and other work that could help build a nuclear bomb . the text did not include an immediate threat of sanctions , opposed by russia and china , and said punitive action would be the subject of further discussions .
but iaea director mohammed elbaradei will have to give a report on iran 's action by aug .
31 .
if iran does not suspend its nuclear work , the council would consider adopting " appropriate measures , " which could be economic and political sanctions . the resolution was passed by a 14-1 vote with qatar in opposition .
it was welcomed by the united states and its allies , but iran 's un ambassador javad zarif said it was " destructive and totally unwarranted " in a long speech to the council . " i would suggest to you that this approach will not lead to any productive outcome .
it can only exacerbate the situation , " zarif told the council .
he said iran was only ready for " serious and non-discriminatory " negotiations . " the door to negotiations is open . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the international community was setting a firm sign of its unity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un hopes diplomacy can still solve the iran conflict " it 's up to iran now to fulfil these binding demands of the international community and dispel the existing doubts about the peaceful nature of its nuclear program , " steinmeier said in a statement on monday .
" iran has the choice .
the door to negotiations is open . " us secretary of state condoleezza rice said the resolution 's wording meant iran still had time to cooperate with world powers on its nuclear program and avoid an all-out confrontation . " i want to be very clear that this does n't close the door to diplomacy , " rice told reporters on her way back to washington from a middle east peace mission . both rice and steinmeier said the extensive six-party package - worked out by germany , france , britain , the united states , russia and china - was still on the table . " our top goal remains finding an amicable diplomatic solution , " steinmeier said .

he said iran was only ready for " serious and non-discriminatory " negotiations . " the door to negotiations is open .

" iran has the choice .
the door to negotiations is open . " us secretary of state condoleezza rice said the resolution 's wording meant iran still had time to cooperate with world powers on its nuclear program and avoid an all-out confrontation . " i want to be very clear that this does n't close the door to diplomacy , " rice told reporters on her way back to washington from a middle east peace mission . both rice and steinmeier said the extensive six-party package - worked out by germany , france , britain , the united states , russia and china - was still on the table . " our top goal remains finding an amicable diplomatic solution , " steinmeier said .
" i appeal to the leaders in tehran to take this opportunity and create the conditions for a return to the negotiating table . " iran is a potential volcano signals from tehran do not indicate that iran will comply to the un demands . " the security council resolution is unacceptable and is shifting the climate down a path which will help no one , " kazem jalali , spokesman for the iranian parliament 's foreign affairs commission , was quoted as saying by the isna news agency late monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar cast the lone dissenting vote qatar was the only council member to oppose the iran resolution .
it said it was too confrontational . " do we really want to see another volcano erupting in this region ? " said qatari un ambassador nassir abdulaziz al-nasser . russia and china gave their backing , though both said that there was no immediate threat of sanctions .
russian ambassador vitaly churkin said that even the next stage precluded any threat of military action . japan on tuesday welcomed the un resolution and said its position was unaffected by its close trade ties with the oil producer .
japan , a non-permanent member of the security council , is a close us ally but has also been a major investor in iran 's energy sector .
asia 's largest economy is heavily dependent on middle eastern oil . china said diplomacy was crucial in resolving the iran nuclear crisis . " china hopes the resolution on iran 's nuclear issue would serve the ongoing diplomatic efforts to settle the standoff , " the official xinhua news agency quoted foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao as saying tuesday .
" china calls on all parties concerned to keep calm and exercise restraint , and continue to push forward -lrb- for an -rrb- early resumption of negotiations .

gerhard richter 's current project is a modern 11,200-piece stained glass window for cologne 's gothic cathedral . the cologne cathedral 's new stained glass window by acclaimed german artist gerhard richter ca n't be overlooked , not only because of its immense size and conspicuous location but also because of its non-traditional approach . " the window will be a significant contribution of modern art to the cologne cathedral , " said barbara schock-werner , the cathedral 's master builder . gerhard richter is considered one of the most significant painters of our time .
his works adorn museum walls around the world and collectors drop millions to snap up his canvases .
the 74-year cologne-based artist is planning to unveil his monumental , 11,200-piece glass window in spring 2007 . gerhard richter has offered to craft the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184-square-foot -rrb- glass window as a gift to the city of cologne , the cathedral and its visitors .

richter 's window does n't prolong the existing tradition but develops it with his abstract use of color . glass squares in 80 different shades will replace a nearly transparent piece of glass that was inserted in the 1950 's after original window was destroyed during world war ii .
the plans for the damaged window , created in 1863 , had been lost so it could not be reproduced . the less-artistic interim piece needs to go because it lets too much light into the church and does n't correspond stylistically to the gothic cathedral , provost norbert feldhoff told german news source dpa . " the order of the individual colors is random , " said schock-werner , describing the all-over pattern of the squares , which measure 9.4 centimeters -lrb- 3.7 inches -rrb- on each side . the glass itself is not colored all the way through .
instead , colored pieces are attached to the outer surface of plain glass with the help of silicone . breaking a sacred art tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artist and his " abstract picture " from 1984 traditionally , church windows depicted biblical scenes .
long before computer books were printed , the panes told bible stories to illiterate parishioners by presenting them in brightly colored , larger-than-life images . however , richter 's window makes an intentional break from tradition .
it does n't render daniel in a den of lions , the flight of the egyptians , jesus ' birth , or the crucifixion .
in a sense , the church took a step of faith in abandoning a long-standing tradition and accepting a piece of art that is not explicitly religious . when asked if the window is a religious work of art , richter said , " oh , that 's hard to say .
art always has something to do with that . " even if christian motifs do n't appear in his latest glass work , crosses and other christian symbols are visible in many of his other works .
so it 's not without reason that richter received the german catholic art and culture prize two years ago . the making of an artist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richter painted milan 's gothic cathedral , which has similarities to cologne 's but is much larger this is n't the first time the internationally known artist has chosen colored glass as his medium .

gerhard richter 's current project is a modern 11,200-piece stained glass window for cologne 's gothic cathedral . the cologne cathedral 's new stained glass window by acclaimed german artist gerhard richter ca n't be overlooked , not only because of its immense size and conspicuous location but also because of its non-traditional approach . " the window will be a significant contribution of modern art to the cologne cathedral , " said barbara schock-werner , the cathedral 's master builder . gerhard richter is considered one of the most significant painters of our time .
his works adorn museum walls around the world and collectors drop millions to snap up his canvases .
the 74-year cologne-based artist is planning to unveil his monumental , 11,200-piece glass window in spring 2007 . gerhard richter has offered to craft the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184-square-foot -rrb- glass window as a gift to the city of cologne , the cathedral and its visitors .
donations will cover the production costs , which amount to some 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 447,000 -rrb- . a modern masterpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cologne cathedral attracts some 2.5 million visitors per year " the most important thing for me was to integrate this window into the cycle of historical windows , particularly as far as color goes , " schock-werner said .
richter 's window does n't prolong the existing tradition but develops it with his abstract use of color . glass squares in 80 different shades will replace a nearly transparent piece of glass that was inserted in the 1950 's after original window was destroyed during world war ii .
the plans for the damaged window , created in 1863 , had been lost so it could not be reproduced . the less-artistic interim piece needs to go because it lets too much light into the church and does n't correspond stylistically to the gothic cathedral , provost norbert feldhoff told german news source dpa . " the order of the individual colors is random , " said schock-werner , describing the all-over pattern of the squares , which measure 9.4 centimeters -lrb- 3.7 inches -rrb- on each side . the glass itself is not colored all the way through .
instead , colored pieces are attached to the outer surface of plain glass with the help of silicone . breaking a sacred art tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artist and his " abstract picture " from 1984 traditionally , church windows depicted biblical scenes .
long before computer books were printed , the panes told bible stories to illiterate parishioners by presenting them in brightly colored , larger-than-life images . however , richter 's window makes an intentional break from tradition .
it does n't render daniel in a den of lions , the flight of the egyptians , jesus ' birth , or the crucifixion .
in a sense , the church took a step of faith in abandoning a long-standing tradition and accepting a piece of art that is not explicitly religious . when asked if the window is a religious work of art , richter said , " oh , that 's hard to say .
art always has something to do with that . " even if christian motifs do n't appear in his latest glass work , crosses and other christian symbols are visible in many of his other works .
so it 's not without reason that richter received the german catholic art and culture prize two years ago . the making of an artist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richter painted milan 's gothic cathedral , which has similarities to cologne 's but is much larger this is n't the first time the internationally known artist has chosen colored glass as his medium .

how would you assess the rome conference ? rolf mützenich : i had hoped for more .
however , it was good that important states and international organizations were able to agree on common terminology at the rome conference .
this can only be evaluated in the context of the g8 summit , the eu foreign minister conferences and deliberations in the un security council . therein lies the bottom line : we need a lasting cease-fire as quickly as possible .
the use of military violence must be stopped . israel sees the concluding declaration from the rome conference as a carte blanche to continue its lebanon offensive , while german foreign minister steinmeier spoke of a " great misunderstanding . "
did the international community , particularly the european union , contribute to the legitimization of this legally questionable campaign ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf mützenich is a historian and political scientist the interpretation of israel 's justice minister is completely absurd .
the legitimization of the disproportionate use of violence is not the issue here .
both sides have harmed the civilian population with military means , which finally has to stop . what we need is a stepwise process : a cease-fire for humanitarian aid and a solution to prevent further escalations in this region . political observers and middle east experts have criticized germany 's passivity since the beginning of the middle east crisis .
is the german stance breaking down unity within the eu ?
and how can the eu be a counterweight to the pro-israel position that the us is taking ? i do n't see any passivity .
other european capitals that have a colonial past in the region could be accused of passivity .
but the german foreign minister is doing quite a lot , both within the region and outside of it .
he was not only in israel , egypt and palestine , he also sent representatives to beirut , damascus and new york .

it makes me dizzy to think that new structures should be formed by violent means .
that is a perception that belongs in the past . the then-ruling coalition between the social democrats and the greens was supported by the population in 2003 when the it rejected the iraq war as contrary to international law .
in the current conflict , the german people seem to view israel 's conduct with increasingly sharper criticism than the elite decision makers , particularly in light of civilian suffering .
is this a sign of a significant discrepancy between the political elite and the general population ? it 's not as clear-cut as you imply .
there are some differences between the two cases .
first of all , israel was actively attacked .
soldiers were abducted in gaza and on the lebanese-israeli border .
israel believes its very existence is in danger , and as the iranian president does not miss any opportunity to make anti-israeli and anti-semitic comments , it is completely understandable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mützenich said the war came just as improvement in lebanon was beginning however , israel is committing unrestrained violence against large parts of lebanon and the lebanese population that do not have anything to do with the current crisis .
the tragedy becomes even more depressing when we consider that a new lebanon with an active public society was just beginning to show itself in the past few months . of course , these are not singular events in region that has known violence for decades .
it 's bitter that - with israel 's bombardment , the abduction of the soldiers , the arrest of freely elected palestinian delegates and ministers and israel 's military campaign - the process in palestine was ended . perhaps part of the hamas would have gone down the path that fatah took - that is , recognizing israel 's right to existence and abstaining from violence .

" the council -lrb- of eu ministers -rrb- calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities to be followed by a sustainable ceasefire , " said finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erkki tuomioja he was speaking to reporters after ministers wrangled for three and a half hours over the exact wording of the joint eu declaration , and as israel escalated attacks on hezbollah guerillas and vowed to step up ground operations . " it 's important to get the words and concepts right , " he said , adding : " there are no divisions in the european union . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the agreement did not mean an immediate ceasefire , since cessation of hostilities was not the same as a ceasefire . " a ceasefire can perhaps be achieved later , " he said .
" we can now only ask the un security council and put pressure on it and not to waste any more time . " division despite tuomioja 's statement , the eu talks did come amid sharp disagreement within the bloc about whether to call for an immediate ceasefire . france has led calls for an immediate ceasefire , but britain and germany have pushed for a un accord to deploy an international force to secure the israeli-lebanon border and ensure that any truce is sustainable . french foreign ministe philippe douste-blazy welcomed the eu agreement , saying the bloc had spoken with " one voice . " " it is an important step .
the european union is supporting the resolution proposed by france to the un security council , " he said , denying any difference of opinion between paris and berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik arriving at the emergency meeting the finnish minister meanwhile underlined the need for urgent action at the un security council to provide the framework for a sustainable ceasefire , notably agreement on an international stabilization force . " once such a framework has been established - and we are hopefully talking more about days rather than weeks - eu member states have indicated their readiness to contribute to such an operation , " he said . no to terror list the finnish eu president also said the bloc does not intend on adding hezbollah to its list of terrorist organizations at the present time . " given the sensitive situation , i do n't think this is something we will be acting on now , tuomioja told the news conference after the meeting . his remarks were in response to a letter signed by 213 members of the united states congress , which was sent to eu foreign policy chief javier solana .

then the first high-ranking priest admitted he was involved . at first , michal czajkowski , a leading church figure known for his work on catholic-jewish relations , rejected the accusations made against him .
but in july , he admitted to spying on his colleagues for 24 years , beginning in 1960 .
soon after , he quit as co-chairman of the polish christian-jewish council . church collaboration hits poland especially hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czajkowski is known for his work on catholic-jewish relations " i want to apologize and ask for forgiveness , especially for those whom i have hurt - i displayed a weakness of character , " czajkowski wrote in a statement printed by polish newspapers .
" i have already expressed my regret toward god .
now i am doing it toward people . " in other former communist countries still grappling with their past , such admissions may be surprising .
but they do n't have the power to shock as in poland , where during four decades of communist rule , the church remained stronger than anywhere else in the bloc and was seen as the focal point to passive resistance and opposition to the regime . in the former communist czechoslovakia , for example , the church played a smaller role in society , and even today , the czechs are among the least devout nations in europe .
in hungary , the catholic church has also admitted that dozens of its priests spied on their colleagues without raising the same level of public shock seen in poland . germany still investigating its own past like other states behind the iron curtain , the churches in the former east germany have had to deal with allegations that their clergy , especially in the protestant church , appeased or supported communist officials . michael zöller , a professor of sociology and religion at the university of bayreuth said collaboration with the communists was more prevalent in the protestant church in the former east germany . " the catholic church was more protected because the gdr wanted to be on good terms with the vatican , " zöller said .
" protestants were more forced to cooperate , especially to be able to get some leeway in their activities . " some clergy members thought of it as a progressive alliance because there was an affinity between church doctrine and socialism - it even attracted clergy from west germany , such as angela merkel 's father , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stolpe has been accused of collaborating with the communists in germany , the opening of the east german secret police , or stasi , archives brought up a number of allegations against east german church officials most famously , former brandenburg premier manfred stolpe , who also served as germany 's minister of transportation , building and housing until 2005 .
stolpe was a high-ranking official of the gdr 's evangelical church and has denied the charges . zöller said he believes that issues of collaboration among the clergy will continue to come up , as historians continue to pore through the stasi files . " officials are still processing documents , " he said .
" who knows yet what information they contain . " over 10 percent of polish priests collaborated polish priest czajkowski was a willing spy , according to the warsaw-based national remembrance institute , which manages communist archives and investigates crimes of that era .
the institute said he reported on the church 's and clergy 's pro-democracy activities and only stopped after regime agents murdered the chaplain of the solidarity trade union , jerzy popieluszko , whom czajkowski is accused of spying on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands in poland mourned pope john paul ii 's death poland 's catholic church , including former pope john paul ii , is widely credited with the rise of solidarity , the movement that brought down the communists and took control of poland in 1989 .
even though the church openly supported the group , the national remembrance institute said about 10 percent to 15 percent of the clergy collaborated with the communists . until recently , the church has refused to cooperate with investigations or provide names regarding collaborators among the clergy .

then the first high-ranking priest admitted he was involved . at first , michal czajkowski , a leading church figure known for his work on catholic-jewish relations , rejected the accusations made against him .
but in july , he admitted to spying on his colleagues for 24 years , beginning in 1960 .
soon after , he quit as co-chairman of the polish christian-jewish council . church collaboration hits poland especially hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czajkowski is known for his work on catholic-jewish relations " i want to apologize and ask for forgiveness , especially for those whom i have hurt - i displayed a weakness of character , " czajkowski wrote in a statement printed by polish newspapers .
" i have already expressed my regret toward god .
now i am doing it toward people . " in other former communist countries still grappling with their past , such admissions may be surprising .
but they do n't have the power to shock as in poland , where during four decades of communist rule , the church remained stronger than anywhere else in the bloc and was seen as the focal point to passive resistance and opposition to the regime . in the former communist czechoslovakia , for example , the church played a smaller role in society , and even today , the czechs are among the least devout nations in europe .
in hungary , the catholic church has also admitted that dozens of its priests spied on their colleagues without raising the same level of public shock seen in poland . germany still investigating its own past like other states behind the iron curtain , the churches in the former east germany have had to deal with allegations that their clergy , especially in the protestant church , appeased or supported communist officials . michael zöller , a professor of sociology and religion at the university of bayreuth said collaboration with the communists was more prevalent in the protestant church in the former east germany . " the catholic church was more protected because the gdr wanted to be on good terms with the vatican , " zöller said .
" protestants were more forced to cooperate , especially to be able to get some leeway in their activities . " some clergy members thought of it as a progressive alliance because there was an affinity between church doctrine and socialism - it even attracted clergy from west germany , such as angela merkel 's father , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stolpe has been accused of collaborating with the communists in germany , the opening of the east german secret police , or stasi , archives brought up a number of allegations against east german church officials most famously , former brandenburg premier manfred stolpe , who also served as germany 's minister of transportation , building and housing until 2005 .
stolpe was a high-ranking official of the gdr 's evangelical church and has denied the charges . zöller said he believes that issues of collaboration among the clergy will continue to come up , as historians continue to pore through the stasi files . " officials are still processing documents , " he said .
" who knows yet what information they contain . " over 10 percent of polish priests collaborated polish priest czajkowski was a willing spy , according to the warsaw-based national remembrance institute , which manages communist archives and investigates crimes of that era .
the institute said he reported on the church 's and clergy 's pro-democracy activities and only stopped after regime agents murdered the chaplain of the solidarity trade union , jerzy popieluszko , whom czajkowski is accused of spying on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands in poland mourned pope john paul ii 's death poland 's catholic church , including former pope john paul ii , is widely credited with the rise of solidarity , the movement that brought down the communists and took control of poland in 1989 .
even though the church openly supported the group , the national remembrance institute said about 10 percent to 15 percent of the clergy collaborated with the communists . until recently , the church has refused to cooperate with investigations or provide names regarding collaborators among the clergy .
however , last year after similar allegations against an aide to pope john paul ii , konrad hejmo , surfaced , and the church suspended him .
hejmo denied the charges , which include spying on the late pope . coming to terms with the past now the catholic church in poland is working at coming to terms with its role in communist times .
earlier this year , church officials said they would begin investigating members of the clergy for collaborating with the communists .
soon after , the polish conference of catholic bishops issued an official apology to the public . " priests and others linked with the church who collaborated with the security services of the communist state cast a shadow on the catholic church 's heroic history under communist rule , " the bishops wrote , adding that an initiative to make public its complete list of collaborators is moving forward . the actions of a few priests also should not diminish the church 's role in promoting democracy , according to wojtek muszynski of the national remembrance institute . " the polish catholic church was still a hero , " he said .
" no matter how hard the secret service tried , they did n't break down 85 to 90 percent of the priests .

he is also part of the committee on foreign relations . dw-world.de : after the middle east conference in rome , crisis diplomacy was in full gear - but there is still no unified demand for a hasty end to the violence .
how would you assess the rome conference ? rolf mützenich : i had hoped for more .
however , it was good that important states and international organizations were able to agree on common terminology at the rome conference .
this can only be evaluated in the context of the g8 summit , the eu foreign minister conferences and deliberations in the un security council . therein lies the bottom line : we need a lasting cease-fire as quickly as possible .
the use of military violence must be stopped . israel sees the concluding declaration from the rome conference as a carte blanche to continue its lebanon offensive , while german foreign minister steinmeier spoke of a " great misunderstanding . "
did the international community , particularly the european union , contribute to the legitimization of this legally questionable campaign ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf mützenich is a historian and political scientist the interpretation of israel 's justice minister is completely absurd .
the legitimization of the disproportionate use of violence is not the issue here .
both sides have harmed the civilian population with military means , which finally has to stop . what we need is a stepwise process : a cease-fire for humanitarian aid and a solution to prevent further escalations in this region . political observers and middle east experts have criticized germany 's passivity since the beginning of the middle east crisis .
is the german stance breaking down unity within the eu ?
and how can the eu be a counterweight to the pro-israel position that the us is taking ? i do n't see any passivity .
other european capitals that have a colonial past in the region could be accused of passivity .
but the german foreign minister is doing quite a lot , both within the region and outside of it .
he was not only in israel , egypt and palestine , he also sent representatives to beirut , damascus and new york .
this is very active diplomacy . however , our influence remains marginal , especially as the american foreign policy is too hesitant .
i do n't at all share the american secretary of state 's perspective that a new middle east emerging .
it makes me dizzy to think that new structures should be formed by violent means .
that is a perception that belongs in the past . the then-ruling coalition between the social democrats and the greens was supported by the population in 2003 when the it rejected the iraq war as contrary to international law .
in the current conflict , the german people seem to view israel 's conduct with increasingly sharper criticism than the elite decision makers , particularly in light of civilian suffering .
is this a sign of a significant discrepancy between the political elite and the general population ? it 's not as clear-cut as you imply .
there are some differences between the two cases .
first of all , israel was actively attacked .
soldiers were abducted in gaza and on the lebanese-israeli border .
israel believes its very existence is in danger , and as the iranian president does not miss any opportunity to make anti-israeli and anti-semitic comments , it is completely understandable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mützenich said the war came just as improvement in lebanon was beginning however , israel is committing unrestrained violence against large parts of lebanon and the lebanese population that do not have anything to do with the current crisis .
the tragedy becomes even more depressing when we consider that a new lebanon with an active public society was just beginning to show itself in the past few months . of course , these are not singular events in region that has known violence for decades .
it 's bitter that - with israel 's bombardment , the abduction of the soldiers , the arrest of freely elected palestinian delegates and ministers and israel 's military campaign - the process in palestine was ended . perhaps part of the hamas would have gone down the path that fatah took - that is , recognizing israel 's right to existence and abstaining from violence .

he is also part of the committee on foreign relations . dw-world.de : after the middle east conference in rome , crisis diplomacy was in full gear - but there is still no unified demand for a hasty end to the violence .
how would you assess the rome conference ? rolf mützenich : i had hoped for more .
however , it was good that important states and international organizations were able to agree on common terminology at the rome conference .
this can only be evaluated in the context of the g8 summit , the eu foreign minister conferences and deliberations in the un security council . therein lies the bottom line : we need a lasting cease-fire as quickly as possible .
the use of military violence must be stopped . israel sees the concluding declaration from the rome conference as a carte blanche to continue its lebanon offensive , while german foreign minister steinmeier spoke of a " great misunderstanding . "
did the international community , particularly the european union , contribute to the legitimization of this legally questionable campaign ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf mützenich is a historian and political scientist the interpretation of israel 's justice minister is completely absurd .
the legitimization of the disproportionate use of violence is not the issue here .
both sides have harmed the civilian population with military means , which finally has to stop . what we need is a stepwise process : a cease-fire for humanitarian aid and a solution to prevent further escalations in this region . political observers and middle east experts have criticized germany 's passivity since the beginning of the middle east crisis .
is the german stance breaking down unity within the eu ?
and how can the eu be a counterweight to the pro-israel position that the us is taking ? i do n't see any passivity .
other european capitals that have a colonial past in the region could be accused of passivity .
but the german foreign minister is doing quite a lot , both within the region and outside of it .
he was not only in israel , egypt and palestine , he also sent representatives to beirut , damascus and new york .
this is very active diplomacy . however , our influence remains marginal , especially as the american foreign policy is too hesitant .
i do n't at all share the american secretary of state 's perspective that a new middle east emerging .
it makes me dizzy to think that new structures should be formed by violent means .
that is a perception that belongs in the past . the then-ruling coalition between the social democrats and the greens was supported by the population in 2003 when the it rejected the iraq war as contrary to international law .
in the current conflict , the german people seem to view israel 's conduct with increasingly sharper criticism than the elite decision makers , particularly in light of civilian suffering .
is this a sign of a significant discrepancy between the political elite and the general population ? it 's not as clear-cut as you imply .
there are some differences between the two cases .
first of all , israel was actively attacked .
soldiers were abducted in gaza and on the lebanese-israeli border .
israel believes its very existence is in danger , and as the iranian president does not miss any opportunity to make anti-israeli and anti-semitic comments , it is completely understandable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mützenich said the war came just as improvement in lebanon was beginning however , israel is committing unrestrained violence against large parts of lebanon and the lebanese population that do not have anything to do with the current crisis .
the tragedy becomes even more depressing when we consider that a new lebanon with an active public society was just beginning to show itself in the past few months . of course , these are not singular events in region that has known violence for decades .
it 's bitter that - with israel 's bombardment , the abduction of the soldiers , the arrest of freely elected palestinian delegates and ministers and israel 's military campaign - the process in palestine was ended . perhaps part of the hamas would have gone down the path that fatah took - that is , recognizing israel 's right to existence and abstaining from violence .
the prisoners ' paper opened a new window for peace a few weeks ago .
but extremists did n't want this solution .
even groups in israel were n't happy to see this kind of solution to the negotiations . loay mudhoon interviewed rolf mützenich -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click on the links to read dw-world.de 's compilation of articles on the conflict and the search for peace .
israel suspends air strikes for 48-hours but says war goes on israel has finally agreed to a limited ceasefire in lebanon with a 48-hour suspension of air strikes but israeli justice minister haim ramon said it did n't mean that the jewish state was ending its war against hezbollah .
-lrb- july 31 , 2006 -rrb- german government criticized for stance on lebanese refugees after germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble said it would be " premature " and " misguided " for germany to take in lebanese refugees , opposition politicians and humanitarian organizations responded with anger .

he is also part of the committee on foreign relations . dw-world.de : after the middle east conference in rome , crisis diplomacy was in full gear - but there is still no unified demand for a hasty end to the violence .
how would you assess the rome conference ? rolf mützenich : i had hoped for more .
however , it was good that important states and international organizations were able to agree on common terminology at the rome conference .
this can only be evaluated in the context of the g8 summit , the eu foreign minister conferences and deliberations in the un security council . therein lies the bottom line : we need a lasting cease-fire as quickly as possible .
the use of military violence must be stopped . israel sees the concluding declaration from the rome conference as a carte blanche to continue its lebanon offensive , while german foreign minister steinmeier spoke of a " great misunderstanding . "
did the international community , particularly the european union , contribute to the legitimization of this legally questionable campaign ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf mützenich is a historian and political scientist the interpretation of israel 's justice minister is completely absurd .
the legitimization of the disproportionate use of violence is not the issue here .
both sides have harmed the civilian population with military means , which finally has to stop . what we need is a stepwise process : a cease-fire for humanitarian aid and a solution to prevent further escalations in this region . political observers and middle east experts have criticized germany 's passivity since the beginning of the middle east crisis .
is the german stance breaking down unity within the eu ?
and how can the eu be a counterweight to the pro-israel position that the us is taking ? i do n't see any passivity .
other european capitals that have a colonial past in the region could be accused of passivity .
but the german foreign minister is doing quite a lot , both within the region and outside of it .
he was not only in israel , egypt and palestine , he also sent representatives to beirut , damascus and new york .
this is very active diplomacy . however , our influence remains marginal , especially as the american foreign policy is too hesitant .
i do n't at all share the american secretary of state 's perspective that a new middle east emerging .
it makes me dizzy to think that new structures should be formed by violent means .
that is a perception that belongs in the past . the then-ruling coalition between the social democrats and the greens was supported by the population in 2003 when the it rejected the iraq war as contrary to international law .
in the current conflict , the german people seem to view israel 's conduct with increasingly sharper criticism than the elite decision makers , particularly in light of civilian suffering .
is this a sign of a significant discrepancy between the political elite and the general population ? it 's not as clear-cut as you imply .
there are some differences between the two cases .

he is also part of the committee on foreign relations . dw-world.de : after the middle east conference in rome , crisis diplomacy was in full gear - but there is still no unified demand for a hasty end to the violence .
how would you assess the rome conference ? rolf mützenich : i had hoped for more .
however , it was good that important states and international organizations were able to agree on common terminology at the rome conference .
this can only be evaluated in the context of the g8 summit , the eu foreign minister conferences and deliberations in the un security council . therein lies the bottom line : we need a lasting cease-fire as quickly as possible .
the use of military violence must be stopped . israel sees the concluding declaration from the rome conference as a carte blanche to continue its lebanon offensive , while german foreign minister steinmeier spoke of a " great misunderstanding . "
did the international community , particularly the european union , contribute to the legitimization of this legally questionable campaign ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf mützenich is a historian and political scientist the interpretation of israel 's justice minister is completely absurd .
the legitimization of the disproportionate use of violence is not the issue here .
both sides have harmed the civilian population with military means , which finally has to stop . what we need is a stepwise process : a cease-fire for humanitarian aid and a solution to prevent further escalations in this region . political observers and middle east experts have criticized germany 's passivity since the beginning of the middle east crisis .
is the german stance breaking down unity within the eu ?
and how can the eu be a counterweight to the pro-israel position that the us is taking ? i do n't see any passivity .
other european capitals that have a colonial past in the region could be accused of passivity .
but the german foreign minister is doing quite a lot , both within the region and outside of it .
he was not only in israel , egypt and palestine , he also sent representatives to beirut , damascus and new york .
this is very active diplomacy . however , our influence remains marginal , especially as the american foreign policy is too hesitant .
i do n't at all share the american secretary of state 's perspective that a new middle east emerging .
it makes me dizzy to think that new structures should be formed by violent means .
that is a perception that belongs in the past . the then-ruling coalition between the social democrats and the greens was supported by the population in 2003 when the it rejected the iraq war as contrary to international law .
in the current conflict , the german people seem to view israel 's conduct with increasingly sharper criticism than the elite decision makers , particularly in light of civilian suffering .
is this a sign of a significant discrepancy between the political elite and the general population ? it 's not as clear-cut as you imply .
there are some differences between the two cases .
first of all , israel was actively attacked .
soldiers were abducted in gaza and on the lebanese-israeli border .
israel believes its very existence is in danger , and as the iranian president does not miss any opportunity to make anti-israeli and anti-semitic comments , it is completely understandable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mützenich said the war came just as improvement in lebanon was beginning however , israel is committing unrestrained violence against large parts of lebanon and the lebanese population that do not have anything to do with the current crisis .
the tragedy becomes even more depressing when we consider that a new lebanon with an active public society was just beginning to show itself in the past few months . of course , these are not singular events in region that has known violence for decades .
it 's bitter that - with israel 's bombardment , the abduction of the soldiers , the arrest of freely elected palestinian delegates and ministers and israel 's military campaign - the process in palestine was ended . perhaps part of the hamas would have gone down the path that fatah took - that is , recognizing israel 's right to existence and abstaining from violence .
the prisoners ' paper opened a new window for peace a few weeks ago .
but extremists did n't want this solution .
even groups in israel were n't happy to see this kind of solution to the negotiations . loay mudhoon interviewed rolf mützenich -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click on the links to read dw-world.de 's compilation of articles on the conflict and the search for peace .
israel suspends air strikes for 48-hours but says war goes on israel has finally agreed to a limited ceasefire in lebanon with a 48-hour suspension of air strikes but israeli justice minister haim ramon said it did n't mean that the jewish state was ending its war against hezbollah .
-lrb- july 31 , 2006 -rrb- german government criticized for stance on lebanese refugees after germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble said it would be " premature " and " misguided " for germany to take in lebanese refugees , opposition politicians and humanitarian organizations responded with anger .

then the first high-ranking priest admitted he was involved . at first , michal czajkowski , a leading church figure known for his work on catholic-jewish relations , rejected the accusations made against him .
but in july , he admitted to spying on his colleagues for 24 years , beginning in 1960 .
soon after , he quit as co-chairman of the polish christian-jewish council . church collaboration hits poland especially hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czajkowski is known for his work on catholic-jewish relations " i want to apologize and ask for forgiveness , especially for those whom i have hurt - i displayed a weakness of character , " czajkowski wrote in a statement printed by polish newspapers .
" i have already expressed my regret toward god .
now i am doing it toward people . " in other former communist countries still grappling with their past , such admissions may be surprising .
but they do n't have the power to shock as in poland , where during four decades of communist rule , the church remained stronger than anywhere else in the bloc and was seen as the focal point to passive resistance and opposition to the regime . in the former communist czechoslovakia , for example , the church played a smaller role in society , and even today , the czechs are among the least devout nations in europe .
in hungary , the catholic church has also admitted that dozens of its priests spied on their colleagues without raising the same level of public shock seen in poland . germany still investigating its own past like other states behind the iron curtain , the churches in the former east germany have had to deal with allegations that their clergy , especially in the protestant church , appeased or supported communist officials . michael zöller , a professor of sociology and religion at the university of bayreuth said collaboration with the communists was more prevalent in the protestant church in the former east germany . " the catholic church was more protected because the gdr wanted to be on good terms with the vatican , " zöller said .
" protestants were more forced to cooperate , especially to be able to get some leeway in their activities . " some clergy members thought of it as a progressive alliance because there was an affinity between church doctrine and socialism - it even attracted clergy from west germany , such as angela merkel 's father , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stolpe has been accused of collaborating with the communists in germany , the opening of the east german secret police , or stasi , archives brought up a number of allegations against east german church officials most famously , former brandenburg premier manfred stolpe , who also served as germany 's minister of transportation , building and housing until 2005 .
stolpe was a high-ranking official of the gdr 's evangelical church and has denied the charges . zöller said he believes that issues of collaboration among the clergy will continue to come up , as historians continue to pore through the stasi files . " officials are still processing documents , " he said .
" who knows yet what information they contain . " over 10 percent of polish priests collaborated polish priest czajkowski was a willing spy , according to the warsaw-based national remembrance institute , which manages communist archives and investigates crimes of that era .
the institute said he reported on the church 's and clergy 's pro-democracy activities and only stopped after regime agents murdered the chaplain of the solidarity trade union , jerzy popieluszko , whom czajkowski is accused of spying on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands in poland mourned pope john paul ii 's death poland 's catholic church , including former pope john paul ii , is widely credited with the rise of solidarity , the movement that brought down the communists and took control of poland in 1989 .
even though the church openly supported the group , the national remembrance institute said about 10 percent to 15 percent of the clergy collaborated with the communists . until recently , the church has refused to cooperate with investigations or provide names regarding collaborators among the clergy .
however , last year after similar allegations against an aide to pope john paul ii , konrad hejmo , surfaced , and the church suspended him .
hejmo denied the charges , which include spying on the late pope . coming to terms with the past now the catholic church in poland is working at coming to terms with its role in communist times .

" it would be not just premature but also objectively misguided if germany or even individual -lrb- german -rrb- states offered ' refugee protection ' of their own accord , " schäuble was quoted as saying . helping locally according to the german interior minister , european countries could , in principle , offer shelter " in case of a massive influx , " but the current situation did not warrant such a response . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble " experts at this point do not expect a mass influx to europe , " schäuble said .
" for that reason , i am very much in favor of not luring people to europe with promises and spreading them widely , but rather of supporting them on the spot , in the region , " he said .
in a statement issued on monday , pro asyl - a non-profit human rights organization for refugees - urged the german government to take the initiative and lobby on the european level for the eu to open its gates to lebanese refugees . germany should at least help with the evacuation of the lebanese refugees who have relatives in germany , the group said . a humanitarian catastrophe there are around 40,000 lebanese living in germany along with numerous german citizens of lebanese origin .

gerhard richter 's current project is a modern 11,200-piece stained glass window for cologne 's gothic cathedral . the cologne cathedral 's new stained glass window by acclaimed german artist gerhard richter ca n't be overlooked , not only because of its immense size and conspicuous location but also because of its non-traditional approach . " the window will be a significant contribution of modern art to the cologne cathedral , " said barbara schock-werner , the cathedral 's master builder . gerhard richter is considered one of the most significant painters of our time .
his works adorn museum walls around the world and collectors drop millions to snap up his canvases .
the 74-year cologne-based artist is planning to unveil his monumental , 11,200-piece glass window in spring 2007 . gerhard richter has offered to craft the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184-square-foot -rrb- glass window as a gift to the city of cologne , the cathedral and its visitors .
donations will cover the production costs , which amount to some 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 447,000 -rrb- . a modern masterpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cologne cathedral attracts some 2.5 million visitors per year " the most important thing for me was to integrate this window into the cycle of historical windows , particularly as far as color goes , " schock-werner said .
richter 's window does n't prolong the existing tradition but develops it with his abstract use of color . glass squares in 80 different shades will replace a nearly transparent piece of glass that was inserted in the 1950 's after original window was destroyed during world war ii .
the plans for the damaged window , created in 1863 , had been lost so it could not be reproduced . the less-artistic interim piece needs to go because it lets too much light into the church and does n't correspond stylistically to the gothic cathedral , provost norbert feldhoff told german news source dpa . " the order of the individual colors is random , " said schock-werner , describing the all-over pattern of the squares , which measure 9.4 centimeters -lrb- 3.7 inches -rrb- on each side . the glass itself is not colored all the way through .
instead , colored pieces are attached to the outer surface of plain glass with the help of silicone . breaking a sacred art tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artist and his " abstract picture " from 1984 traditionally , church windows depicted biblical scenes .
long before computer books were printed , the panes told bible stories to illiterate parishioners by presenting them in brightly colored , larger-than-life images . however , richter 's window makes an intentional break from tradition .
it does n't render daniel in a den of lions , the flight of the egyptians , jesus ' birth , or the crucifixion .
in a sense , the church took a step of faith in abandoning a long-standing tradition and accepting a piece of art that is not explicitly religious . when asked if the window is a religious work of art , richter said , " oh , that 's hard to say .
art always has something to do with that . " even if christian motifs do n't appear in his latest glass work , crosses and other christian symbols are visible in many of his other works .
so it 's not without reason that richter received the german catholic art and culture prize two years ago . the making of an artist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richter painted milan 's gothic cathedral , which has similarities to cologne 's but is much larger this is n't the first time the internationally known artist has chosen colored glass as his medium .
in 1991 , for example , he created artistic accents for the hypobank in düsseldorf , which was designed by cologne architect oswald mathias ungers . richter became well known in the 1960s for modeling his paintings on photographs while using indistinct lines .
his works , which span a career of over 40 years , are stylistically diverse , as new york 's museum of modern art showed in 2002 .
in honor of the dresden native 's 70th birthday , the museum organized the largest retrospective exhibition ever done for a living artist . michael köhler / dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trash art litters cologne some say german artist ha schult likes to provoke .

gerhard richter 's current project is a modern 11,200-piece stained glass window for cologne 's gothic cathedral . the cologne cathedral 's new stained glass window by acclaimed german artist gerhard richter ca n't be overlooked , not only because of its immense size and conspicuous location but also because of its non-traditional approach . " the window will be a significant contribution of modern art to the cologne cathedral , " said barbara schock-werner , the cathedral 's master builder . gerhard richter is considered one of the most significant painters of our time .
his works adorn museum walls around the world and collectors drop millions to snap up his canvases .
the 74-year cologne-based artist is planning to unveil his monumental , 11,200-piece glass window in spring 2007 . gerhard richter has offered to craft the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184-square-foot -rrb- glass window as a gift to the city of cologne , the cathedral and its visitors .
donations will cover the production costs , which amount to some 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 447,000 -rrb- . a modern masterpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cologne cathedral attracts some 2.5 million visitors per year " the most important thing for me was to integrate this window into the cycle of historical windows , particularly as far as color goes , " schock-werner said .
richter 's window does n't prolong the existing tradition but develops it with his abstract use of color . glass squares in 80 different shades will replace a nearly transparent piece of glass that was inserted in the 1950 's after original window was destroyed during world war ii .
the plans for the damaged window , created in 1863 , had been lost so it could not be reproduced . the less-artistic interim piece needs to go because it lets too much light into the church and does n't correspond stylistically to the gothic cathedral , provost norbert feldhoff told german news source dpa . " the order of the individual colors is random , " said schock-werner , describing the all-over pattern of the squares , which measure 9.4 centimeters -lrb- 3.7 inches -rrb- on each side . the glass itself is not colored all the way through .
instead , colored pieces are attached to the outer surface of plain glass with the help of silicone . breaking a sacred art tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artist and his " abstract picture " from 1984 traditionally , church windows depicted biblical scenes .
long before computer books were printed , the panes told bible stories to illiterate parishioners by presenting them in brightly colored , larger-than-life images . however , richter 's window makes an intentional break from tradition .
it does n't render daniel in a den of lions , the flight of the egyptians , jesus ' birth , or the crucifixion .
in a sense , the church took a step of faith in abandoning a long-standing tradition and accepting a piece of art that is not explicitly religious . when asked if the window is a religious work of art , richter said , " oh , that 's hard to say .
art always has something to do with that . " even if christian motifs do n't appear in his latest glass work , crosses and other christian symbols are visible in many of his other works .
so it 's not without reason that richter received the german catholic art and culture prize two years ago . the making of an artist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richter painted milan 's gothic cathedral , which has similarities to cologne 's but is much larger this is n't the first time the internationally known artist has chosen colored glass as his medium .
in 1991 , for example , he created artistic accents for the hypobank in düsseldorf , which was designed by cologne architect oswald mathias ungers . richter became well known in the 1960s for modeling his paintings on photographs while using indistinct lines .
his works , which span a career of over 40 years , are stylistically diverse , as new york 's museum of modern art showed in 2002 .

31 or face the threat of sanctions .
germany and the united states applauded the measure .
but it was immediately rejected by tehran . united nations resolution 1696 expressed " serious concern " at iran 's refusal to comply with international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- orders to halt uranium enrichment and other work that could help build a nuclear bomb . the text did not include an immediate threat of sanctions , opposed by russia and china , and said punitive action would be the subject of further discussions .
but iaea director mohammed elbaradei will have to give a report on iran 's action by aug .
31 .
if iran does not suspend its nuclear work , the council would consider adopting " appropriate measures , " which could be economic and political sanctions . the resolution was passed by a 14-1 vote with qatar in opposition .
it was welcomed by the united states and its allies , but iran 's un ambassador javad zarif said it was " destructive and totally unwarranted " in a long speech to the council . " i would suggest to you that this approach will not lead to any productive outcome .
it can only exacerbate the situation , " zarif told the council .
he said iran was only ready for " serious and non-discriminatory " negotiations . " the door to negotiations is open . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the international community was setting a firm sign of its unity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un hopes diplomacy can still solve the iran conflict " it 's up to iran now to fulfil these binding demands of the international community and dispel the existing doubts about the peaceful nature of its nuclear program , " steinmeier said in a statement on monday .
" iran has the choice .
the door to negotiations is open . " us secretary of state condoleezza rice said the resolution 's wording meant iran still had time to cooperate with world powers on its nuclear program and avoid an all-out confrontation . " i want to be very clear that this does n't close the door to diplomacy , " rice told reporters on her way back to washington from a middle east peace mission . both rice and steinmeier said the extensive six-party package - worked out by germany , france , britain , the united states , russia and china - was still on the table . " our top goal remains finding an amicable diplomatic solution , " steinmeier said .
" i appeal to the leaders in tehran to take this opportunity and create the conditions for a return to the negotiating table . " iran is a potential volcano signals from tehran do not indicate that iran will comply to the un demands . " the security council resolution is unacceptable and is shifting the climate down a path which will help no one , " kazem jalali , spokesman for the iranian parliament 's foreign affairs commission , was quoted as saying by the isna news agency late monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar cast the lone dissenting vote qatar was the only council member to oppose the iran resolution .
it said it was too confrontational . " do we really want to see another volcano erupting in this region ? " said qatari un ambassador nassir abdulaziz al-nasser . russia and china gave their backing , though both said that there was no immediate threat of sanctions .
russian ambassador vitaly churkin said that even the next stage precluded any threat of military action . japan on tuesday welcomed the un resolution and said its position was unaffected by its close trade ties with the oil producer .
japan , a non-permanent member of the security council , is a close us ally but has also been a major investor in iran 's energy sector .
asia 's largest economy is heavily dependent on middle eastern oil . china said diplomacy was crucial in resolving the iran nuclear crisis . " china hopes the resolution on iran 's nuclear issue would serve the ongoing diplomatic efforts to settle the standoff , " the official xinhua news agency quoted foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao as saying tuesday .

" i am not coming back , " joschka fischer said at the end of june , brushing aside suggestions he could return to fight another day for germany 's green party .
" the door is closed ; the key has been turned and thrown away . " the new professor of international economic policy at princeton university 's woodrow wilson school of public and international affairs may have meant every word he said when stepping down from government to concentrate on his new teaching position in the united states .
but in the space of almost a month , the former german foreign minister 's expertise in the middle east has become a more valuable commodity ; one which some wish to use again . the war in lebanon and the rapidly disintegrating relationship between the west and iran over the islamic republic 's nuclear ambitions have turned up the heat in the pressure cooker region , with diplomats from all nations struggling to find viable solutions to the problems in the middle east . a respected middle east expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer with the late palestinian leader yasser arafat some believe fischer , as an expert on the middle east who won the confidence of both jews and palestinians during his seven years as foreign minister , could prove to be an important player again in any negotiations - be it in an official or unofficial capacity . and while no official offer has been made for him to join germany 's efforts in ending the israel-hezbollah conflict or the nuclear stand-off with iran , fischer has been touted as a possible mediator in both crises , either as a german or european union representative .

the german government and fischer himself have not responded to calls for such involvement in either the lebanon or iran crises .
however , fischer started a four-day visit to iran on monday where he will take part in a round table debate organized by tehran 's center for strategic studies after being invited by hassan rohani , iran 's former chief negotiator on its nuclear program . invitation shows fischer 's standing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rohani and fischer have a mutual respect although the private visit had been organized for some time , his inclusion in the debate shows that his regular visits to iran and the middle east during his tenure as germany 's top diplomat built many important working relationships and earned him respect in the region . and as the united nations security council prepares to set tehran a deadline for the suspension of its uranium enrichment program with sanctions seemingly unavoidable given iran 's belligerent stance , a man such as fischer who the iranians can trust could pave the way for talks to reopen .
he himself believes that negotiation with iran is the only way to secure a peaceful resolution to this and the wider problems in the region . " if an understanding can be found with tehran about its nuclear program and uranium enrichment , the situation in the middle east will change , " he recently told die zeit newspaper .
" if not , we are heading for an enormous crisis with unforeseeable consequences . " taking a different line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer at the un as for lebanon , fischer has already voiced his opinions and they differ from the current line of thinking .
while many diplomats believe a un force in lebanon is the way forward , fischer has said it would make " little sense " to deploy a larger un contingent to stabilize the country . " another blue-helmet mandate will make little sense , " fischer said .
" only a robust force with a robust mandate could perhaps achieve something positive .
but the risks are enormous .
i think it is far more important to put political pressure on the radicals and to commit ourselves to new peace negotiations . " fischer said the violence had been " orchestrated by foreign leaders of hamas as part of their struggle with the moderate elements in the movement . "
but iran and syria also had a hand in events , he added . he also accused the west , russia and the united nations of neglecting the middle east peace process . " never before has the west , the us , neglected this volatile conflict so dangerously , never before has the so-called middle east quartet , namely the us , the eu , the un and russia , shown so little commitment , " he said .

groom and groom or bride and bride became possible due to a new law on same-sex registered partnerships . it was actually just over five years ago that one of klaus jetz 's long-sought-after goals was realized .
after long debate and much lobbying from the organization he directs , the lesbian and gay association of germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , the german parliament passed the " registered partnership " bill , which gave gay and lesbian couples new status in the eyes of the state , one that had many of the advantages of marriage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.08.2006 german gay marriage law marks fifth anniversary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first " gay marriage " in hanover in 2001 five years ago , the bride-and-groom grouping lost its monopoly on the church aisle or the top of the wedding cake .
groom and groom or bride and bride became possible due to a new law on same-sex registered partnerships . it was actually just over five years ago that one of klaus jetz 's long-sought-after goals was realized .
after long debate and much lobbying from the organization he directs , the lesbian and gay association of germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , the german parliament passed the " registered partnership " bill , which gave gay and lesbian couples new status in the eyes of the state , one that had many of the advantages of marriage .
the law he had fought so hard for went into effect on aug .
1 , 2001 . " since the early 90s , the lsvd had fought for this , and back then , it all seemed so far off , " he said .
" then with the change of government in 1998 , the chance to make it a reality arrived . " for many long-time same-sex couples , whose daily reality had looked pretty much like a marriage , their relationships were now sanctioned by the coalition government of left-of-center social democrats and greens under gerhard schröder .
the law entitles gay and lesbian couples who registered their partnerships some of the advantages heterosexual married couples enjoy . same-sex couples can now share a last name , refuse to testify against one another in court and have same inheritance and tenants ' rights as heterosexual spouses .
a foreigner legally joined in a gay partnership to a german can apply for the right to citizenship .
partners also take on a responsibility to maintain and support the other in the case of financial difficulties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another happy couple on jan .
1 , 2005 , the law was amended , giving one partner the right to adopt the other partner 's biological child , so-called stepchild adoption .
other rights were expanded , such as the area of property rights , which moved registered partnerships closer to heterosexual marriage . but attempts to give same-sex partners the same tax and welfare benefits as those enjoyed by heterosexual couples were defeated in the conservative-dominated upper house of the german parliament . almost " normal " while it is difficult to know exactly how many same-sex couples have registered their partnerships over the five years of the law because of different recording criteria in germany 's federal states , estimates range between 14,000 and 20,000 . " in 2001 , there were many same-sex couples who knew they wanted to become registered partners and were just waiting for the ink of this law to be dry , " said ute terwedow from the civil registry office in cologne .
" that accounts for the large numbers we saw at the outset .
now the whole thing has become very normal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lsvd 's axel blumenthal , left , and green politician volker beck , signaled their optimism that the constitutional court would rule in their favor in 2002 in cologne in 2002 , 285 same-sex couples registered their partnerships - a " record year , " according to terwedow .
since then , between 170 and 180 couples have tied the knot every year .
according to a survey by the dpa news agency , gay men are saying " i do " much more often than lesbians .
in cologne , only a third of same-sex couples at the registry office are women . when " gay marriage " was under debate in germany , some talked about it being a danger to the nation 's culture fabric and there were fears that it would undermine traditional marriage .
several states led by the conservative union political parties asked the law to be reviewed by the constitutional court , in the hope it would declared unconstitutional .
it was not .
five years later , however , same-sex unions have gained a societal acceptance that exceeds even what optimists had predicted . discriminatory even though klaus jetz celebrated the law 's coming into effect five years ago , he and his partner of 11 years have chosen not to tie the knot at the registry office .
while he said the current law marks progress in the area of gay and lesbian rights , he still finds parts of it unacceptable , since a registered partnership is not the same thing as a marriage .
some have called it marriage " light , " since it has most of traditional marriage 's responsibilities , but fewer of its advantages . there are differences regarding income taxes , joint tax assessments , and inheritance taxes .
for example , it is almost impossible to inherit an apartment from a deceased partner , jetz says , because of the high inheritance taxes that would have to be paid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain legalized gay marriage in 2005 in the face of opposition from the church and conservatives heterosexual married couples , on the other hand , enjoy a tax exemption of 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 635,000 -rrb- .
same-sex couples do not .
and unlike heterosexuals , or gay couples in the neighboring netherlands , german couples will not have the right to adopt . " in germany we are still far away from complete equality for homosexual partnerships , " said volker beck , a green parliamentarian who has been a major backer of the law . the discrepancies came about because the registered partnership bill was split into two parts when it went through parliament .
the section that dealt with many of the financial aspects , such as tax law , would have had to be approved by the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
because that body was dominated by conservatives , the left-of-center government did not try to push it through , since it would have gone down to defeat . " now we need to take a new run at the partnership law to complete it , " jetz said . but he does n't want to downplay the importance of the law , calling it a paradigm change in germany , something that was almost inconceivable just 15 years ago .
he would like to see the government take up the issue again , but said the current coalition under conservative chancellor angela merkel is not likely to . " but even in the netherlands and denmark it took 10 years until lesbian and gay partnerships were made 100 percent equal to heterosexual ones , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain approves gay marriage , adoption days after the election of a staunchly conservative new pope , predominantly roman catholic spain is set to allow homosexuals to marry and adopt children .

but , several cities there are vying to be the first to produce a similar rail system . news reports that china is building its first magnetic-levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- rail system have been circulating in the media for months .
a report published this week in the newspaper china daily said the north-eastern port city dalian planned to construct the first commercial chinese-made maglev train test line this year .
" lines such as these are being built in great numbers in china , " said petra aldenrath , the china correspondent in beijing for german public radio network ard .

" the council -lrb- of eu ministers -rrb- calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities to be followed by a sustainable ceasefire , " said finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erkki tuomioja he was speaking to reporters after ministers wrangled for three and a half hours over the exact wording of the joint eu declaration , and as israel escalated attacks on hezbollah guerillas and vowed to step up ground operations . " it 's important to get the words and concepts right , " he said , adding : " there are no divisions in the european union . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the agreement did not mean an immediate ceasefire , since cessation of hostilities was not the same as a ceasefire . " a ceasefire can perhaps be achieved later , " he said .
" we can now only ask the un security council and put pressure on it and not to waste any more time . " division despite tuomioja 's statement , the eu talks did come amid sharp disagreement within the bloc about whether to call for an immediate ceasefire . france has led calls for an immediate ceasefire , but britain and germany have pushed for a un accord to deploy an international force to secure the israeli-lebanon border and ensure that any truce is sustainable . french foreign ministe philippe douste-blazy welcomed the eu agreement , saying the bloc had spoken with " one voice . " " it is an important step .
the european union is supporting the resolution proposed by france to the un security council , " he said , denying any difference of opinion between paris and berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik arriving at the emergency meeting the finnish minister meanwhile underlined the need for urgent action at the un security council to provide the framework for a sustainable ceasefire , notably agreement on an international stabilization force . " once such a framework has been established - and we are hopefully talking more about days rather than weeks - eu member states have indicated their readiness to contribute to such an operation , " he said . no to terror list the finnish eu president also said the bloc does not intend on adding hezbollah to its list of terrorist organizations at the present time . " given the sensitive situation , i do n't think this is something we will be acting on now , tuomioja told the news conference after the meeting . his remarks were in response to a letter signed by 213 members of the united states congress , which was sent to eu foreign policy chief javier solana .

" the council -lrb- of eu ministers -rrb- calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities to be followed by a sustainable ceasefire , " said finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erkki tuomioja he was speaking to reporters after ministers wrangled for three and a half hours over the exact wording of the joint eu declaration , and as israel escalated attacks on hezbollah guerillas and vowed to step up ground operations . " it 's important to get the words and concepts right , " he said , adding : " there are no divisions in the european union . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the agreement did not mean an immediate ceasefire , since cessation of hostilities was not the same as a ceasefire . " a ceasefire can perhaps be achieved later , " he said .
" we can now only ask the un security council and put pressure on it and not to waste any more time . " division despite tuomioja 's statement , the eu talks did come amid sharp disagreement within the bloc about whether to call for an immediate ceasefire . france has led calls for an immediate ceasefire , but britain and germany have pushed for a un accord to deploy an international force to secure the israeli-lebanon border and ensure that any truce is sustainable . french foreign ministe philippe douste-blazy welcomed the eu agreement , saying the bloc had spoken with " one voice . " " it is an important step .
the european union is supporting the resolution proposed by france to the un security council , " he said , denying any difference of opinion between paris and berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik arriving at the emergency meeting the finnish minister meanwhile underlined the need for urgent action at the un security council to provide the framework for a sustainable ceasefire , notably agreement on an international stabilization force . " once such a framework has been established - and we are hopefully talking more about days rather than weeks - eu member states have indicated their readiness to contribute to such an operation , " he said . no to terror list the finnish eu president also said the bloc does not intend on adding hezbollah to its list of terrorist organizations at the present time . " given the sensitive situation , i do n't think this is something we will be acting on now , tuomioja told the news conference after the meeting . his remarks were in response to a letter signed by 213 members of the united states congress , which was sent to eu foreign policy chief javier solana .

he is also part of the committee on foreign relations . dw-world.de : after the middle east conference in rome , crisis diplomacy was in full gear - but there is still no unified demand for a hasty end to the violence .
how would you assess the rome conference ? rolf mützenich : i had hoped for more .
however , it was good that important states and international organizations were able to agree on common terminology at the rome conference .
this can only be evaluated in the context of the g8 summit , the eu foreign minister conferences and deliberations in the un security council . therein lies the bottom line : we need a lasting cease-fire as quickly as possible .
the use of military violence must be stopped . israel sees the concluding declaration from the rome conference as a carte blanche to continue its lebanon offensive , while german foreign minister steinmeier spoke of a " great misunderstanding . "
did the international community , particularly the european union , contribute to the legitimization of this legally questionable campaign ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf mützenich is a historian and political scientist the interpretation of israel 's justice minister is completely absurd .
the legitimization of the disproportionate use of violence is not the issue here .
both sides have harmed the civilian population with military means , which finally has to stop . what we need is a stepwise process : a cease-fire for humanitarian aid and a solution to prevent further escalations in this region . political observers and middle east experts have criticized germany 's passivity since the beginning of the middle east crisis .
is the german stance breaking down unity within the eu ?
and how can the eu be a counterweight to the pro-israel position that the us is taking ? i do n't see any passivity .
other european capitals that have a colonial past in the region could be accused of passivity .
but the german foreign minister is doing quite a lot , both within the region and outside of it .
he was not only in israel , egypt and palestine , he also sent representatives to beirut , damascus and new york .
this is very active diplomacy . however , our influence remains marginal , especially as the american foreign policy is too hesitant .
i do n't at all share the american secretary of state 's perspective that a new middle east emerging .
it makes me dizzy to think that new structures should be formed by violent means .
that is a perception that belongs in the past . the then-ruling coalition between the social democrats and the greens was supported by the population in 2003 when the it rejected the iraq war as contrary to international law .
in the current conflict , the german people seem to view israel 's conduct with increasingly sharper criticism than the elite decision makers , particularly in light of civilian suffering .
is this a sign of a significant discrepancy between the political elite and the general population ? it 's not as clear-cut as you imply .
there are some differences between the two cases .
first of all , israel was actively attacked .
soldiers were abducted in gaza and on the lebanese-israeli border .
israel believes its very existence is in danger , and as the iranian president does not miss any opportunity to make anti-israeli and anti-semitic comments , it is completely understandable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mützenich said the war came just as improvement in lebanon was beginning however , israel is committing unrestrained violence against large parts of lebanon and the lebanese population that do not have anything to do with the current crisis .
the tragedy becomes even more depressing when we consider that a new lebanon with an active public society was just beginning to show itself in the past few months . of course , these are not singular events in region that has known violence for decades .
it 's bitter that - with israel 's bombardment , the abduction of the soldiers , the arrest of freely elected palestinian delegates and ministers and israel 's military campaign - the process in palestine was ended . perhaps part of the hamas would have gone down the path that fatah took - that is , recognizing israel 's right to existence and abstaining from violence .
the prisoners ' paper opened a new window for peace a few weeks ago .
but extremists did n't want this solution .
even groups in israel were n't happy to see this kind of solution to the negotiations . loay mudhoon interviewed rolf mützenich -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click on the links to read dw-world.de 's compilation of articles on the conflict and the search for peace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 01.08.2006 gothic meets modern in gerhard richter 's glass window großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richter 's multihued window will be finished early next year he 's been called a modern-day picasso and recently became the most expensive living painter .
gerhard richter 's current project is a modern 11,200-piece stained glass window for cologne 's gothic cathedral . the cologne cathedral 's new stained glass window by acclaimed german artist gerhard richter ca n't be overlooked , not only because of its immense size and conspicuous location but also because of its non-traditional approach . " the window will be a significant contribution of modern art to the cologne cathedral , " said barbara schock-werner , the cathedral 's master builder . gerhard richter is considered one of the most significant painters of our time .
his works adorn museum walls around the world and collectors drop millions to snap up his canvases .
the 74-year cologne-based artist is planning to unveil his monumental , 11,200-piece glass window in spring 2007 . gerhard richter has offered to craft the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184-square-foot -rrb- glass window as a gift to the city of cologne , the cathedral and its visitors .
donations will cover the production costs , which amount to some 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 447,000 -rrb- . a modern masterpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cologne cathedral attracts some 2.5 million visitors per year " the most important thing for me was to integrate this window into the cycle of historical windows , particularly as far as color goes , " schock-werner said .
richter 's window does n't prolong the existing tradition but develops it with his abstract use of color . glass squares in 80 different shades will replace a nearly transparent piece of glass that was inserted in the 1950 's after original window was destroyed during world war ii .
the plans for the damaged window , created in 1863 , had been lost so it could not be reproduced . the less-artistic interim piece needs to go because it lets too much light into the church and does n't correspond stylistically to the gothic cathedral , provost norbert feldhoff told german news source dpa . " the order of the individual colors is random , " said schock-werner , describing the all-over pattern of the squares , which measure 9.4 centimeters -lrb- 3.7 inches -rrb- on each side . the glass itself is not colored all the way through .
instead , colored pieces are attached to the outer surface of plain glass with the help of silicone . breaking a sacred art tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artist and his " abstract picture " from 1984 traditionally , church windows depicted biblical scenes .
long before computer books were printed , the panes told bible stories to illiterate parishioners by presenting them in brightly colored , larger-than-life images . however , richter 's window makes an intentional break from tradition .
it does n't render daniel in a den of lions , the flight of the egyptians , jesus ' birth , or the crucifixion .
in a sense , the church took a step of faith in abandoning a long-standing tradition and accepting a piece of art that is not explicitly religious . when asked if the window is a religious work of art , richter said , " oh , that 's hard to say .
art always has something to do with that . " even if christian motifs do n't appear in his latest glass work , crosses and other christian symbols are visible in many of his other works .
so it 's not without reason that richter received the german catholic art and culture prize two years ago . the making of an artist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richter painted milan 's gothic cathedral , which has similarities to cologne 's but is much larger this is n't the first time the internationally known artist has chosen colored glass as his medium .

gerhard richter 's current project is a modern 11,200-piece stained glass window for cologne 's gothic cathedral . the cologne cathedral 's new stained glass window by acclaimed german artist gerhard richter ca n't be overlooked , not only because of its immense size and conspicuous location but also because of its non-traditional approach . " the window will be a significant contribution of modern art to the cologne cathedral , " said barbara schock-werner , the cathedral 's master builder . gerhard richter is considered one of the most significant painters of our time .
his works adorn museum walls around the world and collectors drop millions to snap up his canvases .
the 74-year cologne-based artist is planning to unveil his monumental , 11,200-piece glass window in spring 2007 . gerhard richter has offered to craft the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184-square-foot -rrb- glass window as a gift to the city of cologne , the cathedral and its visitors .
donations will cover the production costs , which amount to some 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 447,000 -rrb- . a modern masterpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cologne cathedral attracts some 2.5 million visitors per year " the most important thing for me was to integrate this window into the cycle of historical windows , particularly as far as color goes , " schock-werner said .
richter 's window does n't prolong the existing tradition but develops it with his abstract use of color . glass squares in 80 different shades will replace a nearly transparent piece of glass that was inserted in the 1950 's after original window was destroyed during world war ii .
the plans for the damaged window , created in 1863 , had been lost so it could not be reproduced . the less-artistic interim piece needs to go because it lets too much light into the church and does n't correspond stylistically to the gothic cathedral , provost norbert feldhoff told german news source dpa . " the order of the individual colors is random , " said schock-werner , describing the all-over pattern of the squares , which measure 9.4 centimeters -lrb- 3.7 inches -rrb- on each side . the glass itself is not colored all the way through .
instead , colored pieces are attached to the outer surface of plain glass with the help of silicone . breaking a sacred art tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artist and his " abstract picture " from 1984 traditionally , church windows depicted biblical scenes .
long before computer books were printed , the panes told bible stories to illiterate parishioners by presenting them in brightly colored , larger-than-life images . however , richter 's window makes an intentional break from tradition .
it does n't render daniel in a den of lions , the flight of the egyptians , jesus ' birth , or the crucifixion .
in a sense , the church took a step of faith in abandoning a long-standing tradition and accepting a piece of art that is not explicitly religious . when asked if the window is a religious work of art , richter said , " oh , that 's hard to say .
art always has something to do with that . " even if christian motifs do n't appear in his latest glass work , crosses and other christian symbols are visible in many of his other works .
so it 's not without reason that richter received the german catholic art and culture prize two years ago . the making of an artist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richter painted milan 's gothic cathedral , which has similarities to cologne 's but is much larger this is n't the first time the internationally known artist has chosen colored glass as his medium .

31 or face the threat of sanctions .
germany and the united states applauded the measure .
but it was immediately rejected by tehran . united nations resolution 1696 expressed " serious concern " at iran 's refusal to comply with international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- orders to halt uranium enrichment and other work that could help build a nuclear bomb . the text did not include an immediate threat of sanctions , opposed by russia and china , and said punitive action would be the subject of further discussions .
but iaea director mohammed elbaradei will have to give a report on iran 's action by aug .

if iran does not suspend its nuclear work , the council would consider adopting " appropriate measures , " which could be economic and political sanctions . the resolution was passed by a 14-1 vote with qatar in opposition .

it can only exacerbate the situation , " zarif told the council .

the door to negotiations is open .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.08.2006 " our influence remains marginal " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf mützenich said a " new middle east " can not be shaped by violence condoleezza rice 's proclamation of a " new middle east " is outdated , and germany is playing a subordinate role in the middle east , rolf mützenich , a german parliamentarian and expert on the region told dw-world.de. a member of the german parliament , rolf mützenich is the disarmament spokesman for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
he is also part of the committee on foreign relations . dw-world.de : after the middle east conference in rome , crisis diplomacy was in full gear - but there is still no unified demand for a hasty end to the violence .
how would you assess the rome conference ? rolf mützenich : i had hoped for more .
however , it was good that important states and international organizations were able to agree on common terminology at the rome conference .
this can only be evaluated in the context of the g8 summit , the eu foreign minister conferences and deliberations in the un security council . therein lies the bottom line : we need a lasting cease-fire as quickly as possible .
the use of military violence must be stopped . israel sees the concluding declaration from the rome conference as a carte blanche to continue its lebanon offensive , while german foreign minister steinmeier spoke of a " great misunderstanding . "
did the international community , particularly the european union , contribute to the legitimization of this legally questionable campaign ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf mützenich is a historian and political scientist the interpretation of israel 's justice minister is completely absurd .
the legitimization of the disproportionate use of violence is not the issue here .
both sides have harmed the civilian population with military means , which finally has to stop . what we need is a stepwise process : a cease-fire for humanitarian aid and a solution to prevent further escalations in this region . political observers and middle east experts have criticized germany 's passivity since the beginning of the middle east crisis .
is the german stance breaking down unity within the eu ?
and how can the eu be a counterweight to the pro-israel position that the us is taking ? i do n't see any passivity .
other european capitals that have a colonial past in the region could be accused of passivity .
but the german foreign minister is doing quite a lot , both within the region and outside of it .
he was not only in israel , egypt and palestine , he also sent representatives to beirut , damascus and new york .
this is very active diplomacy . however , our influence remains marginal , especially as the american foreign policy is too hesitant .
i do n't at all share the american secretary of state 's perspective that a new middle east emerging .
it makes me dizzy to think that new structures should be formed by violent means .
that is a perception that belongs in the past . the then-ruling coalition between the social democrats and the greens was supported by the population in 2003 when the it rejected the iraq war as contrary to international law .
in the current conflict , the german people seem to view israel 's conduct with increasingly sharper criticism than the elite decision makers , particularly in light of civilian suffering .
is this a sign of a significant discrepancy between the political elite and the general population ? it 's not as clear-cut as you imply .
there are some differences between the two cases .
first of all , israel was actively attacked .
soldiers were abducted in gaza and on the lebanese-israeli border .
israel believes its very existence is in danger , and as the iranian president does not miss any opportunity to make anti-israeli and anti-semitic comments , it is completely understandable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mützenich said the war came just as improvement in lebanon was beginning however , israel is committing unrestrained violence against large parts of lebanon and the lebanese population that do not have anything to do with the current crisis .
the tragedy becomes even more depressing when we consider that a new lebanon with an active public society was just beginning to show itself in the past few months . of course , these are not singular events in region that has known violence for decades .
it 's bitter that - with israel 's bombardment , the abduction of the soldiers , the arrest of freely elected palestinian delegates and ministers and israel 's military campaign - the process in palestine was ended . perhaps part of the hamas would have gone down the path that fatah took - that is , recognizing israel 's right to existence and abstaining from violence .

but , several cities there are vying to be the first to produce a similar rail system . news reports that china is building its first magnetic-levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- rail system have been circulating in the media for months .
a report published this week in the newspaper china daily said the north-eastern port city dalian planned to construct the first commercial chinese-made maglev train test line this year .
" lines such as these are being built in great numbers in china , " said petra aldenrath , the china correspondent in beijing for german public radio network ard .
" they are all only short test stretches so far and the trains can not be compared to those of transrapid by the siemens-thyssenkrupp consortium . " a report in the china business daily confirmed that the german transrapid was superior to its chinese competition .
the publication compared five transrapid models developed in china . " our media mix truth and fiction .
none of the models developed in china are ready for use , " the paper quoted a chinese maglev train expert as saying . chinese technology is illusory the world 's only commercial maglev system in the world links shanghai 's financial district and its pudong airport .
instead of mechanical components such as wheels and rails , the transrapid system uses electronics : non-contact electromagnetic levitation , guidance , and propulsion systems .
with an operating speed of 430 km / h , it travels the 30-kilometer stretch in some eight minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid in shanghai only needs eight minutes for 30 kilometers the core technologies that have now been developed in china are based on a magnetic engine , which will drive the train on a three-kilometer railway to be built in the city 's development zone , said li lingqun , chief engineer of the maglev team in dalian .
this system will also be less expensive , he said . " combined with the abundant resources of permanent magnetic materials in china , our technology will be about 50 percent cheaper than that of foreign countries , " li said in the china daily . the dalian train would reach speeds of 220 kilometers per hour , li said . but the technology based on such an engine was by far not as complicated as the transrapid , said aldenrath . " it is illusory to think you can go 220 kilometers per hour on just three kilometers of tracks , " said transrapid spokesman peter wiegelmann .
" you would need rocket propulsion for that . " china wants technology in exchange for contract china is planning an extension of its shanghai connection to the city of hangzhou , 180 kilometers away . earlier this year , germany rejected china 's demands for access to sensitive maglev technology in exchange for building this $ 4.3 billion high-tech rail link .
chinese officials approved the building of the track in march .
but discussions with the companies have been going slowly as beijing is looking for significant technology transfers and funding as the price of admission . " we are optimistic that our transrapid will be employed on this stretch , " wiegelmann said . germany provided 10 percent of the $ 1 billion budget for the shanghai airport link . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china masters german train technology , will cut costs china has mastered a key part of the german technology to build high-speed magnetic levitation trains and is now aiming to cut the costs of its new line by one third , according to state press .

groom and groom or bride and bride became possible due to a new law on same-sex registered partnerships . it was actually just over five years ago that one of klaus jetz 's long-sought-after goals was realized .
after long debate and much lobbying from the organization he directs , the lesbian and gay association of germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , the german parliament passed the " registered partnership " bill , which gave gay and lesbian couples new status in the eyes of the state , one that had many of the advantages of marriage .
the law he had fought so hard for went into effect on aug .
1 , 2001 . " since the early 90s , the lsvd had fought for this , and back then , it all seemed so far off , " he said .
" then with the change of government in 1998 , the chance to make it a reality arrived . " for many long-time same-sex couples , whose daily reality had looked pretty much like a marriage , their relationships were now sanctioned by the coalition government of left-of-center social democrats and greens under gerhard schröder .
the law entitles gay and lesbian couples who registered their partnerships some of the advantages heterosexual married couples enjoy . same-sex couples can now share a last name , refuse to testify against one another in court and have same inheritance and tenants ' rights as heterosexual spouses .
a foreigner legally joined in a gay partnership to a german can apply for the right to citizenship .
partners also take on a responsibility to maintain and support the other in the case of financial difficulties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another happy couple on jan .
1 , 2005 , the law was amended , giving one partner the right to adopt the other partner 's biological child , so-called stepchild adoption .
other rights were expanded , such as the area of property rights , which moved registered partnerships closer to heterosexual marriage . but attempts to give same-sex partners the same tax and welfare benefits as those enjoyed by heterosexual couples were defeated in the conservative-dominated upper house of the german parliament . almost " normal " while it is difficult to know exactly how many same-sex couples have registered their partnerships over the five years of the law because of different recording criteria in germany 's federal states , estimates range between 14,000 and 20,000 . " in 2001 , there were many same-sex couples who knew they wanted to become registered partners and were just waiting for the ink of this law to be dry , " said ute terwedow from the civil registry office in cologne .
" that accounts for the large numbers we saw at the outset .
now the whole thing has become very normal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lsvd 's axel blumenthal , left , and green politician volker beck , signaled their optimism that the constitutional court would rule in their favor in 2002 in cologne in 2002 , 285 same-sex couples registered their partnerships - a " record year , " according to terwedow .
since then , between 170 and 180 couples have tied the knot every year .
according to a survey by the dpa news agency , gay men are saying " i do " much more often than lesbians .
in cologne , only a third of same-sex couples at the registry office are women . when " gay marriage " was under debate in germany , some talked about it being a danger to the nation 's culture fabric and there were fears that it would undermine traditional marriage .
several states led by the conservative union political parties asked the law to be reviewed by the constitutional court , in the hope it would declared unconstitutional .
it was not .
five years later , however , same-sex unions have gained a societal acceptance that exceeds even what optimists had predicted . discriminatory even though klaus jetz celebrated the law 's coming into effect five years ago , he and his partner of 11 years have chosen not to tie the knot at the registry office .
while he said the current law marks progress in the area of gay and lesbian rights , he still finds parts of it unacceptable , since a registered partnership is not the same thing as a marriage .
some have called it marriage " light , " since it has most of traditional marriage 's responsibilities , but fewer of its advantages . there are differences regarding income taxes , joint tax assessments , and inheritance taxes .
for example , it is almost impossible to inherit an apartment from a deceased partner , jetz says , because of the high inheritance taxes that would have to be paid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain legalized gay marriage in 2005 in the face of opposition from the church and conservatives heterosexual married couples , on the other hand , enjoy a tax exemption of 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 635,000 -rrb- .
same-sex couples do not .
and unlike heterosexuals , or gay couples in the neighboring netherlands , german couples will not have the right to adopt . " in germany we are still far away from complete equality for homosexual partnerships , " said volker beck , a green parliamentarian who has been a major backer of the law . the discrepancies came about because the registered partnership bill was split into two parts when it went through parliament .
the section that dealt with many of the financial aspects , such as tax law , would have had to be approved by the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
because that body was dominated by conservatives , the left-of-center government did not try to push it through , since it would have gone down to defeat . " now we need to take a new run at the partnership law to complete it , " jetz said . but he does n't want to downplay the importance of the law , calling it a paradigm change in germany , something that was almost inconceivable just 15 years ago .
he would like to see the government take up the issue again , but said the current coalition under conservative chancellor angela merkel is not likely to . " but even in the netherlands and denmark it took 10 years until lesbian and gay partnerships were made 100 percent equal to heterosexual ones , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain approves gay marriage , adoption days after the election of a staunchly conservative new pope , predominantly roman catholic spain is set to allow homosexuals to marry and adopt children .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.08.2006 german gay marriage law marks fifth anniversary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first " gay marriage " in hanover in 2001 five years ago , the bride-and-groom grouping lost its monopoly on the church aisle or the top of the wedding cake .
groom and groom or bride and bride became possible due to a new law on same-sex registered partnerships . it was actually just over five years ago that one of klaus jetz 's long-sought-after goals was realized .
after long debate and much lobbying from the organization he directs , the lesbian and gay association of germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , the german parliament passed the " registered partnership " bill , which gave gay and lesbian couples new status in the eyes of the state , one that had many of the advantages of marriage .
the law he had fought so hard for went into effect on aug .
1 , 2001 . " since the early 90s , the lsvd had fought for this , and back then , it all seemed so far off , " he said .
" then with the change of government in 1998 , the chance to make it a reality arrived . " for many long-time same-sex couples , whose daily reality had looked pretty much like a marriage , their relationships were now sanctioned by the coalition government of left-of-center social democrats and greens under gerhard schröder .
the law entitles gay and lesbian couples who registered their partnerships some of the advantages heterosexual married couples enjoy . same-sex couples can now share a last name , refuse to testify against one another in court and have same inheritance and tenants ' rights as heterosexual spouses .
a foreigner legally joined in a gay partnership to a german can apply for the right to citizenship .
partners also take on a responsibility to maintain and support the other in the case of financial difficulties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another happy couple on jan .
1 , 2005 , the law was amended , giving one partner the right to adopt the other partner 's biological child , so-called stepchild adoption .
other rights were expanded , such as the area of property rights , which moved registered partnerships closer to heterosexual marriage . but attempts to give same-sex partners the same tax and welfare benefits as those enjoyed by heterosexual couples were defeated in the conservative-dominated upper house of the german parliament . almost " normal " while it is difficult to know exactly how many same-sex couples have registered their partnerships over the five years of the law because of different recording criteria in germany 's federal states , estimates range between 14,000 and 20,000 . " in 2001 , there were many same-sex couples who knew they wanted to become registered partners and were just waiting for the ink of this law to be dry , " said ute terwedow from the civil registry office in cologne .
" that accounts for the large numbers we saw at the outset .
now the whole thing has become very normal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lsvd 's axel blumenthal , left , and green politician volker beck , signaled their optimism that the constitutional court would rule in their favor in 2002 in cologne in 2002 , 285 same-sex couples registered their partnerships - a " record year , " according to terwedow .
since then , between 170 and 180 couples have tied the knot every year .
according to a survey by the dpa news agency , gay men are saying " i do " much more often than lesbians .
in cologne , only a third of same-sex couples at the registry office are women . when " gay marriage " was under debate in germany , some talked about it being a danger to the nation 's culture fabric and there were fears that it would undermine traditional marriage .
several states led by the conservative union political parties asked the law to be reviewed by the constitutional court , in the hope it would declared unconstitutional .
it was not .
five years later , however , same-sex unions have gained a societal acceptance that exceeds even what optimists had predicted . discriminatory even though klaus jetz celebrated the law 's coming into effect five years ago , he and his partner of 11 years have chosen not to tie the knot at the registry office .
while he said the current law marks progress in the area of gay and lesbian rights , he still finds parts of it unacceptable , since a registered partnership is not the same thing as a marriage .
some have called it marriage " light , " since it has most of traditional marriage 's responsibilities , but fewer of its advantages . there are differences regarding income taxes , joint tax assessments , and inheritance taxes .
for example , it is almost impossible to inherit an apartment from a deceased partner , jetz says , because of the high inheritance taxes that would have to be paid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain legalized gay marriage in 2005 in the face of opposition from the church and conservatives heterosexual married couples , on the other hand , enjoy a tax exemption of 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 635,000 -rrb- .
same-sex couples do not .
and unlike heterosexuals , or gay couples in the neighboring netherlands , german couples will not have the right to adopt . " in germany we are still far away from complete equality for homosexual partnerships , " said volker beck , a green parliamentarian who has been a major backer of the law . the discrepancies came about because the registered partnership bill was split into two parts when it went through parliament .
the section that dealt with many of the financial aspects , such as tax law , would have had to be approved by the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
because that body was dominated by conservatives , the left-of-center government did not try to push it through , since it would have gone down to defeat . " now we need to take a new run at the partnership law to complete it , " jetz said . but he does n't want to downplay the importance of the law , calling it a paradigm change in germany , something that was almost inconceivable just 15 years ago .
he would like to see the government take up the issue again , but said the current coalition under conservative chancellor angela merkel is not likely to . " but even in the netherlands and denmark it took 10 years until lesbian and gay partnerships were made 100 percent equal to heterosexual ones , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain approves gay marriage , adoption days after the election of a staunchly conservative new pope , predominantly roman catholic spain is set to allow homosexuals to marry and adopt children .

in cologne , only a third of same-sex couples at the registry office are women . when " gay marriage " was under debate in germany , some talked about it being a danger to the nation 's culture fabric and there were fears that it would undermine traditional marriage .
several states led by the conservative union political parties asked the law to be reviewed by the constitutional court , in the hope it would declared unconstitutional .
it was not .
five years later , however , same-sex unions have gained a societal acceptance that exceeds even what optimists had predicted . discriminatory even though klaus jetz celebrated the law 's coming into effect five years ago , he and his partner of 11 years have chosen not to tie the knot at the registry office .
while he said the current law marks progress in the area of gay and lesbian rights , he still finds parts of it unacceptable , since a registered partnership is not the same thing as a marriage .
some have called it marriage " light , " since it has most of traditional marriage 's responsibilities , but fewer of its advantages . there are differences regarding income taxes , joint tax assessments , and inheritance taxes .
for example , it is almost impossible to inherit an apartment from a deceased partner , jetz says , because of the high inheritance taxes that would have to be paid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain legalized gay marriage in 2005 in the face of opposition from the church and conservatives heterosexual married couples , on the other hand , enjoy a tax exemption of 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 635,000 -rrb- .
same-sex couples do not .
and unlike heterosexuals , or gay couples in the neighboring netherlands , german couples will not have the right to adopt . " in germany we are still far away from complete equality for homosexual partnerships , " said volker beck , a green parliamentarian who has been a major backer of the law . the discrepancies came about because the registered partnership bill was split into two parts when it went through parliament .
the section that dealt with many of the financial aspects , such as tax law , would have had to be approved by the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
because that body was dominated by conservatives , the left-of-center government did not try to push it through , since it would have gone down to defeat . " now we need to take a new run at the partnership law to complete it , " jetz said . but he does n't want to downplay the importance of the law , calling it a paradigm change in germany , something that was almost inconceivable just 15 years ago .
he would like to see the government take up the issue again , but said the current coalition under conservative chancellor angela merkel is not likely to .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.08.2006 german gay marriage law marks fifth anniversary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first " gay marriage " in hanover in 2001 five years ago , the bride-and-groom grouping lost its monopoly on the church aisle or the top of the wedding cake .
groom and groom or bride and bride became possible due to a new law on same-sex registered partnerships . it was actually just over five years ago that one of klaus jetz 's long-sought-after goals was realized .
after long debate and much lobbying from the organization he directs , the lesbian and gay association of germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , the german parliament passed the " registered partnership " bill , which gave gay and lesbian couples new status in the eyes of the state , one that had many of the advantages of marriage .
the law he had fought so hard for went into effect on aug .
1 , 2001 . " since the early 90s , the lsvd had fought for this , and back then , it all seemed so far off , " he said .
" then with the change of government in 1998 , the chance to make it a reality arrived . " for many long-time same-sex couples , whose daily reality had looked pretty much like a marriage , their relationships were now sanctioned by the coalition government of left-of-center social democrats and greens under gerhard schröder .
the law entitles gay and lesbian couples who registered their partnerships some of the advantages heterosexual married couples enjoy . same-sex couples can now share a last name , refuse to testify against one another in court and have same inheritance and tenants ' rights as heterosexual spouses .
a foreigner legally joined in a gay partnership to a german can apply for the right to citizenship .
partners also take on a responsibility to maintain and support the other in the case of financial difficulties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another happy couple on jan .
1 , 2005 , the law was amended , giving one partner the right to adopt the other partner 's biological child , so-called stepchild adoption .
other rights were expanded , such as the area of property rights , which moved registered partnerships closer to heterosexual marriage . but attempts to give same-sex partners the same tax and welfare benefits as those enjoyed by heterosexual couples were defeated in the conservative-dominated upper house of the german parliament . almost " normal " while it is difficult to know exactly how many same-sex couples have registered their partnerships over the five years of the law because of different recording criteria in germany 's federal states , estimates range between 14,000 and 20,000 . " in 2001 , there were many same-sex couples who knew they wanted to become registered partners and were just waiting for the ink of this law to be dry , " said ute terwedow from the civil registry office in cologne .
" that accounts for the large numbers we saw at the outset .
now the whole thing has become very normal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lsvd 's axel blumenthal , left , and green politician volker beck , signaled their optimism that the constitutional court would rule in their favor in 2002 in cologne in 2002 , 285 same-sex couples registered their partnerships - a " record year , " according to terwedow .
since then , between 170 and 180 couples have tied the knot every year .
according to a survey by the dpa news agency , gay men are saying " i do " much more often than lesbians .
in cologne , only a third of same-sex couples at the registry office are women . when " gay marriage " was under debate in germany , some talked about it being a danger to the nation 's culture fabric and there were fears that it would undermine traditional marriage .

he is also part of the committee on foreign relations . dw-world.de : after the middle east conference in rome , crisis diplomacy was in full gear - but there is still no unified demand for a hasty end to the violence .
how would you assess the rome conference ? rolf mützenich : i had hoped for more .
however , it was good that important states and international organizations were able to agree on common terminology at the rome conference .
this can only be evaluated in the context of the g8 summit , the eu foreign minister conferences and deliberations in the un security council . therein lies the bottom line : we need a lasting cease-fire as quickly as possible .
the use of military violence must be stopped . israel sees the concluding declaration from the rome conference as a carte blanche to continue its lebanon offensive , while german foreign minister steinmeier spoke of a " great misunderstanding . "
did the international community , particularly the european union , contribute to the legitimization of this legally questionable campaign ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf mützenich is a historian and political scientist the interpretation of israel 's justice minister is completely absurd .
the legitimization of the disproportionate use of violence is not the issue here .
both sides have harmed the civilian population with military means , which finally has to stop . what we need is a stepwise process : a cease-fire for humanitarian aid and a solution to prevent further escalations in this region . political observers and middle east experts have criticized germany 's passivity since the beginning of the middle east crisis .
is the german stance breaking down unity within the eu ?
and how can the eu be a counterweight to the pro-israel position that the us is taking ? i do n't see any passivity .
other european capitals that have a colonial past in the region could be accused of passivity .
but the german foreign minister is doing quite a lot , both within the region and outside of it .
he was not only in israel , egypt and palestine , he also sent representatives to beirut , damascus and new york .
this is very active diplomacy . however , our influence remains marginal , especially as the american foreign policy is too hesitant .
i do n't at all share the american secretary of state 's perspective that a new middle east emerging .
it makes me dizzy to think that new structures should be formed by violent means .
that is a perception that belongs in the past . the then-ruling coalition between the social democrats and the greens was supported by the population in 2003 when the it rejected the iraq war as contrary to international law .
in the current conflict , the german people seem to view israel 's conduct with increasingly sharper criticism than the elite decision makers , particularly in light of civilian suffering .
is this a sign of a significant discrepancy between the political elite and the general population ? it 's not as clear-cut as you imply .
there are some differences between the two cases .
first of all , israel was actively attacked .
soldiers were abducted in gaza and on the lebanese-israeli border .
israel believes its very existence is in danger , and as the iranian president does not miss any opportunity to make anti-israeli and anti-semitic comments , it is completely understandable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mützenich said the war came just as improvement in lebanon was beginning however , israel is committing unrestrained violence against large parts of lebanon and the lebanese population that do not have anything to do with the current crisis .
the tragedy becomes even more depressing when we consider that a new lebanon with an active public society was just beginning to show itself in the past few months . of course , these are not singular events in region that has known violence for decades .
it 's bitter that - with israel 's bombardment , the abduction of the soldiers , the arrest of freely elected palestinian delegates and ministers and israel 's military campaign - the process in palestine was ended . perhaps part of the hamas would have gone down the path that fatah took - that is , recognizing israel 's right to existence and abstaining from violence .
the prisoners ' paper opened a new window for peace a few weeks ago .
but extremists did n't want this solution .
even groups in israel were n't happy to see this kind of solution to the negotiations . loay mudhoon interviewed rolf mützenich -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click on the links to read dw-world.de 's compilation of articles on the conflict and the search for peace .
israel suspends air strikes for 48-hours but says war goes on israel has finally agreed to a limited ceasefire in lebanon with a 48-hour suspension of air strikes but israeli justice minister haim ramon said it did n't mean that the jewish state was ending its war against hezbollah .
-lrb- july 31 , 2006 -rrb- german government criticized for stance on lebanese refugees after germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble said it would be " premature " and " misguided " for germany to take in lebanese refugees , opposition politicians and humanitarian organizations responded with anger .

" i am not coming back , " joschka fischer said at the end of june , brushing aside suggestions he could return to fight another day for germany 's green party .
" the door is closed ; the key has been turned and thrown away . " the new professor of international economic policy at princeton university 's woodrow wilson school of public and international affairs may have meant every word he said when stepping down from government to concentrate on his new teaching position in the united states .
but in the space of almost a month , the former german foreign minister 's expertise in the middle east has become a more valuable commodity ; one which some wish to use again . the war in lebanon and the rapidly disintegrating relationship between the west and iran over the islamic republic 's nuclear ambitions have turned up the heat in the pressure cooker region , with diplomats from all nations struggling to find viable solutions to the problems in the middle east . a respected middle east expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer with the late palestinian leader yasser arafat some believe fischer , as an expert on the middle east who won the confidence of both jews and palestinians during his seven years as foreign minister , could prove to be an important player again in any negotiations - be it in an official or unofficial capacity . and while no official offer has been made for him to join germany 's efforts in ending the israel-hezbollah conflict or the nuclear stand-off with iran , fischer has been touted as a possible mediator in both crises , either as a german or european union representative . " as a proven international politician , respected both in israel and palestine , joschka fischer would be ideally placed to play a mediating role , as an eu envoy , aimed at negotiating a ceasefire -lrb- in lebanon -rrb- , " leading green meps daniel cohn-bendit from germany and italian monica frassoni said in a statement .
the german government and fischer himself have not responded to calls for such involvement in either the lebanon or iran crises .
however , fischer started a four-day visit to iran on monday where he will take part in a round table debate organized by tehran 's center for strategic studies after being invited by hassan rohani , iran 's former chief negotiator on its nuclear program . invitation shows fischer 's standing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rohani and fischer have a mutual respect although the private visit had been organized for some time , his inclusion in the debate shows that his regular visits to iran and the middle east during his tenure as germany 's top diplomat built many important working relationships and earned him respect in the region . and as the united nations security council prepares to set tehran a deadline for the suspension of its uranium enrichment program with sanctions seemingly unavoidable given iran 's belligerent stance , a man such as fischer who the iranians can trust could pave the way for talks to reopen .
he himself believes that negotiation with iran is the only way to secure a peaceful resolution to this and the wider problems in the region . " if an understanding can be found with tehran about its nuclear program and uranium enrichment , the situation in the middle east will change , " he recently told die zeit newspaper .
" if not , we are heading for an enormous crisis with unforeseeable consequences . " taking a different line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer at the un as for lebanon , fischer has already voiced his opinions and they differ from the current line of thinking .
while many diplomats believe a un force in lebanon is the way forward , fischer has said it would make " little sense " to deploy a larger un contingent to stabilize the country . " another blue-helmet mandate will make little sense , " fischer said .
" only a robust force with a robust mandate could perhaps achieve something positive .
but the risks are enormous .
i think it is far more important to put political pressure on the radicals and to commit ourselves to new peace negotiations . " fischer said the violence had been " orchestrated by foreign leaders of hamas as part of their struggle with the moderate elements in the movement . "
but iran and syria also had a hand in events , he added . he also accused the west , russia and the united nations of neglecting the middle east peace process . " never before has the west , the us , neglected this volatile conflict so dangerously , never before has the so-called middle east quartet , namely the us , the eu , the un and russia , shown so little commitment , " he said .
" this is a tragedy . " fischer 's supporters have urged the international community to " think outside the box " to solve the middle east crisis .
dispatching a former left-wing radical , self-styled rock 'n'roll politician and ex-german foreign minister to the region may be a viable alternative to the current efforts to secure peace . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de middle east cease-fire and un deployment on eu crisis agenda european union foreign ministers will hold a crisis meeting tuesday on the middle east , seeking to exploit a window of opportunity presented by israel 's 48-hour suspension of air strikes to push for a full cease-fire .

" only a robust force with a robust mandate could perhaps achieve something positive .
but the risks are enormous .
i think it is far more important to put political pressure on the radicals and to commit ourselves to new peace negotiations . " fischer said the violence had been " orchestrated by foreign leaders of hamas as part of their struggle with the moderate elements in the movement . "

however , fischer started a four-day visit to iran on monday where he will take part in a round table debate organized by tehran 's center for strategic studies after being invited by hassan rohani , iran 's former chief negotiator on its nuclear program . invitation shows fischer 's standing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rohani and fischer have a mutual respect although the private visit had been organized for some time , his inclusion in the debate shows that his regular visits to iran and the middle east during his tenure as germany 's top diplomat built many important working relationships and earned him respect in the region . and as the united nations security council prepares to set tehran a deadline for the suspension of its uranium enrichment program with sanctions seemingly unavoidable given iran 's belligerent stance , a man such as fischer who the iranians can trust could pave the way for talks to reopen .
he himself believes that negotiation with iran is the only way to secure a peaceful resolution to this and the wider problems in the region . " if an understanding can be found with tehran about its nuclear program and uranium enrichment , the situation in the middle east will change , " he recently told die zeit newspaper .
" if not , we are heading for an enormous crisis with unforeseeable consequences . " taking a different line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer at the un as for lebanon , fischer has already voiced his opinions and they differ from the current line of thinking .
while many diplomats believe a un force in lebanon is the way forward , fischer has said it would make " little sense " to deploy a larger un contingent to stabilize the country . " another blue-helmet mandate will make little sense , " fischer said .
" only a robust force with a robust mandate could perhaps achieve something positive .
but the risks are enormous .
i think it is far more important to put political pressure on the radicals and to commit ourselves to new peace negotiations . " fischer said the violence had been " orchestrated by foreign leaders of hamas as part of their struggle with the moderate elements in the movement . "
but iran and syria also had a hand in events , he added . he also accused the west , russia and the united nations of neglecting the middle east peace process . " never before has the west , the us , neglected this volatile conflict so dangerously , never before has the so-called middle east quartet , namely the us , the eu , the un and russia , shown so little commitment , " he said .
" this is a tragedy . " fischer 's supporters have urged the international community to " think outside the box " to solve the middle east crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.08.2006 former eastern bloc clergy grapple with communist legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish catholics did n't want to believe priests collaborated with the communists after east germany , hungary and the czech republic , poland is the latest country from the former eastern european bloc to confront revelations that some of its clergy collaborated with communists . poland is a country in which church pews are still overflowing , where millions turned out to mourn pope john paul ii 's death last year and one in which government ministers have repeatedly called for " morality " in schools and reference to god in the eu constitution . when revelations first surfaced that some members of poland 's catholic clergy collaborated with the communist dictatorship , most in the staunchly catholic country did n't want to believe them .
then the first high-ranking priest admitted he was involved . at first , michal czajkowski , a leading church figure known for his work on catholic-jewish relations , rejected the accusations made against him .
but in july , he admitted to spying on his colleagues for 24 years , beginning in 1960 .
soon after , he quit as co-chairman of the polish christian-jewish council . church collaboration hits poland especially hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czajkowski is known for his work on catholic-jewish relations " i want to apologize and ask for forgiveness , especially for those whom i have hurt - i displayed a weakness of character , " czajkowski wrote in a statement printed by polish newspapers .
" i have already expressed my regret toward god .
now i am doing it toward people . " in other former communist countries still grappling with their past , such admissions may be surprising .
but they do n't have the power to shock as in poland , where during four decades of communist rule , the church remained stronger than anywhere else in the bloc and was seen as the focal point to passive resistance and opposition to the regime . in the former communist czechoslovakia , for example , the church played a smaller role in society , and even today , the czechs are among the least devout nations in europe .
in hungary , the catholic church has also admitted that dozens of its priests spied on their colleagues without raising the same level of public shock seen in poland . germany still investigating its own past like other states behind the iron curtain , the churches in the former east germany have had to deal with allegations that their clergy , especially in the protestant church , appeased or supported communist officials . michael zöller , a professor of sociology and religion at the university of bayreuth said collaboration with the communists was more prevalent in the protestant church in the former east germany . " the catholic church was more protected because the gdr wanted to be on good terms with the vatican , " zöller said .
" protestants were more forced to cooperate , especially to be able to get some leeway in their activities . " some clergy members thought of it as a progressive alliance because there was an affinity between church doctrine and socialism - it even attracted clergy from west germany , such as angela merkel 's father , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stolpe has been accused of collaborating with the communists in germany , the opening of the east german secret police , or stasi , archives brought up a number of allegations against east german church officials most famously , former brandenburg premier manfred stolpe , who also served as germany 's minister of transportation , building and housing until 2005 .
stolpe was a high-ranking official of the gdr 's evangelical church and has denied the charges . zöller said he believes that issues of collaboration among the clergy will continue to come up , as historians continue to pore through the stasi files . " officials are still processing documents , " he said .
" who knows yet what information they contain . " over 10 percent of polish priests collaborated polish priest czajkowski was a willing spy , according to the warsaw-based national remembrance institute , which manages communist archives and investigates crimes of that era .
the institute said he reported on the church 's and clergy 's pro-democracy activities and only stopped after regime agents murdered the chaplain of the solidarity trade union , jerzy popieluszko , whom czajkowski is accused of spying on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands in poland mourned pope john paul ii 's death poland 's catholic church , including former pope john paul ii , is widely credited with the rise of solidarity , the movement that brought down the communists and took control of poland in 1989 .
even though the church openly supported the group , the national remembrance institute said about 10 percent to 15 percent of the clergy collaborated with the communists . until recently , the church has refused to cooperate with investigations or provide names regarding collaborators among the clergy .
however , last year after similar allegations against an aide to pope john paul ii , konrad hejmo , surfaced , and the church suspended him .
hejmo denied the charges , which include spying on the late pope . coming to terms with the past now the catholic church in poland is working at coming to terms with its role in communist times .
earlier this year , church officials said they would begin investigating members of the clergy for collaborating with the communists .
soon after , the polish conference of catholic bishops issued an official apology to the public . " priests and others linked with the church who collaborated with the security services of the communist state cast a shadow on the catholic church 's heroic history under communist rule , " the bishops wrote , adding that an initiative to make public its complete list of collaborators is moving forward . the actions of a few priests also should not diminish the church 's role in promoting democracy , according to wojtek muszynski of the national remembrance institute . " the polish catholic church was still a hero , " he said .
" no matter how hard the secret service tried , they did n't break down 85 to 90 percent of the priests .

then the first high-ranking priest admitted he was involved . at first , michal czajkowski , a leading church figure known for his work on catholic-jewish relations , rejected the accusations made against him .
but in july , he admitted to spying on his colleagues for 24 years , beginning in 1960 .
soon after , he quit as co-chairman of the polish christian-jewish council . church collaboration hits poland especially hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czajkowski is known for his work on catholic-jewish relations " i want to apologize and ask for forgiveness , especially for those whom i have hurt - i displayed a weakness of character , " czajkowski wrote in a statement printed by polish newspapers .
" i have already expressed my regret toward god .
now i am doing it toward people . " in other former communist countries still grappling with their past , such admissions may be surprising .
but they do n't have the power to shock as in poland , where during four decades of communist rule , the church remained stronger than anywhere else in the bloc and was seen as the focal point to passive resistance and opposition to the regime . in the former communist czechoslovakia , for example , the church played a smaller role in society , and even today , the czechs are among the least devout nations in europe .
in hungary , the catholic church has also admitted that dozens of its priests spied on their colleagues without raising the same level of public shock seen in poland . germany still investigating its own past like other states behind the iron curtain , the churches in the former east germany have had to deal with allegations that their clergy , especially in the protestant church , appeased or supported communist officials . michael zöller , a professor of sociology and religion at the university of bayreuth said collaboration with the communists was more prevalent in the protestant church in the former east germany . " the catholic church was more protected because the gdr wanted to be on good terms with the vatican , " zöller said .
" protestants were more forced to cooperate , especially to be able to get some leeway in their activities . " some clergy members thought of it as a progressive alliance because there was an affinity between church doctrine and socialism - it even attracted clergy from west germany , such as angela merkel 's father , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stolpe has been accused of collaborating with the communists in germany , the opening of the east german secret police , or stasi , archives brought up a number of allegations against east german church officials most famously , former brandenburg premier manfred stolpe , who also served as germany 's minister of transportation , building and housing until 2005 .
stolpe was a high-ranking official of the gdr 's evangelical church and has denied the charges . zöller said he believes that issues of collaboration among the clergy will continue to come up , as historians continue to pore through the stasi files . " officials are still processing documents , " he said .
" who knows yet what information they contain . " over 10 percent of polish priests collaborated polish priest czajkowski was a willing spy , according to the warsaw-based national remembrance institute , which manages communist archives and investigates crimes of that era .
the institute said he reported on the church 's and clergy 's pro-democracy activities and only stopped after regime agents murdered the chaplain of the solidarity trade union , jerzy popieluszko , whom czajkowski is accused of spying on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands in poland mourned pope john paul ii 's death poland 's catholic church , including former pope john paul ii , is widely credited with the rise of solidarity , the movement that brought down the communists and took control of poland in 1989 .
even though the church openly supported the group , the national remembrance institute said about 10 percent to 15 percent of the clergy collaborated with the communists . until recently , the church has refused to cooperate with investigations or provide names regarding collaborators among the clergy .
however , last year after similar allegations against an aide to pope john paul ii , konrad hejmo , surfaced , and the church suspended him .
hejmo denied the charges , which include spying on the late pope . coming to terms with the past now the catholic church in poland is working at coming to terms with its role in communist times .
earlier this year , church officials said they would begin investigating members of the clergy for collaborating with the communists .
soon after , the polish conference of catholic bishops issued an official apology to the public . " priests and others linked with the church who collaborated with the security services of the communist state cast a shadow on the catholic church 's heroic history under communist rule , " the bishops wrote , adding that an initiative to make public its complete list of collaborators is moving forward . the actions of a few priests also should not diminish the church 's role in promoting democracy , according to wojtek muszynski of the national remembrance institute .

then the first high-ranking priest admitted he was involved . at first , michal czajkowski , a leading church figure known for his work on catholic-jewish relations , rejected the accusations made against him .
but in july , he admitted to spying on his colleagues for 24 years , beginning in 1960 .
soon after , he quit as co-chairman of the polish christian-jewish council . church collaboration hits poland especially hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czajkowski is known for his work on catholic-jewish relations " i want to apologize and ask for forgiveness , especially for those whom i have hurt - i displayed a weakness of character , " czajkowski wrote in a statement printed by polish newspapers .
" i have already expressed my regret toward god .
now i am doing it toward people . " in other former communist countries still grappling with their past , such admissions may be surprising .
but they do n't have the power to shock as in poland , where during four decades of communist rule , the church remained stronger than anywhere else in the bloc and was seen as the focal point to passive resistance and opposition to the regime . in the former communist czechoslovakia , for example , the church played a smaller role in society , and even today , the czechs are among the least devout nations in europe .
in hungary , the catholic church has also admitted that dozens of its priests spied on their colleagues without raising the same level of public shock seen in poland . germany still investigating its own past like other states behind the iron curtain , the churches in the former east germany have had to deal with allegations that their clergy , especially in the protestant church , appeased or supported communist officials . michael zöller , a professor of sociology and religion at the university of bayreuth said collaboration with the communists was more prevalent in the protestant church in the former east germany . " the catholic church was more protected because the gdr wanted to be on good terms with the vatican , " zöller said .
" protestants were more forced to cooperate , especially to be able to get some leeway in their activities . " some clergy members thought of it as a progressive alliance because there was an affinity between church doctrine and socialism - it even attracted clergy from west germany , such as angela merkel 's father , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stolpe has been accused of collaborating with the communists in germany , the opening of the east german secret police , or stasi , archives brought up a number of allegations against east german church officials most famously , former brandenburg premier manfred stolpe , who also served as germany 's minister of transportation , building and housing until 2005 .
stolpe was a high-ranking official of the gdr 's evangelical church and has denied the charges . zöller said he believes that issues of collaboration among the clergy will continue to come up , as historians continue to pore through the stasi files . " officials are still processing documents , " he said .
" who knows yet what information they contain . " over 10 percent of polish priests collaborated polish priest czajkowski was a willing spy , according to the warsaw-based national remembrance institute , which manages communist archives and investigates crimes of that era .
the institute said he reported on the church 's and clergy 's pro-democracy activities and only stopped after regime agents murdered the chaplain of the solidarity trade union , jerzy popieluszko , whom czajkowski is accused of spying on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands in poland mourned pope john paul ii 's death poland 's catholic church , including former pope john paul ii , is widely credited with the rise of solidarity , the movement that brought down the communists and took control of poland in 1989 .
even though the church openly supported the group , the national remembrance institute said about 10 percent to 15 percent of the clergy collaborated with the communists . until recently , the church has refused to cooperate with investigations or provide names regarding collaborators among the clergy .
however , last year after similar allegations against an aide to pope john paul ii , konrad hejmo , surfaced , and the church suspended him .
hejmo denied the charges , which include spying on the late pope . coming to terms with the past now the catholic church in poland is working at coming to terms with its role in communist times .
earlier this year , church officials said they would begin investigating members of the clergy for collaborating with the communists .
soon after , the polish conference of catholic bishops issued an official apology to the public . " priests and others linked with the church who collaborated with the security services of the communist state cast a shadow on the catholic church 's heroic history under communist rule , " the bishops wrote , adding that an initiative to make public its complete list of collaborators is moving forward . the actions of a few priests also should not diminish the church 's role in promoting democracy , according to wojtek muszynski of the national remembrance institute . " the polish catholic church was still a hero , " he said .
" no matter how hard the secret service tried , they did n't break down 85 to 90 percent of the priests .

gerhard richter 's current project is a modern 11,200-piece stained glass window for cologne 's gothic cathedral . the cologne cathedral 's new stained glass window by acclaimed german artist gerhard richter ca n't be overlooked , not only because of its immense size and conspicuous location but also because of its non-traditional approach . " the window will be a significant contribution of modern art to the cologne cathedral , " said barbara schock-werner , the cathedral 's master builder . gerhard richter is considered one of the most significant painters of our time .
his works adorn museum walls around the world and collectors drop millions to snap up his canvases .
the 74-year cologne-based artist is planning to unveil his monumental , 11,200-piece glass window in spring 2007 . gerhard richter has offered to craft the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184-square-foot -rrb- glass window as a gift to the city of cologne , the cathedral and its visitors .
donations will cover the production costs , which amount to some 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 447,000 -rrb- . a modern masterpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cologne cathedral attracts some 2.5 million visitors per year " the most important thing for me was to integrate this window into the cycle of historical windows , particularly as far as color goes , " schock-werner said .
richter 's window does n't prolong the existing tradition but develops it with his abstract use of color . glass squares in 80 different shades will replace a nearly transparent piece of glass that was inserted in the 1950 's after original window was destroyed during world war ii .
the plans for the damaged window , created in 1863 , had been lost so it could not be reproduced . the less-artistic interim piece needs to go because it lets too much light into the church and does n't correspond stylistically to the gothic cathedral , provost norbert feldhoff told german news source dpa . " the order of the individual colors is random , " said schock-werner , describing the all-over pattern of the squares , which measure 9.4 centimeters -lrb- 3.7 inches -rrb- on each side . the glass itself is not colored all the way through .
instead , colored pieces are attached to the outer surface of plain glass with the help of silicone . breaking a sacred art tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artist and his " abstract picture " from 1984 traditionally , church windows depicted biblical scenes .
long before computer books were printed , the panes told bible stories to illiterate parishioners by presenting them in brightly colored , larger-than-life images . however , richter 's window makes an intentional break from tradition .
it does n't render daniel in a den of lions , the flight of the egyptians , jesus ' birth , or the crucifixion .
in a sense , the church took a step of faith in abandoning a long-standing tradition and accepting a piece of art that is not explicitly religious . when asked if the window is a religious work of art , richter said , " oh , that 's hard to say .
art always has something to do with that . " even if christian motifs do n't appear in his latest glass work , crosses and other christian symbols are visible in many of his other works .
so it 's not without reason that richter received the german catholic art and culture prize two years ago . the making of an artist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richter painted milan 's gothic cathedral , which has similarities to cologne 's but is much larger this is n't the first time the internationally known artist has chosen colored glass as his medium .
in 1991 , for example , he created artistic accents for the hypobank in düsseldorf , which was designed by cologne architect oswald mathias ungers . richter became well known in the 1960s for modeling his paintings on photographs while using indistinct lines .
his works , which span a career of over 40 years , are stylistically diverse , as new york 's museum of modern art showed in 2002 .

gerhard richter 's current project is a modern 11,200-piece stained glass window for cologne 's gothic cathedral . the cologne cathedral 's new stained glass window by acclaimed german artist gerhard richter ca n't be overlooked , not only because of its immense size and conspicuous location but also because of its non-traditional approach . " the window will be a significant contribution of modern art to the cologne cathedral , " said barbara schock-werner , the cathedral 's master builder . gerhard richter is considered one of the most significant painters of our time .
his works adorn museum walls around the world and collectors drop millions to snap up his canvases .
the 74-year cologne-based artist is planning to unveil his monumental , 11,200-piece glass window in spring 2007 . gerhard richter has offered to craft the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184-square-foot -rrb- glass window as a gift to the city of cologne , the cathedral and its visitors .
donations will cover the production costs , which amount to some 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 447,000 -rrb- . a modern masterpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cologne cathedral attracts some 2.5 million visitors per year " the most important thing for me was to integrate this window into the cycle of historical windows , particularly as far as color goes , " schock-werner said .
richter 's window does n't prolong the existing tradition but develops it with his abstract use of color . glass squares in 80 different shades will replace a nearly transparent piece of glass that was inserted in the 1950 's after original window was destroyed during world war ii .
the plans for the damaged window , created in 1863 , had been lost so it could not be reproduced . the less-artistic interim piece needs to go because it lets too much light into the church and does n't correspond stylistically to the gothic cathedral , provost norbert feldhoff told german news source dpa . " the order of the individual colors is random , " said schock-werner , describing the all-over pattern of the squares , which measure 9.4 centimeters -lrb- 3.7 inches -rrb- on each side . the glass itself is not colored all the way through .
instead , colored pieces are attached to the outer surface of plain glass with the help of silicone . breaking a sacred art tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artist and his " abstract picture " from 1984 traditionally , church windows depicted biblical scenes .
long before computer books were printed , the panes told bible stories to illiterate parishioners by presenting them in brightly colored , larger-than-life images . however , richter 's window makes an intentional break from tradition .
it does n't render daniel in a den of lions , the flight of the egyptians , jesus ' birth , or the crucifixion .
in a sense , the church took a step of faith in abandoning a long-standing tradition and accepting a piece of art that is not explicitly religious . when asked if the window is a religious work of art , richter said , " oh , that 's hard to say .
art always has something to do with that . " even if christian motifs do n't appear in his latest glass work , crosses and other christian symbols are visible in many of his other works .
so it 's not without reason that richter received the german catholic art and culture prize two years ago . the making of an artist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richter painted milan 's gothic cathedral , which has similarities to cologne 's but is much larger this is n't the first time the internationally known artist has chosen colored glass as his medium .
in 1991 , for example , he created artistic accents for the hypobank in düsseldorf , which was designed by cologne architect oswald mathias ungers . richter became well known in the 1960s for modeling his paintings on photographs while using indistinct lines .
his works , which span a career of over 40 years , are stylistically diverse , as new york 's museum of modern art showed in 2002 .

he is also part of the committee on foreign relations . dw-world.de : after the middle east conference in rome , crisis diplomacy was in full gear - but there is still no unified demand for a hasty end to the violence .
how would you assess the rome conference ? rolf mützenich : i had hoped for more .
however , it was good that important states and international organizations were able to agree on common terminology at the rome conference .
this can only be evaluated in the context of the g8 summit , the eu foreign minister conferences and deliberations in the un security council . therein lies the bottom line : we need a lasting cease-fire as quickly as possible .
the use of military violence must be stopped . israel sees the concluding declaration from the rome conference as a carte blanche to continue its lebanon offensive , while german foreign minister steinmeier spoke of a " great misunderstanding . "
did the international community , particularly the european union , contribute to the legitimization of this legally questionable campaign ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf mützenich is a historian and political scientist the interpretation of israel 's justice minister is completely absurd .
the legitimization of the disproportionate use of violence is not the issue here .
both sides have harmed the civilian population with military means , which finally has to stop . what we need is a stepwise process : a cease-fire for humanitarian aid and a solution to prevent further escalations in this region . political observers and middle east experts have criticized germany 's passivity since the beginning of the middle east crisis .
is the german stance breaking down unity within the eu ?
and how can the eu be a counterweight to the pro-israel position that the us is taking ? i do n't see any passivity .
other european capitals that have a colonial past in the region could be accused of passivity .
but the german foreign minister is doing quite a lot , both within the region and outside of it .
he was not only in israel , egypt and palestine , he also sent representatives to beirut , damascus and new york .
this is very active diplomacy . however , our influence remains marginal , especially as the american foreign policy is too hesitant .
i do n't at all share the american secretary of state 's perspective that a new middle east emerging .
it makes me dizzy to think that new structures should be formed by violent means .
that is a perception that belongs in the past . the then-ruling coalition between the social democrats and the greens was supported by the population in 2003 when the it rejected the iraq war as contrary to international law .
in the current conflict , the german people seem to view israel 's conduct with increasingly sharper criticism than the elite decision makers , particularly in light of civilian suffering .
is this a sign of a significant discrepancy between the political elite and the general population ? it 's not as clear-cut as you imply .
there are some differences between the two cases .
first of all , israel was actively attacked .
soldiers were abducted in gaza and on the lebanese-israeli border .
israel believes its very existence is in danger , and as the iranian president does not miss any opportunity to make anti-israeli and anti-semitic comments , it is completely understandable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mützenich said the war came just as improvement in lebanon was beginning however , israel is committing unrestrained violence against large parts of lebanon and the lebanese population that do not have anything to do with the current crisis .
the tragedy becomes even more depressing when we consider that a new lebanon with an active public society was just beginning to show itself in the past few months . of course , these are not singular events in region that has known violence for decades .
it 's bitter that - with israel 's bombardment , the abduction of the soldiers , the arrest of freely elected palestinian delegates and ministers and israel 's military campaign - the process in palestine was ended . perhaps part of the hamas would have gone down the path that fatah took - that is , recognizing israel 's right to existence and abstaining from violence .
the prisoners ' paper opened a new window for peace a few weeks ago .
but extremists did n't want this solution .
even groups in israel were n't happy to see this kind of solution to the negotiations . loay mudhoon interviewed rolf mützenich -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click on the links to read dw-world.de 's compilation of articles on the conflict and the search for peace .
israel suspends air strikes for 48-hours but says war goes on israel has finally agreed to a limited ceasefire in lebanon with a 48-hour suspension of air strikes but israeli justice minister haim ramon said it did n't mean that the jewish state was ending its war against hezbollah .
-lrb- july 31 , 2006 -rrb- german government criticized for stance on lebanese refugees after germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble said it would be " premature " and " misguided " for germany to take in lebanese refugees , opposition politicians and humanitarian organizations responded with anger .

gerhard richter 's current project is a modern 11,200-piece stained glass window for cologne 's gothic cathedral . the cologne cathedral 's new stained glass window by acclaimed german artist gerhard richter ca n't be overlooked , not only because of its immense size and conspicuous location but also because of its non-traditional approach . " the window will be a significant contribution of modern art to the cologne cathedral , " said barbara schock-werner , the cathedral 's master builder . gerhard richter is considered one of the most significant painters of our time .
his works adorn museum walls around the world and collectors drop millions to snap up his canvases .
the 74-year cologne-based artist is planning to unveil his monumental , 11,200-piece glass window in spring 2007 . gerhard richter has offered to craft the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184-square-foot -rrb- glass window as a gift to the city of cologne , the cathedral and its visitors .
donations will cover the production costs , which amount to some 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 447,000 -rrb- . a modern masterpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cologne cathedral attracts some 2.5 million visitors per year " the most important thing for me was to integrate this window into the cycle of historical windows , particularly as far as color goes , " schock-werner said .
richter 's window does n't prolong the existing tradition but develops it with his abstract use of color . glass squares in 80 different shades will replace a nearly transparent piece of glass that was inserted in the 1950 's after original window was destroyed during world war ii .
the plans for the damaged window , created in 1863 , had been lost so it could not be reproduced . the less-artistic interim piece needs to go because it lets too much light into the church and does n't correspond stylistically to the gothic cathedral , provost norbert feldhoff told german news source dpa . " the order of the individual colors is random , " said schock-werner , describing the all-over pattern of the squares , which measure 9.4 centimeters -lrb- 3.7 inches -rrb- on each side . the glass itself is not colored all the way through .
instead , colored pieces are attached to the outer surface of plain glass with the help of silicone . breaking a sacred art tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artist and his " abstract picture " from 1984 traditionally , church windows depicted biblical scenes .
long before computer books were printed , the panes told bible stories to illiterate parishioners by presenting them in brightly colored , larger-than-life images . however , richter 's window makes an intentional break from tradition .
it does n't render daniel in a den of lions , the flight of the egyptians , jesus ' birth , or the crucifixion .
in a sense , the church took a step of faith in abandoning a long-standing tradition and accepting a piece of art that is not explicitly religious . when asked if the window is a religious work of art , richter said , " oh , that 's hard to say .
art always has something to do with that . " even if christian motifs do n't appear in his latest glass work , crosses and other christian symbols are visible in many of his other works .
so it 's not without reason that richter received the german catholic art and culture prize two years ago . the making of an artist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richter painted milan 's gothic cathedral , which has similarities to cologne 's but is much larger this is n't the first time the internationally known artist has chosen colored glass as his medium .
in 1991 , for example , he created artistic accents for the hypobank in düsseldorf , which was designed by cologne architect oswald mathias ungers . richter became well known in the 1960s for modeling his paintings on photographs while using indistinct lines .
his works , which span a career of over 40 years , are stylistically diverse , as new york 's museum of modern art showed in 2002 .

31 or face the threat of sanctions .
germany and the united states applauded the measure .
but it was immediately rejected by tehran . united nations resolution 1696 expressed " serious concern " at iran 's refusal to comply with international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- orders to halt uranium enrichment and other work that could help build a nuclear bomb . the text did not include an immediate threat of sanctions , opposed by russia and china , and said punitive action would be the subject of further discussions .
but iaea director mohammed elbaradei will have to give a report on iran 's action by aug .
31 .
if iran does not suspend its nuclear work , the council would consider adopting " appropriate measures , " which could be economic and political sanctions . the resolution was passed by a 14-1 vote with qatar in opposition .
it was welcomed by the united states and its allies , but iran 's un ambassador javad zarif said it was " destructive and totally unwarranted " in a long speech to the council . " i would suggest to you that this approach will not lead to any productive outcome .
it can only exacerbate the situation , " zarif told the council .
he said iran was only ready for " serious and non-discriminatory " negotiations . " the door to negotiations is open . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the international community was setting a firm sign of its unity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un hopes diplomacy can still solve the iran conflict " it 's up to iran now to fulfil these binding demands of the international community and dispel the existing doubts about the peaceful nature of its nuclear program , " steinmeier said in a statement on monday .
" iran has the choice .
the door to negotiations is open . " us secretary of state condoleezza rice said the resolution 's wording meant iran still had time to cooperate with world powers on its nuclear program and avoid an all-out confrontation . " i want to be very clear that this does n't close the door to diplomacy , " rice told reporters on her way back to washington from a middle east peace mission . both rice and steinmeier said the extensive six-party package - worked out by germany , france , britain , the united states , russia and china - was still on the table . " our top goal remains finding an amicable diplomatic solution , " steinmeier said .
" i appeal to the leaders in tehran to take this opportunity and create the conditions for a return to the negotiating table . " iran is a potential volcano signals from tehran do not indicate that iran will comply to the un demands . " the security council resolution is unacceptable and is shifting the climate down a path which will help no one , " kazem jalali , spokesman for the iranian parliament 's foreign affairs commission , was quoted as saying by the isna news agency late monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar cast the lone dissenting vote qatar was the only council member to oppose the iran resolution .
it said it was too confrontational . " do we really want to see another volcano erupting in this region ? " said qatari un ambassador nassir abdulaziz al-nasser . russia and china gave their backing , though both said that there was no immediate threat of sanctions .
russian ambassador vitaly churkin said that even the next stage precluded any threat of military action . japan on tuesday welcomed the un resolution and said its position was unaffected by its close trade ties with the oil producer .
japan , a non-permanent member of the security council , is a close us ally but has also been a major investor in iran 's energy sector .
asia 's largest economy is heavily dependent on middle eastern oil . china said diplomacy was crucial in resolving the iran nuclear crisis . " china hopes the resolution on iran 's nuclear issue would serve the ongoing diplomatic efforts to settle the standoff , " the official xinhua news agency quoted foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao as saying tuesday .
" china calls on all parties concerned to keep calm and exercise restraint , and continue to push forward -lrb- for an -rrb- early resumption of negotiations . " dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : sanctions would hurt europe and iranians , but not us if iran allows the nuclear conflict to escalate , it will face economic sanctions .
it is europe and the iranian people , not the us or the mullah regime , who would suffer , says dw-world.de 's ibrahim mohamad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.08.2006 fischer visits iran as calls for a diplomatic role gather pace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gone but not forgotten : some believe fischer 's middle east expertise should be used former german foreign minister joschka fischer began a four-day visit to iran monday as the guest of a tehran think-tank with a growing chorus calling for him to return to the middle east in a more official capacity . " i am not coming back , " joschka fischer said at the end of june , brushing aside suggestions he could return to fight another day for germany 's green party .
" the door is closed ; the key has been turned and thrown away . " the new professor of international economic policy at princeton university 's woodrow wilson school of public and international affairs may have meant every word he said when stepping down from government to concentrate on his new teaching position in the united states .
but in the space of almost a month , the former german foreign minister 's expertise in the middle east has become a more valuable commodity ; one which some wish to use again . the war in lebanon and the rapidly disintegrating relationship between the west and iran over the islamic republic 's nuclear ambitions have turned up the heat in the pressure cooker region , with diplomats from all nations struggling to find viable solutions to the problems in the middle east . a respected middle east expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer with the late palestinian leader yasser arafat some believe fischer , as an expert on the middle east who won the confidence of both jews and palestinians during his seven years as foreign minister , could prove to be an important player again in any negotiations - be it in an official or unofficial capacity . and while no official offer has been made for him to join germany 's efforts in ending the israel-hezbollah conflict or the nuclear stand-off with iran , fischer has been touted as a possible mediator in both crises , either as a german or european union representative . " as a proven international politician , respected both in israel and palestine , joschka fischer would be ideally placed to play a mediating role , as an eu envoy , aimed at negotiating a ceasefire -lrb- in lebanon -rrb- , " leading green meps daniel cohn-bendit from germany and italian monica frassoni said in a statement .
the german government and fischer himself have not responded to calls for such involvement in either the lebanon or iran crises .
however , fischer started a four-day visit to iran on monday where he will take part in a round table debate organized by tehran 's center for strategic studies after being invited by hassan rohani , iran 's former chief negotiator on its nuclear program . invitation shows fischer 's standing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rohani and fischer have a mutual respect although the private visit had been organized for some time , his inclusion in the debate shows that his regular visits to iran and the middle east during his tenure as germany 's top diplomat built many important working relationships and earned him respect in the region . and as the united nations security council prepares to set tehran a deadline for the suspension of its uranium enrichment program with sanctions seemingly unavoidable given iran 's belligerent stance , a man such as fischer who the iranians can trust could pave the way for talks to reopen .
he himself believes that negotiation with iran is the only way to secure a peaceful resolution to this and the wider problems in the region . " if an understanding can be found with tehran about its nuclear program and uranium enrichment , the situation in the middle east will change , " he recently told die zeit newspaper .
" if not , we are heading for an enormous crisis with unforeseeable consequences . " taking a different line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer at the un as for lebanon , fischer has already voiced his opinions and they differ from the current line of thinking .
while many diplomats believe a un force in lebanon is the way forward , fischer has said it would make " little sense " to deploy a larger un contingent to stabilize the country . " another blue-helmet mandate will make little sense , " fischer said .
" only a robust force with a robust mandate could perhaps achieve something positive .
but the risks are enormous .
i think it is far more important to put political pressure on the radicals and to commit ourselves to new peace negotiations . " fischer said the violence had been " orchestrated by foreign leaders of hamas as part of their struggle with the moderate elements in the movement . "
but iran and syria also had a hand in events , he added . he also accused the west , russia and the united nations of neglecting the middle east peace process . " never before has the west , the us , neglected this volatile conflict so dangerously , never before has the so-called middle east quartet , namely the us , the eu , the un and russia , shown so little commitment , " he said .
" this is a tragedy . " fischer 's supporters have urged the international community to " think outside the box " to solve the middle east crisis .
dispatching a former left-wing radical , self-styled rock 'n'roll politician and ex-german foreign minister to the region may be a viable alternative to the current efforts to secure peace . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de middle east cease-fire and un deployment on eu crisis agenda european union foreign ministers will hold a crisis meeting tuesday on the middle east , seeking to exploit a window of opportunity presented by israel 's 48-hour suspension of air strikes to push for a full cease-fire .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.08.2006 former eastern bloc clergy grapple with communist legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish catholics did n't want to believe priests collaborated with the communists after east germany , hungary and the czech republic , poland is the latest country from the former eastern european bloc to confront revelations that some of its clergy collaborated with communists . poland is a country in which church pews are still overflowing , where millions turned out to mourn pope john paul ii 's death last year and one in which government ministers have repeatedly called for " morality " in schools and reference to god in the eu constitution . when revelations first surfaced that some members of poland 's catholic clergy collaborated with the communist dictatorship , most in the staunchly catholic country did n't want to believe them .
then the first high-ranking priest admitted he was involved . at first , michal czajkowski , a leading church figure known for his work on catholic-jewish relations , rejected the accusations made against him .
but in july , he admitted to spying on his colleagues for 24 years , beginning in 1960 .
soon after , he quit as co-chairman of the polish christian-jewish council . church collaboration hits poland especially hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czajkowski is known for his work on catholic-jewish relations " i want to apologize and ask for forgiveness , especially for those whom i have hurt - i displayed a weakness of character , " czajkowski wrote in a statement printed by polish newspapers .
" i have already expressed my regret toward god .
now i am doing it toward people . " in other former communist countries still grappling with their past , such admissions may be surprising .
but they do n't have the power to shock as in poland , where during four decades of communist rule , the church remained stronger than anywhere else in the bloc and was seen as the focal point to passive resistance and opposition to the regime . in the former communist czechoslovakia , for example , the church played a smaller role in society , and even today , the czechs are among the least devout nations in europe .
in hungary , the catholic church has also admitted that dozens of its priests spied on their colleagues without raising the same level of public shock seen in poland . germany still investigating its own past like other states behind the iron curtain , the churches in the former east germany have had to deal with allegations that their clergy , especially in the protestant church , appeased or supported communist officials . michael zöller , a professor of sociology and religion at the university of bayreuth said collaboration with the communists was more prevalent in the protestant church in the former east germany . " the catholic church was more protected because the gdr wanted to be on good terms with the vatican , " zöller said .
" protestants were more forced to cooperate , especially to be able to get some leeway in their activities . " some clergy members thought of it as a progressive alliance because there was an affinity between church doctrine and socialism - it even attracted clergy from west germany , such as angela merkel 's father , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stolpe has been accused of collaborating with the communists in germany , the opening of the east german secret police , or stasi , archives brought up a number of allegations against east german church officials most famously , former brandenburg premier manfred stolpe , who also served as germany 's minister of transportation , building and housing until 2005 .
stolpe was a high-ranking official of the gdr 's evangelical church and has denied the charges . zöller said he believes that issues of collaboration among the clergy will continue to come up , as historians continue to pore through the stasi files . " officials are still processing documents , " he said .
" who knows yet what information they contain . " over 10 percent of polish priests collaborated polish priest czajkowski was a willing spy , according to the warsaw-based national remembrance institute , which manages communist archives and investigates crimes of that era .
the institute said he reported on the church 's and clergy 's pro-democracy activities and only stopped after regime agents murdered the chaplain of the solidarity trade union , jerzy popieluszko , whom czajkowski is accused of spying on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands in poland mourned pope john paul ii 's death poland 's catholic church , including former pope john paul ii , is widely credited with the rise of solidarity , the movement that brought down the communists and took control of poland in 1989 .
even though the church openly supported the group , the national remembrance institute said about 10 percent to 15 percent of the clergy collaborated with the communists . until recently , the church has refused to cooperate with investigations or provide names regarding collaborators among the clergy .
however , last year after similar allegations against an aide to pope john paul ii , konrad hejmo , surfaced , and the church suspended him .
hejmo denied the charges , which include spying on the late pope . coming to terms with the past now the catholic church in poland is working at coming to terms with its role in communist times .
earlier this year , church officials said they would begin investigating members of the clergy for collaborating with the communists .
soon after , the polish conference of catholic bishops issued an official apology to the public .

for those at the acclaimed architecture firm gerkan , marg and partners -lrb- gmp -rrb- , the dream has come true yet again - this time in south africa . berlin architects meinhard von gerkan , volkwin marg and their colleagues were commissioned to build three of the five new stadiums planned for the 2010 world cup soccer championship in south africa .
they introduced their plans recently , just weeks after the conclusion of the 2006 world cup in germany . " it even surprised us , " said architect hubert nienhoff from gmp , whose firm has been working on stadiums in cape town , durban and port elizabeth . an arch for the durban skyline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the durban stadium will sit near the indian ocean gerkan , marg and partners also rebuilt stadiums in frankfurt , cologne and berlin in preparation for this year 's world cup .
they 're not novices and it shows . it was the creative touch of nienhoff 's team that won his firm the contract in south africa .
the durban stadium 's facade , which is made up of slats , will protect against sun and rain while not obstructing the view to the outside .
the highlight of the new building is an arch that will span across the stadium .
it will be visible from afar and is expected to enrich the city 's skyline . organizers wanted " to put durban on the map " with the new stadium construction , said nienhoff , which is largely why his team 's unique design was selected . short on time and money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the remodeling of berlin 's olympic stadium is on the firm 's impressive resume though the three new south african stadiums are meant to outlive the 2010 world cup and make a lasting impact on the respective cities , the budget for their remodeling is relatively low compared to similar projects in other countries . only a quarter of the funds invested in the remodeling of the olympic stadium in berlin has been budgeted for the updated port elizabeth stadium , for example . money , however , is less problematic than time . " the decision to start with the construction of the stadiums now is actually too late for us germans , " nienhoff said . it 's no secret that the south african 's have a different relationship with time than the germans do .
international soccer association fifa allegedly discussed behind closed doors the possibility of pulling the 2010 championship from south africa due to the country 's less than timely preparation schedule . up for the challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have a hand in the next world cup " one thing is for sure : the south africans are incredibly proud of their country and are n't going to let anyone doubt that they can pull it off , " nienhoff said . despite the difficulties that inevitably accompany a project of this magnitude , nienhoff is confident of success .
his hope is that people will enjoy coming to the three new stadiums and that the german architecture will touch other parts of africa too . nina werkhäuser -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup scores goal for german economy since the world cup ended , host nation germany has been counting the immediate economic benefits for businesses during the month-long event .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.08.2006 german gay marriage law marks fifth anniversary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first " gay marriage " in hanover in 2001 five years ago , the bride-and-groom grouping lost its monopoly on the church aisle or the top of the wedding cake .
groom and groom or bride and bride became possible due to a new law on same-sex registered partnerships . it was actually just over five years ago that one of klaus jetz 's long-sought-after goals was realized .
after long debate and much lobbying from the organization he directs , the lesbian and gay association of germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , the german parliament passed the " registered partnership " bill , which gave gay and lesbian couples new status in the eyes of the state , one that had many of the advantages of marriage .
the law he had fought so hard for went into effect on aug .
1 , 2001 . " since the early 90s , the lsvd had fought for this , and back then , it all seemed so far off , " he said .
" then with the change of government in 1998 , the chance to make it a reality arrived . " for many long-time same-sex couples , whose daily reality had looked pretty much like a marriage , their relationships were now sanctioned by the coalition government of left-of-center social democrats and greens under gerhard schröder .
the law entitles gay and lesbian couples who registered their partnerships some of the advantages heterosexual married couples enjoy . same-sex couples can now share a last name , refuse to testify against one another in court and have same inheritance and tenants ' rights as heterosexual spouses .
a foreigner legally joined in a gay partnership to a german can apply for the right to citizenship .
partners also take on a responsibility to maintain and support the other in the case of financial difficulties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another happy couple on jan .
1 , 2005 , the law was amended , giving one partner the right to adopt the other partner 's biological child , so-called stepchild adoption .
other rights were expanded , such as the area of property rights , which moved registered partnerships closer to heterosexual marriage . but attempts to give same-sex partners the same tax and welfare benefits as those enjoyed by heterosexual couples were defeated in the conservative-dominated upper house of the german parliament . almost " normal " while it is difficult to know exactly how many same-sex couples have registered their partnerships over the five years of the law because of different recording criteria in germany 's federal states , estimates range between 14,000 and 20,000 . " in 2001 , there were many same-sex couples who knew they wanted to become registered partners and were just waiting for the ink of this law to be dry , " said ute terwedow from the civil registry office in cologne .
" that accounts for the large numbers we saw at the outset .
now the whole thing has become very normal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lsvd 's axel blumenthal , left , and green politician volker beck , signaled their optimism that the constitutional court would rule in their favor in 2002 in cologne in 2002 , 285 same-sex couples registered their partnerships - a " record year , " according to terwedow .
since then , between 170 and 180 couples have tied the knot every year .
according to a survey by the dpa news agency , gay men are saying " i do " much more often than lesbians .
in cologne , only a third of same-sex couples at the registry office are women . when " gay marriage " was under debate in germany , some talked about it being a danger to the nation 's culture fabric and there were fears that it would undermine traditional marriage .
several states led by the conservative union political parties asked the law to be reviewed by the constitutional court , in the hope it would declared unconstitutional .
it was not .
five years later , however , same-sex unions have gained a societal acceptance that exceeds even what optimists had predicted . discriminatory even though klaus jetz celebrated the law 's coming into effect five years ago , he and his partner of 11 years have chosen not to tie the knot at the registry office .
while he said the current law marks progress in the area of gay and lesbian rights , he still finds parts of it unacceptable , since a registered partnership is not the same thing as a marriage .
some have called it marriage " light , " since it has most of traditional marriage 's responsibilities , but fewer of its advantages . there are differences regarding income taxes , joint tax assessments , and inheritance taxes .
for example , it is almost impossible to inherit an apartment from a deceased partner , jetz says , because of the high inheritance taxes that would have to be paid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain legalized gay marriage in 2005 in the face of opposition from the church and conservatives heterosexual married couples , on the other hand , enjoy a tax exemption of 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 635,000 -rrb- .
same-sex couples do not .
and unlike heterosexuals , or gay couples in the neighboring netherlands , german couples will not have the right to adopt . " in germany we are still far away from complete equality for homosexual partnerships , " said volker beck , a green parliamentarian who has been a major backer of the law . the discrepancies came about because the registered partnership bill was split into two parts when it went through parliament .
the section that dealt with many of the financial aspects , such as tax law , would have had to be approved by the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
because that body was dominated by conservatives , the left-of-center government did not try to push it through , since it would have gone down to defeat . " now we need to take a new run at the partnership law to complete it , " jetz said . but he does n't want to downplay the importance of the law , calling it a paradigm change in germany , something that was almost inconceivable just 15 years ago .
he would like to see the government take up the issue again , but said the current coalition under conservative chancellor angela merkel is not likely to . " but even in the netherlands and denmark it took 10 years until lesbian and gay partnerships were made 100 percent equal to heterosexual ones , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain approves gay marriage , adoption days after the election of a staunchly conservative new pope , predominantly roman catholic spain is set to allow homosexuals to marry and adopt children .

partners also take on a responsibility to maintain and support the other in the case of financial difficulties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another happy couple on jan .
1 , 2005 , the law was amended , giving one partner the right to adopt the other partner 's biological child , so-called stepchild adoption .
other rights were expanded , such as the area of property rights , which moved registered partnerships closer to heterosexual marriage . but attempts to give same-sex partners the same tax and welfare benefits as those enjoyed by heterosexual couples were defeated in the conservative-dominated upper house of the german parliament . almost " normal " while it is difficult to know exactly how many same-sex couples have registered their partnerships over the five years of the law because of different recording criteria in germany 's federal states , estimates range between 14,000 and 20,000 . " in 2001 , there were many same-sex couples who knew they wanted to become registered partners and were just waiting for the ink of this law to be dry , " said ute terwedow from the civil registry office in cologne .
" that accounts for the large numbers we saw at the outset .
now the whole thing has become very normal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lsvd 's axel blumenthal , left , and green politician volker beck , signaled their optimism that the constitutional court would rule in their favor in 2002 in cologne in 2002 , 285 same-sex couples registered their partnerships - a " record year , " according to terwedow .
since then , between 170 and 180 couples have tied the knot every year .
according to a survey by the dpa news agency , gay men are saying " i do " much more often than lesbians .
in cologne , only a third of same-sex couples at the registry office are women . when " gay marriage " was under debate in germany , some talked about it being a danger to the nation 's culture fabric and there were fears that it would undermine traditional marriage .
several states led by the conservative union political parties asked the law to be reviewed by the constitutional court , in the hope it would declared unconstitutional .
it was not .
five years later , however , same-sex unions have gained a societal acceptance that exceeds even what optimists had predicted . discriminatory even though klaus jetz celebrated the law 's coming into effect five years ago , he and his partner of 11 years have chosen not to tie the knot at the registry office .
while he said the current law marks progress in the area of gay and lesbian rights , he still finds parts of it unacceptable , since a registered partnership is not the same thing as a marriage .
some have called it marriage " light , " since it has most of traditional marriage 's responsibilities , but fewer of its advantages . there are differences regarding income taxes , joint tax assessments , and inheritance taxes .
for example , it is almost impossible to inherit an apartment from a deceased partner , jetz says , because of the high inheritance taxes that would have to be paid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain legalized gay marriage in 2005 in the face of opposition from the church and conservatives heterosexual married couples , on the other hand , enjoy a tax exemption of 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 635,000 -rrb- .
same-sex couples do not .
and unlike heterosexuals , or gay couples in the neighboring netherlands , german couples will not have the right to adopt . " in germany we are still far away from complete equality for homosexual partnerships , " said volker beck , a green parliamentarian who has been a major backer of the law . the discrepancies came about because the registered partnership bill was split into two parts when it went through parliament .
the section that dealt with many of the financial aspects , such as tax law , would have had to be approved by the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
because that body was dominated by conservatives , the left-of-center government did not try to push it through , since it would have gone down to defeat . " now we need to take a new run at the partnership law to complete it , " jetz said . but he does n't want to downplay the importance of the law , calling it a paradigm change in germany , something that was almost inconceivable just 15 years ago .
he would like to see the government take up the issue again , but said the current coalition under conservative chancellor angela merkel is not likely to .

groom and groom or bride and bride became possible due to a new law on same-sex registered partnerships . it was actually just over five years ago that one of klaus jetz 's long-sought-after goals was realized .
after long debate and much lobbying from the organization he directs , the lesbian and gay association of germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , the german parliament passed the " registered partnership " bill , which gave gay and lesbian couples new status in the eyes of the state , one that had many of the advantages of marriage .
the law he had fought so hard for went into effect on aug .
1 , 2001 . " since the early 90s , the lsvd had fought for this , and back then , it all seemed so far off , " he said .
" then with the change of government in 1998 , the chance to make it a reality arrived . " for many long-time same-sex couples , whose daily reality had looked pretty much like a marriage , their relationships were now sanctioned by the coalition government of left-of-center social democrats and greens under gerhard schröder .

for those at the acclaimed architecture firm gerkan , marg and partners -lrb- gmp -rrb- , the dream has come true yet again - this time in south africa . berlin architects meinhard von gerkan , volkwin marg and their colleagues were commissioned to build three of the five new stadiums planned for the 2010 world cup soccer championship in south africa .
they introduced their plans recently , just weeks after the conclusion of the 2006 world cup in germany . " it even surprised us , " said architect hubert nienhoff from gmp , whose firm has been working on stadiums in cape town , durban and port elizabeth . an arch for the durban skyline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the durban stadium will sit near the indian ocean gerkan , marg and partners also rebuilt stadiums in frankfurt , cologne and berlin in preparation for this year 's world cup .
they 're not novices and it shows . it was the creative touch of nienhoff 's team that won his firm the contract in south africa .
the durban stadium 's facade , which is made up of slats , will protect against sun and rain while not obstructing the view to the outside .
the highlight of the new building is an arch that will span across the stadium .
it will be visible from afar and is expected to enrich the city 's skyline . organizers wanted " to put durban on the map " with the new stadium construction , said nienhoff , which is largely why his team 's unique design was selected . short on time and money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the remodeling of berlin 's olympic stadium is on the firm 's impressive resume though the three new south african stadiums are meant to outlive the 2010 world cup and make a lasting impact on the respective cities , the budget for their remodeling is relatively low compared to similar projects in other countries . only a quarter of the funds invested in the remodeling of the olympic stadium in berlin has been budgeted for the updated port elizabeth stadium , for example . money , however , is less problematic than time . " the decision to start with the construction of the stadiums now is actually too late for us germans , " nienhoff said . it 's no secret that the south african 's have a different relationship with time than the germans do .
international soccer association fifa allegedly discussed behind closed doors the possibility of pulling the 2010 championship from south africa due to the country 's less than timely preparation schedule . up for the challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have a hand in the next world cup " one thing is for sure : the south africans are incredibly proud of their country and are n't going to let anyone doubt that they can pull it off , " nienhoff said . despite the difficulties that inevitably accompany a project of this magnitude , nienhoff is confident of success .
his hope is that people will enjoy coming to the three new stadiums and that the german architecture will touch other parts of africa too . nina werkhäuser -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup scores goal for german economy since the world cup ended , host nation germany has been counting the immediate economic benefits for businesses during the month-long event .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.08.2006 former eastern bloc clergy grapple with communist legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish catholics did n't want to believe priests collaborated with the communists after east germany , hungary and the czech republic , poland is the latest country from the former eastern european bloc to confront revelations that some of its clergy collaborated with communists . poland is a country in which church pews are still overflowing , where millions turned out to mourn pope john paul ii 's death last year and one in which government ministers have repeatedly called for " morality " in schools and reference to god in the eu constitution . when revelations first surfaced that some members of poland 's catholic clergy collaborated with the communist dictatorship , most in the staunchly catholic country did n't want to believe them .
then the first high-ranking priest admitted he was involved . at first , michal czajkowski , a leading church figure known for his work on catholic-jewish relations , rejected the accusations made against him .
but in july , he admitted to spying on his colleagues for 24 years , beginning in 1960 .
soon after , he quit as co-chairman of the polish christian-jewish council . church collaboration hits poland especially hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czajkowski is known for his work on catholic-jewish relations " i want to apologize and ask for forgiveness , especially for those whom i have hurt - i displayed a weakness of character , " czajkowski wrote in a statement printed by polish newspapers .
" i have already expressed my regret toward god .
now i am doing it toward people . " in other former communist countries still grappling with their past , such admissions may be surprising .
but they do n't have the power to shock as in poland , where during four decades of communist rule , the church remained stronger than anywhere else in the bloc and was seen as the focal point to passive resistance and opposition to the regime . in the former communist czechoslovakia , for example , the church played a smaller role in society , and even today , the czechs are among the least devout nations in europe .
in hungary , the catholic church has also admitted that dozens of its priests spied on their colleagues without raising the same level of public shock seen in poland . germany still investigating its own past like other states behind the iron curtain , the churches in the former east germany have had to deal with allegations that their clergy , especially in the protestant church , appeased or supported communist officials . michael zöller , a professor of sociology and religion at the university of bayreuth said collaboration with the communists was more prevalent in the protestant church in the former east germany . " the catholic church was more protected because the gdr wanted to be on good terms with the vatican , " zöller said .
" protestants were more forced to cooperate , especially to be able to get some leeway in their activities . " some clergy members thought of it as a progressive alliance because there was an affinity between church doctrine and socialism - it even attracted clergy from west germany , such as angela merkel 's father , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stolpe has been accused of collaborating with the communists in germany , the opening of the east german secret police , or stasi , archives brought up a number of allegations against east german church officials most famously , former brandenburg premier manfred stolpe , who also served as germany 's minister of transportation , building and housing until 2005 .
stolpe was a high-ranking official of the gdr 's evangelical church and has denied the charges . zöller said he believes that issues of collaboration among the clergy will continue to come up , as historians continue to pore through the stasi files . " officials are still processing documents , " he said .
" who knows yet what information they contain . " over 10 percent of polish priests collaborated polish priest czajkowski was a willing spy , according to the warsaw-based national remembrance institute , which manages communist archives and investigates crimes of that era .
the institute said he reported on the church 's and clergy 's pro-democracy activities and only stopped after regime agents murdered the chaplain of the solidarity trade union , jerzy popieluszko , whom czajkowski is accused of spying on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands in poland mourned pope john paul ii 's death poland 's catholic church , including former pope john paul ii , is widely credited with the rise of solidarity , the movement that brought down the communists and took control of poland in 1989 .
even though the church openly supported the group , the national remembrance institute said about 10 percent to 15 percent of the clergy collaborated with the communists . until recently , the church has refused to cooperate with investigations or provide names regarding collaborators among the clergy .
however , last year after similar allegations against an aide to pope john paul ii , konrad hejmo , surfaced , and the church suspended him .
hejmo denied the charges , which include spying on the late pope . coming to terms with the past now the catholic church in poland is working at coming to terms with its role in communist times .
earlier this year , church officials said they would begin investigating members of the clergy for collaborating with the communists .
soon after , the polish conference of catholic bishops issued an official apology to the public . " priests and others linked with the church who collaborated with the security services of the communist state cast a shadow on the catholic church 's heroic history under communist rule , " the bishops wrote , adding that an initiative to make public its complete list of collaborators is moving forward . the actions of a few priests also should not diminish the church 's role in promoting democracy , according to wojtek muszynski of the national remembrance institute . " the polish catholic church was still a hero , " he said .
" no matter how hard the secret service tried , they did n't break down 85 to 90 percent of the priests .

" the council -lrb- of eu ministers -rrb- calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities to be followed by a sustainable ceasefire , " said finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erkki tuomioja he was speaking to reporters after ministers wrangled for three and a half hours over the exact wording of the joint eu declaration , and as israel escalated attacks on hezbollah guerillas and vowed to step up ground operations . " it 's important to get the words and concepts right , " he said , adding : " there are no divisions in the european union . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the agreement did not mean an immediate ceasefire , since cessation of hostilities was not the same as a ceasefire . " a ceasefire can perhaps be achieved later , " he said .
" we can now only ask the un security council and put pressure on it and not to waste any more time . " division despite tuomioja 's statement , the eu talks did come amid sharp disagreement within the bloc about whether to call for an immediate ceasefire . france has led calls for an immediate ceasefire , but britain and germany have pushed for a un accord to deploy an international force to secure the israeli-lebanon border and ensure that any truce is sustainable . french foreign ministe philippe douste-blazy welcomed the eu agreement , saying the bloc had spoken with " one voice . " " it is an important step .
the european union is supporting the resolution proposed by france to the un security council , " he said , denying any difference of opinion between paris and berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik arriving at the emergency meeting the finnish minister meanwhile underlined the need for urgent action at the un security council to provide the framework for a sustainable ceasefire , notably agreement on an international stabilization force .

" given the sensitive situation , i do n't think this is something we will be acting on now , tuomioja told the news conference after the meeting . his remarks were in response to a letter signed by 213 members of the united states congress , which was sent to eu foreign policy chief javier solana .

he is also part of the committee on foreign relations . dw-world.de : after the middle east conference in rome , crisis diplomacy was in full gear - but there is still no unified demand for a hasty end to the violence .
how would you assess the rome conference ? rolf mützenich : i had hoped for more .
however , it was good that important states and international organizations were able to agree on common terminology at the rome conference .
this can only be evaluated in the context of the g8 summit , the eu foreign minister conferences and deliberations in the un security council . therein lies the bottom line : we need a lasting cease-fire as quickly as possible .
the use of military violence must be stopped . israel sees the concluding declaration from the rome conference as a carte blanche to continue its lebanon offensive , while german foreign minister steinmeier spoke of a " great misunderstanding . "
did the international community , particularly the european union , contribute to the legitimization of this legally questionable campaign ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf mützenich is a historian and political scientist the interpretation of israel 's justice minister is completely absurd .
the legitimization of the disproportionate use of violence is not the issue here .
both sides have harmed the civilian population with military means , which finally has to stop . what we need is a stepwise process : a cease-fire for humanitarian aid and a solution to prevent further escalations in this region . political observers and middle east experts have criticized germany 's passivity since the beginning of the middle east crisis .
is the german stance breaking down unity within the eu ?
and how can the eu be a counterweight to the pro-israel position that the us is taking ? i do n't see any passivity .
other european capitals that have a colonial past in the region could be accused of passivity .
but the german foreign minister is doing quite a lot , both within the region and outside of it .
he was not only in israel , egypt and palestine , he also sent representatives to beirut , damascus and new york .
this is very active diplomacy . however , our influence remains marginal , especially as the american foreign policy is too hesitant .
i do n't at all share the american secretary of state 's perspective that a new middle east emerging .
it makes me dizzy to think that new structures should be formed by violent means .
that is a perception that belongs in the past . the then-ruling coalition between the social democrats and the greens was supported by the population in 2003 when the it rejected the iraq war as contrary to international law .
in the current conflict , the german people seem to view israel 's conduct with increasingly sharper criticism than the elite decision makers , particularly in light of civilian suffering .
is this a sign of a significant discrepancy between the political elite and the general population ? it 's not as clear-cut as you imply .
there are some differences between the two cases .
first of all , israel was actively attacked .
soldiers were abducted in gaza and on the lebanese-israeli border .
israel believes its very existence is in danger , and as the iranian president does not miss any opportunity to make anti-israeli and anti-semitic comments , it is completely understandable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mützenich said the war came just as improvement in lebanon was beginning however , israel is committing unrestrained violence against large parts of lebanon and the lebanese population that do not have anything to do with the current crisis .
the tragedy becomes even more depressing when we consider that a new lebanon with an active public society was just beginning to show itself in the past few months . of course , these are not singular events in region that has known violence for decades .
it 's bitter that - with israel 's bombardment , the abduction of the soldiers , the arrest of freely elected palestinian delegates and ministers and israel 's military campaign - the process in palestine was ended . perhaps part of the hamas would have gone down the path that fatah took - that is , recognizing israel 's right to existence and abstaining from violence .
the prisoners ' paper opened a new window for peace a few weeks ago .
but extremists did n't want this solution .
even groups in israel were n't happy to see this kind of solution to the negotiations . loay mudhoon interviewed rolf mützenich -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click on the links to read dw-world.de 's compilation of articles on the conflict and the search for peace .
israel suspends air strikes for 48-hours but says war goes on israel has finally agreed to a limited ceasefire in lebanon with a 48-hour suspension of air strikes but israeli justice minister haim ramon said it did n't mean that the jewish state was ending its war against hezbollah .

he is also part of the committee on foreign relations . dw-world.de : after the middle east conference in rome , crisis diplomacy was in full gear - but there is still no unified demand for a hasty end to the violence .
how would you assess the rome conference ? rolf mützenich : i had hoped for more .
however , it was good that important states and international organizations were able to agree on common terminology at the rome conference .
this can only be evaluated in the context of the g8 summit , the eu foreign minister conferences and deliberations in the un security council . therein lies the bottom line : we need a lasting cease-fire as quickly as possible .
the use of military violence must be stopped . israel sees the concluding declaration from the rome conference as a carte blanche to continue its lebanon offensive , while german foreign minister steinmeier spoke of a " great misunderstanding . "
did the international community , particularly the european union , contribute to the legitimization of this legally questionable campaign ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf mützenich is a historian and political scientist the interpretation of israel 's justice minister is completely absurd .
the legitimization of the disproportionate use of violence is not the issue here .
both sides have harmed the civilian population with military means , which finally has to stop . what we need is a stepwise process : a cease-fire for humanitarian aid and a solution to prevent further escalations in this region . political observers and middle east experts have criticized germany 's passivity since the beginning of the middle east crisis .
is the german stance breaking down unity within the eu ?
and how can the eu be a counterweight to the pro-israel position that the us is taking ? i do n't see any passivity .
other european capitals that have a colonial past in the region could be accused of passivity .
but the german foreign minister is doing quite a lot , both within the region and outside of it .
he was not only in israel , egypt and palestine , he also sent representatives to beirut , damascus and new york .
this is very active diplomacy . however , our influence remains marginal , especially as the american foreign policy is too hesitant .
i do n't at all share the american secretary of state 's perspective that a new middle east emerging .
it makes me dizzy to think that new structures should be formed by violent means .
that is a perception that belongs in the past . the then-ruling coalition between the social democrats and the greens was supported by the population in 2003 when the it rejected the iraq war as contrary to international law .
in the current conflict , the german people seem to view israel 's conduct with increasingly sharper criticism than the elite decision makers , particularly in light of civilian suffering .
is this a sign of a significant discrepancy between the political elite and the general population ? it 's not as clear-cut as you imply .
there are some differences between the two cases .
first of all , israel was actively attacked .
soldiers were abducted in gaza and on the lebanese-israeli border .
israel believes its very existence is in danger , and as the iranian president does not miss any opportunity to make anti-israeli and anti-semitic comments , it is completely understandable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mützenich said the war came just as improvement in lebanon was beginning however , israel is committing unrestrained violence against large parts of lebanon and the lebanese population that do not have anything to do with the current crisis .
the tragedy becomes even more depressing when we consider that a new lebanon with an active public society was just beginning to show itself in the past few months . of course , these are not singular events in region that has known violence for decades .
it 's bitter that - with israel 's bombardment , the abduction of the soldiers , the arrest of freely elected palestinian delegates and ministers and israel 's military campaign - the process in palestine was ended . perhaps part of the hamas would have gone down the path that fatah took - that is , recognizing israel 's right to existence and abstaining from violence .
the prisoners ' paper opened a new window for peace a few weeks ago .
but extremists did n't want this solution .
even groups in israel were n't happy to see this kind of solution to the negotiations . loay mudhoon interviewed rolf mützenich -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click on the links to read dw-world.de 's compilation of articles on the conflict and the search for peace .
israel suspends air strikes for 48-hours but says war goes on israel has finally agreed to a limited ceasefire in lebanon with a 48-hour suspension of air strikes but israeli justice minister haim ramon said it did n't mean that the jewish state was ending its war against hezbollah .
-lrb- july 31 , 2006 -rrb- german government criticized for stance on lebanese refugees after germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble said it would be " premature " and " misguided " for germany to take in lebanese refugees , opposition politicians and humanitarian organizations responded with anger .

groom and groom or bride and bride became possible due to a new law on same-sex registered partnerships . it was actually just over five years ago that one of klaus jetz 's long-sought-after goals was realized .
after long debate and much lobbying from the organization he directs , the lesbian and gay association of germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , the german parliament passed the " registered partnership " bill , which gave gay and lesbian couples new status in the eyes of the state , one that had many of the advantages of marriage .
the law he had fought so hard for went into effect on aug .
1 , 2001 . " since the early 90s , the lsvd had fought for this , and back then , it all seemed so far off , " he said .
" then with the change of government in 1998 , the chance to make it a reality arrived . " for many long-time same-sex couples , whose daily reality had looked pretty much like a marriage , their relationships were now sanctioned by the coalition government of left-of-center social democrats and greens under gerhard schröder .
the law entitles gay and lesbian couples who registered their partnerships some of the advantages heterosexual married couples enjoy . same-sex couples can now share a last name , refuse to testify against one another in court and have same inheritance and tenants ' rights as heterosexual spouses .
a foreigner legally joined in a gay partnership to a german can apply for the right to citizenship .
partners also take on a responsibility to maintain and support the other in the case of financial difficulties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another happy couple on jan .
1 , 2005 , the law was amended , giving one partner the right to adopt the other partner 's biological child , so-called stepchild adoption .
other rights were expanded , such as the area of property rights , which moved registered partnerships closer to heterosexual marriage . but attempts to give same-sex partners the same tax and welfare benefits as those enjoyed by heterosexual couples were defeated in the conservative-dominated upper house of the german parliament . almost " normal " while it is difficult to know exactly how many same-sex couples have registered their partnerships over the five years of the law because of different recording criteria in germany 's federal states , estimates range between 14,000 and 20,000 . " in 2001 , there were many same-sex couples who knew they wanted to become registered partners and were just waiting for the ink of this law to be dry , " said ute terwedow from the civil registry office in cologne .
" that accounts for the large numbers we saw at the outset .
now the whole thing has become very normal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lsvd 's axel blumenthal , left , and green politician volker beck , signaled their optimism that the constitutional court would rule in their favor in 2002 in cologne in 2002 , 285 same-sex couples registered their partnerships - a " record year , " according to terwedow .
since then , between 170 and 180 couples have tied the knot every year .
according to a survey by the dpa news agency , gay men are saying " i do " much more often than lesbians .
in cologne , only a third of same-sex couples at the registry office are women . when " gay marriage " was under debate in germany , some talked about it being a danger to the nation 's culture fabric and there were fears that it would undermine traditional marriage .
several states led by the conservative union political parties asked the law to be reviewed by the constitutional court , in the hope it would declared unconstitutional .
it was not .
five years later , however , same-sex unions have gained a societal acceptance that exceeds even what optimists had predicted . discriminatory even though klaus jetz celebrated the law 's coming into effect five years ago , he and his partner of 11 years have chosen not to tie the knot at the registry office .
while he said the current law marks progress in the area of gay and lesbian rights , he still finds parts of it unacceptable , since a registered partnership is not the same thing as a marriage .
some have called it marriage " light , " since it has most of traditional marriage 's responsibilities , but fewer of its advantages . there are differences regarding income taxes , joint tax assessments , and inheritance taxes .
for example , it is almost impossible to inherit an apartment from a deceased partner , jetz says , because of the high inheritance taxes that would have to be paid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain legalized gay marriage in 2005 in the face of opposition from the church and conservatives heterosexual married couples , on the other hand , enjoy a tax exemption of 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 635,000 -rrb- .
same-sex couples do not .
and unlike heterosexuals , or gay couples in the neighboring netherlands , german couples will not have the right to adopt . " in germany we are still far away from complete equality for homosexual partnerships , " said volker beck , a green parliamentarian who has been a major backer of the law . the discrepancies came about because the registered partnership bill was split into two parts when it went through parliament .

" now we need to take a new run at the partnership law to complete it , " jetz said . but he does n't want to downplay the importance of the law , calling it a paradigm change in germany , something that was almost inconceivable just 15 years ago .
he would like to see the government take up the issue again , but said the current coalition under conservative chancellor angela merkel is not likely to .

for those at the acclaimed architecture firm gerkan , marg and partners -lrb- gmp -rrb- , the dream has come true yet again - this time in south africa . berlin architects meinhard von gerkan , volkwin marg and their colleagues were commissioned to build three of the five new stadiums planned for the 2010 world cup soccer championship in south africa .
they introduced their plans recently , just weeks after the conclusion of the 2006 world cup in germany . " it even surprised us , " said architect hubert nienhoff from gmp , whose firm has been working on stadiums in cape town , durban and port elizabeth . an arch for the durban skyline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the durban stadium will sit near the indian ocean gerkan , marg and partners also rebuilt stadiums in frankfurt , cologne and berlin in preparation for this year 's world cup .
they 're not novices and it shows . it was the creative touch of nienhoff 's team that won his firm the contract in south africa .
the durban stadium 's facade , which is made up of slats , will protect against sun and rain while not obstructing the view to the outside .
the highlight of the new building is an arch that will span across the stadium .
it will be visible from afar and is expected to enrich the city 's skyline . organizers wanted " to put durban on the map " with the new stadium construction , said nienhoff , which is largely why his team 's unique design was selected . short on time and money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the remodeling of berlin 's olympic stadium is on the firm 's impressive resume though the three new south african stadiums are meant to outlive the 2010 world cup and make a lasting impact on the respective cities , the budget for their remodeling is relatively low compared to similar projects in other countries . only a quarter of the funds invested in the remodeling of the olympic stadium in berlin has been budgeted for the updated port elizabeth stadium , for example . money , however , is less problematic than time . " the decision to start with the construction of the stadiums now is actually too late for us germans , " nienhoff said . it 's no secret that the south african 's have a different relationship with time than the germans do .
international soccer association fifa allegedly discussed behind closed doors the possibility of pulling the 2010 championship from south africa due to the country 's less than timely preparation schedule . up for the challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have a hand in the next world cup " one thing is for sure : the south africans are incredibly proud of their country and are n't going to let anyone doubt that they can pull it off , " nienhoff said . despite the difficulties that inevitably accompany a project of this magnitude , nienhoff is confident of success .
his hope is that people will enjoy coming to the three new stadiums and that the german architecture will touch other parts of africa too . nina werkhäuser -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup scores goal for german economy since the world cup ended , host nation germany has been counting the immediate economic benefits for businesses during the month-long event .

now , the beck 's brewery is scrambling to meet its orders as a result . the combination of heat , sun and a good world cup soccer game this summer was enough to make most people in germany crave a nice cold beer .

all bottling lines were working overtime . beck 's , which operates from bremen in northern germany , said it will compensate wholesale merchants " in some cases " for the delay . but with cooler temperatures across europe and just national soccer to watch , is this a case of too little beer , too late ? dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de socceroos pain eased with aussie win in beer world cup the socceroos may have been eliminated from the world cup by italy but an adelaide brewer says fans can console themselves with the fact that an aussie ale has won a " beer world cup " held in britain .

gerhard richter 's current project is a modern 11,200-piece stained glass window for cologne 's gothic cathedral . the cologne cathedral 's new stained glass window by acclaimed german artist gerhard richter ca n't be overlooked , not only because of its immense size and conspicuous location but also because of its non-traditional approach . " the window will be a significant contribution of modern art to the cologne cathedral , " said barbara schock-werner , the cathedral 's master builder . gerhard richter is considered one of the most significant painters of our time .
his works adorn museum walls around the world and collectors drop millions to snap up his canvases .
the 74-year cologne-based artist is planning to unveil his monumental , 11,200-piece glass window in spring 2007 . gerhard richter has offered to craft the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184-square-foot -rrb- glass window as a gift to the city of cologne , the cathedral and its visitors .
donations will cover the production costs , which amount to some 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 447,000 -rrb- . a modern masterpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cologne cathedral attracts some 2.5 million visitors per year " the most important thing for me was to integrate this window into the cycle of historical windows , particularly as far as color goes , " schock-werner said .
richter 's window does n't prolong the existing tradition but develops it with his abstract use of color . glass squares in 80 different shades will replace a nearly transparent piece of glass that was inserted in the 1950 's after original window was destroyed during world war ii .
the plans for the damaged window , created in 1863 , had been lost so it could not be reproduced . the less-artistic interim piece needs to go because it lets too much light into the church and does n't correspond stylistically to the gothic cathedral , provost norbert feldhoff told german news source dpa . " the order of the individual colors is random , " said schock-werner , describing the all-over pattern of the squares , which measure 9.4 centimeters -lrb- 3.7 inches -rrb- on each side . the glass itself is not colored all the way through .
instead , colored pieces are attached to the outer surface of plain glass with the help of silicone . breaking a sacred art tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artist and his " abstract picture " from 1984 traditionally , church windows depicted biblical scenes .
long before computer books were printed , the panes told bible stories to illiterate parishioners by presenting them in brightly colored , larger-than-life images . however , richter 's window makes an intentional break from tradition .
it does n't render daniel in a den of lions , the flight of the egyptians , jesus ' birth , or the crucifixion .
in a sense , the church took a step of faith in abandoning a long-standing tradition and accepting a piece of art that is not explicitly religious . when asked if the window is a religious work of art , richter said , " oh , that 's hard to say .
art always has something to do with that . " even if christian motifs do n't appear in his latest glass work , crosses and other christian symbols are visible in many of his other works .
so it 's not without reason that richter received the german catholic art and culture prize two years ago . the making of an artist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richter painted milan 's gothic cathedral , which has similarities to cologne 's but is much larger this is n't the first time the internationally known artist has chosen colored glass as his medium .
in 1991 , for example , he created artistic accents for the hypobank in düsseldorf , which was designed by cologne architect oswald mathias ungers . richter became well known in the 1960s for modeling his paintings on photographs while using indistinct lines .
his works , which span a career of over 40 years , are stylistically diverse , as new york 's museum of modern art showed in 2002 .
in honor of the dresden native 's 70th birthday , the museum organized the largest retrospective exhibition ever done for a living artist . michael köhler / dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : trash art litters cologne some say german artist ha schult likes to provoke .

culture minister alun pugh warned trinity mirror - owners of the western mail and daily post - that the assembly may use its own website .
mr pugh said jobs adverts on websites could reach more people and save money .
trinity mirror said it was well placed to meet future challenges and said it offered value for money .
it is understood the assembly government currently pays around £ 3m a year to trinity mirror in advertising revenue .
we 've got an obligation to get the best value for public money culture minister alun pugh mr pugh 's was sacked as a western mail columnist in january after claiming opinion formers in wales regarded the paper as " a bit of a joke " .
he made his claim during an assembly culture committee review of newspapers in wales which recommended that assembly advertising be split more evenly between papers .
the london-based trinity mirror group , owner of the western mail , daily post , south wales echo and two dozen other newspapers in wales currently receives most money from the assembly for advertising .
mr pugh told bbc wales news : " i certainly think in the longer term -lsb- trinity mirror has -rsb- got a serious challenge from new media .
the western mail is owned by trinity mirror " for example both the assembly government and the public service more generally in wales put a very substantial sum of money every year into the trinity mirror organisation for things like classified job advertising .
" at some point in the future there must be a tipping point whereas instead of paying very large sums of public money to trinity mirror to carry the job advertising it could be done for example ... on the assembly government 's own website . "
he added the decision to move away from newspaper job adverts was not imminent .
" i 'm certainly not saying we should do that now .
what i am saying is that the media are evolving , " he said .
" we 've got an obligation to get the best value for public money . "
a spokesman for the assembly government issued a clarification stressing that even if it moves towards internet-based advertising , it is likely it will still need to sign-post vacancies through newspaper advertising .
trinity mirror said it was " well placed to meet these challenges should they arise " as it is developing a portfolio of websites .
' dangerous game ' " like any organisation with a substantial advertising budget , the welsh assembly employs media planners and buyers to determine where that budget should be spent , " said a spokesman .
" the western mail , along with newspapers in general , continues to offer both value for money and a huge audience - a fact recognised by the assembly . "
a media expert warned that mr pugh was playing a " dangerous game " with the welsh media .
dr james thomas from the cardiff school of journalism said : " the ability to hit the western mail 's advertising revenue is one of the few hard weapons that the assembly actually has .
" there 's always the chance that trinity mirror might reconsider the future of the western mail and might think with reduced revenue it 's simply not worth continued investment .
" ultimately it 's a question of who needs the western mail most .
" does trinity mirror need it or does the welsh assembly and welsh culture and politics need it ? "

the israeli prime minister ehud olmert signalled his determination to carry on when he said in a speech on monday that there would be no ceasefire within the next few days .
the israelis seem intent on widening the so-called " buffer zone " they have been establishing close to the border .
they say they will hold this until an international force arrives .
but that could take some time .
the speech by mr olmert was in marked contrast to the cautious optimism expressed by the us secretary of state condoleezza rice .
speaking in the aftermath of the bombing at qana , she said that a ceasefire might be possible by the end of the week .
the bombing appeared to give added urgency to the diplomacy surrounding the middle east conflict , increasing the pressure on the united states to press for a ceasefire sooner rather than later .
even before mr olmert spoke , there were indications that a ceasefire this week might not be easy to achieve .
the israeli defence minister amir peretz told the israeli parliament : " israel will expand its operations against hezbollah ... as much as i am a man of peace , i maintain that we can not accept an immediate ceasefire ... if there is an immediate ceasefire , the extremists will immediately rear their heads . "
and hassan fadlallah , a hezbollah member of the lebanese parliament said : " the cabinet , the resistance and the people are united on their stand .
stopping the israeli aggression is the priority , there is no other discussion , there is no negotiation concerning any other issues .
when the israeli aggression stops , we can then discuss other political issues . "
and president bush himself , in comments on monday , indicated that he still wanted more than a ceasefire .
" we want there to be a long-lasting peace , one that is sustainable , " he said .
' i think it is time ' dr rice laid out the three parts of a resolution : " a ceasefire , the political principles that provide for a long-term settlement , and the authorisation of an international force to support the lebanese army in keeping the peace .
we are working simultaneously on all three tracks so that a cease-fire can be supported by the deployment of an international stabilisation force as soon as possible after security council action . "
the secretary of state was speaking as she left jerusalem to return to the united states after failing to get a meeting with the lebanese prime minister fouad siniora .
he had refused to see her unless she was prepared to discuss an immediate ceasefire .
later , on her plane , she told reporters : " i am going to push very hard to have the un security council resolution this week .
i think it is time . "
diplomacy goes on dr rice said : " this morning , as i head back to washington i take with me an emerging consensus on what is necessary for both an urgent ceasefire and a lasting settlement . "
she has been encouraged that the lebanese government itself , including hezbollah , has agreed at least to the principles of a settlement .
however it is not there yet .
there is still a gap between those -lrb- france and others -rrb- that want an " immediate " ceasefire and the us and britain that call for an " urgent " or " sustainable " ceasefire or one " as soon as possible " .
the one would get the fighting stopped now and agree on a settlement afterwards .
the other would get as much agreement on a settlement as possible first and then stop the fighting .
the qana bombing has brought the two positions closer .
international force there are still issues around the force - for example , its size , powers and whether it should be deployed along the lebanon-syria border .
dr rice met with top israeli officials to try to iron out a cease-fire getting hezbollah to accept such a force will be crucial .
and just what happens over the two missing israeli soldiers captured by hezbollah remains unclear .
if the resolution is written under chapter seven of the charter , it will be mandatory for israel to comply .
a statement from an emergency meeting of the security council on sunday did not use the word " immediate " because of us opposition .
war crimes an issue the un secretary general kofi annan did inject a severe new tone , with its own moral pressure , at that meeting .
" there is strong prima facie evidence that both -lsb- sides -rsb- have committed grave breaches of international humanitarian law , " he said .
this is a reference , with regard to israel , to the principle of proportionality and to the bombing of buildings and structures with civilians in or near them - the geneva conventions allow attacks only if such places are making an " effective " military contribution to the opposing side .
as for hezbollah , it has been firing rockets indiscriminately into civilian areas and the un humanitarian chief jan egeland has accused it of using civilians as cover .
human rights watch in new york called on the un " to investigate serious violations of international humanitarian law in the context of the current conflict " .
its director kenneth roth said : " today 's strike on qana ... suggests that the israeli military is treating southern lebanon as a free-fire zone .
the israeli military seems to consider anyone left in the area a combatant who is fair game for attack . "
" such consistent failure to distinguish combatants and civilians is a war crime , " he said .
in a statement , the israel defense forces said : " responsibility for any and all casualties among uninvolved lebanese civilians lies squarely on the shoulders of hezbollah , which abuses civilians as human shields , and on the lebanese government which fails to prevent this . "

the israeli prime minister ehud olmert signalled his determination to carry on when he said in a speech on monday that there would be no ceasefire within the next few days .
the israelis seem intent on widening the so-called " buffer zone " they have been establishing close to the border .
they say they will hold this until an international force arrives .
but that could take some time .
the speech by mr olmert was in marked contrast to the cautious optimism expressed by the us secretary of state condoleezza rice .
speaking in the aftermath of the bombing at qana , she said that a ceasefire might be possible by the end of the week .
the bombing appeared to give added urgency to the diplomacy surrounding the middle east conflict , increasing the pressure on the united states to press for a ceasefire sooner rather than later .
even before mr olmert spoke , there were indications that a ceasefire this week might not be easy to achieve .
the israeli defence minister amir peretz told the israeli parliament : " israel will expand its operations against hezbollah ... as much as i am a man of peace , i maintain that we can not accept an immediate ceasefire ... if there is an immediate ceasefire , the extremists will immediately rear their heads . "
and hassan fadlallah , a hezbollah member of the lebanese parliament said : " the cabinet , the resistance and the people are united on their stand .
stopping the israeli aggression is the priority , there is no other discussion , there is no negotiation concerning any other issues .
when the israeli aggression stops , we can then discuss other political issues . "
and president bush himself , in comments on monday , indicated that he still wanted more than a ceasefire .
" we want there to be a long-lasting peace , one that is sustainable , " he said .
' i think it is time ' dr rice laid out the three parts of a resolution : " a ceasefire , the political principles that provide for a long-term settlement , and the authorisation of an international force to support the lebanese army in keeping the peace .
we are working simultaneously on all three tracks so that a cease-fire can be supported by the deployment of an international stabilisation force as soon as possible after security council action . "
the secretary of state was speaking as she left jerusalem to return to the united states after failing to get a meeting with the lebanese prime minister fouad siniora .
he had refused to see her unless she was prepared to discuss an immediate ceasefire .
later , on her plane , she told reporters : " i am going to push very hard to have the un security council resolution this week .
i think it is time . "
diplomacy goes on dr rice said : " this morning , as i head back to washington i take with me an emerging consensus on what is necessary for both an urgent ceasefire and a lasting settlement . "
she has been encouraged that the lebanese government itself , including hezbollah , has agreed at least to the principles of a settlement .
however it is not there yet .
there is still a gap between those -lrb- france and others -rrb- that want an " immediate " ceasefire and the us and britain that call for an " urgent " or " sustainable " ceasefire or one " as soon as possible " .
the one would get the fighting stopped now and agree on a settlement afterwards .
the other would get as much agreement on a settlement as possible first and then stop the fighting .
the qana bombing has brought the two positions closer .
international force there are still issues around the force - for example , its size , powers and whether it should be deployed along the lebanon-syria border .
dr rice met with top israeli officials to try to iron out a cease-fire getting hezbollah to accept such a force will be crucial .
and just what happens over the two missing israeli soldiers captured by hezbollah remains unclear .
if the resolution is written under chapter seven of the charter , it will be mandatory for israel to comply .
a statement from an emergency meeting of the security council on sunday did not use the word " immediate " because of us opposition .

the israeli prime minister ehud olmert signalled his determination to carry on when he said in a speech on monday that there would be no ceasefire within the next few days .
the israelis seem intent on widening the so-called " buffer zone " they have been establishing close to the border .
they say they will hold this until an international force arrives .
but that could take some time .
the speech by mr olmert was in marked contrast to the cautious optimism expressed by the us secretary of state condoleezza rice .
speaking in the aftermath of the bombing at qana , she said that a ceasefire might be possible by the end of the week .
the bombing appeared to give added urgency to the diplomacy surrounding the middle east conflict , increasing the pressure on the united states to press for a ceasefire sooner rather than later .
even before mr olmert spoke , there were indications that a ceasefire this week might not be easy to achieve .
the israeli defence minister amir peretz told the israeli parliament : " israel will expand its operations against hezbollah ... as much as i am a man of peace , i maintain that we can not accept an immediate ceasefire ... if there is an immediate ceasefire , the extremists will immediately rear their heads . "
and hassan fadlallah , a hezbollah member of the lebanese parliament said : " the cabinet , the resistance and the people are united on their stand .
stopping the israeli aggression is the priority , there is no other discussion , there is no negotiation concerning any other issues .
when the israeli aggression stops , we can then discuss other political issues . "
and president bush himself , in comments on monday , indicated that he still wanted more than a ceasefire .
" we want there to be a long-lasting peace , one that is sustainable , " he said .
' i think it is time ' dr rice laid out the three parts of a resolution : " a ceasefire , the political principles that provide for a long-term settlement , and the authorisation of an international force to support the lebanese army in keeping the peace .
we are working simultaneously on all three tracks so that a cease-fire can be supported by the deployment of an international stabilisation force as soon as possible after security council action . "
the secretary of state was speaking as she left jerusalem to return to the united states after failing to get a meeting with the lebanese prime minister fouad siniora .
he had refused to see her unless she was prepared to discuss an immediate ceasefire .
later , on her plane , she told reporters : " i am going to push very hard to have the un security council resolution this week .
i think it is time . "
diplomacy goes on dr rice said : " this morning , as i head back to washington i take with me an emerging consensus on what is necessary for both an urgent ceasefire and a lasting settlement . "
she has been encouraged that the lebanese government itself , including hezbollah , has agreed at least to the principles of a settlement .
however it is not there yet .
there is still a gap between those -lrb- france and others -rrb- that want an " immediate " ceasefire and the us and britain that call for an " urgent " or " sustainable " ceasefire or one " as soon as possible " .
the one would get the fighting stopped now and agree on a settlement afterwards .
the other would get as much agreement on a settlement as possible first and then stop the fighting .
the qana bombing has brought the two positions closer .
international force there are still issues around the force - for example , its size , powers and whether it should be deployed along the lebanon-syria border .
dr rice met with top israeli officials to try to iron out a cease-fire getting hezbollah to accept such a force will be crucial .
and just what happens over the two missing israeli soldiers captured by hezbollah remains unclear .
if the resolution is written under chapter seven of the charter , it will be mandatory for israel to comply .
a statement from an emergency meeting of the security council on sunday did not use the word " immediate " because of us opposition .
war crimes an issue the un secretary general kofi annan did inject a severe new tone , with its own moral pressure , at that meeting .
" there is strong prima facie evidence that both -lsb- sides -rsb- have committed grave breaches of international humanitarian law , " he said .
this is a reference , with regard to israel , to the principle of proportionality and to the bombing of buildings and structures with civilians in or near them - the geneva conventions allow attacks only if such places are making an " effective " military contribution to the opposing side .
as for hezbollah , it has been firing rockets indiscriminately into civilian areas and the un humanitarian chief jan egeland has accused it of using civilians as cover .
human rights watch in new york called on the un " to investigate serious violations of international humanitarian law in the context of the current conflict " .
its director kenneth roth said : " today 's strike on qana ... suggests that the israeli military is treating southern lebanon as a free-fire zone .

a statement written by the president and read out on tv by his personal secretary said mr castro had undergone surgery to halt internal bleeding .
the cuban leader , who turns 80 this month , said a punishing schedule in recent weeks had affected his health .
this is the first time mr castro has relinquished any of his duties since he came to power in 1959 .
raul castro , the defence minister , has long been designated as his successor should he become incapacitated .
cuba has a communist , one-party system .
stress in his statement , fidel castro said a recent trip to argentina and last week 's anniversary of the cuban revolution had caused him " days and nights of non-stop work " and put him under " extreme stress " .
profile of fidel castro in pictures : reaction to move resulting intestinal bleeding , he said , meant he needed an operation which would require several weeks of rest .
" since our country is threatened by the us government under circumstances such as these , " the statement said , mr castro had delegated his functions as president and first secretary of the communist party to his brother raul , who is 75 .
a major celebration had been planned for 13 august - the veteran leader 's 80th birthday - but the event has now been postponed until december .
the bbc 's stephen gibbs in havana says the fact that the cuban leader did not appear in person to read the letter has added to speculation about the gravity of his condition .
have your say " like 95 % of cuban-americans i am extremely happy about this news " george , new york city , usa send us your comments he says there is no question that something serious is happening , and this may be a major turning point for cuba .
handing over the reins of power will be a shock to many cubans , 70 % of whom have known no other leader , our correspondent says - and the external enemies of mr castro will doubtless believe this is the moment for change .
fidel castro has been among the world 's longest-ruling leaders - outlasting nine us presidents .
glee in us the news prompted scenes of wild celebration on the streets of miami on monday night , as thousands of people danced , banged cooking pots and chanted " cuba , cuba , cuba ! "
profile : raul castro handover dominates press " there has never been anything that has given the people so much hope , " armando tellez , 33 , told the news agency ap .
others , like miguel saavedra , the leader of a conservative cuban exile group , speculated that mr castro had already died .
" castro is dead ... why is he dead ?
because the government they give a lot of information to the whole world that castro passed his power to the brother ... this news now is the best news ... for 48 years , " mr saavedra said .
but others were more circumspect , noting that mr castro has survived several health scares .
in 2001 , he fainted briefly during a speech .
and in 2004 , tv cameras captured the moment when mr castro slipped and fell , breaking his knee and fracturing his arm .
the white house said it was monitoring the situation , but did not wish to speculate on mr castro 's health .
" we will continue to work for the day of cuba 's freedom , " said spokesman peter watkins .

" since our country is threatened by the us government under circumstances such as these , " the statement said , mr castro had delegated his functions as president and first secretary of the communist party to his brother raul , who is 75 .
a major celebration had been planned for 13 august - the veteran leader 's 80th birthday - but the event has now been postponed until december .

the white house said it was monitoring the situation , but did not wish to speculate on mr castro 's health .

these days , of course , mtv is less of a tv station than an international conglomerate , broadcasting to 1.3 billion people in 179 countries via 78 different channels .
its moves into original programming has led to such hits as beavis and butt-head , the osbournes and jackass , while its movie arm has produced oscar-nominated titles like murderball and hustle and flow .
launched on 1 august 1981 , the fledgling tv channel captured the public imagination with pop videos " on demand " , competitions and enthusiastic " vjs " -lrb- video jockeys -rrb- who became almost as famous as the stars they introduced .
groundbreaking moments in its early years included the world premiere of michael jackson 's thriller video , the live aid concerts in 1985 and the birth of the mtv video music awards .
' strong stomach ' the launch of mtv europe in 1987 saw the station extend its influence outside the us for the first time .
have your say " i have loved mtv since i first got cable in 1997 " jennifer , netherlands send us your comments it also saw a new influx of on-screen presenters , among them davina mccall - who was talent-spotted while working for the company as a receptionist .
" in mtv you could start in the kitchen and end up a presenter - it was that kind of place , " the big brother host said .
bbc radio 1 dj edith bowman was another wannabe who got her big break through the channel after it launched mtv uk in 1997 .
to be a vj , she recalled , required " a strong stomach , originality and confidence " .
" what was lovely about mtv was that there was no stereotypical vj , " added mccall .
" every one was different because it was based around your taste in music . "
as the network expanded , however , the reliance on back-to-back videos decreased in line with the growth of non-music programming .
political conscience with specialised spin-off channels focusing on individual music genres , the main network moved into stunt shows like jackass and punk 'd , animated cartoons and the real world - a reality series that predated big brother by seven years .
the osbournes made its tv debut in 2002 , with pimp my ride - a show devoted to the extravagant retooling of motor cars - following two years later .
the station also developed a political conscience , mobilising young voters with such memorable slogans as " rock the vote " and " choose or lose " .
its diversification into other areas can be attributed in part to the rise of the internet , which provided a rival outlet for showcasing , packaging and distributing music to the so-called " mtv generation " .
but it can also be seen as a response to the proliferation of competing music channels , many of which - such as vh1 - were produced by the same company .
given the way music television has evolved in the 25 years since the channel was launched , that famous sting refrain from the dire straits song money for nothing - " i want my mtv " - now seems a nostalgic anachronism .
that the channel has survived and flourished , however , is a testament to its canny understanding of popular trends and the global audience .

shrub and grassland next to the narrow gauge line from alston in cumbria to kirkhaugh in northumberland has become tinder dry due to record temperatures .
three trackside fires last week were blamed on sparks from the locomotive .
now the volunteer-run south tynedale railway has decided to replace tourist steam engines with diesel trains .
a spokesman for the organisation said : " on 28 july , sparks from the steam locomotive hauling passenger trains along the line that day , caused three fires to stretches of grassed trackside , which had to be extinguished later that day .
' substantial rainfall ' " therefore to reduce the risk of further line side fires being caused due to the dry and warm weather at present , it has been decided to suspend the use of steam locomotives on passenger trains until further notice .
" this means that trains will be diesel hauled until there has been a substantial amount of rainfall . "
steam trains were scheduled to operate on the line between 17 july and 3 september .
the south tynedale railway operates narrow gauge passenger trains along a two mile line along the scenic south tyne valley between alston and kirkhaugh .
the line is built along part of the former 13 mile long standard gauge haltwhistle to alston branch , which was closed by british rail in 1976 .

a spokesman for the organisation said : " on 28 july , sparks from the steam locomotive hauling passenger trains along the line that day , caused three fires to stretches of grassed trackside , which had to be extinguished later that day .
' substantial rainfall ' " therefore to reduce the risk of further line side fires being caused due to the dry and warm weather at present , it has been decided to suspend the use of steam locomotives on passenger trains until further notice .
" this means that trains will be diesel hauled until there has been a substantial amount of rainfall . "
steam trains were scheduled to operate on the line between 17 july and 3 september .
the south tynedale railway operates narrow gauge passenger trains along a two mile line along the scenic south tyne valley between alston and kirkhaugh .
the line is built along part of the former 13 mile long standard gauge haltwhistle to alston branch , which was closed by british rail in 1976 .

the scottish crop research institute in dundee has identified how vitamin c is produced in blackcurrant bushes and now hopes to improve the process .
the £ 1.2m study aims to increase vitamin levels and fruit quality by altering starch deposits on the plant .
it is hoped the crop improvements will give uk farmers a competitive edge .
scri team leader dr robert hancock said the research , which does not involve genetic modification , would benefit consumers .
" vitamin c is vital to tissue growth and repair and gives a big boost to the immune system , but because it dissolves in water the body can not store it .
" we need to eat vitamin c-rich food every day , but people just do not get enough .
" blackcurrants contain more vitamin c than oranges , so boosting that even further can only be a good thing . "
the research , which is also being conducted at east malling research in kent , is part-funded by glaxosmithkline , the pharmaceutical company that manufactures ribena .
' real benefits ' other funders include the biotechnology and biological sciences research council -lrb- bbsrc -rrb- , the horticulture development council and the scottish executive .
bbsrc director prof nigel brown said : " bbsrc is a strong supporter of this type of research where basic plant science can help to improve the dietary and health benefits of popular foodstuffs .
" this is an example of how collaboration between different research groups with public and commercial funding can produce real benefits for consumers , producers and the uk food industry . "
blackcurrant varieties bred at the scri are grown all over the world , accounting for more than half the global crop .
the different types of berry are all named after scottish mountains , such as ben hope , ben tirran and ben alder .

the scottish crop research institute in dundee has identified how vitamin c is produced in blackcurrant bushes and now hopes to improve the process .
the £ 1.2m study aims to increase vitamin levels and fruit quality by altering starch deposits on the plant .
it is hoped the crop improvements will give uk farmers a competitive edge .
scri team leader dr robert hancock said the research , which does not involve genetic modification , would benefit consumers .
" vitamin c is vital to tissue growth and repair and gives a big boost to the immune system , but because it dissolves in water the body can not store it .
" we need to eat vitamin c-rich food every day , but people just do not get enough .
" blackcurrants contain more vitamin c than oranges , so boosting that even further can only be a good thing . "
the research , which is also being conducted at east malling research in kent , is part-funded by glaxosmithkline , the pharmaceutical company that manufactures ribena .
' real benefits ' other funders include the biotechnology and biological sciences research council -lrb- bbsrc -rrb- , the horticulture development council and the scottish executive .
bbsrc director prof nigel brown said : " bbsrc is a strong supporter of this type of research where basic plant science can help to improve the dietary and health benefits of popular foodstuffs .
" this is an example of how collaboration between different research groups with public and commercial funding can produce real benefits for consumers , producers and the uk food industry . "

some 60,000 employees will benefit from the windfall , which represents about 5 % of annual salaries .
the announcement was made as the bank reported a 17 % rise in half-year pre-tax profits to £ 2.65bn.
hbos - formed after halifax merged with bank of scotland in 2001 - also said it would lift its share buyback to £ 1bn .
it had originally said it was planning to buy back £ 750m of its shares .
hbos said it had seen bad debts in its retail arm rise " in line with general trends in the sector " . "
today 's results show with real clarity organic growth is at the absolute core of what we 're about " andy hornby , chief executive , hbos like other banks - which have also been posting results in recent days - the firm has tightened criteria for lending to reduce bad debt .
the bank 's results come a day after rival hsbc reported half-year profits of $ 12.5bn - as its chief executive , michael geoghegan told the financial times he was worried that people were being encouraged to file for bankruptcy rather than pay their debts .
new chief hbos 's latest earnings come as andy hornby takes over at the helm of the firm .
at 38 years old , mr hornby is the youngest bank chief executive in europe .
" today 's results show with real clarity organic growth is at the absolute core of what we 're about , " mr hornby told reuters .
hbos said in the uk it had " targeted growth selectively in markets where we see the most attractive prospects for sustainable growth " but that it was not overly dependent on any one product or line .
while retail sales , house prices and the economy " are all performing better than expected " making an interest rate rise likely , if rates do rise hbos said it was unlikely to have much of an impact on its business .
the bank said that during the past six months it had seen a further 400,000 people open current accounts with the firm , a rise of 29 % on the same period in 2005 .

more than 70 % of women had made serious attempts to diet in the last year and 58 % had " disordered " eating patterns .
most of the 2,000 women questioned by top sante magazine were unhappy with their bodies and half had had cosmetic surgery , or would consider it .
experts warned eating disorders could affect people of all ages and urged women not to look for quick fixes .
the average woman over the age of 40 wants to weigh less than she did at 20 and would like to be 9st 7lb instead of her current weight of 11st 11lb , the survey results showed .
she rates her body as three-and-a-half out of 10 , compared with seven out of 10 for the body they had when they were younger , and particularly hates her middle , hips and thighs and the tops of her arms .
what is worrying is that women appear to be turning to inappropriate means of taking control of their weight and shape eating disorders association spokesman women said they found it harder to lose weight once they hit 40 , and over a third said they were constantly on a diet .
worryingly , more than half of women admitted to a disordered way of eating - skipping breakfast , having a snack for lunch or having wine and chocolate instead of a proper dinner so they can still have treats while trying to keep trim .
a third said they had taken slimming pills or laxatives , and women also admitted they had fasted and tried hypnosis to lose weight .
the majority of women said they envied women their own age who had good bodies .
they blamed ageing , pregnancy and menopause for their weight gain .
cosmetic surgery figures from the british association of aesthetic plastic surgeons for 2005 show that cosmetic surgery is becoming more popular women had 19,601 procedures in 2005 compared with 15,019 in 2004 .
anti-ageing procedures have seen a particular rise in popularity , with a 42 % rise in facelifts and a 50 % rise in eyelid surgery .
a spokesperson for the eating disorders association said : " this research has concluded what we always suspected - that people of all ages are concerned about issues with weight and shape .
" what is worrying is that women appear to be turning to inappropriate means of taking control of their weight and shape .
" it 's vitally important to follow an appropriate diet and to take exercise .
" quick fixes and pharmaceutical fixes are likely to lead to problems .
abusing slimming pills and laxatives can have a dramatic effect on your health .
" we live in a society where undue emphasis is placed on body image and shape and many people fall into the trap of imagining that changing their weight or shape will solve other emotional problems in their lives . "

she rates her body as three-and-a-half out of 10 , compared with seven out of 10 for the body they had when they were younger , and particularly hates her middle , hips and thighs and the tops of her arms .
what is worrying is that women appear to be turning to inappropriate means of taking control of their weight and shape eating disorders association spokesman women said they found it harder to lose weight once they hit 40 , and over a third said they were constantly on a diet .
worryingly , more than half of women admitted to a disordered way of eating - skipping breakfast , having a snack for lunch or having wine and chocolate instead of a proper dinner so they can still have treats while trying to keep trim .
a third said they had taken slimming pills or laxatives , and women also admitted they had fasted and tried hypnosis to lose weight .
the majority of women said they envied women their own age who had good bodies .
they blamed ageing , pregnancy and menopause for their weight gain .
cosmetic surgery figures from the british association of aesthetic plastic surgeons for 2005 show that cosmetic surgery is becoming more popular women had 19,601 procedures in 2005 compared with 15,019 in 2004 .
anti-ageing procedures have seen a particular rise in popularity , with a 42 % rise in facelifts and a 50 % rise in eyelid surgery .
a spokesperson for the eating disorders association said : " this research has concluded what we always suspected - that people of all ages are concerned about issues with weight and shape .
" what is worrying is that women appear to be turning to inappropriate means of taking control of their weight and shape .
" it 's vitally important to follow an appropriate diet and to take exercise .
" quick fixes and pharmaceutical fixes are likely to lead to problems .
abusing slimming pills and laxatives can have a dramatic effect on your health .
" we live in a society where undue emphasis is placed on body image and shape and many people fall into the trap of imagining that changing their weight or shape will solve other emotional problems in their lives . "

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- panorama -pipe- faith , hate and charity : transcript home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics version -pipe- accessibility help help bbc news more programmes file on 4 newsnight this world more ...
last updated : tuesday , 1 august 2006 , 10:11 gmt 11:11 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version faith , hate and charity : transcript nb : this transcript was typed from a transcription unit recording and not copied from an original script : because of the possibility of mis-hearing and the difficulty , in some cases of identifying individual speakers , the bbc cannot vouch for its accuracy .
panorama faith , hate & charity recorded from transmission : bbc one date : 30:07:06 john ware : this is a promotion for one of britain 's leading islamic charities called interpal .
" interpal , helping palestinians in need . "
ware : interpal does help palestinians who are greatly in need .
yusuf : we are for humanity , we are all for life .
ware : why then has interpal given funds to some organisations that promote death ?
-lsb- muslim children performing -rsb- give me the kalashnikov if you are thinking of giving up the fight .
ware : death in the cause of islam .
-lsb- children performing -rsb- for the sake of glory to religion we give our blood .
ware : interpal is at the heart of a global coalition of islamic charities , led by the spiritual leader of the largest islamic ideological movement in the world .
yusuf qaradawi : -lsb- preaching -rsb- we must plant the love of death and the love of martyrdom in the islamic nation .
ware : this is the story of how charity in britain has helped spread the ideology of the muslim brotherhood , which is largely peaceful , but which also likes to keep its options open .
-lsb- children performing -rsb- fasten your bomb belt oh would-be martyr and fill the square with blood so that we get back our homeland .
john ware ware : last january a political earthquake reshaped the middle east .
a group of fundamentalists regarded by western governments as terrorists , took power here in palestine .
the new palestinian government is run by hamas , for whom religion and politics are fused as one .
i 'm on my way to a charity in the west bank .
the old palestinian regime was regarded as corrupt .
hamas has won a reputation for honesty , based largely on how they 've run charities , many with funds from the british islamic charity interpal .
this kindergarten is run by a charity called the khalil al-rahman girls ' association .
it 's one of about 20 charities in the hebron area that have been funded by interpal over the years .
today it 's closed , it 's friday , it 's a muslim holiday .
no doubt many of the charities activities are jolly and wholesome , but some will chill the heart .
-lsb- children performing -rsb- we will sacrifice ourselves for our country .
we answer your call and make of our skulls a ladder to your glory .. a ladder ..
ware : the charity thanks interpal for its funding , which lasted 4 years .
this included money for food and education .
the children are taught that islam is more than just a faith , it 's also a political ideology .
-lsb- children performing -rsb- rise with us to liberate palestine through the path of the islamic dawah .
whoever abandons the path of muslims will live under humiliation and slavery .
ware : dawah means missionary work , bringing people closer to islam .
for a political movement like hamas , dawah is militant political preaching , often aimed at impressionable minds .
dr reuven paz former head , research division israel general security service children are the main focus for hamas dawah , because the principal is building the army of god .
the army of allah - jundullah , in arabic .
ware : these children learn there can be no compromise with israel , because the entire holy land was bequeathed to muslims .
-lsb- children performing -rsb- we assert that what is on this land and under this sky is muslim .
the brigades are preparing their lions to destroy the state of lies .
to victory in the decisive moment . -rsb-
-lsb- applause -rsb- ware : by law , british charities like interpal must ensure their funds are n't used to further the ideologies of terrorist groups .
hamas emerged in 1987 , as the palestinian branch of the worlds largest ideological islamic group , the muslim brotherhood .
here , in towns like ramallah , capital of the west bank , the brotherhood had been digging its roots deep into palestinian society for many years .
the brotherhood used charities to spread its dawah , calling palestinians to return to the fundamentals of islam .
mouin rabbani international crisis group the muslim brotherhood were very much a social movement , for whom the concept of charity and social welfare was an important component of what 's called dawah , which i think , loosely translated , might be translated as causalitisation .
ware : hamas capitalised on the brotherhood 's social welfare network , to turn growing numbers of observant muslims , into followers of their more militant and political version of islam .
is hamas in the social welfare business only to do good works ?
rabbani : no , of course not .
it 's a political organisation , that has a series of defined objectives , among which is increasing its .. the popular allegiance to it among its constituents .
ware : mosques , especially , have been used to inculcate hamas consciousness into young palestinians .
interpal funds religious activates .
it 's transferred money to the abdul nasser mosque in ramallah .
the mosque is quite obviously influenced by hamas .
rabbani : people or charities who are sending money to islamic charities in palestine , that are clearly controlled by hamas , are helping in the growth of the movement .
ware : in britain interpal had a prominent stall at this recent exhibition in london , to promote islam .
interpal has been raising around £ 4 million a year .
the charity categorically denies it 's helping to fund the hamas movement behind the banner of humanitarian aid .
the man who runs interpal has blamed such allegations on what he calls the " christian and jewish zionist movement . "
doctor essam mustafa , known also as essam yusuf , says he 'd consider stopping funds to any charity inciting violence .
dr essam yusuf vice chairman & managing trustee , interpal we are for humanity , we are all for life .
and this is what interpal is here for , and this is what interpal wish , and will , continue to do so in the future , inshallah .
ware : doctor yusef was celebrating interpal 's 10th anniversary at the british library where he was awarded a degree from the islamic university of gaza for his charity work .
december 2004 -lsb- yusuf receiving degree -rsb- -lsb- applause -rsb- ware : the university is a muslim brotherhood stronghold , the crucible of hamas ' holy war ideology .
doctor yusef declined to be interviewed .
but he has said : " we categorically deny we are , in any way , connected to any political organisation . "
and yet , his funds have helped build up hamas into what it is today .
a guest at interpal 's anniversary dinner was his friend , fellow palestinian mohammed sawalha .
from london , sawalha is said to have master minded much of hamas ' political and military strategy .
wanted by israel , he fled to london in 1990 .
paz : sawalha was one of the senior activists in the dawah portals of hamas .
he was involved , let 's say , with the background of the finance , the logistic assistance .
ware : but he was in hamas ?
dr reuven paz former head , research division israel general security service he was , he was a member , he was an activist of hamas , that 's for sure .
ware : in london , sawalha is alleged to have directed funds , both for hamas ' armed wing , and for spreading its missionary dawah .
then , in january 1993 , an operation sawalha was involved in went badly wrong .
hamas would be forced to reorganise its funding arrangements .
reconstruction ware : a senior hamas man from america flew into london for instructions from sawalha .
sawalha 's visitor was en route to the palestinian territories .
the two men travelled to sawalha 's home .
his visitor 's name was mohammed salah .
salah 's mission was to distribute funds .
sawalha told him who to meet in the palestinian territories .
paz : mohammed sawalha told mohammed salah to look as a respectable businessman , where to hide the suitcase , to take not to fancy hotel , etc , etc , and to be very cautious .
ware : with sawalha 's agreement salah began distributing about a quarter of a million dollars to local hamas operatives .
some was ear marked for military activities .
some for missionary dawah .
more money was in the pipe line from his bank in chicago .
but the israeli 's had been tracking him .
stopped at a check point as he left gaza , salah was arrested .
march 1993 ware : salah ended up doing nearly 5 years in an israeli jail , where the israeli 's got a lot out of him about mohammed sawalha in london , and hamas ' funding operation .
during one interrogation , salah was taped without his knowledge .
audio recording of salah 's interrogation ware : salah refers to sawalha as abu abada reconstruction salah : i made a stop in london to meet with abu abada , who is more knowledge about the west bank 's operational activities .
see , the operational and the dawah .
interrogator : i did n't understand .
one more time .
do you mean that abu abada is to be in charge of the dawah and of the movement .
salah : yes .
ware : although abu abada , mohammed sawalha , was known to mi5 , the authorities let him operate freely here .
paz : maybe even in london , i would say , he became more important for hamas than during the period he was in the territories .
ware : in london hamas and the islamic charity world were linking up .
mohammed sawalha had become friendly with the man who was to become boss of interpal , essam yusef .
intelligence sources say that in 1992 they had a visitor from the west bank .
his name was doctor mahmoud ramahi , a senior member of hamas .
doctor ramahi had been recruited to hamas by sawalha , who was his brother-in-law .
doctor yusuf told us he did n't recall meeting doctor ramahi in london .
at the time doctor yusuf was a trustee of a charity called the palestine and lebanon relief fund .
at his london meeting , according to our sources , doctor ramahi of hamas was asked to represent doctor yusuf 's charity in the palestinian territories .
in ramallah i arranged to meet doctor ramahi .
i wanted to ask him about his london meeting 14 years ago .
today he 's a successful doctor , and a senior hamas politician .
at the time he ran a medical centre , part of a charity closely affiliated to hamas .
doctor ramahi told me that in london he 'd simply asked for charitable funds from essam yusuf .
when you travelled to london , you were n't travelling as a member of the political office of hamas ?
dr mahmoud ramahi hamas no , no .
no , it 's for my job as chairman of the medical centre .
and i was the fund for this centre not because of hamas , not that i go to london and meet essam yusuf because we are members of hamas , no .
as a principle we have to help the poor people .
ware : for hamas though there can be more to helping the poor than just religion .
ramahi : for all muslims the politics is what 's inside the religion .
you ca n't separate the religion from the politics .
the politics is one part of the religion .
ware : 8 months after his trip to london , doctor ramahi was arrested by the israeli 's .
reconstruction december 1992 ware : hundreds more hamas men were deported to lebanon .
hamas was reeling .
money was its life blood , now it was being cut off .
the fight for hamas ' survival began , led by its network of supporters outside palestine .
in october 1993 a group of 25 muslims from canada and america arrived at philadelphia in the united states .
the most intractable conflict in the most volatile region of the world had begun to look as if it might be settled .
13th september 1993 -lsb- footage : rabin , arafat and clinton -rsb- ware : the israeli 's and palestinians had just signed a peace agreement known as the oslo accords .
hamas ' supporters on the outside were determined to help hamas on the inside destroy the peace process .
the group met at this hotel , all followers of the muslim brotherhood movement .
some ran islamic charities , others pressure groups .
the fbi was watching .
they described the group as muslim fundamentalists .
dale watson former assistant director fbi counterterrorism division their public persona was something very legal , looked very good , but yet if you looked behind the scene , so to speak , or behind the curtain , we knew this was n't the boy scouts .
reconstruction ware : the fbi bugged their rooms , and the meeting room where they spent most of the weekend in conference .
watson : we realised there was an orchestrated effort here to pretty much try to hide their identity - 1 -rrb- and 2 -rrb- make sure that they stayed under the radar scope , so to speak .
ware : fbi transcripts of this marathon session show that hamas , on the outside , was to follow a secret and subversive agenda , but one with a respectable public face .
privately they would do everything they could to destroy the oslo peace process , whilst publicly never speaking against it .
this was the blueprint for hamas ' survival , hammered out not in the back streets of gaza , but here in a suburban american hotel .
reconstruction ware : the participants referred to themselves simply as " the movement . "
they were careful not to use the word hamas .
participant : the goals we are taking about are in our hearts .
we ca n't put them down .
ware : to the muslim brothers at philadelphia there could be no compromise with the more secular palestinian leadership of talking peace , and never with israel .
participant : as a matter of fact a final decision has been made to continue the struggle indefinitely , whatever the circumstances .
ware : but , how to win this struggle ?
participant : the answer is to adhere to a strategy that can make the accord fail .
ware : one strategy was to direct more funds from islamic charities in america , to islamic charities in palestine who 'd be more receptive to hamas ' ideology .
participant : to defeat the accord we should make services available to the population .
ware : but , with a bias towards one section of the population .
participant : our relation has to be good with everyone , but we can give the islamists 100,000 , and 5,000 to the others .
ware : but those at philadelphia were only too aware of the fate of doctor ramahi .
arrested while distributing hamas funds and organising demonstrations , whilst also running a charity .
the expansion of missionary dawah was threatened by this mix of hamas and charity work .
a fundamental reorganisation of hamas ' funding system was proposed .
participant : the physician who fund the centre , and who was in charge of almost everything , and who was active and efficient , got mixed up , and was investigated and imprisoned .
what happened to him affected the institution drastically .
there should be no mix of the two works .
ware : no mix between overt hamas activity , and charitable work to safeguard dawah .
participant : we have to avoid being labelled terrorists , or terrorism supporters .
ware : keeping intact the hidden purpose of destroying the peace process by building grass root support for hamas .
participant : those brothers whom you help doing these things will ultimately by loyal to you politically .
dale watson former assistant director fbi counterterrorism division it was clear that we were not talking about just taking care of widows , orphans and hospitals , and it was a promotion of the organisation , their beliefs and ideas .
ware : but of course raising money for needy people is a very plausible , and worthy thing to do .
watson : absolutely , it is a worthy and worthwhile thing to do .
so it was a difficult matter , but if you really peeled of the onion , so to speak , you saw that hey , this is not exactly what it appears to be .
ware : the movement suggested that the funding of hamas associated charities should not be confined to america .
participant : i think the american arena is a secure place for a movement .
europe also can play the same role .
ware : philadelphia provided a model for promoting dawah on the inside , whilst affording legal cover to its funders on the outside .
although interpal 's trustees were n't present , there are striking similarities between the philadelphia model and the way interpal operates .
most of interpal 's funding is directed towards islamic charities .
i 'm on my way to an orphanage near hebron which gets funds from interpal .
the israeli 's found material here glorifying martyrdom .
posters of local militants framed with loving care , obviously by children .
the main hero figure is a local man .
the israelis say he planned the cold blooded murder of 4 jewish students .
the head of the orphanage is waiting to meet me .
hi mr rjoub , thanks for seeing me .
how are you ?
nice to see you .
the israeli 's say these posters were recovered intact , with the framing .
so the reason i 'm asking , mr rjoub , the reason i 'm asking about the framing is were you aware of any pupils or staff putting these frames together ?
hashem rjoub director , dura islamic society for orphans by god , i do n't think so .
we never had things like that .
this is the first time .
i was surprised by these photos .
we have never had any student or teacher who 's an artist .
i , of course , forbid anything like this .
and we only allow hanging things on the school walls which are to do with education .
ware : this is mr rjoub at a hamas rally .
at philadelphia the brotherhood wanted to disassociate charities from obvious hamas activity .
mr rjoub may not be an activist , but he 's certainly a supporter .
and there is a jihadi ethos in his orphanage , quiet , but resolute all the same .
it 's now afternoon prayers , then lessons resume .
interpal helps fund about 50 orphans here .
the teacher explains how he believes islam will , one day , deliver total victory .
teacher : we know the state of israel is something that happened suddenly , which was built upon what was originally there .
so it 's temporary .
ware : ultimate victory is fundamental to the ideology of hamas , a victory hamas insists has been ordained by god . -lsb- to young boy -rsb- who would you like to be ?
who 's your big hero ?
boy : like a mujahid .
ware : a fighter !
fighting for what ?
boy : we will continue to resist the israelis until we get them out .
teacher : i ca n't hear you .
raise your voice .
boy : we will resist the israelis .
ware : how many here want to be fighters ? 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 .
the children seem happy , and well cared for .
whether , overall , the ethos that interpal 's funding goes to support is healthy is less clear .
there was one other thing i wanted to ask you .
i 'm curious about that little sign up there .
what exactly is it ?
rjoub : let me look at it closely .
" do not disappoint the orphan . "
this is a koranic verse .
the koran encourages us to protect the orphan .
ware : and that red colour coming down the arm , and spilling over the world , is that .. does that signify .. what does that signify ?
rjoub : it 's not clear whether it 's blood or not , but in truth it looks like it might be .
ware : mr rjoub told me he 'd never noticed the blood before , even though the plaque had been there 10 years .
and he said the flags were of saudi arabia .
they are , in fact , used by hamas .
it conveys to me a picture of islam dominating the world , and , if necessary , through blood shed .
is that a dreadful exaggeration ?
rjoub : it 's true .
this picture expresses the vision of the person who drew it .
that does n't necessarily mean that these things exist .
ware : do you think you might take it down now i 've pointed it out to you ?
rjoub : yes indeed .
i want to stress that islam has ruled most of the world without blood .
there was no blood , it was through persuasion .
ware : interpal was launched in london in 1994 , 10 months after the muslim brotherhood meeting in philadelphia .
it operates from an anonymous building in cricklewood .
some of interpal 's own trustees have been followers of the brotherhood movement .
newspapers soon reported allegations that interpal was funding hamas .
the charity commission , the body that regulates charities , investigated .
they found no evidence of bias .
interpal distributed funds only on the basis of need .
but need was being determined not by interpal , but by the palestinian charities they helped fund .
at philadelphia some of these charities were named by this man .
the american authorities say muin shabib later admitted supporting hamas financially , and politically .
to his fellow muslim brothers , shabib spoke of charities that interpal would later give funds to as " our institutions . "
reconstruction shabib : in the west bank our institutions include the al tatoman charitable association , the jenin zakat committee , who establish a hospital .
in jerusalem we have the association of islamic studies and cultures .
we have active institutions at ramallah , such as the zakat committee .
ware : to some the israel palestine conflict was about much more than a national liberation issue .
it was the centre of struggle of the entire islamic world .
-lsb- the movement -rsb- participant : our greatest cause is islam .
palestine is only one part of this cause .
we have to stick to the fundamentals , the basics , the foundations of islam .
ware : humanitarian aid would certainly be needed .
a young , mainly conscript , israeli army often used live ammunition against unarmed demonstrators when palestinians staged a second uprising , or intifada , against israel 's occupation of the west bank .
the israeli 's were being hit by wave after wave of suicide bombers , targeting civilians .
dozens of the bombers were hamas .
the israeli 's sealed off towns , sending the palestinian economy into freefall .
interpal 's doctor essam yusuf now expanded his charity work .
he became the key man in a global coalition of islamic charities , with interpal at its heart .
this coalition was called the ' union of good . '
union of good promotional video dr essam yusuf union of good & interpal through that union for good we have managed to create something over than $ 200 million for palestinians in need .
ware : this has been social intervention on a vast scale .
this $ 200 million has bought more than just food and medicine .
it 's also been directed at the motor of missionary dawah .
schools , summer camps , mosques , places where a jihadi ethos has been promoted .
presiding over this global coalition of islamic charities is doctor yusuf qaradawi , spiritual leader of the muslim brotherhood movement , and a favourite of the london mayor .
july 2004 ken livingstone : you are truly welcome , welcome to london , a city of all faiths .
ware : doctor qaradawi 's followers in london , like the fugitive hamas commander mohammed sawalha , were there to greet him .
al-jazeera television ware : his following in the middle east is so big that sheikh qaradawi has his own talk show on al jazeera .
he makes no bones about the relationship between charity and politics .
2001 qaradawi : i do n't like this word " donations . "
i like to call it jihad with money .
because god has ordered us to fight enemies with our lives and our money .
ware : social welfare activism was the power behind the intifada .
for doctor qaradawi the intifada was also islam 's glory .
2001 qaradawi : w must plant the love of death and the love of martyrdom in the islamic nation .
ware : few have done more to fuse theology and politics , fuelling islamism 's global cult of martyrdom and holy war .
2002 qaradawi : the israelis have the nuclear bomb and we have the population bomb .
this population which has a desire for martyrdom and death .
this is what we have !
this is why these human bombs must continue until liberation .
ware : charity commission guidelines require interpal 's trustees to disassociate themselves completely from any hint of support for terrorism .
and yet , on television in the gulf , interpal 's vice chairman has sounded as if he might support terrorism .
2002 with me is brother essam yusuf from qatar .
go ahead brother essam yusuf : peace be with you .
greetings to the sheikh of the mujahideen .
sheikh dr yusuf ql-qaradawi .
the sheikh of heroic stands .
but my biggest salutation is to the mujahideen , to the heroes of the palestinian people who are sacrificing everything that is precious .
john ware doctor yusuf denied his words meant that he supported suicide bombers .
he said he was simply saluting sheikh qaradawi as the sheikh of strugglers .
he did say that he was opposed to suicide bombers targeting innocent people , but it was for others to decide who was innocent .
an article in doctor yusuf 's name also talks of " our battle with the zionist enemy " being a long one .
" and of support for jihad , in all its forms , until god allows for victory .
victory only comes from god . "
to hamas supporters , jihad , in all its forms , includes suicide bombing .
but doctor yusuf insists he never wrote or approved those words .
even though the article was commissioned by his own organisation , the union of good and appeared in his name .
doctor yusuf also denies his union of good website expresses support for hamas .
even though it includes a picture of sheikh yassin , the founder of hamas , on the page of a children 's campaign called the al yassin fund .
israel defence forces vido ware : in 2002 the israeli 's raided many charities associated with hamas .
they also searched the offices of the palestinian authorities security service .
what they discovered suggests , once again , that doctor yusuf broke the rules requiring charity trustees to disassociate themselves from terrorism .
this palestinian report describes the union of good as ' one of the biggest hamas supporters . '
it also discloses that in june 2002 doctor yusuf travelled to yemen , where he met senior members of hamas .
one was doctor mohammed syam , whom he describes as ' brilliant . '
kelly moore : we knew of course that syam was the head of hamas in yemen , and my impression of him is that he 's a terrorist , and supports militant terrorist activities .
fbi video ware : this was a mass wedding , 3 months after doctor yusuf 's visit .
sheikh syam was a guest , but it was n't a celebration of life to come , but of the near certainty of death , for the grooms about to embark on jihad .
the sheikh made an announcement .
sheikh syam : you will read about it tomorrow in the newspapers and hear about it in the media .
it brought down many of the invading occupiers and thanks be to god , lord of the universe .
god is the great and thanks be to god !
-lsb- aftermath - scene of the bombing -rsb- ware : a hamas suicide bomber has just blown up a bus full of passengers in tel aviv , killing 6 people including a student from scotland .
kelly moore former assistant us attorney he 's announcing , somewhat gleefully , and basically proud of the fact that hamas has just carried out a suicide attack in which innocent civilians were killed in israel .
ware : in yemen , doctor yusuf also met sheikh mohammed moyad , now in jail in america for funding hamas , and trying to fund al qaeda .
he ran a charity in the union of good , and he was being investigated by the fbi .
they 'd set up a sting at this hotel in frankfurt .
their informants posed as men who wanted to spend $ 2 million on jihad .
fbi video ware : this video was played at al moyad 's trial .
he offered 4 receipts from islamic charities as proof that he could get money to jihad .
moyad : this one , for instance , we deliver it to hamas .
this one we deliver it to the interior .
this one we send it to the martyrs .
but when we are in front of our government ¿ -lsb- laughter -rsb- ware : one of the receipts was from interpal , for $ 70,000 , which listed items like food , medical aid , and summer camps for children .
moore : in the middle of that conversation room service happened to walk in , in the hotel in frankfurt .
and when they walked in moyad quickly flipped the papers over so that they could n't be seen , and instructed everyone to change the subject , which obviously , if you were talking about charitable matters , he would n't have had to do .
ware : to reassure the fbi informants their money would actually fund jihad , al moyad then offered these details about interpal .
al moyad : it 's interpal .
it 's a company which i visited in london , and i sat with them there .
they 're good .
ware : al moyad said that , in london , he 'd dealt personally with interpal 's managing trustee , doctor essam yusuf .
moyad : i sat with essam , he 's one of the best people .
he is , tell him , the assistant , the one responsible for things after sheikh al-qaradawi in the union of good .
participant : are they hamas as well ?
moyad : they are working for all of the islamic jihad .
so this is hamas also .
ware : doctor yusuf acknowledges he met al moyad in yemen , but says it was solely to do with raising funds for palestinians in need .
he insists sheikh syam , who gleefully announced the suicide bombing , just happened to be present at one of his meetings .
the vice chairman of interpal , doctor essam yusuf , has said many times that neither he nor interpal have any connections , any links , of any kind , with hamas .
what 's your response to that ?
moore : given that he was meeting with moyad and mohammed syam , moyad who 's now been convicted of terrorism crimes related to hamas , and syam who was the known leader of hamas in yemen , he clearly has links to hamas .
those are links to hamas .
ware : it is because doctor yusuf runs both interpal , and the union of good , that the american authorities have put interpal at the very heart of hamas ' global fundraising operation .
interpal strenuously denies this .
you describe interpal as the funding coordinator for hamas .
that .. you 're ascribing interpal a very central role there .
daniel glaser : yes , we are .
ware : and that 's still the position as far as you 're concerned ?
glaser : absolutely .
ware : the us and european union have outlawed both the political and military wings of hamas .
they regard it as one terrorist movement , and its social welfare network as integral to the movement .
daniel glaser us treasury it becomes difficult to separate its social welfare network out from what hamas actually is , which is a network dedicated to violence and extremism .
the fact that they provide these social services , legitimises that ideology , it radicalises populations , it provides an over arching legitimisation and cover for what is ultimately a terrorist organisation .
ware : the americans designated interpal as a terrorist entity in 2003 .
once again the charity commission launched an investigation , and once again they found no evidence that interpal had any links to hamas .
for the americans it was a bewildering decision .
senate hearing 25th september 2003 david aufhauser general counsel , us treasury what happened with interpal in britain is really quite chilling .
this .. these were the best of our friends .
if we can not convince them to join us against one of the primary funders of hamas , in the millions of dollars , within weeks after the designation by the eu of hamas as a foreign terrorist organisation , it gives you some taste of how difficult it is to get other , less friendly , nations to join us .
ware : the charity commission , which regulates charities , pledges that any allegation of links to terrorism will be assessed rigorously .
this is not a cheap point .
the word investigation seems to dignify what you actually did .
it does n't sound to me as if you conducted an investigation .
kenneth dibble charity commission the enquiry we undertook in 1996 was different from the one we undertook in 2003 , they had a different focus .
ware : so it 's not .. it would n't be fair to describe 2003 as a rigorous investigation .
dibble : it was an investigation which followed a particular concern , and focus .
ware : but it was n't widespread .
dibble : it was n't in depth .
ware : interpal may not have been buying guns , but emphatically its funds were going to charities inextricably linked to hamas .
just how much influence hamas has over some charities funded by interpal can require the judgement of solomon , though the charity commission are n't perhaps the best people to make that judgement , since their investigators have n't actually set foot here on the west bank .
the commission has avoided taking a stand on a defining issue of the age , on where exactly islamic piety bleeds into islamist politics .
instead they 've relied on what interpal boasts are their eyes and ears on the ground , the palestinian charities their money goes to .
hebron is one of hamas ' power bases in the west bank .
the sign says ' welcome to the city of hamas . '
welcome to the city of hamas ware : as we drove through the city we came across a hamas celebration .
the guest of honour was a hamas man , mustafa shawer , who 'd just been released by the israeli 's after being detained for 20 months without trial .
how do you do , can we talk to you ?
mr shawer is a professor at hebron university , teaching islamic culture and law .
i asked him why hamas had won the election .
mustafa shawer hamas i think the main reason the islamic movement has been successful is the people 's love of islam .
the think that their worldly interests forget about the after life and paradise require a person who is religious , who can be trusted with public money and serve the public honestly .
ware : the lion 's share of interpal 's funding in hebron has gone to the city 's biggest charity .
promotional video the islamic charitable society strives day and night to care and cater for orphans , and the needy .
ware : at philadelphia , the brotherhood movement urged charitable funding to create employment and economic power centres for hamas supporters .
that 's happened in hebron .
here workers receive their salaries from the charities sewing workshop .
the treatment 's also available from the charities clinic .
and , thanks to interpal , bread from the charity 's bakery is delivered to poorer families .
hamas may now be the palestinian government , but its supporters do n't tend to talk openly about its activities .
what about the islamic charitable society of hebron ?
is that part of the social welfare network of hamas ?
shawer : this talk is not true .
ware : but it does appear to be true .
the hebron charity 's own website in 2004 showed that mr shawer himself was then a member of its administrative board .
several other senior figures have belonged to hamas , including abdul al haliq al nache , seen here at a rally .
he 's now hamas ' most senior man in jail .
the charities current chairman is also a member of hamas .
the charity runs two large orphanages , and schools for boys and girls .
the term orphan includes children who have parents who ca n't look after them .
interpal 's funds help the charity give these boys an education , and holidays .
what 's your favourite lesson ?
saif badran the language , the arabic language .
ware : arabic language ?
badran : yes .
ware : why arabic language ?
badran : because the first thing is .. it 's my language , and it 's the language of the koran .
ware : what does the koran mean to you ?
badran : i learn from it everything .
how to life .. it 's the way of my life .
ware : this is a photograph of a school event .
flags used by hamas are prominently to the fore .
several former pupils have joined hamas ' armed wing .
at least two have aspired to the goal set by doctor qaradawi ' a passion for death in the cause of islam . '
they became suicide bombers .
one was raed abul marsq , pictured here with his two children before strapping on an 11 pound bomb packed with nails , and boarding a jerusalem bus , killing 23 .
nearby is the girls ' orphanage and school , also run by the islamic charitable society of hebron to which interpal also gives substantial funds .
the entrance to the school is adorned by two hamas flags .
i went to see the principal , her name is fateheya qawasmeh .
we 're from the bbc .
how do you do ?
mrs qawasmeh was a hamas candidate in the recent election .
she is the mother of six children , whom she says have been brought up to love martyrdom , and famously , widow of abdullah , an iconic local commander of hamas , which is proud to repeat israel 's description of him as a battery farmer of martyrs .
mrs qawasmeh says her late husband chose her for his wife because of her love of dawah .
fateheya qawasmeh head , al sharia girls ' school hebron we are here to fulfil an educational role .
the political role is outside the school .
ware : you say you leave your political beliefs outside , but of course i could n't help notice two large hamas flags right outside your door .
qawasmeh : where are they ?
ware : where exactly , show me where ?
qawasmeh : where are they ?
ware : i saw two flags hanging outside the door .
qawasmeh : this flag is n't only the hamas flag , it 's also the saudi flag , is n't it ?
ware : but this is n't saudi arabia , this is the west bank .
why are you flying the flag of saudi arabia ?
qawasmeh : this flag represents muslims in general , whether it 's saudi arabia , palestine , anywhere , anywhere .
ware : so it 's a coincidence that it happens to be the same flag as hamas , and that you stood for hamas in the election ?
that 's just a coincidence ?
qawasmeh : saudi arabia is a muslim country and it represents the islamic world , since holy mecca is in it .
ware : although mrs qawasmeh insisted she kept her politics out of the school , i wondered how she managed this , given her fundamentalist views .
i thought the whole ideology of hamas was that you ca n't really separate politics from your faith , because the two are completely bound up in each other .
the two are one , as it were .
qawasmeh : inside the school my duty is simply educational .
outside the school i 'm active in some social work organisations .
ware : this is one social organisation mrs qawasmeh helped set up , the al khalil al rahman girls ' society .
it too has had funds from interpal . -lsb- children perform -rsb- we all sacrifice ourselves for our country .
we answer your call and make of our skulls a ladder to your glory .
ware : ' we answer your call , and make our skulls a ladder to your glory . '
now that 's just one example of young .. very young girls actually , singing songs about martyrdom , and that kind of thing .
that 's politics , is n't it ?
qawasmeh : these songs do n't come from the school .
the girls learn them from their own social environment , from their homes .
we do n't teach these songs in the school .
they 're not on the curriculum .
ware : but at her girl 's society the children are n't exactly discouraged from singing such songs .
-lsb- children perform -rsb- to martyrs in every time and place .
to their rich blood and to their wounds which have defined the identity of the islamic land .
ware : these are not views you would dissent from , i imagine .
qawasmeh : are we banned from talking even about ourselves ?
we 're a group of educationalists , rational people who believe that it 's okay for a human being to speak about his homeland in his songs and his talk .
or are we not allowed to do such a thing , and you lot are allowed everything ?
ware : at this point mrs qawasmeh said she had to go , because her own children were waiting .
i had one more question .
i read that the israeli army searched this orphanage here in august 2004 .
that 's what i read .
that 's not true ?
qawasmeh : it did n't happen .
it definitely did n't happen .
i 'm sure .
nobody came to our orphanage .
ware : so we asked the israeli 's for their evidence .
they took us to this vast hangar on an army base , containing many thousands of files , seized from islamic charities on the west bank .
the army produced four boxes which they said were taken from the girls ' orphanage in hebron on the 12th of august 2004 .
the boxes do contain material which , self evidently , is from the orphanage .
mrs qawasmeh 's denial is simply not credible .
with the boxes came this computer hard drive which the israeli 's say they found in the office of the manageress who ran the orphanage .
on it are the names of all the children , and a lot else besides .
this , quite literally , is a trove of images of hamas martyrs and their exploits - hundreds of them .
nothing is left to the imagination .
bars and buses they 've blown up , the bloody , twisted , and scattered limbs of their victims .
there 's also the odd picture paying homage to osama bin laden .
you 've taken interpal 's word for it , without going to the west bank , that that kind of thing is n't going on , have n't you ?
kenneth dibble charity commission well , i do n't know whether we asked them specifically in terms , because i 'm not aware that that sort of concern has actually been raised with us .
ware : you are kidding !
sorry , surely you have , you 've asked them , in a place like the west bank you surely have said what else is going on in these organisations ?
dibble : i do not believe we have considered that , in terms .
ware : well that is exactly the point , and can you tell me why you have n't considered that , because it 's pretty fundamental , is n't it ?
dibble : well it is , but , as i said , it 's only in recent times that the vulnerability of charities for use for these purposes has actually been recognised .
but i think it 's an issue that you are now raising now and , if i may say so , is quite a pertinent issue to raise .
ware : today the middle east is once again convulsed by hate .
but when this latest battle ends , there will still be hamas .
some in hamas have talked of a possible truce with israel .
others see a struggle that will end only with the end of israel .
interpal says it had always wanted to build on the peace process ..
what it 's helped build is an implacable islamist ideology .
roughly how many charity committees is hamas affiliated to at the moment , would you say ?
dr mahmoud ramahi hamas maybe more than 200 of charitable committees is affiliated to hamas .
some of them they ca n't say that we are affiliated to hamas , because of these struggles , and so and so .
ware : to what extent do you think this charitable work contributed to your substantial victory earlier this year ?
ramahi : yes , they have a big .. they are responsible for the victories that we take , because as you understand ¿ ware : they are responsible ?
ramahi : they are responsible .
ware : the social , hamas ' social ¿ ramahi : the main responsible . -lrb- laughs -rrb- ware : in public the british government is crystal clear about where it stands on support for hamas .
7th july 2004 tony blair : -lsb- speaking in the house -rsb- let me make it absolutely clear .
we want nothing to do with people who support suicide bombers in palestine , or elsewhere , or support terrorists .
ware : and yet officials believe some of interpal 's funds have gone to palestinian charities that engender hamas ' ideology .
last year the treasuries asset freezing working group examined files on charities in six west bank towns .
on hebron a draft report says the islamic charitable society had funded and administered educational programmes that appear tantamount to incitement and indoctrination in support of violent hamas activity .
a year on the government hesitates to do much about it .
meanwhile the muslim brotherhood movement here goes from strength to strength .
and it 's the friend of interpal 's managing trustee who is leading it .
the fugitive hamas commander , mohammed sawalha , is perhaps , the most influential muslim brother in britain today .
he organised the recent islam expo in london , his latest act of missionary dawah to promote what he describes as the real islam .
but , what exactly does mohammed sawalha mean by " real islam " , and how can we explore this without asking him about his background and his real beliefs ?
well , we ca n't , because he wo n't discuss them .
and for all the organiser 's warm words about this exhibition promoting dialogue and understanding , in fact the muslim brotherhood is exercising tight control .
they wo n't even let us in there .
but we found a way in to find interpal 's managing trustee , along with muslim leaders , and some politicians .
the muslim brotherhood movement already dominates many islamic groups here .
islam expo was a further attempt by the movement to position itself as mainstream .
its followers are foot soldiers to the most influential dawah missionary of political islam today , sheikh yusuf qaradawi .
but it is only to middle east audiences that the brotherhood 's spiritual leader , the sheikh of the mujahideen , unveils his prophetic dream .
europe , as he sees it , islam 's next frontier .
1999 yusuf qaradawi : so constantinople has been conquered and now the second part of the prophecy remains , which is the conquest of rome .
this means that islam will return to europe once again .
perhaps the next conquest will be the conquest of dawah and ideas .
there 's no need for conquest to be with the sword .
we might conquer these countries without armies .
we want armies of dawah preachers and teachers .
ware : islam is undergoing a huge revival , here and everywhere , and it is the muslim brotherhood who are leading it .
welcome to the dawah of political islam .
with its high octane blend of politics and religion as potent as any of history 's grand ideas .

panorama faith , hate & charity recorded from transmission : bbc one date : 30:07:06 john ware : this is a promotion for one of britain 's leading islamic charities called interpal .
" interpal , helping palestinians in need . "
ware : interpal does help palestinians who are greatly in need .
yusuf : we are for humanity , we are all for life .
ware : why then has interpal given funds to some organisations that promote death ?

john ware ware : last january a political earthquake reshaped the middle east .
a group of fundamentalists regarded by western governments as terrorists , took power here in palestine .
the new palestinian government is run by hamas , for whom religion and politics are fused as one .
i 'm on my way to a charity in the west bank .
the old palestinian regime was regarded as corrupt .
hamas has won a reputation for honesty , based largely on how they 've run charities , many with funds from the british islamic charity interpal .
this kindergarten is run by a charity called the khalil al-rahman girls ' association .
it 's one of about 20 charities in the hebron area that have been funded by interpal over the years .
today it 's closed , it 's friday , it 's a muslim holiday .
no doubt many of the charities activities are jolly and wholesome , but some will chill the heart .
-lsb- children performing -rsb- we will sacrifice ourselves for our country .
we answer your call and make of our skulls a ladder to your glory .. a ladder ..
ware : the charity thanks interpal for its funding , which lasted 4 years .
this included money for food and education .
the children are taught that islam is more than just a faith , it 's also a political ideology .
-lsb- children performing -rsb- rise with us to liberate palestine through the path of the islamic dawah .
whoever abandons the path of muslims will live under humiliation and slavery .
ware : dawah means missionary work , bringing people closer to islam .
for a political movement like hamas , dawah is militant political preaching , often aimed at impressionable minds .
dr reuven paz former head , research division israel general security service children are the main focus for hamas dawah , because the principal is building the army of god .
the army of allah - jundullah , in arabic .
ware : these children learn there can be no compromise with israel , because the entire holy land was bequeathed to muslims .
-lsb- children performing -rsb- we assert that what is on this land and under this sky is muslim .
the brigades are preparing their lions to destroy the state of lies .
to victory in the decisive moment . -rsb-
-lsb- applause -rsb- ware : by law , british charities like interpal must ensure their funds are n't used to further the ideologies of terrorist groups .
hamas emerged in 1987 , as the palestinian branch of the worlds largest ideological islamic group , the muslim brotherhood .
here , in towns like ramallah , capital of the west bank , the brotherhood had been digging its roots deep into palestinian society for many years .
the brotherhood used charities to spread its dawah , calling palestinians to return to the fundamentals of islam .
mouin rabbani international crisis group the muslim brotherhood were very much a social movement , for whom the concept of charity and social welfare was an important component of what 's called dawah , which i think , loosely translated , might be translated as causalitisation .
ware : hamas capitalised on the brotherhood 's social welfare network , to turn growing numbers of observant muslims , into followers of their more militant and political version of islam .
is hamas in the social welfare business only to do good works ?
rabbani : no , of course not .
it 's a political organisation , that has a series of defined objectives , among which is increasing its .. the popular allegiance to it among its constituents .
ware : mosques , especially , have been used to inculcate hamas consciousness into young palestinians .
interpal funds religious activates .
it 's transferred money to the abdul nasser mosque in ramallah .
the mosque is quite obviously influenced by hamas .
rabbani : people or charities who are sending money to islamic charities in palestine , that are clearly controlled by hamas , are helping in the growth of the movement .
ware : in britain interpal had a prominent stall at this recent exhibition in london , to promote islam .
interpal has been raising around £ 4 million a year .
the charity categorically denies it 's helping to fund the hamas movement behind the banner of humanitarian aid .
the man who runs interpal has blamed such allegations on what he calls the " christian and jewish zionist movement . "
doctor essam mustafa , known also as essam yusuf , says he 'd consider stopping funds to any charity inciting violence .
dr essam yusuf vice chairman & managing trustee , interpal we are for humanity , we are all for life .
and this is what interpal is here for , and this is what interpal wish , and will , continue to do so in the future , inshallah .
ware : doctor yusef was celebrating interpal 's 10th anniversary at the british library where he was awarded a degree from the islamic university of gaza for his charity work .
december 2004 -lsb- yusuf receiving degree -rsb- -lsb- applause -rsb- ware : the university is a muslim brotherhood stronghold , the crucible of hamas ' holy war ideology .
doctor yusef declined to be interviewed .
but he has said : " we categorically deny we are , in any way , connected to any political organisation . "
and yet , his funds have helped build up hamas into what it is today .
a guest at interpal 's anniversary dinner was his friend , fellow palestinian mohammed sawalha .
from london , sawalha is said to have master minded much of hamas ' political and military strategy .
wanted by israel , he fled to london in 1990 .
paz : sawalha was one of the senior activists in the dawah portals of hamas .
he was involved , let 's say , with the background of the finance , the logistic assistance .
ware : but he was in hamas ?
dr reuven paz former head , research division israel general security service he was , he was a member , he was an activist of hamas , that 's for sure .
ware : in london , sawalha is alleged to have directed funds , both for hamas ' armed wing , and for spreading its missionary dawah .
then , in january 1993 , an operation sawalha was involved in went badly wrong .
hamas would be forced to reorganise its funding arrangements .
reconstruction ware : a senior hamas man from america flew into london for instructions from sawalha .
sawalha 's visitor was en route to the palestinian territories .
the two men travelled to sawalha 's home .
his visitor 's name was mohammed salah .
salah 's mission was to distribute funds .
sawalha told him who to meet in the palestinian territories .
paz : mohammed sawalha told mohammed salah to look as a respectable businessman , where to hide the suitcase , to take not to fancy hotel , etc , etc , and to be very cautious .
ware : with sawalha 's agreement salah began distributing about a quarter of a million dollars to local hamas operatives .
some was ear marked for military activities .
some for missionary dawah .
more money was in the pipe line from his bank in chicago .
but the israeli 's had been tracking him .
stopped at a check point as he left gaza , salah was arrested .
march 1993 ware : salah ended up doing nearly 5 years in an israeli jail , where the israeli 's got a lot out of him about mohammed sawalha in london , and hamas ' funding operation .
during one interrogation , salah was taped without his knowledge .
audio recording of salah 's interrogation ware : salah refers to sawalha as abu abada reconstruction salah : i made a stop in london to meet with abu abada , who is more knowledge about the west bank 's operational activities .
see , the operational and the dawah .
interrogator : i did n't understand .
one more time .
do you mean that abu abada is to be in charge of the dawah and of the movement .
salah : yes .
ware : although abu abada , mohammed sawalha , was known to mi5 , the authorities let him operate freely here .
paz : maybe even in london , i would say , he became more important for hamas than during the period he was in the territories .
ware : in london hamas and the islamic charity world were linking up .
mohammed sawalha had become friendly with the man who was to become boss of interpal , essam yusef .
intelligence sources say that in 1992 they had a visitor from the west bank .
his name was doctor mahmoud ramahi , a senior member of hamas .
doctor ramahi had been recruited to hamas by sawalha , who was his brother-in-law .
doctor yusuf told us he did n't recall meeting doctor ramahi in london .
at the time doctor yusuf was a trustee of a charity called the palestine and lebanon relief fund .
at his london meeting , according to our sources , doctor ramahi of hamas was asked to represent doctor yusuf 's charity in the palestinian territories .
in ramallah i arranged to meet doctor ramahi .
i wanted to ask him about his london meeting 14 years ago .
today he 's a successful doctor , and a senior hamas politician .
at the time he ran a medical centre , part of a charity closely affiliated to hamas .
doctor ramahi told me that in london he 'd simply asked for charitable funds from essam yusuf .
when you travelled to london , you were n't travelling as a member of the political office of hamas ?
dr mahmoud ramahi hamas no , no .
no , it 's for my job as chairman of the medical centre .
and i was the fund for this centre not because of hamas , not that i go to london and meet essam yusuf because we are members of hamas , no .
as a principle we have to help the poor people .
ware : for hamas though there can be more to helping the poor than just religion .
ramahi : for all muslims the politics is what 's inside the religion .
you ca n't separate the religion from the politics .
the politics is one part of the religion .
ware : 8 months after his trip to london , doctor ramahi was arrested by the israeli 's .
reconstruction december 1992 ware : hundreds more hamas men were deported to lebanon .
hamas was reeling .
money was its life blood , now it was being cut off .
the fight for hamas ' survival began , led by its network of supporters outside palestine .
in october 1993 a group of 25 muslims from canada and america arrived at philadelphia in the united states .
the most intractable conflict in the most volatile region of the world had begun to look as if it might be settled .
13th september 1993 -lsb- footage : rabin , arafat and clinton -rsb- ware : the israeli 's and palestinians had just signed a peace agreement known as the oslo accords .
hamas ' supporters on the outside were determined to help hamas on the inside destroy the peace process .
the group met at this hotel , all followers of the muslim brotherhood movement .
some ran islamic charities , others pressure groups .
the fbi was watching .
they described the group as muslim fundamentalists .
dale watson former assistant director fbi counterterrorism division their public persona was something very legal , looked very good , but yet if you looked behind the scene , so to speak , or behind the curtain , we knew this was n't the boy scouts .
reconstruction ware : the fbi bugged their rooms , and the meeting room where they spent most of the weekend in conference .
watson : we realised there was an orchestrated effort here to pretty much try to hide their identity - 1 -rrb- and 2 -rrb- make sure that they stayed under the radar scope , so to speak .
ware : fbi transcripts of this marathon session show that hamas , on the outside , was to follow a secret and subversive agenda , but one with a respectable public face .
privately they would do everything they could to destroy the oslo peace process , whilst publicly never speaking against it .
this was the blueprint for hamas ' survival , hammered out not in the back streets of gaza , but here in a suburban american hotel .
reconstruction ware : the participants referred to themselves simply as " the movement . "
they were careful not to use the word hamas .
participant : the goals we are taking about are in our hearts .
we ca n't put them down .
ware : to the muslim brothers at philadelphia there could be no compromise with the more secular palestinian leadership of talking peace , and never with israel .
participant : as a matter of fact a final decision has been made to continue the struggle indefinitely , whatever the circumstances .
ware : but , how to win this struggle ?
participant : the answer is to adhere to a strategy that can make the accord fail .
ware : one strategy was to direct more funds from islamic charities in america , to islamic charities in palestine who 'd be more receptive to hamas ' ideology .
participant : to defeat the accord we should make services available to the population .
ware : but , with a bias towards one section of the population .
participant : our relation has to be good with everyone , but we can give the islamists 100,000 , and 5,000 to the others .
ware : but those at philadelphia were only too aware of the fate of doctor ramahi .
arrested while distributing hamas funds and organising demonstrations , whilst also running a charity .
the expansion of missionary dawah was threatened by this mix of hamas and charity work .
a fundamental reorganisation of hamas ' funding system was proposed .
participant : the physician who fund the centre , and who was in charge of almost everything , and who was active and efficient , got mixed up , and was investigated and imprisoned .
what happened to him affected the institution drastically .
there should be no mix of the two works .
ware : no mix between overt hamas activity , and charitable work to safeguard dawah .
participant : we have to avoid being labelled terrorists , or terrorism supporters .
ware : keeping intact the hidden purpose of destroying the peace process by building grass root support for hamas .
participant : those brothers whom you help doing these things will ultimately by loyal to you politically .
dale watson former assistant director fbi counterterrorism division it was clear that we were not talking about just taking care of widows , orphans and hospitals , and it was a promotion of the organisation , their beliefs and ideas .
ware : but of course raising money for needy people is a very plausible , and worthy thing to do .
watson : absolutely , it is a worthy and worthwhile thing to do .
so it was a difficult matter , but if you really peeled of the onion , so to speak , you saw that hey , this is not exactly what it appears to be .
ware : the movement suggested that the funding of hamas associated charities should not be confined to america .
participant : i think the american arena is a secure place for a movement .
europe also can play the same role .
ware : philadelphia provided a model for promoting dawah on the inside , whilst affording legal cover to its funders on the outside .
although interpal 's trustees were n't present , there are striking similarities between the philadelphia model and the way interpal operates .
most of interpal 's funding is directed towards islamic charities .
i 'm on my way to an orphanage near hebron which gets funds from interpal .
the israeli 's found material here glorifying martyrdom .
posters of local militants framed with loving care , obviously by children .
the main hero figure is a local man .
the israelis say he planned the cold blooded murder of 4 jewish students .
the head of the orphanage is waiting to meet me .
hi mr rjoub , thanks for seeing me .
how are you ?
nice to see you .
the israeli 's say these posters were recovered intact , with the framing .
so the reason i 'm asking , mr rjoub , the reason i 'm asking about the framing is were you aware of any pupils or staff putting these frames together ?
hashem rjoub director , dura islamic society for orphans by god , i do n't think so .
we never had things like that .
this is the first time .
i was surprised by these photos .
we have never had any student or teacher who 's an artist .
i , of course , forbid anything like this .
and we only allow hanging things on the school walls which are to do with education .
ware : this is mr rjoub at a hamas rally .
at philadelphia the brotherhood wanted to disassociate charities from obvious hamas activity .
mr rjoub may not be an activist , but he 's certainly a supporter .
and there is a jihadi ethos in his orphanage , quiet , but resolute all the same .
it 's now afternoon prayers , then lessons resume .
interpal helps fund about 50 orphans here .
the teacher explains how he believes islam will , one day , deliver total victory .
teacher : we know the state of israel is something that happened suddenly , which was built upon what was originally there .
so it 's temporary .
ware : ultimate victory is fundamental to the ideology of hamas , a victory hamas insists has been ordained by god . -lsb- to young boy -rsb- who would you like to be ?
who 's your big hero ?
boy : like a mujahid .
ware : a fighter !
fighting for what ?
boy : we will continue to resist the israelis until we get them out .
teacher : i ca n't hear you .
raise your voice .
boy : we will resist the israelis .
ware : how many here want to be fighters ? 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 .
the children seem happy , and well cared for .
whether , overall , the ethos that interpal 's funding goes to support is healthy is less clear .
there was one other thing i wanted to ask you .
i 'm curious about that little sign up there .
what exactly is it ?
rjoub : let me look at it closely .
" do not disappoint the orphan . "
this is a koranic verse .
the koran encourages us to protect the orphan .
ware : and that red colour coming down the arm , and spilling over the world , is that .. does that signify .. what does that signify ?
rjoub : it 's not clear whether it 's blood or not , but in truth it looks like it might be .
ware : mr rjoub told me he 'd never noticed the blood before , even though the plaque had been there 10 years .
and he said the flags were of saudi arabia .
they are , in fact , used by hamas .
it conveys to me a picture of islam dominating the world , and , if necessary , through blood shed .
is that a dreadful exaggeration ?
rjoub : it 's true .
this picture expresses the vision of the person who drew it .
that does n't necessarily mean that these things exist .
ware : do you think you might take it down now i 've pointed it out to you ?
rjoub : yes indeed .
i want to stress that islam has ruled most of the world without blood .
there was no blood , it was through persuasion .
ware : interpal was launched in london in 1994 , 10 months after the muslim brotherhood meeting in philadelphia .
it operates from an anonymous building in cricklewood .
some of interpal 's own trustees have been followers of the brotherhood movement .
newspapers soon reported allegations that interpal was funding hamas .
the charity commission , the body that regulates charities , investigated .
they found no evidence of bias .
interpal distributed funds only on the basis of need .
but need was being determined not by interpal , but by the palestinian charities they helped fund .
at philadelphia some of these charities were named by this man .
the american authorities say muin shabib later admitted supporting hamas financially , and politically .
to his fellow muslim brothers , shabib spoke of charities that interpal would later give funds to as " our institutions . "
reconstruction shabib : in the west bank our institutions include the al tatoman charitable association , the jenin zakat committee , who establish a hospital .
in jerusalem we have the association of islamic studies and cultures .
we have active institutions at ramallah , such as the zakat committee .
ware : to some the israel palestine conflict was about much more than a national liberation issue .
it was the centre of struggle of the entire islamic world .
-lsb- the movement -rsb- participant : our greatest cause is islam .
palestine is only one part of this cause .
we have to stick to the fundamentals , the basics , the foundations of islam .
ware : humanitarian aid would certainly be needed .
a young , mainly conscript , israeli army often used live ammunition against unarmed demonstrators when palestinians staged a second uprising , or intifada , against israel 's occupation of the west bank .
the israeli 's were being hit by wave after wave of suicide bombers , targeting civilians .
dozens of the bombers were hamas .
the israeli 's sealed off towns , sending the palestinian economy into freefall .
interpal 's doctor essam yusuf now expanded his charity work .
he became the key man in a global coalition of islamic charities , with interpal at its heart .
this coalition was called the ' union of good . '
union of good promotional video dr essam yusuf union of good & interpal through that union for good we have managed to create something over than $ 200 million for palestinians in need .
ware : this has been social intervention on a vast scale .
this $ 200 million has bought more than just food and medicine .
it 's also been directed at the motor of missionary dawah .
schools , summer camps , mosques , places where a jihadi ethos has been promoted .
presiding over this global coalition of islamic charities is doctor yusuf qaradawi , spiritual leader of the muslim brotherhood movement , and a favourite of the london mayor .
july 2004 ken livingstone : you are truly welcome , welcome to london , a city of all faiths .
ware : doctor qaradawi 's followers in london , like the fugitive hamas commander mohammed sawalha , were there to greet him .
al-jazeera television ware : his following in the middle east is so big that sheikh qaradawi has his own talk show on al jazeera .
he makes no bones about the relationship between charity and politics .
2001 qaradawi : i do n't like this word " donations . "
i like to call it jihad with money .
because god has ordered us to fight enemies with our lives and our money .
ware : social welfare activism was the power behind the intifada .
for doctor qaradawi the intifada was also islam 's glory .
2001 qaradawi : w must plant the love of death and the love of martyrdom in the islamic nation .
ware : few have done more to fuse theology and politics , fuelling islamism 's global cult of martyrdom and holy war .
2002 qaradawi : the israelis have the nuclear bomb and we have the population bomb .
this population which has a desire for martyrdom and death .
this is what we have !
this is why these human bombs must continue until liberation .
ware : charity commission guidelines require interpal 's trustees to disassociate themselves completely from any hint of support for terrorism .
and yet , on television in the gulf , interpal 's vice chairman has sounded as if he might support terrorism .
2002 with me is brother essam yusuf from qatar .
go ahead brother essam yusuf : peace be with you .
greetings to the sheikh of the mujahideen .
sheikh dr yusuf ql-qaradawi .
the sheikh of heroic stands .
but my biggest salutation is to the mujahideen , to the heroes of the palestinian people who are sacrificing everything that is precious .
john ware doctor yusuf denied his words meant that he supported suicide bombers .
he said he was simply saluting sheikh qaradawi as the sheikh of strugglers .
he did say that he was opposed to suicide bombers targeting innocent people , but it was for others to decide who was innocent .
an article in doctor yusuf 's name also talks of " our battle with the zionist enemy " being a long one .
" and of support for jihad , in all its forms , until god allows for victory .
victory only comes from god . "
to hamas supporters , jihad , in all its forms , includes suicide bombing .
but doctor yusuf insists he never wrote or approved those words .
even though the article was commissioned by his own organisation , the union of good and appeared in his name .
doctor yusuf also denies his union of good website expresses support for hamas .
even though it includes a picture of sheikh yassin , the founder of hamas , on the page of a children 's campaign called the al yassin fund .
israel defence forces vido ware : in 2002 the israeli 's raided many charities associated with hamas .
they also searched the offices of the palestinian authorities security service .
what they discovered suggests , once again , that doctor yusuf broke the rules requiring charity trustees to disassociate themselves from terrorism .
this palestinian report describes the union of good as ' one of the biggest hamas supporters . '
it also discloses that in june 2002 doctor yusuf travelled to yemen , where he met senior members of hamas .
one was doctor mohammed syam , whom he describes as ' brilliant . '
kelly moore : we knew of course that syam was the head of hamas in yemen , and my impression of him is that he 's a terrorist , and supports militant terrorist activities .
fbi video ware : this was a mass wedding , 3 months after doctor yusuf 's visit .
sheikh syam was a guest , but it was n't a celebration of life to come , but of the near certainty of death , for the grooms about to embark on jihad .
the sheikh made an announcement .
sheikh syam : you will read about it tomorrow in the newspapers and hear about it in the media .
it brought down many of the invading occupiers and thanks be to god , lord of the universe .
god is the great and thanks be to god !
-lsb- aftermath - scene of the bombing -rsb- ware : a hamas suicide bomber has just blown up a bus full of passengers in tel aviv , killing 6 people including a student from scotland .
kelly moore former assistant us attorney he 's announcing , somewhat gleefully , and basically proud of the fact that hamas has just carried out a suicide attack in which innocent civilians were killed in israel .
ware : in yemen , doctor yusuf also met sheikh mohammed moyad , now in jail in america for funding hamas , and trying to fund al qaeda .
he ran a charity in the union of good , and he was being investigated by the fbi .
they 'd set up a sting at this hotel in frankfurt .
their informants posed as men who wanted to spend $ 2 million on jihad .
fbi video ware : this video was played at al moyad 's trial .
he offered 4 receipts from islamic charities as proof that he could get money to jihad .
moyad : this one , for instance , we deliver it to hamas .
this one we deliver it to the interior .
this one we send it to the martyrs .
but when we are in front of our government ¿ -lsb- laughter -rsb- ware : one of the receipts was from interpal , for $ 70,000 , which listed items like food , medical aid , and summer camps for children .
moore : in the middle of that conversation room service happened to walk in , in the hotel in frankfurt .
and when they walked in moyad quickly flipped the papers over so that they could n't be seen , and instructed everyone to change the subject , which obviously , if you were talking about charitable matters , he would n't have had to do .
ware : to reassure the fbi informants their money would actually fund jihad , al moyad then offered these details about interpal .
al moyad : it 's interpal .
it 's a company which i visited in london , and i sat with them there .
they 're good .
ware : al moyad said that , in london , he 'd dealt personally with interpal 's managing trustee , doctor essam yusuf .
moyad : i sat with essam , he 's one of the best people .
he is , tell him , the assistant , the one responsible for things after sheikh al-qaradawi in the union of good .
participant : are they hamas as well ?
moyad : they are working for all of the islamic jihad .
so this is hamas also .
ware : doctor yusuf acknowledges he met al moyad in yemen , but says it was solely to do with raising funds for palestinians in need .
he insists sheikh syam , who gleefully announced the suicide bombing , just happened to be present at one of his meetings .
the vice chairman of interpal , doctor essam yusuf , has said many times that neither he nor interpal have any connections , any links , of any kind , with hamas .
what 's your response to that ?
moore : given that he was meeting with moyad and mohammed syam , moyad who 's now been convicted of terrorism crimes related to hamas , and syam who was the known leader of hamas in yemen , he clearly has links to hamas .
those are links to hamas .
ware : it is because doctor yusuf runs both interpal , and the union of good , that the american authorities have put interpal at the very heart of hamas ' global fundraising operation .
interpal strenuously denies this .
you describe interpal as the funding coordinator for hamas .
that .. you 're ascribing interpal a very central role there .
daniel glaser : yes , we are .
ware : and that 's still the position as far as you 're concerned ?
glaser : absolutely .
ware : the us and european union have outlawed both the political and military wings of hamas .
they regard it as one terrorist movement , and its social welfare network as integral to the movement .
daniel glaser us treasury it becomes difficult to separate its social welfare network out from what hamas actually is , which is a network dedicated to violence and extremism .
the fact that they provide these social services , legitimises that ideology , it radicalises populations , it provides an over arching legitimisation and cover for what is ultimately a terrorist organisation .
ware : the americans designated interpal as a terrorist entity in 2003 .
once again the charity commission launched an investigation , and once again they found no evidence that interpal had any links to hamas .
for the americans it was a bewildering decision .
senate hearing 25th september 2003 david aufhauser general counsel , us treasury what happened with interpal in britain is really quite chilling .
this .. these were the best of our friends .
if we can not convince them to join us against one of the primary funders of hamas , in the millions of dollars , within weeks after the designation by the eu of hamas as a foreign terrorist organisation , it gives you some taste of how difficult it is to get other , less friendly , nations to join us .
ware : the charity commission , which regulates charities , pledges that any allegation of links to terrorism will be assessed rigorously .
this is not a cheap point .
the word investigation seems to dignify what you actually did .
it does n't sound to me as if you conducted an investigation .
kenneth dibble charity commission the enquiry we undertook in 1996 was different from the one we undertook in 2003 , they had a different focus .
ware : so it 's not .. it would n't be fair to describe 2003 as a rigorous investigation .
dibble : it was an investigation which followed a particular concern , and focus .
ware : but it was n't widespread .
dibble : it was n't in depth .
ware : interpal may not have been buying guns , but emphatically its funds were going to charities inextricably linked to hamas .
just how much influence hamas has over some charities funded by interpal can require the judgement of solomon , though the charity commission are n't perhaps the best people to make that judgement , since their investigators have n't actually set foot here on the west bank .
the commission has avoided taking a stand on a defining issue of the age , on where exactly islamic piety bleeds into islamist politics .
instead they 've relied on what interpal boasts are their eyes and ears on the ground , the palestinian charities their money goes to .
hebron is one of hamas ' power bases in the west bank .
the sign says ' welcome to the city of hamas . '
welcome to the city of hamas ware : as we drove through the city we came across a hamas celebration .
the guest of honour was a hamas man , mustafa shawer , who 'd just been released by the israeli 's after being detained for 20 months without trial .
how do you do , can we talk to you ?
mr shawer is a professor at hebron university , teaching islamic culture and law .
i asked him why hamas had won the election .
mustafa shawer hamas i think the main reason the islamic movement has been successful is the people 's love of islam .
the think that their worldly interests forget about the after life and paradise require a person who is religious , who can be trusted with public money and serve the public honestly .
ware : the lion 's share of interpal 's funding in hebron has gone to the city 's biggest charity .
promotional video the islamic charitable society strives day and night to care and cater for orphans , and the needy .
ware : at philadelphia , the brotherhood movement urged charitable funding to create employment and economic power centres for hamas supporters .
that 's happened in hebron .
here workers receive their salaries from the charities sewing workshop .
the treatment 's also available from the charities clinic .
and , thanks to interpal , bread from the charity 's bakery is delivered to poorer families .
hamas may now be the palestinian government , but its supporters do n't tend to talk openly about its activities .
what about the islamic charitable society of hebron ?
is that part of the social welfare network of hamas ?
shawer : this talk is not true .
ware : but it does appear to be true .
the hebron charity 's own website in 2004 showed that mr shawer himself was then a member of its administrative board .
several other senior figures have belonged to hamas , including abdul al haliq al nache , seen here at a rally .
he 's now hamas ' most senior man in jail .
the charities current chairman is also a member of hamas .
the charity runs two large orphanages , and schools for boys and girls .
the term orphan includes children who have parents who ca n't look after them .
interpal 's funds help the charity give these boys an education , and holidays .
what 's your favourite lesson ?
saif badran the language , the arabic language .
ware : arabic language ?
badran : yes .
ware : why arabic language ?
badran : because the first thing is .. it 's my language , and it 's the language of the koran .
ware : what does the koran mean to you ?
badran : i learn from it everything .
how to life .. it 's the way of my life .
ware : this is a photograph of a school event .
flags used by hamas are prominently to the fore .
several former pupils have joined hamas ' armed wing .
at least two have aspired to the goal set by doctor qaradawi ' a passion for death in the cause of islam . '
they became suicide bombers .
one was raed abul marsq , pictured here with his two children before strapping on an 11 pound bomb packed with nails , and boarding a jerusalem bus , killing 23 .
nearby is the girls ' orphanage and school , also run by the islamic charitable society of hebron to which interpal also gives substantial funds .
the entrance to the school is adorned by two hamas flags .
i went to see the principal , her name is fateheya qawasmeh .
we 're from the bbc .
how do you do ?
mrs qawasmeh was a hamas candidate in the recent election .
she is the mother of six children , whom she says have been brought up to love martyrdom , and famously , widow of abdullah , an iconic local commander of hamas , which is proud to repeat israel 's description of him as a battery farmer of martyrs .
mrs qawasmeh says her late husband chose her for his wife because of her love of dawah .
fateheya qawasmeh head , al sharia girls ' school hebron we are here to fulfil an educational role .
the political role is outside the school .
ware : you say you leave your political beliefs outside , but of course i could n't help notice two large hamas flags right outside your door .
qawasmeh : where are they ?
ware : where exactly , show me where ?
qawasmeh : where are they ?
ware : i saw two flags hanging outside the door .
qawasmeh : this flag is n't only the hamas flag , it 's also the saudi flag , is n't it ?
ware : but this is n't saudi arabia , this is the west bank .
why are you flying the flag of saudi arabia ?
qawasmeh : this flag represents muslims in general , whether it 's saudi arabia , palestine , anywhere , anywhere .
ware : so it 's a coincidence that it happens to be the same flag as hamas , and that you stood for hamas in the election ?
that 's just a coincidence ?
qawasmeh : saudi arabia is a muslim country and it represents the islamic world , since holy mecca is in it .
ware : although mrs qawasmeh insisted she kept her politics out of the school , i wondered how she managed this , given her fundamentalist views .
i thought the whole ideology of hamas was that you ca n't really separate politics from your faith , because the two are completely bound up in each other .
the two are one , as it were .
qawasmeh : inside the school my duty is simply educational .
outside the school i 'm active in some social work organisations .
ware : this is one social organisation mrs qawasmeh helped set up , the al khalil al rahman girls ' society .
it too has had funds from interpal . -lsb- children perform -rsb- we all sacrifice ourselves for our country .
we answer your call and make of our skulls a ladder to your glory .
ware : ' we answer your call , and make our skulls a ladder to your glory . '
now that 's just one example of young .. very young girls actually , singing songs about martyrdom , and that kind of thing .
that 's politics , is n't it ?
qawasmeh : these songs do n't come from the school .
the girls learn them from their own social environment , from their homes .
we do n't teach these songs in the school .
they 're not on the curriculum .
ware : but at her girl 's society the children are n't exactly discouraged from singing such songs .
-lsb- children perform -rsb- to martyrs in every time and place .
to their rich blood and to their wounds which have defined the identity of the islamic land .
ware : these are not views you would dissent from , i imagine .
qawasmeh : are we banned from talking even about ourselves ?
we 're a group of educationalists , rational people who believe that it 's okay for a human being to speak about his homeland in his songs and his talk .
or are we not allowed to do such a thing , and you lot are allowed everything ?
ware : at this point mrs qawasmeh said she had to go , because her own children were waiting .
i had one more question .
i read that the israeli army searched this orphanage here in august 2004 .
that 's what i read .
that 's not true ?
qawasmeh : it did n't happen .
it definitely did n't happen .
i 'm sure .
nobody came to our orphanage .
ware : so we asked the israeli 's for their evidence .
they took us to this vast hangar on an army base , containing many thousands of files , seized from islamic charities on the west bank .
the army produced four boxes which they said were taken from the girls ' orphanage in hebron on the 12th of august 2004 .
the boxes do contain material which , self evidently , is from the orphanage .
mrs qawasmeh 's denial is simply not credible .
with the boxes came this computer hard drive which the israeli 's say they found in the office of the manageress who ran the orphanage .
on it are the names of all the children , and a lot else besides .
this , quite literally , is a trove of images of hamas martyrs and their exploits - hundreds of them .
nothing is left to the imagination .
bars and buses they 've blown up , the bloody , twisted , and scattered limbs of their victims .
there 's also the odd picture paying homage to osama bin laden .
you 've taken interpal 's word for it , without going to the west bank , that that kind of thing is n't going on , have n't you ?
kenneth dibble charity commission well , i do n't know whether we asked them specifically in terms , because i 'm not aware that that sort of concern has actually been raised with us .
ware : you are kidding !
sorry , surely you have , you 've asked them , in a place like the west bank you surely have said what else is going on in these organisations ?
dibble : i do not believe we have considered that , in terms .
ware : well that is exactly the point , and can you tell me why you have n't considered that , because it 's pretty fundamental , is n't it ?
dibble : well it is , but , as i said , it 's only in recent times that the vulnerability of charities for use for these purposes has actually been recognised .
but i think it 's an issue that you are now raising now and , if i may say so , is quite a pertinent issue to raise .
ware : today the middle east is once again convulsed by hate .
but when this latest battle ends , there will still be hamas .
some in hamas have talked of a possible truce with israel .
others see a struggle that will end only with the end of israel .
interpal says it had always wanted to build on the peace process ..
what it 's helped build is an implacable islamist ideology .
roughly how many charity committees is hamas affiliated to at the moment , would you say ?
dr mahmoud ramahi hamas maybe more than 200 of charitable committees is affiliated to hamas .
some of them they ca n't say that we are affiliated to hamas , because of these struggles , and so and so .
ware : to what extent do you think this charitable work contributed to your substantial victory earlier this year ?
ramahi : yes , they have a big .. they are responsible for the victories that we take , because as you understand ¿ ware : they are responsible ?
ramahi : they are responsible .
ware : the social , hamas ' social ¿ ramahi : the main responsible . -lrb- laughs -rrb- ware : in public the british government is crystal clear about where it stands on support for hamas .
7th july 2004 tony blair : -lsb- speaking in the house -rsb- let me make it absolutely clear .
we want nothing to do with people who support suicide bombers in palestine , or elsewhere , or support terrorists .
ware : and yet officials believe some of interpal 's funds have gone to palestinian charities that engender hamas ' ideology .
last year the treasuries asset freezing working group examined files on charities in six west bank towns .
on hebron a draft report says the islamic charitable society had funded and administered educational programmes that appear tantamount to incitement and indoctrination in support of violent hamas activity .
a year on the government hesitates to do much about it .
meanwhile the muslim brotherhood movement here goes from strength to strength .
and it 's the friend of interpal 's managing trustee who is leading it .
the fugitive hamas commander , mohammed sawalha , is perhaps , the most influential muslim brother in britain today .
he organised the recent islam expo in london , his latest act of missionary dawah to promote what he describes as the real islam .
but , what exactly does mohammed sawalha mean by " real islam " , and how can we explore this without asking him about his background and his real beliefs ?
well , we ca n't , because he wo n't discuss them .
and for all the organiser 's warm words about this exhibition promoting dialogue and understanding , in fact the muslim brotherhood is exercising tight control .
they wo n't even let us in there .
but we found a way in to find interpal 's managing trustee , along with muslim leaders , and some politicians .
the muslim brotherhood movement already dominates many islamic groups here .
islam expo was a further attempt by the movement to position itself as mainstream .
its followers are foot soldiers to the most influential dawah missionary of political islam today , sheikh yusuf qaradawi .
but it is only to middle east audiences that the brotherhood 's spiritual leader , the sheikh of the mujahideen , unveils his prophetic dream .
europe , as he sees it , islam 's next frontier .
1999 yusuf qaradawi : so constantinople has been conquered and now the second part of the prophecy remains , which is the conquest of rome .
this means that islam will return to europe once again .
perhaps the next conquest will be the conquest of dawah and ideas .
there 's no need for conquest to be with the sword .
we might conquer these countries without armies .
we want armies of dawah preachers and teachers .
ware : islam is undergoing a huge revival , here and everywhere , and it is the muslim brotherhood who are leading it .
welcome to the dawah of political islam .
with its high octane blend of politics and religion as potent as any of history 's grand ideas .

panorama faith , hate & charity recorded from transmission : bbc one date : 30:07:06 john ware : this is a promotion for one of britain 's leading islamic charities called interpal .
" interpal , helping palestinians in need . "
ware : interpal does help palestinians who are greatly in need .
yusuf : we are for humanity , we are all for life .
ware : why then has interpal given funds to some organisations that promote death ?
-lsb- muslim children performing -rsb- give me the kalashnikov if you are thinking of giving up the fight .
ware : death in the cause of islam .
-lsb- children performing -rsb- for the sake of glory to religion we give our blood .
ware : interpal is at the heart of a global coalition of islamic charities , led by the spiritual leader of the largest islamic ideological movement in the world .
yusuf qaradawi : -lsb- preaching -rsb- we must plant the love of death and the love of martyrdom in the islamic nation .
ware : this is the story of how charity in britain has helped spread the ideology of the muslim brotherhood , which is largely peaceful , but which also likes to keep its options open .
-lsb- children performing -rsb- fasten your bomb belt oh would-be martyr and fill the square with blood so that we get back our homeland .
john ware ware : last january a political earthquake reshaped the middle east .
a group of fundamentalists regarded by western governments as terrorists , took power here in palestine .
the new palestinian government is run by hamas , for whom religion and politics are fused as one .
i 'm on my way to a charity in the west bank .
the old palestinian regime was regarded as corrupt .
hamas has won a reputation for honesty , based largely on how they 've run charities , many with funds from the british islamic charity interpal .
this kindergarten is run by a charity called the khalil al-rahman girls ' association .
it 's one of about 20 charities in the hebron area that have been funded by interpal over the years .
today it 's closed , it 's friday , it 's a muslim holiday .
no doubt many of the charities activities are jolly and wholesome , but some will chill the heart .
-lsb- children performing -rsb- we will sacrifice ourselves for our country .
we answer your call and make of our skulls a ladder to your glory .. a ladder ..
ware : the charity thanks interpal for its funding , which lasted 4 years .
this included money for food and education .
the children are taught that islam is more than just a faith , it 's also a political ideology .
-lsb- children performing -rsb- rise with us to liberate palestine through the path of the islamic dawah .
whoever abandons the path of muslims will live under humiliation and slavery .
ware : dawah means missionary work , bringing people closer to islam .
for a political movement like hamas , dawah is militant political preaching , often aimed at impressionable minds .
dr reuven paz former head , research division israel general security service children are the main focus for hamas dawah , because the principal is building the army of god .
the army of allah - jundullah , in arabic .
ware : these children learn there can be no compromise with israel , because the entire holy land was bequeathed to muslims .
-lsb- children performing -rsb- we assert that what is on this land and under this sky is muslim .
the brigades are preparing their lions to destroy the state of lies .
to victory in the decisive moment . -rsb-
-lsb- applause -rsb- ware : by law , british charities like interpal must ensure their funds are n't used to further the ideologies of terrorist groups .
hamas emerged in 1987 , as the palestinian branch of the worlds largest ideological islamic group , the muslim brotherhood .
here , in towns like ramallah , capital of the west bank , the brotherhood had been digging its roots deep into palestinian society for many years .
the brotherhood used charities to spread its dawah , calling palestinians to return to the fundamentals of islam .
mouin rabbani international crisis group the muslim brotherhood were very much a social movement , for whom the concept of charity and social welfare was an important component of what 's called dawah , which i think , loosely translated , might be translated as causalitisation .
ware : hamas capitalised on the brotherhood 's social welfare network , to turn growing numbers of observant muslims , into followers of their more militant and political version of islam .
is hamas in the social welfare business only to do good works ?
rabbani : no , of course not .
it 's a political organisation , that has a series of defined objectives , among which is increasing its .. the popular allegiance to it among its constituents .
ware : mosques , especially , have been used to inculcate hamas consciousness into young palestinians .
interpal funds religious activates .
it 's transferred money to the abdul nasser mosque in ramallah .
the mosque is quite obviously influenced by hamas .
rabbani : people or charities who are sending money to islamic charities in palestine , that are clearly controlled by hamas , are helping in the growth of the movement .
ware : in britain interpal had a prominent stall at this recent exhibition in london , to promote islam .
interpal has been raising around £ 4 million a year .
the charity categorically denies it 's helping to fund the hamas movement behind the banner of humanitarian aid .
the man who runs interpal has blamed such allegations on what he calls the " christian and jewish zionist movement . "
doctor essam mustafa , known also as essam yusuf , says he 'd consider stopping funds to any charity inciting violence .
dr essam yusuf vice chairman & managing trustee , interpal we are for humanity , we are all for life .
and this is what interpal is here for , and this is what interpal wish , and will , continue to do so in the future , inshallah .
ware : doctor yusef was celebrating interpal 's 10th anniversary at the british library where he was awarded a degree from the islamic university of gaza for his charity work .
december 2004 -lsb- yusuf receiving degree -rsb- -lsb- applause -rsb- ware : the university is a muslim brotherhood stronghold , the crucible of hamas ' holy war ideology .
doctor yusef declined to be interviewed .
but he has said : " we categorically deny we are , in any way , connected to any political organisation . "
and yet , his funds have helped build up hamas into what it is today .
a guest at interpal 's anniversary dinner was his friend , fellow palestinian mohammed sawalha .
from london , sawalha is said to have master minded much of hamas ' political and military strategy .
wanted by israel , he fled to london in 1990 .
paz : sawalha was one of the senior activists in the dawah portals of hamas .
he was involved , let 's say , with the background of the finance , the logistic assistance .
ware : but he was in hamas ?
dr reuven paz former head , research division israel general security service he was , he was a member , he was an activist of hamas , that 's for sure .
ware : in london , sawalha is alleged to have directed funds , both for hamas ' armed wing , and for spreading its missionary dawah .
then , in january 1993 , an operation sawalha was involved in went badly wrong .
hamas would be forced to reorganise its funding arrangements .
reconstruction ware : a senior hamas man from america flew into london for instructions from sawalha .
sawalha 's visitor was en route to the palestinian territories .
the two men travelled to sawalha 's home .
his visitor 's name was mohammed salah .
salah 's mission was to distribute funds .
sawalha told him who to meet in the palestinian territories .
paz : mohammed sawalha told mohammed salah to look as a respectable businessman , where to hide the suitcase , to take not to fancy hotel , etc , etc , and to be very cautious .
ware : with sawalha 's agreement salah began distributing about a quarter of a million dollars to local hamas operatives .
some was ear marked for military activities .
some for missionary dawah .
more money was in the pipe line from his bank in chicago .
but the israeli 's had been tracking him .
stopped at a check point as he left gaza , salah was arrested .
march 1993 ware : salah ended up doing nearly 5 years in an israeli jail , where the israeli 's got a lot out of him about mohammed sawalha in london , and hamas ' funding operation .
during one interrogation , salah was taped without his knowledge .
audio recording of salah 's interrogation ware : salah refers to sawalha as abu abada reconstruction salah : i made a stop in london to meet with abu abada , who is more knowledge about the west bank 's operational activities .
see , the operational and the dawah .
interrogator : i did n't understand .
one more time .
do you mean that abu abada is to be in charge of the dawah and of the movement .
salah : yes .
ware : although abu abada , mohammed sawalha , was known to mi5 , the authorities let him operate freely here .
paz : maybe even in london , i would say , he became more important for hamas than during the period he was in the territories .
ware : in london hamas and the islamic charity world were linking up .
mohammed sawalha had become friendly with the man who was to become boss of interpal , essam yusef .
intelligence sources say that in 1992 they had a visitor from the west bank .
his name was doctor mahmoud ramahi , a senior member of hamas .
doctor ramahi had been recruited to hamas by sawalha , who was his brother-in-law .
doctor yusuf told us he did n't recall meeting doctor ramahi in london .
at the time doctor yusuf was a trustee of a charity called the palestine and lebanon relief fund .
at his london meeting , according to our sources , doctor ramahi of hamas was asked to represent doctor yusuf 's charity in the palestinian territories .
in ramallah i arranged to meet doctor ramahi .
i wanted to ask him about his london meeting 14 years ago .
today he 's a successful doctor , and a senior hamas politician .
at the time he ran a medical centre , part of a charity closely affiliated to hamas .
doctor ramahi told me that in london he 'd simply asked for charitable funds from essam yusuf .
when you travelled to london , you were n't travelling as a member of the political office of hamas ?
dr mahmoud ramahi hamas no , no .
no , it 's for my job as chairman of the medical centre .
and i was the fund for this centre not because of hamas , not that i go to london and meet essam yusuf because we are members of hamas , no .
as a principle we have to help the poor people .
ware : for hamas though there can be more to helping the poor than just religion .
ramahi : for all muslims the politics is what 's inside the religion .
you ca n't separate the religion from the politics .
the politics is one part of the religion .
ware : 8 months after his trip to london , doctor ramahi was arrested by the israeli 's .
reconstruction december 1992 ware : hundreds more hamas men were deported to lebanon .
hamas was reeling .
money was its life blood , now it was being cut off .
the fight for hamas ' survival began , led by its network of supporters outside palestine .
in october 1993 a group of 25 muslims from canada and america arrived at philadelphia in the united states .
the most intractable conflict in the most volatile region of the world had begun to look as if it might be settled .
13th september 1993 -lsb- footage : rabin , arafat and clinton -rsb- ware : the israeli 's and palestinians had just signed a peace agreement known as the oslo accords .
hamas ' supporters on the outside were determined to help hamas on the inside destroy the peace process .
the group met at this hotel , all followers of the muslim brotherhood movement .
some ran islamic charities , others pressure groups .
the fbi was watching .
they described the group as muslim fundamentalists .
dale watson former assistant director fbi counterterrorism division their public persona was something very legal , looked very good , but yet if you looked behind the scene , so to speak , or behind the curtain , we knew this was n't the boy scouts .
reconstruction ware : the fbi bugged their rooms , and the meeting room where they spent most of the weekend in conference .
watson : we realised there was an orchestrated effort here to pretty much try to hide their identity - 1 -rrb- and 2 -rrb- make sure that they stayed under the radar scope , so to speak .
ware : fbi transcripts of this marathon session show that hamas , on the outside , was to follow a secret and subversive agenda , but one with a respectable public face .
privately they would do everything they could to destroy the oslo peace process , whilst publicly never speaking against it .
this was the blueprint for hamas ' survival , hammered out not in the back streets of gaza , but here in a suburban american hotel .
reconstruction ware : the participants referred to themselves simply as " the movement . "
they were careful not to use the word hamas .
participant : the goals we are taking about are in our hearts .
we ca n't put them down .
ware : to the muslim brothers at philadelphia there could be no compromise with the more secular palestinian leadership of talking peace , and never with israel .
participant : as a matter of fact a final decision has been made to continue the struggle indefinitely , whatever the circumstances .
ware : but , how to win this struggle ?
participant : the answer is to adhere to a strategy that can make the accord fail .
ware : one strategy was to direct more funds from islamic charities in america , to islamic charities in palestine who 'd be more receptive to hamas ' ideology .
participant : to defeat the accord we should make services available to the population .
ware : but , with a bias towards one section of the population .
participant : our relation has to be good with everyone , but we can give the islamists 100,000 , and 5,000 to the others .
ware : but those at philadelphia were only too aware of the fate of doctor ramahi .
arrested while distributing hamas funds and organising demonstrations , whilst also running a charity .
the expansion of missionary dawah was threatened by this mix of hamas and charity work .
a fundamental reorganisation of hamas ' funding system was proposed .
participant : the physician who fund the centre , and who was in charge of almost everything , and who was active and efficient , got mixed up , and was investigated and imprisoned .
what happened to him affected the institution drastically .
there should be no mix of the two works .
ware : no mix between overt hamas activity , and charitable work to safeguard dawah .
participant : we have to avoid being labelled terrorists , or terrorism supporters .
ware : keeping intact the hidden purpose of destroying the peace process by building grass root support for hamas .
participant : those brothers whom you help doing these things will ultimately by loyal to you politically .
dale watson former assistant director fbi counterterrorism division it was clear that we were not talking about just taking care of widows , orphans and hospitals , and it was a promotion of the organisation , their beliefs and ideas .
ware : but of course raising money for needy people is a very plausible , and worthy thing to do .
watson : absolutely , it is a worthy and worthwhile thing to do .
so it was a difficult matter , but if you really peeled of the onion , so to speak , you saw that hey , this is not exactly what it appears to be .
ware : the movement suggested that the funding of hamas associated charities should not be confined to america .
participant : i think the american arena is a secure place for a movement .
europe also can play the same role .
ware : philadelphia provided a model for promoting dawah on the inside , whilst affording legal cover to its funders on the outside .
although interpal 's trustees were n't present , there are striking similarities between the philadelphia model and the way interpal operates .
most of interpal 's funding is directed towards islamic charities .
i 'm on my way to an orphanage near hebron which gets funds from interpal .
the israeli 's found material here glorifying martyrdom .
posters of local militants framed with loving care , obviously by children .
the main hero figure is a local man .
the israelis say he planned the cold blooded murder of 4 jewish students .
the head of the orphanage is waiting to meet me .
hi mr rjoub , thanks for seeing me .
how are you ?
nice to see you .
the israeli 's say these posters were recovered intact , with the framing .
so the reason i 'm asking , mr rjoub , the reason i 'm asking about the framing is were you aware of any pupils or staff putting these frames together ?
hashem rjoub director , dura islamic society for orphans by god , i do n't think so .
we never had things like that .
this is the first time .
i was surprised by these photos .
we have never had any student or teacher who 's an artist .
i , of course , forbid anything like this .
and we only allow hanging things on the school walls which are to do with education .
ware : this is mr rjoub at a hamas rally .
at philadelphia the brotherhood wanted to disassociate charities from obvious hamas activity .
mr rjoub may not be an activist , but he 's certainly a supporter .
and there is a jihadi ethos in his orphanage , quiet , but resolute all the same .
it 's now afternoon prayers , then lessons resume .
interpal helps fund about 50 orphans here .
the teacher explains how he believes islam will , one day , deliver total victory .
teacher : we know the state of israel is something that happened suddenly , which was built upon what was originally there .
so it 's temporary .
ware : ultimate victory is fundamental to the ideology of hamas , a victory hamas insists has been ordained by god . -lsb- to young boy -rsb- who would you like to be ?
who 's your big hero ?
boy : like a mujahid .
ware : a fighter !
fighting for what ?
boy : we will continue to resist the israelis until we get them out .
teacher : i ca n't hear you .
raise your voice .
boy : we will resist the israelis .
ware : how many here want to be fighters ? 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 .
the children seem happy , and well cared for .
whether , overall , the ethos that interpal 's funding goes to support is healthy is less clear .
there was one other thing i wanted to ask you .
i 'm curious about that little sign up there .
what exactly is it ?
rjoub : let me look at it closely .
" do not disappoint the orphan . "
this is a koranic verse .
the koran encourages us to protect the orphan .
ware : and that red colour coming down the arm , and spilling over the world , is that .. does that signify .. what does that signify ?
rjoub : it 's not clear whether it 's blood or not , but in truth it looks like it might be .
ware : mr rjoub told me he 'd never noticed the blood before , even though the plaque had been there 10 years .
and he said the flags were of saudi arabia .
they are , in fact , used by hamas .
it conveys to me a picture of islam dominating the world , and , if necessary , through blood shed .
is that a dreadful exaggeration ?
rjoub : it 's true .
this picture expresses the vision of the person who drew it .
that does n't necessarily mean that these things exist .
ware : do you think you might take it down now i 've pointed it out to you ?
rjoub : yes indeed .
i want to stress that islam has ruled most of the world without blood .
there was no blood , it was through persuasion .
ware : interpal was launched in london in 1994 , 10 months after the muslim brotherhood meeting in philadelphia .
it operates from an anonymous building in cricklewood .
some of interpal 's own trustees have been followers of the brotherhood movement .
newspapers soon reported allegations that interpal was funding hamas .
the charity commission , the body that regulates charities , investigated .
they found no evidence of bias .
interpal distributed funds only on the basis of need .
but need was being determined not by interpal , but by the palestinian charities they helped fund .
at philadelphia some of these charities were named by this man .
the american authorities say muin shabib later admitted supporting hamas financially , and politically .
to his fellow muslim brothers , shabib spoke of charities that interpal would later give funds to as " our institutions . "
reconstruction shabib : in the west bank our institutions include the al tatoman charitable association , the jenin zakat committee , who establish a hospital .
in jerusalem we have the association of islamic studies and cultures .
we have active institutions at ramallah , such as the zakat committee .
ware : to some the israel palestine conflict was about much more than a national liberation issue .
it was the centre of struggle of the entire islamic world .
-lsb- the movement -rsb- participant : our greatest cause is islam .
palestine is only one part of this cause .
we have to stick to the fundamentals , the basics , the foundations of islam .
ware : humanitarian aid would certainly be needed .
a young , mainly conscript , israeli army often used live ammunition against unarmed demonstrators when palestinians staged a second uprising , or intifada , against israel 's occupation of the west bank .
the israeli 's were being hit by wave after wave of suicide bombers , targeting civilians .
dozens of the bombers were hamas .
the israeli 's sealed off towns , sending the palestinian economy into freefall .
interpal 's doctor essam yusuf now expanded his charity work .
he became the key man in a global coalition of islamic charities , with interpal at its heart .
this coalition was called the ' union of good . '
union of good promotional video dr essam yusuf union of good & interpal through that union for good we have managed to create something over than $ 200 million for palestinians in need .
ware : this has been social intervention on a vast scale .
this $ 200 million has bought more than just food and medicine .
it 's also been directed at the motor of missionary dawah .
schools , summer camps , mosques , places where a jihadi ethos has been promoted .
presiding over this global coalition of islamic charities is doctor yusuf qaradawi , spiritual leader of the muslim brotherhood movement , and a favourite of the london mayor .
july 2004 ken livingstone : you are truly welcome , welcome to london , a city of all faiths .
ware : doctor qaradawi 's followers in london , like the fugitive hamas commander mohammed sawalha , were there to greet him .
al-jazeera television ware : his following in the middle east is so big that sheikh qaradawi has his own talk show on al jazeera .
he makes no bones about the relationship between charity and politics .
2001 qaradawi : i do n't like this word " donations . "
i like to call it jihad with money .
because god has ordered us to fight enemies with our lives and our money .
ware : social welfare activism was the power behind the intifada .
for doctor qaradawi the intifada was also islam 's glory .
2001 qaradawi : w must plant the love of death and the love of martyrdom in the islamic nation .
ware : few have done more to fuse theology and politics , fuelling islamism 's global cult of martyrdom and holy war .
2002 qaradawi : the israelis have the nuclear bomb and we have the population bomb .
this population which has a desire for martyrdom and death .
this is what we have !
this is why these human bombs must continue until liberation .
ware : charity commission guidelines require interpal 's trustees to disassociate themselves completely from any hint of support for terrorism .
and yet , on television in the gulf , interpal 's vice chairman has sounded as if he might support terrorism .
2002 with me is brother essam yusuf from qatar .
go ahead brother essam yusuf : peace be with you .
greetings to the sheikh of the mujahideen .
sheikh dr yusuf ql-qaradawi .
the sheikh of heroic stands .
but my biggest salutation is to the mujahideen , to the heroes of the palestinian people who are sacrificing everything that is precious .
john ware doctor yusuf denied his words meant that he supported suicide bombers .
he said he was simply saluting sheikh qaradawi as the sheikh of strugglers .
he did say that he was opposed to suicide bombers targeting innocent people , but it was for others to decide who was innocent .
an article in doctor yusuf 's name also talks of " our battle with the zionist enemy " being a long one .
" and of support for jihad , in all its forms , until god allows for victory .
victory only comes from god . "
to hamas supporters , jihad , in all its forms , includes suicide bombing .
but doctor yusuf insists he never wrote or approved those words .
even though the article was commissioned by his own organisation , the union of good and appeared in his name .
doctor yusuf also denies his union of good website expresses support for hamas .
even though it includes a picture of sheikh yassin , the founder of hamas , on the page of a children 's campaign called the al yassin fund .
israel defence forces vido ware : in 2002 the israeli 's raided many charities associated with hamas .
they also searched the offices of the palestinian authorities security service .
what they discovered suggests , once again , that doctor yusuf broke the rules requiring charity trustees to disassociate themselves from terrorism .
this palestinian report describes the union of good as ' one of the biggest hamas supporters . '
it also discloses that in june 2002 doctor yusuf travelled to yemen , where he met senior members of hamas .
one was doctor mohammed syam , whom he describes as ' brilliant . '
kelly moore : we knew of course that syam was the head of hamas in yemen , and my impression of him is that he 's a terrorist , and supports militant terrorist activities .
fbi video ware : this was a mass wedding , 3 months after doctor yusuf 's visit .
sheikh syam was a guest , but it was n't a celebration of life to come , but of the near certainty of death , for the grooms about to embark on jihad .
the sheikh made an announcement .
sheikh syam : you will read about it tomorrow in the newspapers and hear about it in the media .
it brought down many of the invading occupiers and thanks be to god , lord of the universe .
god is the great and thanks be to god !
-lsb- aftermath - scene of the bombing -rsb- ware : a hamas suicide bomber has just blown up a bus full of passengers in tel aviv , killing 6 people including a student from scotland .
kelly moore former assistant us attorney he 's announcing , somewhat gleefully , and basically proud of the fact that hamas has just carried out a suicide attack in which innocent civilians were killed in israel .
ware : in yemen , doctor yusuf also met sheikh mohammed moyad , now in jail in america for funding hamas , and trying to fund al qaeda .
he ran a charity in the union of good , and he was being investigated by the fbi .
they 'd set up a sting at this hotel in frankfurt .
their informants posed as men who wanted to spend $ 2 million on jihad .
fbi video ware : this video was played at al moyad 's trial .
he offered 4 receipts from islamic charities as proof that he could get money to jihad .
moyad : this one , for instance , we deliver it to hamas .
this one we deliver it to the interior .
this one we send it to the martyrs .
but when we are in front of our government ¿ -lsb- laughter -rsb- ware : one of the receipts was from interpal , for $ 70,000 , which listed items like food , medical aid , and summer camps for children .
moore : in the middle of that conversation room service happened to walk in , in the hotel in frankfurt .
and when they walked in moyad quickly flipped the papers over so that they could n't be seen , and instructed everyone to change the subject , which obviously , if you were talking about charitable matters , he would n't have had to do .
ware : to reassure the fbi informants their money would actually fund jihad , al moyad then offered these details about interpal .
al moyad : it 's interpal .
it 's a company which i visited in london , and i sat with them there .
they 're good .
ware : al moyad said that , in london , he 'd dealt personally with interpal 's managing trustee , doctor essam yusuf .
moyad : i sat with essam , he 's one of the best people .
he is , tell him , the assistant , the one responsible for things after sheikh al-qaradawi in the union of good .
participant : are they hamas as well ?
moyad : they are working for all of the islamic jihad .
so this is hamas also .
ware : doctor yusuf acknowledges he met al moyad in yemen , but says it was solely to do with raising funds for palestinians in need .
he insists sheikh syam , who gleefully announced the suicide bombing , just happened to be present at one of his meetings .
the vice chairman of interpal , doctor essam yusuf , has said many times that neither he nor interpal have any connections , any links , of any kind , with hamas .
what 's your response to that ?
moore : given that he was meeting with moyad and mohammed syam , moyad who 's now been convicted of terrorism crimes related to hamas , and syam who was the known leader of hamas in yemen , he clearly has links to hamas .
those are links to hamas .
ware : it is because doctor yusuf runs both interpal , and the union of good , that the american authorities have put interpal at the very heart of hamas ' global fundraising operation .
interpal strenuously denies this .
you describe interpal as the funding coordinator for hamas .
that .. you 're ascribing interpal a very central role there .
daniel glaser : yes , we are .
ware : and that 's still the position as far as you 're concerned ?
glaser : absolutely .
ware : the us and european union have outlawed both the political and military wings of hamas .
they regard it as one terrorist movement , and its social welfare network as integral to the movement .
daniel glaser us treasury it becomes difficult to separate its social welfare network out from what hamas actually is , which is a network dedicated to violence and extremism .
the fact that they provide these social services , legitimises that ideology , it radicalises populations , it provides an over arching legitimisation and cover for what is ultimately a terrorist organisation .
ware : the americans designated interpal as a terrorist entity in 2003 .
once again the charity commission launched an investigation , and once again they found no evidence that interpal had any links to hamas .
for the americans it was a bewildering decision .
senate hearing 25th september 2003 david aufhauser general counsel , us treasury what happened with interpal in britain is really quite chilling .
this .. these were the best of our friends .
if we can not convince them to join us against one of the primary funders of hamas , in the millions of dollars , within weeks after the designation by the eu of hamas as a foreign terrorist organisation , it gives you some taste of how difficult it is to get other , less friendly , nations to join us .
ware : the charity commission , which regulates charities , pledges that any allegation of links to terrorism will be assessed rigorously .
this is not a cheap point .
the word investigation seems to dignify what you actually did .
it does n't sound to me as if you conducted an investigation .
kenneth dibble charity commission the enquiry we undertook in 1996 was different from the one we undertook in 2003 , they had a different focus .
ware : so it 's not .. it would n't be fair to describe 2003 as a rigorous investigation .
dibble : it was an investigation which followed a particular concern , and focus .
ware : but it was n't widespread .
dibble : it was n't in depth .
ware : interpal may not have been buying guns , but emphatically its funds were going to charities inextricably linked to hamas .
just how much influence hamas has over some charities funded by interpal can require the judgement of solomon , though the charity commission are n't perhaps the best people to make that judgement , since their investigators have n't actually set foot here on the west bank .
the commission has avoided taking a stand on a defining issue of the age , on where exactly islamic piety bleeds into islamist politics .
instead they 've relied on what interpal boasts are their eyes and ears on the ground , the palestinian charities their money goes to .
hebron is one of hamas ' power bases in the west bank .
the sign says ' welcome to the city of hamas . '
welcome to the city of hamas ware : as we drove through the city we came across a hamas celebration .
the guest of honour was a hamas man , mustafa shawer , who 'd just been released by the israeli 's after being detained for 20 months without trial .
how do you do , can we talk to you ?
mr shawer is a professor at hebron university , teaching islamic culture and law .
i asked him why hamas had won the election .
mustafa shawer hamas i think the main reason the islamic movement has been successful is the people 's love of islam .
the think that their worldly interests forget about the after life and paradise require a person who is religious , who can be trusted with public money and serve the public honestly .
ware : the lion 's share of interpal 's funding in hebron has gone to the city 's biggest charity .
promotional video the islamic charitable society strives day and night to care and cater for orphans , and the needy .
ware : at philadelphia , the brotherhood movement urged charitable funding to create employment and economic power centres for hamas supporters .
that 's happened in hebron .
here workers receive their salaries from the charities sewing workshop .
the treatment 's also available from the charities clinic .
and , thanks to interpal , bread from the charity 's bakery is delivered to poorer families .
hamas may now be the palestinian government , but its supporters do n't tend to talk openly about its activities .
what about the islamic charitable society of hebron ?
is that part of the social welfare network of hamas ?
shawer : this talk is not true .
ware : but it does appear to be true .
the hebron charity 's own website in 2004 showed that mr shawer himself was then a member of its administrative board .
several other senior figures have belonged to hamas , including abdul al haliq al nache , seen here at a rally .
he 's now hamas ' most senior man in jail .
the charities current chairman is also a member of hamas .
the charity runs two large orphanages , and schools for boys and girls .
the term orphan includes children who have parents who ca n't look after them .
interpal 's funds help the charity give these boys an education , and holidays .
what 's your favourite lesson ?
saif badran the language , the arabic language .
ware : arabic language ?
badran : yes .
ware : why arabic language ?
badran : because the first thing is .. it 's my language , and it 's the language of the koran .
ware : what does the koran mean to you ?
badran : i learn from it everything .
how to life .. it 's the way of my life .
ware : this is a photograph of a school event .
flags used by hamas are prominently to the fore .
several former pupils have joined hamas ' armed wing .
at least two have aspired to the goal set by doctor qaradawi ' a passion for death in the cause of islam . '
they became suicide bombers .
one was raed abul marsq , pictured here with his two children before strapping on an 11 pound bomb packed with nails , and boarding a jerusalem bus , killing 23 .
nearby is the girls ' orphanage and school , also run by the islamic charitable society of hebron to which interpal also gives substantial funds .
the entrance to the school is adorned by two hamas flags .
i went to see the principal , her name is fateheya qawasmeh .
we 're from the bbc .
how do you do ?
mrs qawasmeh was a hamas candidate in the recent election .
she is the mother of six children , whom she says have been brought up to love martyrdom , and famously , widow of abdullah , an iconic local commander of hamas , which is proud to repeat israel 's description of him as a battery farmer of martyrs .
mrs qawasmeh says her late husband chose her for his wife because of her love of dawah .
fateheya qawasmeh head , al sharia girls ' school hebron we are here to fulfil an educational role .
the political role is outside the school .
ware : you say you leave your political beliefs outside , but of course i could n't help notice two large hamas flags right outside your door .
qawasmeh : where are they ?
ware : where exactly , show me where ?
qawasmeh : where are they ?
ware : i saw two flags hanging outside the door .
qawasmeh : this flag is n't only the hamas flag , it 's also the saudi flag , is n't it ?
ware : but this is n't saudi arabia , this is the west bank .
why are you flying the flag of saudi arabia ?
qawasmeh : this flag represents muslims in general , whether it 's saudi arabia , palestine , anywhere , anywhere .
ware : so it 's a coincidence that it happens to be the same flag as hamas , and that you stood for hamas in the election ?
that 's just a coincidence ?
qawasmeh : saudi arabia is a muslim country and it represents the islamic world , since holy mecca is in it .
ware : although mrs qawasmeh insisted she kept her politics out of the school , i wondered how she managed this , given her fundamentalist views .
i thought the whole ideology of hamas was that you ca n't really separate politics from your faith , because the two are completely bound up in each other .
the two are one , as it were .
qawasmeh : inside the school my duty is simply educational .
outside the school i 'm active in some social work organisations .
ware : this is one social organisation mrs qawasmeh helped set up , the al khalil al rahman girls ' society .
it too has had funds from interpal . -lsb- children perform -rsb- we all sacrifice ourselves for our country .
we answer your call and make of our skulls a ladder to your glory .
ware : ' we answer your call , and make our skulls a ladder to your glory . '
now that 's just one example of young .. very young girls actually , singing songs about martyrdom , and that kind of thing .
that 's politics , is n't it ?
qawasmeh : these songs do n't come from the school .
the girls learn them from their own social environment , from their homes .
we do n't teach these songs in the school .
they 're not on the curriculum .
ware : but at her girl 's society the children are n't exactly discouraged from singing such songs .
-lsb- children perform -rsb- to martyrs in every time and place .
to their rich blood and to their wounds which have defined the identity of the islamic land .
ware : these are not views you would dissent from , i imagine .
qawasmeh : are we banned from talking even about ourselves ?
we 're a group of educationalists , rational people who believe that it 's okay for a human being to speak about his homeland in his songs and his talk .
or are we not allowed to do such a thing , and you lot are allowed everything ?
ware : at this point mrs qawasmeh said she had to go , because her own children were waiting .
i had one more question .
i read that the israeli army searched this orphanage here in august 2004 .
that 's what i read .
that 's not true ?
qawasmeh : it did n't happen .
it definitely did n't happen .
i 'm sure .
nobody came to our orphanage .
ware : so we asked the israeli 's for their evidence .
they took us to this vast hangar on an army base , containing many thousands of files , seized from islamic charities on the west bank .
the army produced four boxes which they said were taken from the girls ' orphanage in hebron on the 12th of august 2004 .
the boxes do contain material which , self evidently , is from the orphanage .
mrs qawasmeh 's denial is simply not credible .
with the boxes came this computer hard drive which the israeli 's say they found in the office of the manageress who ran the orphanage .
on it are the names of all the children , and a lot else besides .
this , quite literally , is a trove of images of hamas martyrs and their exploits - hundreds of them .
nothing is left to the imagination .
bars and buses they 've blown up , the bloody , twisted , and scattered limbs of their victims .
there 's also the odd picture paying homage to osama bin laden .
you 've taken interpal 's word for it , without going to the west bank , that that kind of thing is n't going on , have n't you ?
kenneth dibble charity commission well , i do n't know whether we asked them specifically in terms , because i 'm not aware that that sort of concern has actually been raised with us .
ware : you are kidding !
sorry , surely you have , you 've asked them , in a place like the west bank you surely have said what else is going on in these organisations ?
dibble : i do not believe we have considered that , in terms .
ware : well that is exactly the point , and can you tell me why you have n't considered that , because it 's pretty fundamental , is n't it ?
dibble : well it is , but , as i said , it 's only in recent times that the vulnerability of charities for use for these purposes has actually been recognised .
but i think it 's an issue that you are now raising now and , if i may say so , is quite a pertinent issue to raise .
ware : today the middle east is once again convulsed by hate .
but when this latest battle ends , there will still be hamas .
some in hamas have talked of a possible truce with israel .
others see a struggle that will end only with the end of israel .
interpal says it had always wanted to build on the peace process ..
what it 's helped build is an implacable islamist ideology .
roughly how many charity committees is hamas affiliated to at the moment , would you say ?
dr mahmoud ramahi hamas maybe more than 200 of charitable committees is affiliated to hamas .
some of them they ca n't say that we are affiliated to hamas , because of these struggles , and so and so .
ware : to what extent do you think this charitable work contributed to your substantial victory earlier this year ?
ramahi : yes , they have a big .. they are responsible for the victories that we take , because as you understand ¿ ware : they are responsible ?
ramahi : they are responsible .
ware : the social , hamas ' social ¿ ramahi : the main responsible . -lrb- laughs -rrb- ware : in public the british government is crystal clear about where it stands on support for hamas .
7th july 2004 tony blair : -lsb- speaking in the house -rsb- let me make it absolutely clear .
we want nothing to do with people who support suicide bombers in palestine , or elsewhere , or support terrorists .
ware : and yet officials believe some of interpal 's funds have gone to palestinian charities that engender hamas ' ideology .
last year the treasuries asset freezing working group examined files on charities in six west bank towns .
on hebron a draft report says the islamic charitable society had funded and administered educational programmes that appear tantamount to incitement and indoctrination in support of violent hamas activity .
a year on the government hesitates to do much about it .
meanwhile the muslim brotherhood movement here goes from strength to strength .
and it 's the friend of interpal 's managing trustee who is leading it .
the fugitive hamas commander , mohammed sawalha , is perhaps , the most influential muslim brother in britain today .
he organised the recent islam expo in london , his latest act of missionary dawah to promote what he describes as the real islam .
but , what exactly does mohammed sawalha mean by " real islam " , and how can we explore this without asking him about his background and his real beliefs ?
well , we ca n't , because he wo n't discuss them .
and for all the organiser 's warm words about this exhibition promoting dialogue and understanding , in fact the muslim brotherhood is exercising tight control .
they wo n't even let us in there .
but we found a way in to find interpal 's managing trustee , along with muslim leaders , and some politicians .
the muslim brotherhood movement already dominates many islamic groups here .
islam expo was a further attempt by the movement to position itself as mainstream .
its followers are foot soldiers to the most influential dawah missionary of political islam today , sheikh yusuf qaradawi .
but it is only to middle east audiences that the brotherhood 's spiritual leader , the sheikh of the mujahideen , unveils his prophetic dream .
europe , as he sees it , islam 's next frontier .
1999 yusuf qaradawi : so constantinople has been conquered and now the second part of the prophecy remains , which is the conquest of rome .
this means that islam will return to europe once again .
perhaps the next conquest will be the conquest of dawah and ideas .
there 's no need for conquest to be with the sword .
we might conquer these countries without armies .
we want armies of dawah preachers and teachers .
ware : islam is undergoing a huge revival , here and everywhere , and it is the muslim brotherhood who are leading it .
welcome to the dawah of political islam .
with its high octane blend of politics and religion as potent as any of history 's grand ideas .

panorama faith , hate & charity recorded from transmission : bbc one date : 30:07:06 john ware : this is a promotion for one of britain 's leading islamic charities called interpal .
" interpal , helping palestinians in need . "
ware : interpal does help palestinians who are greatly in need .
yusuf : we are for humanity , we are all for life .
ware : why then has interpal given funds to some organisations that promote death ?
-lsb- muslim children performing -rsb- give me the kalashnikov if you are thinking of giving up the fight .
ware : death in the cause of islam .
-lsb- children performing -rsb- for the sake of glory to religion we give our blood .
ware : interpal is at the heart of a global coalition of islamic charities , led by the spiritual leader of the largest islamic ideological movement in the world .
yusuf qaradawi : -lsb- preaching -rsb- we must plant the love of death and the love of martyrdom in the islamic nation .
ware : this is the story of how charity in britain has helped spread the ideology of the muslim brotherhood , which is largely peaceful , but which also likes to keep its options open .
-lsb- children performing -rsb- fasten your bomb belt oh would-be martyr and fill the square with blood so that we get back our homeland .
john ware ware : last january a political earthquake reshaped the middle east .
a group of fundamentalists regarded by western governments as terrorists , took power here in palestine .
the new palestinian government is run by hamas , for whom religion and politics are fused as one .
i 'm on my way to a charity in the west bank .
the old palestinian regime was regarded as corrupt .
hamas has won a reputation for honesty , based largely on how they 've run charities , many with funds from the british islamic charity interpal .
this kindergarten is run by a charity called the khalil al-rahman girls ' association .
it 's one of about 20 charities in the hebron area that have been funded by interpal over the years .
today it 's closed , it 's friday , it 's a muslim holiday .
no doubt many of the charities activities are jolly and wholesome , but some will chill the heart .
-lsb- children performing -rsb- we will sacrifice ourselves for our country .
we answer your call and make of our skulls a ladder to your glory .. a ladder ..
ware : the charity thanks interpal for its funding , which lasted 4 years .
this included money for food and education .
the children are taught that islam is more than just a faith , it 's also a political ideology .
-lsb- children performing -rsb- rise with us to liberate palestine through the path of the islamic dawah .
whoever abandons the path of muslims will live under humiliation and slavery .
ware : dawah means missionary work , bringing people closer to islam .
for a political movement like hamas , dawah is militant political preaching , often aimed at impressionable minds .
dr reuven paz former head , research division israel general security service children are the main focus for hamas dawah , because the principal is building the army of god .
the army of allah - jundullah , in arabic .
ware : these children learn there can be no compromise with israel , because the entire holy land was bequeathed to muslims .
-lsb- children performing -rsb- we assert that what is on this land and under this sky is muslim .
the brigades are preparing their lions to destroy the state of lies .
to victory in the decisive moment . -rsb-
-lsb- applause -rsb- ware : by law , british charities like interpal must ensure their funds are n't used to further the ideologies of terrorist groups .
hamas emerged in 1987 , as the palestinian branch of the worlds largest ideological islamic group , the muslim brotherhood .
here , in towns like ramallah , capital of the west bank , the brotherhood had been digging its roots deep into palestinian society for many years .
the brotherhood used charities to spread its dawah , calling palestinians to return to the fundamentals of islam .
mouin rabbani international crisis group the muslim brotherhood were very much a social movement , for whom the concept of charity and social welfare was an important component of what 's called dawah , which i think , loosely translated , might be translated as causalitisation .
ware : hamas capitalised on the brotherhood 's social welfare network , to turn growing numbers of observant muslims , into followers of their more militant and political version of islam .
is hamas in the social welfare business only to do good works ?
rabbani : no , of course not .
it 's a political organisation , that has a series of defined objectives , among which is increasing its .. the popular allegiance to it among its constituents .
ware : mosques , especially , have been used to inculcate hamas consciousness into young palestinians .
interpal funds religious activates .
it 's transferred money to the abdul nasser mosque in ramallah .
the mosque is quite obviously influenced by hamas .
rabbani : people or charities who are sending money to islamic charities in palestine , that are clearly controlled by hamas , are helping in the growth of the movement .
ware : in britain interpal had a prominent stall at this recent exhibition in london , to promote islam .
interpal has been raising around £ 4 million a year .
the charity categorically denies it 's helping to fund the hamas movement behind the banner of humanitarian aid .
the man who runs interpal has blamed such allegations on what he calls the " christian and jewish zionist movement . "
doctor essam mustafa , known also as essam yusuf , says he 'd consider stopping funds to any charity inciting violence .
dr essam yusuf vice chairman & managing trustee , interpal we are for humanity , we are all for life .
and this is what interpal is here for , and this is what interpal wish , and will , continue to do so in the future , inshallah .
ware : doctor yusef was celebrating interpal 's 10th anniversary at the british library where he was awarded a degree from the islamic university of gaza for his charity work .
december 2004 -lsb- yusuf receiving degree -rsb- -lsb- applause -rsb- ware : the university is a muslim brotherhood stronghold , the crucible of hamas ' holy war ideology .
doctor yusef declined to be interviewed .
but he has said : " we categorically deny we are , in any way , connected to any political organisation . "
and yet , his funds have helped build up hamas into what it is today .
a guest at interpal 's anniversary dinner was his friend , fellow palestinian mohammed sawalha .
from london , sawalha is said to have master minded much of hamas ' political and military strategy .
wanted by israel , he fled to london in 1990 .
paz : sawalha was one of the senior activists in the dawah portals of hamas .
he was involved , let 's say , with the background of the finance , the logistic assistance .
ware : but he was in hamas ?
dr reuven paz former head , research division israel general security service he was , he was a member , he was an activist of hamas , that 's for sure .
ware : in london , sawalha is alleged to have directed funds , both for hamas ' armed wing , and for spreading its missionary dawah .
then , in january 1993 , an operation sawalha was involved in went badly wrong .
hamas would be forced to reorganise its funding arrangements .
reconstruction ware : a senior hamas man from america flew into london for instructions from sawalha .
sawalha 's visitor was en route to the palestinian territories .
the two men travelled to sawalha 's home .
his visitor 's name was mohammed salah .
salah 's mission was to distribute funds .
sawalha told him who to meet in the palestinian territories .
paz : mohammed sawalha told mohammed salah to look as a respectable businessman , where to hide the suitcase , to take not to fancy hotel , etc , etc , and to be very cautious .
ware : with sawalha 's agreement salah began distributing about a quarter of a million dollars to local hamas operatives .
some was ear marked for military activities .
some for missionary dawah .
more money was in the pipe line from his bank in chicago .
but the israeli 's had been tracking him .
stopped at a check point as he left gaza , salah was arrested .
march 1993 ware : salah ended up doing nearly 5 years in an israeli jail , where the israeli 's got a lot out of him about mohammed sawalha in london , and hamas ' funding operation .
during one interrogation , salah was taped without his knowledge .
audio recording of salah 's interrogation ware : salah refers to sawalha as abu abada reconstruction salah : i made a stop in london to meet with abu abada , who is more knowledge about the west bank 's operational activities .
see , the operational and the dawah .
interrogator : i did n't understand .
one more time .
do you mean that abu abada is to be in charge of the dawah and of the movement .
salah : yes .
ware : although abu abada , mohammed sawalha , was known to mi5 , the authorities let him operate freely here .
paz : maybe even in london , i would say , he became more important for hamas than during the period he was in the territories .
ware : in london hamas and the islamic charity world were linking up .
mohammed sawalha had become friendly with the man who was to become boss of interpal , essam yusef .
intelligence sources say that in 1992 they had a visitor from the west bank .
his name was doctor mahmoud ramahi , a senior member of hamas .
doctor ramahi had been recruited to hamas by sawalha , who was his brother-in-law .
doctor yusuf told us he did n't recall meeting doctor ramahi in london .
at the time doctor yusuf was a trustee of a charity called the palestine and lebanon relief fund .
at his london meeting , according to our sources , doctor ramahi of hamas was asked to represent doctor yusuf 's charity in the palestinian territories .
in ramallah i arranged to meet doctor ramahi .
i wanted to ask him about his london meeting 14 years ago .
today he 's a successful doctor , and a senior hamas politician .
at the time he ran a medical centre , part of a charity closely affiliated to hamas .
doctor ramahi told me that in london he 'd simply asked for charitable funds from essam yusuf .
when you travelled to london , you were n't travelling as a member of the political office of hamas ?
dr mahmoud ramahi hamas no , no .
no , it 's for my job as chairman of the medical centre .
and i was the fund for this centre not because of hamas , not that i go to london and meet essam yusuf because we are members of hamas , no .
as a principle we have to help the poor people .
ware : for hamas though there can be more to helping the poor than just religion .
ramahi : for all muslims the politics is what 's inside the religion .
you ca n't separate the religion from the politics .
the politics is one part of the religion .
ware : 8 months after his trip to london , doctor ramahi was arrested by the israeli 's .
reconstruction december 1992 ware : hundreds more hamas men were deported to lebanon .
hamas was reeling .
money was its life blood , now it was being cut off .
the fight for hamas ' survival began , led by its network of supporters outside palestine .
in october 1993 a group of 25 muslims from canada and america arrived at philadelphia in the united states .
the most intractable conflict in the most volatile region of the world had begun to look as if it might be settled .
13th september 1993 -lsb- footage : rabin , arafat and clinton -rsb- ware : the israeli 's and palestinians had just signed a peace agreement known as the oslo accords .
hamas ' supporters on the outside were determined to help hamas on the inside destroy the peace process .
the group met at this hotel , all followers of the muslim brotherhood movement .
some ran islamic charities , others pressure groups .
the fbi was watching .
they described the group as muslim fundamentalists .
dale watson former assistant director fbi counterterrorism division their public persona was something very legal , looked very good , but yet if you looked behind the scene , so to speak , or behind the curtain , we knew this was n't the boy scouts .
reconstruction ware : the fbi bugged their rooms , and the meeting room where they spent most of the weekend in conference .
watson : we realised there was an orchestrated effort here to pretty much try to hide their identity - 1 -rrb- and 2 -rrb- make sure that they stayed under the radar scope , so to speak .
ware : fbi transcripts of this marathon session show that hamas , on the outside , was to follow a secret and subversive agenda , but one with a respectable public face .
privately they would do everything they could to destroy the oslo peace process , whilst publicly never speaking against it .
this was the blueprint for hamas ' survival , hammered out not in the back streets of gaza , but here in a suburban american hotel .
reconstruction ware : the participants referred to themselves simply as " the movement . "
they were careful not to use the word hamas .
participant : the goals we are taking about are in our hearts .
we ca n't put them down .
ware : to the muslim brothers at philadelphia there could be no compromise with the more secular palestinian leadership of talking peace , and never with israel .
participant : as a matter of fact a final decision has been made to continue the struggle indefinitely , whatever the circumstances .
ware : but , how to win this struggle ?
participant : the answer is to adhere to a strategy that can make the accord fail .
ware : one strategy was to direct more funds from islamic charities in america , to islamic charities in palestine who 'd be more receptive to hamas ' ideology .
participant : to defeat the accord we should make services available to the population .
ware : but , with a bias towards one section of the population .
participant : our relation has to be good with everyone , but we can give the islamists 100,000 , and 5,000 to the others .
ware : but those at philadelphia were only too aware of the fate of doctor ramahi .
arrested while distributing hamas funds and organising demonstrations , whilst also running a charity .
the expansion of missionary dawah was threatened by this mix of hamas and charity work .
a fundamental reorganisation of hamas ' funding system was proposed .
participant : the physician who fund the centre , and who was in charge of almost everything , and who was active and efficient , got mixed up , and was investigated and imprisoned .
what happened to him affected the institution drastically .
there should be no mix of the two works .
ware : no mix between overt hamas activity , and charitable work to safeguard dawah .
participant : we have to avoid being labelled terrorists , or terrorism supporters .
ware : keeping intact the hidden purpose of destroying the peace process by building grass root support for hamas .
participant : those brothers whom you help doing these things will ultimately by loyal to you politically .
dale watson former assistant director fbi counterterrorism division it was clear that we were not talking about just taking care of widows , orphans and hospitals , and it was a promotion of the organisation , their beliefs and ideas .
ware : but of course raising money for needy people is a very plausible , and worthy thing to do .
watson : absolutely , it is a worthy and worthwhile thing to do .
so it was a difficult matter , but if you really peeled of the onion , so to speak , you saw that hey , this is not exactly what it appears to be .
ware : the movement suggested that the funding of hamas associated charities should not be confined to america .
participant : i think the american arena is a secure place for a movement .
europe also can play the same role .
ware : philadelphia provided a model for promoting dawah on the inside , whilst affording legal cover to its funders on the outside .
although interpal 's trustees were n't present , there are striking similarities between the philadelphia model and the way interpal operates .
most of interpal 's funding is directed towards islamic charities .
i 'm on my way to an orphanage near hebron which gets funds from interpal .
the israeli 's found material here glorifying martyrdom .
posters of local militants framed with loving care , obviously by children .
the main hero figure is a local man .
the israelis say he planned the cold blooded murder of 4 jewish students .
the head of the orphanage is waiting to meet me .
hi mr rjoub , thanks for seeing me .
how are you ?
nice to see you .
the israeli 's say these posters were recovered intact , with the framing .
so the reason i 'm asking , mr rjoub , the reason i 'm asking about the framing is were you aware of any pupils or staff putting these frames together ?
hashem rjoub director , dura islamic society for orphans by god , i do n't think so .
we never had things like that .
this is the first time .
i was surprised by these photos .
we have never had any student or teacher who 's an artist .
i , of course , forbid anything like this .
and we only allow hanging things on the school walls which are to do with education .
ware : this is mr rjoub at a hamas rally .
at philadelphia the brotherhood wanted to disassociate charities from obvious hamas activity .
mr rjoub may not be an activist , but he 's certainly a supporter .
and there is a jihadi ethos in his orphanage , quiet , but resolute all the same .
it 's now afternoon prayers , then lessons resume .
interpal helps fund about 50 orphans here .
the teacher explains how he believes islam will , one day , deliver total victory .
teacher : we know the state of israel is something that happened suddenly , which was built upon what was originally there .
so it 's temporary .
ware : ultimate victory is fundamental to the ideology of hamas , a victory hamas insists has been ordained by god . -lsb- to young boy -rsb- who would you like to be ?
who 's your big hero ?
boy : like a mujahid .
ware : a fighter !
fighting for what ?
boy : we will continue to resist the israelis until we get them out .
teacher : i ca n't hear you .
raise your voice .
boy : we will resist the israelis .
ware : how many here want to be fighters ? 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 .
the children seem happy , and well cared for .
whether , overall , the ethos that interpal 's funding goes to support is healthy is less clear .
there was one other thing i wanted to ask you .
i 'm curious about that little sign up there .
what exactly is it ?
rjoub : let me look at it closely .
" do not disappoint the orphan . "
this is a koranic verse .
the koran encourages us to protect the orphan .
ware : and that red colour coming down the arm , and spilling over the world , is that .. does that signify .. what does that signify ?
rjoub : it 's not clear whether it 's blood or not , but in truth it looks like it might be .
ware : mr rjoub told me he 'd never noticed the blood before , even though the plaque had been there 10 years .
and he said the flags were of saudi arabia .
they are , in fact , used by hamas .
it conveys to me a picture of islam dominating the world , and , if necessary , through blood shed .
is that a dreadful exaggeration ?
rjoub : it 's true .
this picture expresses the vision of the person who drew it .
that does n't necessarily mean that these things exist .
ware : do you think you might take it down now i 've pointed it out to you ?
rjoub : yes indeed .
i want to stress that islam has ruled most of the world without blood .
there was no blood , it was through persuasion .
ware : interpal was launched in london in 1994 , 10 months after the muslim brotherhood meeting in philadelphia .
it operates from an anonymous building in cricklewood .
some of interpal 's own trustees have been followers of the brotherhood movement .
newspapers soon reported allegations that interpal was funding hamas .
the charity commission , the body that regulates charities , investigated .
they found no evidence of bias .
interpal distributed funds only on the basis of need .
but need was being determined not by interpal , but by the palestinian charities they helped fund .
at philadelphia some of these charities were named by this man .
the american authorities say muin shabib later admitted supporting hamas financially , and politically .
to his fellow muslim brothers , shabib spoke of charities that interpal would later give funds to as " our institutions . "
reconstruction shabib : in the west bank our institutions include the al tatoman charitable association , the jenin zakat committee , who establish a hospital .
in jerusalem we have the association of islamic studies and cultures .
we have active institutions at ramallah , such as the zakat committee .
ware : to some the israel palestine conflict was about much more than a national liberation issue .
it was the centre of struggle of the entire islamic world .
-lsb- the movement -rsb- participant : our greatest cause is islam .
palestine is only one part of this cause .
we have to stick to the fundamentals , the basics , the foundations of islam .
ware : humanitarian aid would certainly be needed .
a young , mainly conscript , israeli army often used live ammunition against unarmed demonstrators when palestinians staged a second uprising , or intifada , against israel 's occupation of the west bank .
the israeli 's were being hit by wave after wave of suicide bombers , targeting civilians .
dozens of the bombers were hamas .
the israeli 's sealed off towns , sending the palestinian economy into freefall .
interpal 's doctor essam yusuf now expanded his charity work .
he became the key man in a global coalition of islamic charities , with interpal at its heart .
this coalition was called the ' union of good . '
union of good promotional video dr essam yusuf union of good & interpal through that union for good we have managed to create something over than $ 200 million for palestinians in need .
ware : this has been social intervention on a vast scale .
this $ 200 million has bought more than just food and medicine .
it 's also been directed at the motor of missionary dawah .
schools , summer camps , mosques , places where a jihadi ethos has been promoted .
presiding over this global coalition of islamic charities is doctor yusuf qaradawi , spiritual leader of the muslim brotherhood movement , and a favourite of the london mayor .
july 2004 ken livingstone : you are truly welcome , welcome to london , a city of all faiths .
ware : doctor qaradawi 's followers in london , like the fugitive hamas commander mohammed sawalha , were there to greet him .
al-jazeera television ware : his following in the middle east is so big that sheikh qaradawi has his own talk show on al jazeera .
he makes no bones about the relationship between charity and politics .
2001 qaradawi : i do n't like this word " donations . "
i like to call it jihad with money .
because god has ordered us to fight enemies with our lives and our money .
ware : social welfare activism was the power behind the intifada .
for doctor qaradawi the intifada was also islam 's glory .
2001 qaradawi : w must plant the love of death and the love of martyrdom in the islamic nation .
ware : few have done more to fuse theology and politics , fuelling islamism 's global cult of martyrdom and holy war .
2002 qaradawi : the israelis have the nuclear bomb and we have the population bomb .
this population which has a desire for martyrdom and death .
this is what we have !
this is why these human bombs must continue until liberation .
ware : charity commission guidelines require interpal 's trustees to disassociate themselves completely from any hint of support for terrorism .
and yet , on television in the gulf , interpal 's vice chairman has sounded as if he might support terrorism .
2002 with me is brother essam yusuf from qatar .
go ahead brother essam yusuf : peace be with you .
greetings to the sheikh of the mujahideen .
sheikh dr yusuf ql-qaradawi .
the sheikh of heroic stands .
but my biggest salutation is to the mujahideen , to the heroes of the palestinian people who are sacrificing everything that is precious .
john ware doctor yusuf denied his words meant that he supported suicide bombers .
he said he was simply saluting sheikh qaradawi as the sheikh of strugglers .
he did say that he was opposed to suicide bombers targeting innocent people , but it was for others to decide who was innocent .
an article in doctor yusuf 's name also talks of " our battle with the zionist enemy " being a long one .
" and of support for jihad , in all its forms , until god allows for victory .
victory only comes from god . "
to hamas supporters , jihad , in all its forms , includes suicide bombing .
but doctor yusuf insists he never wrote or approved those words .
even though the article was commissioned by his own organisation , the union of good and appeared in his name .
doctor yusuf also denies his union of good website expresses support for hamas .
even though it includes a picture of sheikh yassin , the founder of hamas , on the page of a children 's campaign called the al yassin fund .
israel defence forces vido ware : in 2002 the israeli 's raided many charities associated with hamas .
they also searched the offices of the palestinian authorities security service .
what they discovered suggests , once again , that doctor yusuf broke the rules requiring charity trustees to disassociate themselves from terrorism .
this palestinian report describes the union of good as ' one of the biggest hamas supporters . '
it also discloses that in june 2002 doctor yusuf travelled to yemen , where he met senior members of hamas .
one was doctor mohammed syam , whom he describes as ' brilliant . '
kelly moore : we knew of course that syam was the head of hamas in yemen , and my impression of him is that he 's a terrorist , and supports militant terrorist activities .
fbi video ware : this was a mass wedding , 3 months after doctor yusuf 's visit .
sheikh syam was a guest , but it was n't a celebration of life to come , but of the near certainty of death , for the grooms about to embark on jihad .
the sheikh made an announcement .
sheikh syam : you will read about it tomorrow in the newspapers and hear about it in the media .
it brought down many of the invading occupiers and thanks be to god , lord of the universe .
god is the great and thanks be to god !
-lsb- aftermath - scene of the bombing -rsb- ware : a hamas suicide bomber has just blown up a bus full of passengers in tel aviv , killing 6 people including a student from scotland .
kelly moore former assistant us attorney he 's announcing , somewhat gleefully , and basically proud of the fact that hamas has just carried out a suicide attack in which innocent civilians were killed in israel .
ware : in yemen , doctor yusuf also met sheikh mohammed moyad , now in jail in america for funding hamas , and trying to fund al qaeda .
he ran a charity in the union of good , and he was being investigated by the fbi .
they 'd set up a sting at this hotel in frankfurt .
their informants posed as men who wanted to spend $ 2 million on jihad .
fbi video ware : this video was played at al moyad 's trial .
he offered 4 receipts from islamic charities as proof that he could get money to jihad .
moyad : this one , for instance , we deliver it to hamas .
this one we deliver it to the interior .
this one we send it to the martyrs .
but when we are in front of our government ¿ -lsb- laughter -rsb- ware : one of the receipts was from interpal , for $ 70,000 , which listed items like food , medical aid , and summer camps for children .
moore : in the middle of that conversation room service happened to walk in , in the hotel in frankfurt .
and when they walked in moyad quickly flipped the papers over so that they could n't be seen , and instructed everyone to change the subject , which obviously , if you were talking about charitable matters , he would n't have had to do .
ware : to reassure the fbi informants their money would actually fund jihad , al moyad then offered these details about interpal .
al moyad : it 's interpal .
it 's a company which i visited in london , and i sat with them there .
they 're good .
ware : al moyad said that , in london , he 'd dealt personally with interpal 's managing trustee , doctor essam yusuf .
moyad : i sat with essam , he 's one of the best people .
he is , tell him , the assistant , the one responsible for things after sheikh al-qaradawi in the union of good .
participant : are they hamas as well ?
moyad : they are working for all of the islamic jihad .
so this is hamas also .
ware : doctor yusuf acknowledges he met al moyad in yemen , but says it was solely to do with raising funds for palestinians in need .
he insists sheikh syam , who gleefully announced the suicide bombing , just happened to be present at one of his meetings .
the vice chairman of interpal , doctor essam yusuf , has said many times that neither he nor interpal have any connections , any links , of any kind , with hamas .
what 's your response to that ?
moore : given that he was meeting with moyad and mohammed syam , moyad who 's now been convicted of terrorism crimes related to hamas , and syam who was the known leader of hamas in yemen , he clearly has links to hamas .
those are links to hamas .
ware : it is because doctor yusuf runs both interpal , and the union of good , that the american authorities have put interpal at the very heart of hamas ' global fundraising operation .
interpal strenuously denies this .
you describe interpal as the funding coordinator for hamas .
that .. you 're ascribing interpal a very central role there .
daniel glaser : yes , we are .
ware : and that 's still the position as far as you 're concerned ?
glaser : absolutely .
ware : the us and european union have outlawed both the political and military wings of hamas .
they regard it as one terrorist movement , and its social welfare network as integral to the movement .
daniel glaser us treasury it becomes difficult to separate its social welfare network out from what hamas actually is , which is a network dedicated to violence and extremism .
the fact that they provide these social services , legitimises that ideology , it radicalises populations , it provides an over arching legitimisation and cover for what is ultimately a terrorist organisation .
ware : the americans designated interpal as a terrorist entity in 2003 .
once again the charity commission launched an investigation , and once again they found no evidence that interpal had any links to hamas .
for the americans it was a bewildering decision .
senate hearing 25th september 2003 david aufhauser general counsel , us treasury what happened with interpal in britain is really quite chilling .
this .. these were the best of our friends .
if we can not convince them to join us against one of the primary funders of hamas , in the millions of dollars , within weeks after the designation by the eu of hamas as a foreign terrorist organisation , it gives you some taste of how difficult it is to get other , less friendly , nations to join us .
ware : the charity commission , which regulates charities , pledges that any allegation of links to terrorism will be assessed rigorously .
this is not a cheap point .
the word investigation seems to dignify what you actually did .
it does n't sound to me as if you conducted an investigation .
kenneth dibble charity commission the enquiry we undertook in 1996 was different from the one we undertook in 2003 , they had a different focus .
ware : so it 's not .. it would n't be fair to describe 2003 as a rigorous investigation .
dibble : it was an investigation which followed a particular concern , and focus .
ware : but it was n't widespread .
dibble : it was n't in depth .
ware : interpal may not have been buying guns , but emphatically its funds were going to charities inextricably linked to hamas .
just how much influence hamas has over some charities funded by interpal can require the judgement of solomon , though the charity commission are n't perhaps the best people to make that judgement , since their investigators have n't actually set foot here on the west bank .
the commission has avoided taking a stand on a defining issue of the age , on where exactly islamic piety bleeds into islamist politics .
instead they 've relied on what interpal boasts are their eyes and ears on the ground , the palestinian charities their money goes to .
hebron is one of hamas ' power bases in the west bank .
the sign says ' welcome to the city of hamas . '
welcome to the city of hamas ware : as we drove through the city we came across a hamas celebration .
the guest of honour was a hamas man , mustafa shawer , who 'd just been released by the israeli 's after being detained for 20 months without trial .
how do you do , can we talk to you ?
mr shawer is a professor at hebron university , teaching islamic culture and law .
i asked him why hamas had won the election .
mustafa shawer hamas i think the main reason the islamic movement has been successful is the people 's love of islam .
the think that their worldly interests forget about the after life and paradise require a person who is religious , who can be trusted with public money and serve the public honestly .
ware : the lion 's share of interpal 's funding in hebron has gone to the city 's biggest charity .
promotional video the islamic charitable society strives day and night to care and cater for orphans , and the needy .
ware : at philadelphia , the brotherhood movement urged charitable funding to create employment and economic power centres for hamas supporters .
that 's happened in hebron .
here workers receive their salaries from the charities sewing workshop .
the treatment 's also available from the charities clinic .
and , thanks to interpal , bread from the charity 's bakery is delivered to poorer families .
hamas may now be the palestinian government , but its supporters do n't tend to talk openly about its activities .
what about the islamic charitable society of hebron ?
is that part of the social welfare network of hamas ?
shawer : this talk is not true .
ware : but it does appear to be true .
the hebron charity 's own website in 2004 showed that mr shawer himself was then a member of its administrative board .
several other senior figures have belonged to hamas , including abdul al haliq al nache , seen here at a rally .
he 's now hamas ' most senior man in jail .
the charities current chairman is also a member of hamas .
the charity runs two large orphanages , and schools for boys and girls .
the term orphan includes children who have parents who ca n't look after them .
interpal 's funds help the charity give these boys an education , and holidays .
what 's your favourite lesson ?
saif badran the language , the arabic language .
ware : arabic language ?
badran : yes .
ware : why arabic language ?
badran : because the first thing is .. it 's my language , and it 's the language of the koran .
ware : what does the koran mean to you ?
badran : i learn from it everything .
how to life .. it 's the way of my life .
ware : this is a photograph of a school event .
flags used by hamas are prominently to the fore .
several former pupils have joined hamas ' armed wing .
at least two have aspired to the goal set by doctor qaradawi ' a passion for death in the cause of islam . '
they became suicide bombers .
one was raed abul marsq , pictured here with his two children before strapping on an 11 pound bomb packed with nails , and boarding a jerusalem bus , killing 23 .
nearby is the girls ' orphanage and school , also run by the islamic charitable society of hebron to which interpal also gives substantial funds .
the entrance to the school is adorned by two hamas flags .
i went to see the principal , her name is fateheya qawasmeh .
we 're from the bbc .
how do you do ?
mrs qawasmeh was a hamas candidate in the recent election .
she is the mother of six children , whom she says have been brought up to love martyrdom , and famously , widow of abdullah , an iconic local commander of hamas , which is proud to repeat israel 's description of him as a battery farmer of martyrs .
mrs qawasmeh says her late husband chose her for his wife because of her love of dawah .
fateheya qawasmeh head , al sharia girls ' school hebron we are here to fulfil an educational role .
the political role is outside the school .
ware : you say you leave your political beliefs outside , but of course i could n't help notice two large hamas flags right outside your door .
qawasmeh : where are they ?
ware : where exactly , show me where ?
qawasmeh : where are they ?
ware : i saw two flags hanging outside the door .
qawasmeh : this flag is n't only the hamas flag , it 's also the saudi flag , is n't it ?
ware : but this is n't saudi arabia , this is the west bank .
why are you flying the flag of saudi arabia ?
qawasmeh : this flag represents muslims in general , whether it 's saudi arabia , palestine , anywhere , anywhere .
ware : so it 's a coincidence that it happens to be the same flag as hamas , and that you stood for hamas in the election ?
that 's just a coincidence ?
qawasmeh : saudi arabia is a muslim country and it represents the islamic world , since holy mecca is in it .
ware : although mrs qawasmeh insisted she kept her politics out of the school , i wondered how she managed this , given her fundamentalist views .
i thought the whole ideology of hamas was that you ca n't really separate politics from your faith , because the two are completely bound up in each other .
the two are one , as it were .
qawasmeh : inside the school my duty is simply educational .
outside the school i 'm active in some social work organisations .
ware : this is one social organisation mrs qawasmeh helped set up , the al khalil al rahman girls ' society .
it too has had funds from interpal . -lsb- children perform -rsb- we all sacrifice ourselves for our country .
we answer your call and make of our skulls a ladder to your glory .
ware : ' we answer your call , and make our skulls a ladder to your glory . '
now that 's just one example of young .. very young girls actually , singing songs about martyrdom , and that kind of thing .
that 's politics , is n't it ?
qawasmeh : these songs do n't come from the school .
the girls learn them from their own social environment , from their homes .
we do n't teach these songs in the school .
they 're not on the curriculum .
ware : but at her girl 's society the children are n't exactly discouraged from singing such songs .
-lsb- children perform -rsb- to martyrs in every time and place .
to their rich blood and to their wounds which have defined the identity of the islamic land .
ware : these are not views you would dissent from , i imagine .
qawasmeh : are we banned from talking even about ourselves ?
we 're a group of educationalists , rational people who believe that it 's okay for a human being to speak about his homeland in his songs and his talk .
or are we not allowed to do such a thing , and you lot are allowed everything ?
ware : at this point mrs qawasmeh said she had to go , because her own children were waiting .
i had one more question .
i read that the israeli army searched this orphanage here in august 2004 .
that 's what i read .
that 's not true ?
qawasmeh : it did n't happen .
it definitely did n't happen .
i 'm sure .
nobody came to our orphanage .
ware : so we asked the israeli 's for their evidence .
they took us to this vast hangar on an army base , containing many thousands of files , seized from islamic charities on the west bank .
the army produced four boxes which they said were taken from the girls ' orphanage in hebron on the 12th of august 2004 .
the boxes do contain material which , self evidently , is from the orphanage .
mrs qawasmeh 's denial is simply not credible .
with the boxes came this computer hard drive which the israeli 's say they found in the office of the manageress who ran the orphanage .
on it are the names of all the children , and a lot else besides .
this , quite literally , is a trove of images of hamas martyrs and their exploits - hundreds of them .
nothing is left to the imagination .
bars and buses they 've blown up , the bloody , twisted , and scattered limbs of their victims .
there 's also the odd picture paying homage to osama bin laden .
you 've taken interpal 's word for it , without going to the west bank , that that kind of thing is n't going on , have n't you ?
kenneth dibble charity commission well , i do n't know whether we asked them specifically in terms , because i 'm not aware that that sort of concern has actually been raised with us .
ware : you are kidding !
sorry , surely you have , you 've asked them , in a place like the west bank you surely have said what else is going on in these organisations ?
dibble : i do not believe we have considered that , in terms .
ware : well that is exactly the point , and can you tell me why you have n't considered that , because it 's pretty fundamental , is n't it ?
dibble : well it is , but , as i said , it 's only in recent times that the vulnerability of charities for use for these purposes has actually been recognised .
but i think it 's an issue that you are now raising now and , if i may say so , is quite a pertinent issue to raise .
ware : today the middle east is once again convulsed by hate .
but when this latest battle ends , there will still be hamas .
some in hamas have talked of a possible truce with israel .
others see a struggle that will end only with the end of israel .
interpal says it had always wanted to build on the peace process ..
what it 's helped build is an implacable islamist ideology .
roughly how many charity committees is hamas affiliated to at the moment , would you say ?
dr mahmoud ramahi hamas maybe more than 200 of charitable committees is affiliated to hamas .
some of them they ca n't say that we are affiliated to hamas , because of these struggles , and so and so .
ware : to what extent do you think this charitable work contributed to your substantial victory earlier this year ?
ramahi : yes , they have a big .. they are responsible for the victories that we take , because as you understand ¿ ware : they are responsible ?
ramahi : they are responsible .
ware : the social , hamas ' social ¿ ramahi : the main responsible . -lrb- laughs -rrb- ware : in public the british government is crystal clear about where it stands on support for hamas .
7th july 2004 tony blair : -lsb- speaking in the house -rsb- let me make it absolutely clear .
we want nothing to do with people who support suicide bombers in palestine , or elsewhere , or support terrorists .
ware : and yet officials believe some of interpal 's funds have gone to palestinian charities that engender hamas ' ideology .
last year the treasuries asset freezing working group examined files on charities in six west bank towns .
on hebron a draft report says the islamic charitable society had funded and administered educational programmes that appear tantamount to incitement and indoctrination in support of violent hamas activity .
a year on the government hesitates to do much about it .
meanwhile the muslim brotherhood movement here goes from strength to strength .
and it 's the friend of interpal 's managing trustee who is leading it .
the fugitive hamas commander , mohammed sawalha , is perhaps , the most influential muslim brother in britain today .
he organised the recent islam expo in london , his latest act of missionary dawah to promote what he describes as the real islam .
but , what exactly does mohammed sawalha mean by " real islam " , and how can we explore this without asking him about his background and his real beliefs ?
well , we ca n't , because he wo n't discuss them .
and for all the organiser 's warm words about this exhibition promoting dialogue and understanding , in fact the muslim brotherhood is exercising tight control .
they wo n't even let us in there .
but we found a way in to find interpal 's managing trustee , along with muslim leaders , and some politicians .
the muslim brotherhood movement already dominates many islamic groups here .
islam expo was a further attempt by the movement to position itself as mainstream .
its followers are foot soldiers to the most influential dawah missionary of political islam today , sheikh yusuf qaradawi .
but it is only to middle east audiences that the brotherhood 's spiritual leader , the sheikh of the mujahideen , unveils his prophetic dream .
europe , as he sees it , islam 's next frontier .
1999 yusuf qaradawi : so constantinople has been conquered and now the second part of the prophecy remains , which is the conquest of rome .
this means that islam will return to europe once again .
perhaps the next conquest will be the conquest of dawah and ideas .
there 's no need for conquest to be with the sword .
we might conquer these countries without armies .
we want armies of dawah preachers and teachers .
ware : islam is undergoing a huge revival , here and everywhere , and it is the muslim brotherhood who are leading it .
welcome to the dawah of political islam .
with its high octane blend of politics and religion as potent as any of history 's grand ideas .
