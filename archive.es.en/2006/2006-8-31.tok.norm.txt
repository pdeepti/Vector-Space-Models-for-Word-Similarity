"
merkel and the jewish council president met wednesday to clear things up . german chancellor angela merkel met charlotte knobloch , the president of germany 's central council of jews , wednesday to address jewish anger over remarks made by overseas development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul about israel 's offensive in lebanon . merkel and knobloch , in the first meeting of its kind since the council 's president took office , discussed the situation of the jewish community in germany , the state of affairs in the middle east and germany 's cooperation with the united nations in stabilizing lebanon for over an hour . the meeting concluded with the chancellor reaffirming that the german government and the central council of jews had " a positive and trusting friendship . " minister called for un investigation of israel the meeting was deemed necessary after wieczorek-zeul came under fire from knobloch and the council when , during a visit to lebanon , she called for a un investigation into claims that israel used carpet bombs in the campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul has defended her comments on israel " i pointed out - and all the aid organizations and even the un also point out - that there are carpet bombs in southern lebanon , " the minister told german broadcaster zdf on thursday .
she has continued to defend her comment and repeated her appeal for a general ban on carpet bombs . the central council of jews has accused wieczorek-zeul of stirring up anti-jewish sentiment in germany . jewish council critical of beirut visit knobloch has also attacked the development minister for visiting beirut last week as part of germany 's pledge to help rebuild lebanon following the devastating 34-day-long israeli offensive to rout hezbollah militia . " the least she could have done was to visit israel first .
she should have reached out first to the attacked , not the attackers , " said the council president . the council 's vice president , salomon korn , told the daily frankfurter rundschau , " the call for a un probe was another knee-jerk reaction from the minister towards israel . " if wieczorek-zeul wanted a un probe this should also take into account the fact that israeli citizens have for years come under rocket fire from lebanese soil , he added . the development minister said thursday on zdf 's " morgenmagazin " that she traveled to lebanon last weekend because germany is participating in rebuilding the country 's infrastructure .
israel , she said , wants to use its own resources to repair damage within its borders and therefore a visit was not necessary . internal differences on middle east policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knobloch became council president in june 2005 the row has highlighted differences of opinion in merkel 's power sharing left-right government on the middle east . when the war in lebanon erupted , the conservative merkel pointed out that hezbollah had started the trouble by seizing israeli soldiers .
though merkel urged restraint she did not join calls by other european leaders for an immediate ceasefire or criticize israel 's use of force as excessive . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said wednesday that germany believed it carries a historical responsibility towards the jewish state because of the holocaust , and said all government ministers respected this policy . wieczorek-zeul had not broken with it by calling for a un probe , nor was she anti-israeli , he added . she is a member of the social democrats , like foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , and is known for lashing out at human rights abuses regardless who may have committed them . steinmeier , who would like to help broker a long-term peace deal in the middle east , came in for criticism from the jewish council at the start of the war when he suggested that israel 's offensive might be disproportionate . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a german minister 's popular dissent on lebanon germany 's minister responsible for development aid has been a lone voice calling for an immediate ceasefire in lebanon .

the focus this year is likely to be high-definition tv and the growing battle between dvd formats . technophiles in berlin might think they have died and gone to high-tech heaven as they roam the aisles of the 46th ifa consumer electronics show in the country 's capital , the world 's largest .
exhibitors from 30 countries have come to show off their latest developments , with the next generation of televisions - high-definition tv -lrb- hdtv -rrb- with lcd and plasma screens - taking center stage . the arrival of hd-tv , high definition television , will mean that pictures will edge closer to cinema quality , and sound will come from eight channels instead of one or two .
the new , slim lcd and plasma sets are selling well here in germany , with sales up 30 percent on last year .
electronics retailers got an additional boost during this summer 's soccer world cup , when sales jumped further .
in western europe , an estimated 14 million hdtvs are expected to have been sold by the end of 2006 . " those figures back up the forecasts of market analysts who say that the roll-out for hd-tv is going to be much faster than it was for color television in the days of black and white , " said rainer hecker , the chairman of germany 's society for consumer electronics . battle of the formats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost all the major industrial groups in the consumer electronics sector are at the ifa much attention at the show is likely to focus on the battle between rival optical-disc formats , blu-ray and hd-dvd , described by some as a 21st-century repeat of the vhs versus beta video tape formats . both insist they have found the perfect successor to today 's dvd movie discs , and will announce players , for sale in european stores , and the first releases of high-definition movies for european sale .
but the rocky start of the technology in the united states in recent weeks suggests the real european launch is still months away and this drama could continue for some time .
it almost certainly will not be resolved at the current show . mobile devices the industry is also registering healthy demand for mobile and hand-held devices .
more than 160 million mobile phones , navigation aids , mp3 players , notebooks and other portable devices were sold in europe in 2005 . " these are all categories that came to the market relatively recently and are displaying a dynamism , quite unlike what we were seeing five years ago , " said hans joachim kamp , head of germany 's consumer electronics trade association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making sure everything 's shiny ever year about 10,000 new consumer electronics products are released onto the market .
the ones that sell well generally have lots of features and boost the image of their owners . however , sales in germany dropped by one-and-a-half percent in the first six months of this year .
this was due largely to falling sales in it and telecommunications products .
but analysts are still confident the whole of the electronics industry will turn in a growth figure of four percent this year .
it is hoped the ifa will help kick-start that growth . the fair opens for consumers on friday .
those visitors can get a sneak preview of the products that the retailers will be ordering and which will appear in stores over the next six months .

" please , do not believe in the myth of an anti-semitic , homophobic , xenophobic poland .
please , come to poland , " he said in brussels after talks with european commission president jose manuel barroso . since he came to office last month , kaczynski 's government has appeared isolationist and has raised eyebrows in the eu with its hard-line attitude toward homosexuals , jews and the death penalty . " i can not mention any specific names here but i can tell you that in poland there are homosexuals who take very high positions on the polish political scene , and they also come from the right-wing parties , " he told reporters . " when it comes to anti-semitism , we have certain provisions in poland so that you can not use anti-semitic language , " he said . redressing the balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leader of poland 's conservative law and justice party , jaroslaw kaczynski , does n't usually mince words on arriving for his one-day visit , kaczynski , the twin brother of polish president lech kaczynski , said he was determined to clear up " misunderstandings " about his country 's commitment to the european union . poland joined the bloc in the " big bang " enlargement in may 2004 that saw the eu grow from 15 to 25 member states . " i am convinced that we will dissipate these misunderstandings and that this evening things will be better , " he told reporters traveling with him . " of course , we have our own expectations and our opinions and these sometimes differ from those of other countries , but we are a normal and loyal member of this organization , and we 'll do everything to ensure it has a great future in front of it , " he said . sensitive matters in july , all of poland 's former foreign ministers since the fall of communism in 1989 wrote a letter to condemn his brother 's behavior as " damaging to the interests of poland " and dismissive of its eu partners .
the letter was made public after the president appeared to snub a summit with german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac . at their joint press conference , barroso said he had raised a number of " sensitive matters " with kaczynski about poland 's attitude toward issues ranging from the death penalty to the independence of the central bank . he said he had been satisfied with the response . " i do n't take decisions based on comment , i take decisions based on facts and i think the facts will show poland 's commitment to european values , " barroso said .
" i really believe that poland is a crucially important country for the success of the european project .
i also believe that the european union is crucial for the future of poland and the well-being of the polish people .

" kaczynski could also come under fire over an initiative launched by the extreme-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , a junior partner in his coalition government , to collect half a million signatures of eu citizens on a petition demanding the death penalty for pedophile-murderers . that move has already drawn a swift rebuff from the commission .
the eu 's executive body has said that capital punishment " is not compatible with european law or european values . " in a sign he was listening to some eu warnings , the polish premier said his government would send on thursday a " project paper " to the commission to better explain its controversial state aid to three key shipyards . brussels has warned that it expects the polish authorities to clarify by the end of the month its restructuring plans for the gdansk , gdynia and szczecin yards , the country 's biggest and which employ around 16,000 people . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish president 's twin brother becomes prime minister the surprise announcement that the president 's twin , jaroslaw kaczynski , is to be sworn in monday as prime minister has pushed down the value of the polish currency and raised concerns over poland 's nationalist shift .

on wednesday in berlin , she announced plans by the government to step up its investment in high-tech , with the aim to bring creative ideas out of the ivory tower and onto the commercial market . " in many areas , we are at the top in basic research , " she said .
" but in general , across technical fields , putting those ideas into practice does n't work frequently enough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan , federal minister of education and research schavan , a member of the conservative christian democrats , said many of germany 's good ideas get put away in a drawer somewhere or first get turned into money-making products abroad .
the minister said she wants to put the emphasis on scientific research which can lead to products or processes with commercial uses . " fields of innovation " most of the federal money will go to the aerospace and energy technology sectors , although substantial amounts will be directed toward health and medical research , environmental research as well as security technology for nuclear power plants .
all in all , schavan named 17 " fields of innovation , " which range from aerospace to traffic technology to nano- and biotechnology . the funding also includes award money so that small and medium-sized companies can get their research findings to market more quickly . " we also want to ensure that young scientists in this country realize their opportunities and make germany into a place where new talent is forged , " she said . industry groups and economic organizations had mostly praise for the new investment program , although some were critical that even more of the money set aside was not going into efforts to get products to market .

he considers the establishment of sustainable economic development in the region to be the greatest challenge in his new role , particularly in light of the impending transfer of authority in kosovo . the new unmik head is confident this can be achieved , but said that integrating kosovo into the larger markets in southeastern europe and the eu is essential . eco n omic i n tegratio n n ecessary for developme n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rücker has served for three years in the balkans " it 's very good that kosovo is a member of the regional energy league in southeastern europe , which links the regional energy markets , " rücker said .
" without integration , it wo n't work .
investment in the infrastructure - and especially private investment - is necessary .
the privatization program is contributing to this . " rücker , a 55-year-old native of the southwestern german state of baden-württemberg , brings practical experience in solving macro-economic problems .
as mayor of the town of sindelfingen from 1993 to 2001 , he managed to revamp the city 's budget , which had been burdened by heavy debts . " i think that this administrative experience in a town with difficulties is very important , " said franz-lothar altmann , an economic expert for southeastern europe at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" he has shown that he can lead a larger political entity , which is what kosovo is . " repairi n g eth n ic divisio n s in addition to the economic developments , rücker will have to contribute to ethnic conciliation between serbs and albanians in kosovo .
his goal is that , by the end of his mandate , all citizens will be represented through the elected institutions in the region and ethnic minorities will be active in social and political life . " unmik is mandated to administrate kosovo as a whole and structures that work against this can not be tolerated , " said rücker , referring to parallel administrative structures in the region that aim at dividing kosovo between the serbs and albanians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostilities in kosovo disrupted - and ended - many lives the implementation of standardized license plates is one example of efforts to promote political and ethnic cooperation , rücker said .
to enhance freedom of movement for all residents , unmik introduced license plates several years ago that do n't reveal which city the vehicle is from .
previously , nationalist street mobs had attacked returning refugees after identifying from the license plate where they came from . however , the newer standardized plates still are n't in use in serbian-dominated northern kosovo , because they are not officially recognized by neighboring serbia .
serbs from the north drive with serbian license plates or none at all .
they do n't dare to come south , and drivers from the south avoid heading north with standard plates . status decisio n expected by year 's e n d whether with license plates , ethnic reconciliation or economic development , rücker is aware that change wo n't come over night , he said . " it 's very important for us that the residents of kosovo have perspective , " he said .
" this will come with the beginning of the status negotiations , at the latest . " the negotiation process on kosovo 's ultimate political status is being chaired by finnish diplomat martti ahtisaari .
resolving kosovo 's status is a major factor in the stability of the region , rücker said . " we will do everything we can so that mr. ahtisaari and the contact group are able to stay on schedule , " he said .
" that means that they should be able to submit a final decision on kosovo 's status to the security council by the end of the year .

bavarian officials are calling it an " emergency solution . " homeschooling is illegal in germany , and yet the members of the fundamentalist christian sect " zwölf stämme " -lrb- twelve tribes -rrb- have won a victory of sorts in their fight to educate their children outside of germany 's state school system .
bavarian officials have agreed to let the group 's 32 school-aged children be taught by their own teachers in a private school - albeit one that is subject to state controls .
the school has initially been limited to a timeframe of one year . with the creation of the private school , a " years-long illegal situation has been ended , " said stefan rössle , district administrator for the region of donauwörth in bavaria . long battle with the law because of their religious convictions , parents in the twelve tribes community had been battling with state officials for over four years to keep their children out of state schools .
twelve tribes members take the bible 's teachings literally , and prefer to shield their children from some aspects of the modern world .
in homeschooling , for example , they teach the creation story , not the theory of evolution . but because homeschooling is not allowed in germany , the twelve tribes parents paid a high price for their resistance to state education .
over the years , they 've amassed some 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 167,000 -rrb- in unpaid fines , watched their children be forcibly enrolled in state schools , and stood by as one father was imprisoned for two weeks for his resistance .
through it all , they refused to bow to the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creation of the private school was an " emergency solution , " state officials said the result is a compromise solution .
the bavarian ministry of educational and cultural affairs has approved a curriculum for the group 's new private school in which sex education is absent , but where ethics , rather than religion , will be taught .
the parents can choose the teachers , but they have to foot the bill for the school themselves . " for us , the compromise was mainly about protecting the children 's right to an education , " said a ministry spokesperson . state still has control unlike homeschooling , the school will still be subject to state supervision .
state school officials have the right to visit the school at anytime and check on how lessons are being taught . " we will keep a very watchful eye on the project , " said rössle . green party politicians in the bavarian state parliament have criticized the compromise , saying the state is not acting in the children 's interest when it allows a " questionable religious community " the freedom to educate outside the state system . this latest example in bavaria highlights the difficult position state authorities are in when parents simply refuse to obey the law .
in recent months , there have been several incidents of homeschooling families clashing with truancy officials , mostly for religious reasons . their case histories are documented by several homeschooling initiatives in germany which are lobbying for greater educational freedom . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living room lessons not easy in germany opting to teach your kids at home instead of sending them to school is not an easy decision .

de la vega followed up a trip on tuesday to current european union presidency holder finland by telling senior eu officials in brussels more had to be done and the bloc as a whole showed a " lack of commitment " in dealing with the problem .
the number of immigrants arriving in 2006 has exceeded the totals of previous years with about 19,000 refugees landing on the spanish islands to date , compared to the previous annual record of 9,900 , in 2002 .
the deputy prime minister stressed that spain could not deal with the constant flow from africa alone and madrid was " concerned at the slowness of certain initiatives . "
more refugee arrivals than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the influx of refugees has stretched spain 's resources according to canary islands authorities , in august alone over 4,700 refugees arrived on their shores , which is more than the total for 2005 .
three months ago de la vega forcibly put spain 's case forward but despite receiving air and sea surveillance assistance from the eu borders monitoring body frontex , the influx has continued unabated with the surveillance programme still not fully operational .
only finland , italy and portugal have so far committed patrol boats or surveillance planes to frontex , operating off mauritania , senegal and cape verde , joining spanish officials already working in the area .
after talks with de la vega , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said : " it is essential that all member states continue to show their political readiness to share the heavy burden which is now carried by a limited number of member states , which do their best to protect the eu external borders . "
frattini announced that the commission would set up a high-level working group on immigration and asylum issues , to be coordinated by de la vega , but acknowledged that " there is no quick fix . "
ineffective eu assistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masses of arrivals could cause a humanitarian crisis hindering frontex efforts further , one italian patrol boat , diciotti , has been stuck for 10 days in the southern spanish port of cadiz with engine trouble , while portugese counterpart baptista de andrade has been patrolling off cape verde for the past 10 days but has yet to report sightings of any illegal immigrants .
with the continual flow of arrivals , there has been increased political pressure on the spanish government , and with the canaries facing regional elections next year , the issue has become highly politicized .
nationally , the main conservative opposition popular party has lambasted the government as incompetent .
immigrants who survive torrid trips to the islands lasting upwards of 10 days are taken to overflowing reception camps and are then transferred to the mainland for up to 40 days , after which they are given an unenforceable document providing for their expulsion .
' ' humanitarian catastrophe " waiting to happen spain announced recently that 11,826 illegal arrivals had been transferred from the canary islands to the mainland since january .
most can not be repatriated in the absence of bilateral agreements with their homeland .
de la vega criticized eu partner states for their slowness in applying article 13 of the cotonou accord on repatriation of immigrants amid the reluctance to commit sufficient resources to the problem .
the canaries government had after monday 's arrivals called on eu states and the international community to help halt " a humanitarian catastrophe " , estimating some 490 would-be immigrants had died at sea this year . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks rapid reaction teams to deal with illegal immigrants the european commission has unveiled plans for rapid reaction teams of border guards to police europe 's frontiers , as spain and malta haggled over who should deal with a fresh wave of illegal immigrants .

de la vega followed up a trip on tuesday to current european union presidency holder finland by telling senior eu officials in brussels more had to be done and the bloc as a whole showed a " lack of commitment " in dealing with the problem .
the number of immigrants arriving in 2006 has exceeded the totals of previous years with about 19,000 refugees landing on the spanish islands to date , compared to the previous annual record of 9,900 , in 2002 .
the deputy prime minister stressed that spain could not deal with the constant flow from africa alone and madrid was " concerned at the slowness of certain initiatives . "
more refugee arrivals than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the influx of refugees has stretched spain 's resources according to canary islands authorities , in august alone over 4,700 refugees arrived on their shores , which is more than the total for 2005 .
three months ago de la vega forcibly put spain 's case forward but despite receiving air and sea surveillance assistance from the eu borders monitoring body frontex , the influx has continued unabated with the surveillance programme still not fully operational .
only finland , italy and portugal have so far committed patrol boats or surveillance planes to frontex , operating off mauritania , senegal and cape verde , joining spanish officials already working in the area .
after talks with de la vega , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said : " it is essential that all member states continue to show their political readiness to share the heavy burden which is now carried by a limited number of member states , which do their best to protect the eu external borders . "
frattini announced that the commission would set up a high-level working group on immigration and asylum issues , to be coordinated by de la vega , but acknowledged that " there is no quick fix . "
ineffective eu assistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masses of arrivals could cause a humanitarian crisis hindering frontex efforts further , one italian patrol boat , diciotti , has been stuck for 10 days in the southern spanish port of cadiz with engine trouble , while portugese counterpart baptista de andrade has been patrolling off cape verde for the past 10 days but has yet to report sightings of any illegal immigrants .
with the continual flow of arrivals , there has been increased political pressure on the spanish government , and with the canaries facing regional elections next year , the issue has become highly politicized .
nationally , the main conservative opposition popular party has lambasted the government as incompetent .
immigrants who survive torrid trips to the islands lasting upwards of 10 days are taken to overflowing reception camps and are then transferred to the mainland for up to 40 days , after which they are given an unenforceable document providing for their expulsion .
' ' humanitarian catastrophe " waiting to happen spain announced recently that 11,826 illegal arrivals had been transferred from the canary islands to the mainland since january .
most can not be repatriated in the absence of bilateral agreements with their homeland .

germany 's education and research minister says the goal is 1.5 million new jobs in high-tech fields . ground-breaking research is n't the problem in germany , getting innovative products to the market is , according to annette schavan , minister for education and research .
on wednesday in berlin , she announced plans by the government to step up its investment in high-tech , with the aim to bring creative ideas out of the ivory tower and onto the commercial market . " in many areas , we are at the top in basic research , " she said .
" but in general , across technical fields , putting those ideas into practice does n't work frequently enough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan , federal minister of education and research schavan , a member of the conservative christian democrats , said many of germany 's good ideas get put away in a drawer somewhere or first get turned into money-making products abroad .
the minister said she wants to put the emphasis on scientific research which can lead to products or processes with commercial uses . " fields of innovation " most of the federal money will go to the aerospace and energy technology sectors , although substantial amounts will be directed toward health and medical research , environmental research as well as security technology for nuclear power plants .
all in all , schavan named 17 " fields of innovation , " which range from aerospace to traffic technology to nano- and biotechnology . the funding also includes award money so that small and medium-sized companies can get their research findings to market more quickly . " we also want to ensure that young scientists in this country realize their opportunities and make germany into a place where new talent is forged , " she said . industry groups and economic organizations had mostly praise for the new investment program , although some were critical that even more of the money set aside was not going into efforts to get products to market .

he considers the establishment of sustainable economic development in the region to be the greatest challenge in his new role , particularly in light of the impending transfer of authority in kosovo . the new unmik head is confident this can be achieved , but said that integrating kosovo into the larger markets in southeastern europe and the eu is essential . eco n omic i n tegratio n n ecessary for developme n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rücker has served for three years in the balkans " it 's very good that kosovo is a member of the regional energy league in southeastern europe , which links the regional energy markets , " rücker said .
" without integration , it wo n't work .
investment in the infrastructure - and especially private investment - is necessary .
the privatization program is contributing to this . " rücker , a 55-year-old native of the southwestern german state of baden-württemberg , brings practical experience in solving macro-economic problems .
as mayor of the town of sindelfingen from 1993 to 2001 , he managed to revamp the city 's budget , which had been burdened by heavy debts . " i think that this administrative experience in a town with difficulties is very important , " said franz-lothar altmann , an economic expert for southeastern europe at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" he has shown that he can lead a larger political entity , which is what kosovo is . " repairi n g eth n ic divisio n s in addition to the economic developments , rücker will have to contribute to ethnic conciliation between serbs and albanians in kosovo .
his goal is that , by the end of his mandate , all citizens will be represented through the elected institutions in the region and ethnic minorities will be active in social and political life . " unmik is mandated to administrate kosovo as a whole and structures that work against this can not be tolerated , " said rücker , referring to parallel administrative structures in the region that aim at dividing kosovo between the serbs and albanians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostilities in kosovo disrupted - and ended - many lives the implementation of standardized license plates is one example of efforts to promote political and ethnic cooperation , rücker said .
to enhance freedom of movement for all residents , unmik introduced license plates several years ago that do n't reveal which city the vehicle is from .
previously , nationalist street mobs had attacked returning refugees after identifying from the license plate where they came from . however , the newer standardized plates still are n't in use in serbian-dominated northern kosovo , because they are not officially recognized by neighboring serbia .
serbs from the north drive with serbian license plates or none at all .
they do n't dare to come south , and drivers from the south avoid heading north with standard plates . status decisio n expected by year 's e n d whether with license plates , ethnic reconciliation or economic development , rücker is aware that change wo n't come over night , he said . " it 's very important for us that the residents of kosovo have perspective , " he said .
" this will come with the beginning of the status negotiations , at the latest . " the negotiation process on kosovo 's ultimate political status is being chaired by finnish diplomat martti ahtisaari .
resolving kosovo 's status is a major factor in the stability of the region , rücker said . " we will do everything we can so that mr. ahtisaari and the contact group are able to stay on schedule , " he said .
" that means that they should be able to submit a final decision on kosovo 's status to the security council by the end of the year .

he considers the establishment of sustainable economic development in the region to be the greatest challenge in his new role , particularly in light of the impending transfer of authority in kosovo . the new unmik head is confident this can be achieved , but said that integrating kosovo into the larger markets in southeastern europe and the eu is essential . eco n omic i n tegratio n n ecessary for developme n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rücker has served for three years in the balkans " it 's very good that kosovo is a member of the regional energy league in southeastern europe , which links the regional energy markets , " rücker said .
" without integration , it wo n't work .
investment in the infrastructure - and especially private investment - is necessary .
the privatization program is contributing to this . " rücker , a 55-year-old native of the southwestern german state of baden-württemberg , brings practical experience in solving macro-economic problems .
as mayor of the town of sindelfingen from 1993 to 2001 , he managed to revamp the city 's budget , which had been burdened by heavy debts . " i think that this administrative experience in a town with difficulties is very important , " said franz-lothar altmann , an economic expert for southeastern europe at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" he has shown that he can lead a larger political entity , which is what kosovo is . " repairi n g eth n ic divisio n s in addition to the economic developments , rücker will have to contribute to ethnic conciliation between serbs and albanians in kosovo .
his goal is that , by the end of his mandate , all citizens will be represented through the elected institutions in the region and ethnic minorities will be active in social and political life . " unmik is mandated to administrate kosovo as a whole and structures that work against this can not be tolerated , " said rücker , referring to parallel administrative structures in the region that aim at dividing kosovo between the serbs and albanians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostilities in kosovo disrupted - and ended - many lives the implementation of standardized license plates is one example of efforts to promote political and ethnic cooperation , rücker said .
to enhance freedom of movement for all residents , unmik introduced license plates several years ago that do n't reveal which city the vehicle is from .
previously , nationalist street mobs had attacked returning refugees after identifying from the license plate where they came from . however , the newer standardized plates still are n't in use in serbian-dominated northern kosovo , because they are not officially recognized by neighboring serbia .
serbs from the north drive with serbian license plates or none at all .
they do n't dare to come south , and drivers from the south avoid heading north with standard plates . status decisio n expected by year 's e n d whether with license plates , ethnic reconciliation or economic development , rücker is aware that change wo n't come over night , he said . " it 's very important for us that the residents of kosovo have perspective , " he said .
" this will come with the beginning of the status negotiations , at the latest . " the negotiation process on kosovo 's ultimate political status is being chaired by finnish diplomat martti ahtisaari .
resolving kosovo 's status is a major factor in the stability of the region , rücker said . " we will do everything we can so that mr. ahtisaari and the contact group are able to stay on schedule , " he said .
" that means that they should be able to submit a final decision on kosovo 's status to the security council by the end of the year .

bavarian officials are calling it an " emergency solution . " homeschooling is illegal in germany , and yet the members of the fundamentalist christian sect " zwölf stämme " -lrb- twelve tribes -rrb- have won a victory of sorts in their fight to educate their children outside of germany 's state school system .
bavarian officials have agreed to let the group 's 32 school-aged children be taught by their own teachers in a private school - albeit one that is subject to state controls .
the school has initially been limited to a timeframe of one year . with the creation of the private school , a " years-long illegal situation has been ended , " said stefan rössle , district administrator for the region of donauwörth in bavaria . long battle with the law because of their religious convictions , parents in the twelve tribes community had been battling with state officials for over four years to keep their children out of state schools .
twelve tribes members take the bible 's teachings literally , and prefer to shield their children from some aspects of the modern world .
in homeschooling , for example , they teach the creation story , not the theory of evolution . but because homeschooling is not allowed in germany , the twelve tribes parents paid a high price for their resistance to state education .
over the years , they 've amassed some 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 167,000 -rrb- in unpaid fines , watched their children be forcibly enrolled in state schools , and stood by as one father was imprisoned for two weeks for his resistance .
through it all , they refused to bow to the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creation of the private school was an " emergency solution , " state officials said the result is a compromise solution .
the bavarian ministry of educational and cultural affairs has approved a curriculum for the group 's new private school in which sex education is absent , but where ethics , rather than religion , will be taught .
the parents can choose the teachers , but they have to foot the bill for the school themselves . " for us , the compromise was mainly about protecting the children 's right to an education , " said a ministry spokesperson . state still has control unlike homeschooling , the school will still be subject to state supervision .
state school officials have the right to visit the school at anytime and check on how lessons are being taught . " we will keep a very watchful eye on the project , " said rössle . green party politicians in the bavarian state parliament have criticized the compromise , saying the state is not acting in the children 's interest when it allows a " questionable religious community " the freedom to educate outside the state system . this latest example in bavaria highlights the difficult position state authorities are in when parents simply refuse to obey the law .

bavarian officials are calling it an " emergency solution . " homeschooling is illegal in germany , and yet the members of the fundamentalist christian sect " zwölf stämme " -lrb- twelve tribes -rrb- have won a victory of sorts in their fight to educate their children outside of germany 's state school system .
bavarian officials have agreed to let the group 's 32 school-aged children be taught by their own teachers in a private school - albeit one that is subject to state controls .
the school has initially been limited to a timeframe of one year . with the creation of the private school , a " years-long illegal situation has been ended , " said stefan rössle , district administrator for the region of donauwörth in bavaria . long battle with the law because of their religious convictions , parents in the twelve tribes community had been battling with state officials for over four years to keep their children out of state schools .
twelve tribes members take the bible 's teachings literally , and prefer to shield their children from some aspects of the modern world .
in homeschooling , for example , they teach the creation story , not the theory of evolution . but because homeschooling is not allowed in germany , the twelve tribes parents paid a high price for their resistance to state education .
over the years , they 've amassed some 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 167,000 -rrb- in unpaid fines , watched their children be forcibly enrolled in state schools , and stood by as one father was imprisoned for two weeks for his resistance .
through it all , they refused to bow to the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creation of the private school was an " emergency solution , " state officials said the result is a compromise solution .
the bavarian ministry of educational and cultural affairs has approved a curriculum for the group 's new private school in which sex education is absent , but where ethics , rather than religion , will be taught .
the parents can choose the teachers , but they have to foot the bill for the school themselves . " for us , the compromise was mainly about protecting the children 's right to an education , " said a ministry spokesperson . state still has control unlike homeschooling , the school will still be subject to state supervision .
state school officials have the right to visit the school at anytime and check on how lessons are being taught . " we will keep a very watchful eye on the project , " said rössle . green party politicians in the bavarian state parliament have criticized the compromise , saying the state is not acting in the children 's interest when it allows a " questionable religious community " the freedom to educate outside the state system . this latest example in bavaria highlights the difficult position state authorities are in when parents simply refuse to obey the law .
in recent months , there have been several incidents of homeschooling families clashing with truancy officials , mostly for religious reasons . their case histories are documented by several homeschooling initiatives in germany which are lobbying for greater educational freedom . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living room lessons not easy in germany opting to teach your kids at home instead of sending them to school is not an easy decision .

merkel and the jewish council president met wednesday to clear things up . german chancellor angela merkel met charlotte knobloch , the president of germany 's central council of jews , wednesday to address jewish anger over remarks made by overseas development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul about israel 's offensive in lebanon . merkel and knobloch , in the first meeting of its kind since the council 's president took office , discussed the situation of the jewish community in germany , the state of affairs in the middle east and germany 's cooperation with the united nations in stabilizing lebanon for over an hour . the meeting concluded with the chancellor reaffirming that the german government and the central council of jews had " a positive and trusting friendship . " minister called for un investigation of israel the meeting was deemed necessary after wieczorek-zeul came under fire from knobloch and the council when , during a visit to lebanon , she called for a un investigation into claims that israel used carpet bombs in the campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul has defended her comments on israel " i pointed out - and all the aid organizations and even the un also point out - that there are carpet bombs in southern lebanon , " the minister told german broadcaster zdf on thursday .
she has continued to defend her comment and repeated her appeal for a general ban on carpet bombs . the central council of jews has accused wieczorek-zeul of stirring up anti-jewish sentiment in germany . jewish council critical of beirut visit knobloch has also attacked the development minister for visiting beirut last week as part of germany 's pledge to help rebuild lebanon following the devastating 34-day-long israeli offensive to rout hezbollah militia . " the least she could have done was to visit israel first .
she should have reached out first to the attacked , not the attackers , " said the council president . the council 's vice president , salomon korn , told the daily frankfurter rundschau , " the call for a un probe was another knee-jerk reaction from the minister towards israel . " if wieczorek-zeul wanted a un probe this should also take into account the fact that israeli citizens have for years come under rocket fire from lebanese soil , he added . the development minister said thursday on zdf 's " morgenmagazin " that she traveled to lebanon last weekend because germany is participating in rebuilding the country 's infrastructure .
israel , she said , wants to use its own resources to repair damage within its borders and therefore a visit was not necessary . internal differences on middle east policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knobloch became council president in june 2005 the row has highlighted differences of opinion in merkel 's power sharing left-right government on the middle east . when the war in lebanon erupted , the conservative merkel pointed out that hezbollah had started the trouble by seizing israeli soldiers .
though merkel urged restraint she did not join calls by other european leaders for an immediate ceasefire or criticize israel 's use of force as excessive . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said wednesday that germany believed it carries a historical responsibility towards the jewish state because of the holocaust , and said all government ministers respected this policy . wieczorek-zeul had not broken with it by calling for a un probe , nor was she anti-israeli , he added . she is a member of the social democrats , like foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , and is known for lashing out at human rights abuses regardless who may have committed them . steinmeier , who would like to help broker a long-term peace deal in the middle east , came in for criticism from the jewish council at the start of the war when he suggested that israel 's offensive might be disproportionate . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a german minister 's popular dissent on lebanon germany 's minister responsible for development aid has been a lone voice calling for an immediate ceasefire in lebanon .

bavarian officials are calling it an " emergency solution . " homeschooling is illegal in germany , and yet the members of the fundamentalist christian sect " zwölf stämme " -lrb- twelve tribes -rrb- have won a victory of sorts in their fight to educate their children outside of germany 's state school system .
bavarian officials have agreed to let the group 's 32 school-aged children be taught by their own teachers in a private school - albeit one that is subject to state controls .
the school has initially been limited to a timeframe of one year . with the creation of the private school , a " years-long illegal situation has been ended , " said stefan rössle , district administrator for the region of donauwörth in bavaria . long battle with the law because of their religious convictions , parents in the twelve tribes community had been battling with state officials for over four years to keep their children out of state schools .
twelve tribes members take the bible 's teachings literally , and prefer to shield their children from some aspects of the modern world .
in homeschooling , for example , they teach the creation story , not the theory of evolution . but because homeschooling is not allowed in germany , the twelve tribes parents paid a high price for their resistance to state education .
over the years , they 've amassed some 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 167,000 -rrb- in unpaid fines , watched their children be forcibly enrolled in state schools , and stood by as one father was imprisoned for two weeks for his resistance .
through it all , they refused to bow to the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creation of the private school was an " emergency solution , " state officials said the result is a compromise solution .
the bavarian ministry of educational and cultural affairs has approved a curriculum for the group 's new private school in which sex education is absent , but where ethics , rather than religion , will be taught .
the parents can choose the teachers , but they have to foot the bill for the school themselves . " for us , the compromise was mainly about protecting the children 's right to an education , " said a ministry spokesperson . state still has control unlike homeschooling , the school will still be subject to state supervision .
state school officials have the right to visit the school at anytime and check on how lessons are being taught . " we will keep a very watchful eye on the project , " said rössle . green party politicians in the bavarian state parliament have criticized the compromise , saying the state is not acting in the children 's interest when it allows a " questionable religious community " the freedom to educate outside the state system . this latest example in bavaria highlights the difficult position state authorities are in when parents simply refuse to obey the law .
in recent months , there have been several incidents of homeschooling families clashing with truancy officials , mostly for religious reasons . their case histories are documented by several homeschooling initiatives in germany which are lobbying for greater educational freedom . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living room lessons not easy in germany opting to teach your kids at home instead of sending them to school is not an easy decision .

he considers the establishment of sustainable economic development in the region to be the greatest challenge in his new role , particularly in light of the impending transfer of authority in kosovo . the new unmik head is confident this can be achieved , but said that integrating kosovo into the larger markets in southeastern europe and the eu is essential . eco n omic i n tegratio n n ecessary for developme n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rücker has served for three years in the balkans " it 's very good that kosovo is a member of the regional energy league in southeastern europe , which links the regional energy markets , " rücker said .
" without integration , it wo n't work .
investment in the infrastructure - and especially private investment - is necessary .
the privatization program is contributing to this . " rücker , a 55-year-old native of the southwestern german state of baden-württemberg , brings practical experience in solving macro-economic problems .
as mayor of the town of sindelfingen from 1993 to 2001 , he managed to revamp the city 's budget , which had been burdened by heavy debts . " i think that this administrative experience in a town with difficulties is very important , " said franz-lothar altmann , an economic expert for southeastern europe at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" he has shown that he can lead a larger political entity , which is what kosovo is . " repairi n g eth n ic divisio n s in addition to the economic developments , rücker will have to contribute to ethnic conciliation between serbs and albanians in kosovo .
his goal is that , by the end of his mandate , all citizens will be represented through the elected institutions in the region and ethnic minorities will be active in social and political life . " unmik is mandated to administrate kosovo as a whole and structures that work against this can not be tolerated , " said rücker , referring to parallel administrative structures in the region that aim at dividing kosovo between the serbs and albanians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostilities in kosovo disrupted - and ended - many lives the implementation of standardized license plates is one example of efforts to promote political and ethnic cooperation , rücker said .
to enhance freedom of movement for all residents , unmik introduced license plates several years ago that do n't reveal which city the vehicle is from .
previously , nationalist street mobs had attacked returning refugees after identifying from the license plate where they came from . however , the newer standardized plates still are n't in use in serbian-dominated northern kosovo , because they are not officially recognized by neighboring serbia .
serbs from the north drive with serbian license plates or none at all .
they do n't dare to come south , and drivers from the south avoid heading north with standard plates . status decisio n expected by year 's e n d whether with license plates , ethnic reconciliation or economic development , rücker is aware that change wo n't come over night , he said . " it 's very important for us that the residents of kosovo have perspective , " he said .
" this will come with the beginning of the status negotiations , at the latest . " the negotiation process on kosovo 's ultimate political status is being chaired by finnish diplomat martti ahtisaari .
resolving kosovo 's status is a major factor in the stability of the region , rücker said . " we will do everything we can so that mr. ahtisaari and the contact group are able to stay on schedule , " he said .
" that means that they should be able to submit a final decision on kosovo 's status to the security council by the end of the year .

" by adopting independent and logical policies , the europeans can change for the better the region 's attitude towards them .
the europeans should not follow wrong and aggressive us policies , since the us only thinks about itself , " ahmadinejad was quoted as saying . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopes for an alternative to sanctions in iran stand-off iran 's confident dismissal of the un threat of action caused widespread concern in the international community wednesday , while germany maintained that sanctions were far from definite .

"
merkel and the jewish council president met wednesday to clear things up . german chancellor angela merkel met charlotte knobloch , the president of germany 's central council of jews , wednesday to address jewish anger over remarks made by overseas development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul about israel 's offensive in lebanon . merkel and knobloch , in the first meeting of its kind since the council 's president took office , discussed the situation of the jewish community in germany , the state of affairs in the middle east and germany 's cooperation with the united nations in stabilizing lebanon for over an hour . the meeting concluded with the chancellor reaffirming that the german government and the central council of jews had " a positive and trusting friendship . " minister called for un investigation of israel the meeting was deemed necessary after wieczorek-zeul came under fire from knobloch and the council when , during a visit to lebanon , she called for a un investigation into claims that israel used carpet bombs in the campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul has defended her comments on israel " i pointed out - and all the aid organizations and even the un also point out - that there are carpet bombs in southern lebanon , " the minister told german broadcaster zdf on thursday .
she has continued to defend her comment and repeated her appeal for a general ban on carpet bombs . the central council of jews has accused wieczorek-zeul of stirring up anti-jewish sentiment in germany . jewish council critical of beirut visit knobloch has also attacked the development minister for visiting beirut last week as part of germany 's pledge to help rebuild lebanon following the devastating 34-day-long israeli offensive to rout hezbollah militia . " the least she could have done was to visit israel first .
she should have reached out first to the attacked , not the attackers , " said the council president . the council 's vice president , salomon korn , told the daily frankfurter rundschau , " the call for a un probe was another knee-jerk reaction from the minister towards israel . " if wieczorek-zeul wanted a un probe this should also take into account the fact that israeli citizens have for years come under rocket fire from lebanese soil , he added . the development minister said thursday on zdf 's " morgenmagazin " that she traveled to lebanon last weekend because germany is participating in rebuilding the country 's infrastructure .
israel , she said , wants to use its own resources to repair damage within its borders and therefore a visit was not necessary . internal differences on middle east policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knobloch became council president in june 2005 the row has highlighted differences of opinion in merkel 's power sharing left-right government on the middle east . when the war in lebanon erupted , the conservative merkel pointed out that hezbollah had started the trouble by seizing israeli soldiers .
though merkel urged restraint she did not join calls by other european leaders for an immediate ceasefire or criticize israel 's use of force as excessive . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said wednesday that germany believed it carries a historical responsibility towards the jewish state because of the holocaust , and said all government ministers respected this policy . wieczorek-zeul had not broken with it by calling for a un probe , nor was she anti-israeli , he added . she is a member of the social democrats , like foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , and is known for lashing out at human rights abuses regardless who may have committed them . steinmeier , who would like to help broker a long-term peace deal in the middle east , came in for criticism from the jewish council at the start of the war when he suggested that israel 's offensive might be disproportionate . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a german minister 's popular dissent on lebanon germany 's minister responsible for development aid has been a lone voice calling for an immediate ceasefire in lebanon .

germany wants to crack down on such sites and will change the law to do it . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has identified the internet as a " textbook " for terrorists and has announced that action will be taken to prevent the increasing number of manuals on bomb-making being made available online and block islamist forums espousing violent jihad . jörg ziercke , the president of the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- , has added his weight to schäuble 's calls by demanding that internet providers do more to stop such material from going online and is prepared to back stronger laws to enforce this .
at the moment , providers are not legally required to block users or remove content . experts believe that the power of the internet in the hands of terrorists should not be underestimated .
" there are enough reports from the police , the office for the protection of the constitution and news services that say that the internet is the most popular medium for communication between islamic groups , " said bernd carstensen , acting chairman of the federal alliance of german detectives -lrb- bdk -rrb- . estimates put the number of radical islamist web sites at around 5,000 , not including the many thousands of chatrooms in which terrorist groups and individuals keep in contact with each other . huge increase in islamist web presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror has spread on the web since sept .
11 , 2001 the menace is growing .
according to gabriel weimann , a communications expert in haifa and author of the book " terror on the internet , " there were only a dozen or so terrorist web pages online in 1998 .
since the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , experts point out that the terrorist presence on the internet has vastly expanded . terrorists have clearly discovered the huge potential for spreading propaganda online .
" as well as dominating most areas in society , the internet has also expanded the possibilities for radical groups , " said carstensen .
" since the internet offers the technical possibilities of chatrooms , forums and password-protected areas , it is an attractive proposition for terrorists .
they can remain anonymous and secure on the internet . " german police and secret services currently have limited powers to prosecute individuals or groups responsible for spreading islamic propaganda on the internet .
they have , however , filed a number of suits , although there are no official figures . new technology and training needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specially trained police officers would be needed according to the bdk , the police and security forces have teams of operatives monitoring the islamist presence on the internet , but more personnel would be needed if the interior ministry gets its way in securing more wide-ranging powers .
" these operatives would have to be specially trained to search for and analyze results in arabic , " says carstensen . these specialist teams would also have to have search technology that would allow them to reach the outer limits of the web that terrorists inhabit .
they would also need technology to efficiently record what they find .
currently , screenshots and saved data are the only evidence .
when further investigation - and the confiscation of hard drives - is approved , sometimes after days or weeks , the incriminating data may have already disappeared . but the new laws the interior ministry are hoping for are by no means guaranteed .
a special meeting of state interior ministers on sept .
4 in berlin will address the possibility of granting powers like those in place in britain , where phone , video and internet monitoring are all part of the fight against terror . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german federal police see no acute terror danger at home after the arrest of three suspects in germany in connection with the plot to bomb german trains , the head of the country 's federal criminal police office says he sees no immediate danger of further attacks right now .

"
merkel and the jewish council president met wednesday to clear things up . german chancellor angela merkel met charlotte knobloch , the president of germany 's central council of jews , wednesday to address jewish anger over remarks made by overseas development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul about israel 's offensive in lebanon . merkel and knobloch , in the first meeting of its kind since the council 's president took office , discussed the situation of the jewish community in germany , the state of affairs in the middle east and germany 's cooperation with the united nations in stabilizing lebanon for over an hour . the meeting concluded with the chancellor reaffirming that the german government and the central council of jews had " a positive and trusting friendship .

" the least she could have done was to visit israel first .
she should have reached out first to the attacked , not the attackers , " said the council president . the council 's vice president , salomon korn , told the daily frankfurter rundschau , " the call for a un probe was another knee-jerk reaction from the minister towards israel .

germany wants to crack down on such sites and will change the law to do it . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has identified the internet as a " textbook " for terrorists and has announced that action will be taken to prevent the increasing number of manuals on bomb-making being made available online and block islamist forums espousing violent jihad . jörg ziercke , the president of the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- , has added his weight to schäuble 's calls by demanding that internet providers do more to stop such material from going online and is prepared to back stronger laws to enforce this .
at the moment , providers are not legally required to block users or remove content . experts believe that the power of the internet in the hands of terrorists should not be underestimated .
" there are enough reports from the police , the office for the protection of the constitution and news services that say that the internet is the most popular medium for communication between islamic groups , " said bernd carstensen , acting chairman of the federal alliance of german detectives -lrb- bdk -rrb- . estimates put the number of radical islamist web sites at around 5,000 , not including the many thousands of chatrooms in which terrorist groups and individuals keep in contact with each other . huge increase in islamist web presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror has spread on the web since sept .
11 , 2001 the menace is growing .
according to gabriel weimann , a communications expert in haifa and author of the book " terror on the internet , " there were only a dozen or so terrorist web pages online in 1998 .
since the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , experts point out that the terrorist presence on the internet has vastly expanded . terrorists have clearly discovered the huge potential for spreading propaganda online .
" as well as dominating most areas in society , the internet has also expanded the possibilities for radical groups , " said carstensen .
" since the internet offers the technical possibilities of chatrooms , forums and password-protected areas , it is an attractive proposition for terrorists .
they can remain anonymous and secure on the internet . " german police and secret services currently have limited powers to prosecute individuals or groups responsible for spreading islamic propaganda on the internet .
they have , however , filed a number of suits , although there are no official figures . new technology and training needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specially trained police officers would be needed according to the bdk , the police and security forces have teams of operatives monitoring the islamist presence on the internet , but more personnel would be needed if the interior ministry gets its way in securing more wide-ranging powers .
" these operatives would have to be specially trained to search for and analyze results in arabic , " says carstensen . these specialist teams would also have to have search technology that would allow them to reach the outer limits of the web that terrorists inhabit .
they would also need technology to efficiently record what they find .
currently , screenshots and saved data are the only evidence .
when further investigation - and the confiscation of hard drives - is approved , sometimes after days or weeks , the incriminating data may have already disappeared . but the new laws the interior ministry are hoping for are by no means guaranteed .

germany 's education and research minister says the goal is 1.5 million new jobs in high-tech fields . ground-breaking research is n't the problem in germany , getting innovative products to the market is , according to annette schavan , minister for education and research .
on wednesday in berlin , she announced plans by the government to step up its investment in high-tech , with the aim to bring creative ideas out of the ivory tower and onto the commercial market . " in many areas , we are at the top in basic research , " she said .
" but in general , across technical fields , putting those ideas into practice does n't work frequently enough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan , federal minister of education and research schavan , a member of the conservative christian democrats , said many of germany 's good ideas get put away in a drawer somewhere or first get turned into money-making products abroad .
the minister said she wants to put the emphasis on scientific research which can lead to products or processes with commercial uses . " fields of innovation " most of the federal money will go to the aerospace and energy technology sectors , although substantial amounts will be directed toward health and medical research , environmental research as well as security technology for nuclear power plants .
all in all , schavan named 17 " fields of innovation , " which range from aerospace to traffic technology to nano- and biotechnology . the funding also includes award money so that small and medium-sized companies can get their research findings to market more quickly . " we also want to ensure that young scientists in this country realize their opportunities and make germany into a place where new talent is forged , " she said . industry groups and economic organizations had mostly praise for the new investment program , although some were critical that even more of the money set aside was not going into efforts to get products to market .
the association of the german electronic and electronics industry called on the government to keep its attention on turning technical ideas into reality , rather than just funding new research initiatives . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plans billion-euro investment in universities the german government plans to spend an additional 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- in research and development by the end of 2009 .

he considers the establishment of sustainable economic development in the region to be the greatest challenge in his new role , particularly in light of the impending transfer of authority in kosovo . the new unmik head is confident this can be achieved , but said that integrating kosovo into the larger markets in southeastern europe and the eu is essential . eco n omic i n tegratio n n ecessary for developme n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rücker has served for three years in the balkans " it 's very good that kosovo is a member of the regional energy league in southeastern europe , which links the regional energy markets , " rücker said .

investment in the infrastructure - and especially private investment - is necessary .
the privatization program is contributing to this . " rücker , a 55-year-old native of the southwestern german state of baden-württemberg , brings practical experience in solving macro-economic problems .
as mayor of the town of sindelfingen from 1993 to 2001 , he managed to revamp the city 's budget , which had been burdened by heavy debts . " i think that this administrative experience in a town with difficulties is very important , " said franz-lothar altmann , an economic expert for southeastern europe at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" he has shown that he can lead a larger political entity , which is what kosovo is . " repairi n g eth n ic divisio n s in addition to the economic developments , rücker will have to contribute to ethnic conciliation between serbs and albanians in kosovo .
his goal is that , by the end of his mandate , all citizens will be represented through the elected institutions in the region and ethnic minorities will be active in social and political life . " unmik is mandated to administrate kosovo as a whole and structures that work against this can not be tolerated , " said rücker , referring to parallel administrative structures in the region that aim at dividing kosovo between the serbs and albanians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostilities in kosovo disrupted - and ended - many lives the implementation of standardized license plates is one example of efforts to promote political and ethnic cooperation , rücker said .
to enhance freedom of movement for all residents , unmik introduced license plates several years ago that do n't reveal which city the vehicle is from .
previously , nationalist street mobs had attacked returning refugees after identifying from the license plate where they came from . however , the newer standardized plates still are n't in use in serbian-dominated northern kosovo , because they are not officially recognized by neighboring serbia .
serbs from the north drive with serbian license plates or none at all .
they do n't dare to come south , and drivers from the south avoid heading north with standard plates . status decisio n expected by year 's e n d whether with license plates , ethnic reconciliation or economic development , rücker is aware that change wo n't come over night , he said . " it 's very important for us that the residents of kosovo have perspective , " he said .
" this will come with the beginning of the status negotiations , at the latest . " the negotiation process on kosovo 's ultimate political status is being chaired by finnish diplomat martti ahtisaari .
resolving kosovo 's status is a major factor in the stability of the region , rücker said . " we will do everything we can so that mr. ahtisaari and the contact group are able to stay on schedule , " he said .

de la vega followed up a trip on tuesday to current european union presidency holder finland by telling senior eu officials in brussels more had to be done and the bloc as a whole showed a " lack of commitment " in dealing with the problem .
the number of immigrants arriving in 2006 has exceeded the totals of previous years with about 19,000 refugees landing on the spanish islands to date , compared to the previous annual record of 9,900 , in 2002 .
the deputy prime minister stressed that spain could not deal with the constant flow from africa alone and madrid was " concerned at the slowness of certain initiatives . "
more refugee arrivals than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the influx of refugees has stretched spain 's resources according to canary islands authorities , in august alone over 4,700 refugees arrived on their shores , which is more than the total for 2005 .
three months ago de la vega forcibly put spain 's case forward but despite receiving air and sea surveillance assistance from the eu borders monitoring body frontex , the influx has continued unabated with the surveillance programme still not fully operational .
only finland , italy and portugal have so far committed patrol boats or surveillance planes to frontex , operating off mauritania , senegal and cape verde , joining spanish officials already working in the area .
after talks with de la vega , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said : " it is essential that all member states continue to show their political readiness to share the heavy burden which is now carried by a limited number of member states , which do their best to protect the eu external borders . "
frattini announced that the commission would set up a high-level working group on immigration and asylum issues , to be coordinated by de la vega , but acknowledged that " there is no quick fix . "
ineffective eu assistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masses of arrivals could cause a humanitarian crisis hindering frontex efforts further , one italian patrol boat , diciotti , has been stuck for 10 days in the southern spanish port of cadiz with engine trouble , while portugese counterpart baptista de andrade has been patrolling off cape verde for the past 10 days but has yet to report sightings of any illegal immigrants .
with the continual flow of arrivals , there has been increased political pressure on the spanish government , and with the canaries facing regional elections next year , the issue has become highly politicized .
nationally , the main conservative opposition popular party has lambasted the government as incompetent .
immigrants who survive torrid trips to the islands lasting upwards of 10 days are taken to overflowing reception camps and are then transferred to the mainland for up to 40 days , after which they are given an unenforceable document providing for their expulsion .
' ' humanitarian catastrophe " waiting to happen spain announced recently that 11,826 illegal arrivals had been transferred from the canary islands to the mainland since january .
most can not be repatriated in the absence of bilateral agreements with their homeland .
de la vega criticized eu partner states for their slowness in applying article 13 of the cotonou accord on repatriation of immigrants amid the reluctance to commit sufficient resources to the problem .
the canaries government had after monday 's arrivals called on eu states and the international community to help halt " a humanitarian catastrophe " , estimating some 490 would-be immigrants had died at sea this year . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks rapid reaction teams to deal with illegal immigrants the european commission has unveiled plans for rapid reaction teams of border guards to police europe 's frontiers , as spain and malta haggled over who should deal with a fresh wave of illegal immigrants .

31 deadline imposed by the un security council for suspending the program . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said he would not buckle in the face of mounting pressure , hours before the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog was expected to report tehran in defiance of the security council . " iran will not back down an inch in the face of intimidation , aggression and will not accept being deprived of its rights , " ahmadinejad said in a speech in northwestern iran on thursday . " the powers of oppression do not want iran to progress .
but i say to them : the iranian people , including young scientists who have succeeded with empty hands and without your help to reach the summits of nuclear technology , can also develop iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's elbaradei is expected to report tehran to the un the un security council has mandated that iran must suspend all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities by aug .
31 , spurred by fears in the west that tehran is covertly seeking to make the atom bomb .
iran insists the program is aimed at producing electricity . report : west planning sanctions germany , the united states , france , and britain were reportedly drawing up plans for a three-stage system of international sanctions designed to force iran into compliance . the progressively tougher measures would begin with an embargo on the sale of nuclear-related materials and a limited travel ban for iranian officials , graduating to a broader travel ban and the freezing of overseas assets and then , if these measures fail , restrictions on commercial flights and world bank loans , the new york times reported . the five permanent members of the council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany , have sought to coax tehran into suspending enrichment by offering a package of security , trade and technology incentives . but russia and china have shown great reluctance even to threaten iran with sanctions . us undersecretary of state nicholas burns said on wednesday that he expected sanctions to be imposed within a month . " we believe the sanctions regime will be agreed to in september by the security council and we 're going to work towards that with a great deal of energy and termination , " he told cnn . us state department spokesman sean mccormack said senior officials from britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states would meet in europe early next week to begin discussing sanctions against iran if it is deemed to have flouted the un deadline . ahmadinejad appeals to european powers in an apparent attempt to drive a wedge between the united states and its european partners , president ahmadinejad called on europe to solve the row over iran 's nuclear program through negotiations and act independently of washington , the state-run irna news agency reported on thursday . " by adopting independent and logical policies , the europeans can change for the better the region 's attitude towards them .
the europeans should not follow wrong and aggressive us policies , since the us only thinks about itself , " ahmadinejad was quoted as saying . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopes for an alternative to sanctions in iran stand-off iran 's confident dismissal of the un threat of action caused widespread concern in the international community wednesday , while germany maintained that sanctions were far from definite .

de la vega followed up a trip on tuesday to current european union presidency holder finland by telling senior eu officials in brussels more had to be done and the bloc as a whole showed a " lack of commitment " in dealing with the problem .
the number of immigrants arriving in 2006 has exceeded the totals of previous years with about 19,000 refugees landing on the spanish islands to date , compared to the previous annual record of 9,900 , in 2002 .
the deputy prime minister stressed that spain could not deal with the constant flow from africa alone and madrid was " concerned at the slowness of certain initiatives . "
more refugee arrivals than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the influx of refugees has stretched spain 's resources according to canary islands authorities , in august alone over 4,700 refugees arrived on their shores , which is more than the total for 2005 .
three months ago de la vega forcibly put spain 's case forward but despite receiving air and sea surveillance assistance from the eu borders monitoring body frontex , the influx has continued unabated with the surveillance programme still not fully operational .
only finland , italy and portugal have so far committed patrol boats or surveillance planes to frontex , operating off mauritania , senegal and cape verde , joining spanish officials already working in the area .
after talks with de la vega , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said : " it is essential that all member states continue to show their political readiness to share the heavy burden which is now carried by a limited number of member states , which do their best to protect the eu external borders . "
frattini announced that the commission would set up a high-level working group on immigration and asylum issues , to be coordinated by de la vega , but acknowledged that " there is no quick fix . "
ineffective eu assistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masses of arrivals could cause a humanitarian crisis hindering frontex efforts further , one italian patrol boat , diciotti , has been stuck for 10 days in the southern spanish port of cadiz with engine trouble , while portugese counterpart baptista de andrade has been patrolling off cape verde for the past 10 days but has yet to report sightings of any illegal immigrants .
with the continual flow of arrivals , there has been increased political pressure on the spanish government , and with the canaries facing regional elections next year , the issue has become highly politicized .
nationally , the main conservative opposition popular party has lambasted the government as incompetent .

bavarian officials are calling it an " emergency solution . " homeschooling is illegal in germany , and yet the members of the fundamentalist christian sect " zwölf stämme " -lrb- twelve tribes -rrb- have won a victory of sorts in their fight to educate their children outside of germany 's state school system .
bavarian officials have agreed to let the group 's 32 school-aged children be taught by their own teachers in a private school - albeit one that is subject to state controls .
the school has initially been limited to a timeframe of one year . with the creation of the private school , a " years-long illegal situation has been ended , " said stefan rössle , district administrator for the region of donauwörth in bavaria . long battle with the law because of their religious convictions , parents in the twelve tribes community had been battling with state officials for over four years to keep their children out of state schools .
twelve tribes members take the bible 's teachings literally , and prefer to shield their children from some aspects of the modern world .
in homeschooling , for example , they teach the creation story , not the theory of evolution . but because homeschooling is not allowed in germany , the twelve tribes parents paid a high price for their resistance to state education .
over the years , they 've amassed some 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 167,000 -rrb- in unpaid fines , watched their children be forcibly enrolled in state schools , and stood by as one father was imprisoned for two weeks for his resistance .
through it all , they refused to bow to the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creation of the private school was an " emergency solution , " state officials said the result is a compromise solution .
the bavarian ministry of educational and cultural affairs has approved a curriculum for the group 's new private school in which sex education is absent , but where ethics , rather than religion , will be taught .
the parents can choose the teachers , but they have to foot the bill for the school themselves . " for us , the compromise was mainly about protecting the children 's right to an education , " said a ministry spokesperson . state still has control unlike homeschooling , the school will still be subject to state supervision .
state school officials have the right to visit the school at anytime and check on how lessons are being taught . " we will keep a very watchful eye on the project , " said rössle . green party politicians in the bavarian state parliament have criticized the compromise , saying the state is not acting in the children 's interest when it allows a " questionable religious community " the freedom to educate outside the state system . this latest example in bavaria highlights the difficult position state authorities are in when parents simply refuse to obey the law .

" for us , the compromise was mainly about protecting the children 's right to an education , " said a ministry spokesperson . state still has control unlike homeschooling , the school will still be subject to state supervision .
state school officials have the right to visit the school at anytime and check on how lessons are being taught . " we will keep a very watchful eye on the project , " said rössle . green party politicians in the bavarian state parliament have criticized the compromise , saying the state is not acting in the children 's interest when it allows a " questionable religious community " the freedom to educate outside the state system . this latest example in bavaria highlights the difficult position state authorities are in when parents simply refuse to obey the law .

de la vega followed up a trip on tuesday to current european union presidency holder finland by telling senior eu officials in brussels more had to be done and the bloc as a whole showed a " lack of commitment " in dealing with the problem .
the number of immigrants arriving in 2006 has exceeded the totals of previous years with about 19,000 refugees landing on the spanish islands to date , compared to the previous annual record of 9,900 , in 2002 .
the deputy prime minister stressed that spain could not deal with the constant flow from africa alone and madrid was " concerned at the slowness of certain initiatives . "
more refugee arrivals than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the influx of refugees has stretched spain 's resources according to canary islands authorities , in august alone over 4,700 refugees arrived on their shores , which is more than the total for 2005 .
three months ago de la vega forcibly put spain 's case forward but despite receiving air and sea surveillance assistance from the eu borders monitoring body frontex , the influx has continued unabated with the surveillance programme still not fully operational .
only finland , italy and portugal have so far committed patrol boats or surveillance planes to frontex , operating off mauritania , senegal and cape verde , joining spanish officials already working in the area .
after talks with de la vega , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said : " it is essential that all member states continue to show their political readiness to share the heavy burden which is now carried by a limited number of member states , which do their best to protect the eu external borders . "
frattini announced that the commission would set up a high-level working group on immigration and asylum issues , to be coordinated by de la vega , but acknowledged that " there is no quick fix . "
ineffective eu assistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masses of arrivals could cause a humanitarian crisis hindering frontex efforts further , one italian patrol boat , diciotti , has been stuck for 10 days in the southern spanish port of cadiz with engine trouble , while portugese counterpart baptista de andrade has been patrolling off cape verde for the past 10 days but has yet to report sightings of any illegal immigrants .
with the continual flow of arrivals , there has been increased political pressure on the spanish government , and with the canaries facing regional elections next year , the issue has become highly politicized .
nationally , the main conservative opposition popular party has lambasted the government as incompetent .
immigrants who survive torrid trips to the islands lasting upwards of 10 days are taken to overflowing reception camps and are then transferred to the mainland for up to 40 days , after which they are given an unenforceable document providing for their expulsion .
' ' humanitarian catastrophe " waiting to happen spain announced recently that 11,826 illegal arrivals had been transferred from the canary islands to the mainland since january .
most can not be repatriated in the absence of bilateral agreements with their homeland .
de la vega criticized eu partner states for their slowness in applying article 13 of the cotonou accord on repatriation of immigrants amid the reluctance to commit sufficient resources to the problem .
the canaries government had after monday 's arrivals called on eu states and the international community to help halt " a humanitarian catastrophe " , estimating some 490 would-be immigrants had died at sea this year . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks rapid reaction teams to deal with illegal immigrants the european commission has unveiled plans for rapid reaction teams of border guards to police europe 's frontiers , as spain and malta haggled over who should deal with a fresh wave of illegal immigrants .

he considers the establishment of sustainable economic development in the region to be the greatest challenge in his new role , particularly in light of the impending transfer of authority in kosovo . the new unmik head is confident this can be achieved , but said that integrating kosovo into the larger markets in southeastern europe and the eu is essential . eco n omic i n tegratio n n ecessary for developme n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rücker has served for three years in the balkans " it 's very good that kosovo is a member of the regional energy league in southeastern europe , which links the regional energy markets , " rücker said .
" without integration , it wo n't work .
investment in the infrastructure - and especially private investment - is necessary .
the privatization program is contributing to this . " rücker , a 55-year-old native of the southwestern german state of baden-württemberg , brings practical experience in solving macro-economic problems .
as mayor of the town of sindelfingen from 1993 to 2001 , he managed to revamp the city 's budget , which had been burdened by heavy debts . " i think that this administrative experience in a town with difficulties is very important , " said franz-lothar altmann , an economic expert for southeastern europe at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" he has shown that he can lead a larger political entity , which is what kosovo is . " repairi n g eth n ic divisio n s in addition to the economic developments , rücker will have to contribute to ethnic conciliation between serbs and albanians in kosovo .
his goal is that , by the end of his mandate , all citizens will be represented through the elected institutions in the region and ethnic minorities will be active in social and political life . " unmik is mandated to administrate kosovo as a whole and structures that work against this can not be tolerated , " said rücker , referring to parallel administrative structures in the region that aim at dividing kosovo between the serbs and albanians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostilities in kosovo disrupted - and ended - many lives the implementation of standardized license plates is one example of efforts to promote political and ethnic cooperation , rücker said .
to enhance freedom of movement for all residents , unmik introduced license plates several years ago that do n't reveal which city the vehicle is from .
previously , nationalist street mobs had attacked returning refugees after identifying from the license plate where they came from . however , the newer standardized plates still are n't in use in serbian-dominated northern kosovo , because they are not officially recognized by neighboring serbia .
serbs from the north drive with serbian license plates or none at all .
they do n't dare to come south , and drivers from the south avoid heading north with standard plates . status decisio n expected by year 's e n d whether with license plates , ethnic reconciliation or economic development , rücker is aware that change wo n't come over night , he said . " it 's very important for us that the residents of kosovo have perspective , " he said .
" this will come with the beginning of the status negotiations , at the latest . " the negotiation process on kosovo 's ultimate political status is being chaired by finnish diplomat martti ahtisaari .
resolving kosovo 's status is a major factor in the stability of the region , rücker said . " we will do everything we can so that mr. ahtisaari and the contact group are able to stay on schedule , " he said .
" that means that they should be able to submit a final decision on kosovo 's status to the security council by the end of the year .

the number of immigrants arriving in 2006 has exceeded the totals of previous years with about 19,000 refugees landing on the spanish islands to date , compared to the previous annual record of 9,900 , in 2002 .

31 deadline imposed by the un security council for suspending the program . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said he would not buckle in the face of mounting pressure , hours before the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog was expected to report tehran in defiance of the security council . " iran will not back down an inch in the face of intimidation , aggression and will not accept being deprived of its rights , " ahmadinejad said in a speech in northwestern iran on thursday . " the powers of oppression do not want iran to progress .
but i say to them : the iranian people , including young scientists who have succeeded with empty hands and without your help to reach the summits of nuclear technology , can also develop iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's elbaradei is expected to report tehran to the un the un security council has mandated that iran must suspend all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities by aug .
31 , spurred by fears in the west that tehran is covertly seeking to make the atom bomb .
iran insists the program is aimed at producing electricity . report : west planning sanctions germany , the united states , france , and britain were reportedly drawing up plans for a three-stage system of international sanctions designed to force iran into compliance . the progressively tougher measures would begin with an embargo on the sale of nuclear-related materials and a limited travel ban for iranian officials , graduating to a broader travel ban and the freezing of overseas assets and then , if these measures fail , restrictions on commercial flights and world bank loans , the new york times reported . the five permanent members of the council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany , have sought to coax tehran into suspending enrichment by offering a package of security , trade and technology incentives . but russia and china have shown great reluctance even to threaten iran with sanctions . us undersecretary of state nicholas burns said on wednesday that he expected sanctions to be imposed within a month . " we believe the sanctions regime will be agreed to in september by the security council and we 're going to work towards that with a great deal of energy and termination , " he told cnn . us state department spokesman sean mccormack said senior officials from britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states would meet in europe early next week to begin discussing sanctions against iran if it is deemed to have flouted the un deadline . ahmadinejad appeals to european powers in an apparent attempt to drive a wedge between the united states and its european partners , president ahmadinejad called on europe to solve the row over iran 's nuclear program through negotiations and act independently of washington , the state-run irna news agency reported on thursday . " by adopting independent and logical policies , the europeans can change for the better the region 's attitude towards them .
the europeans should not follow wrong and aggressive us policies , since the us only thinks about itself , " ahmadinejad was quoted as saying . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopes for an alternative to sanctions in iran stand-off iran 's confident dismissal of the un threat of action caused widespread concern in the international community wednesday , while germany maintained that sanctions were far from definite .

he considers the establishment of sustainable economic development in the region to be the greatest challenge in his new role , particularly in light of the impending transfer of authority in kosovo . the new unmik head is confident this can be achieved , but said that integrating kosovo into the larger markets in southeastern europe and the eu is essential . eco n omic i n tegratio n n ecessary for developme n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rücker has served for three years in the balkans " it 's very good that kosovo is a member of the regional energy league in southeastern europe , which links the regional energy markets , " rücker said .
" without integration , it wo n't work .
investment in the infrastructure - and especially private investment - is necessary .
the privatization program is contributing to this . " rücker , a 55-year-old native of the southwestern german state of baden-württemberg , brings practical experience in solving macro-economic problems .
as mayor of the town of sindelfingen from 1993 to 2001 , he managed to revamp the city 's budget , which had been burdened by heavy debts . " i think that this administrative experience in a town with difficulties is very important , " said franz-lothar altmann , an economic expert for southeastern europe at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" he has shown that he can lead a larger political entity , which is what kosovo is . " repairi n g eth n ic divisio n s in addition to the economic developments , rücker will have to contribute to ethnic conciliation between serbs and albanians in kosovo .
his goal is that , by the end of his mandate , all citizens will be represented through the elected institutions in the region and ethnic minorities will be active in social and political life . " unmik is mandated to administrate kosovo as a whole and structures that work against this can not be tolerated , " said rücker , referring to parallel administrative structures in the region that aim at dividing kosovo between the serbs and albanians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostilities in kosovo disrupted - and ended - many lives the implementation of standardized license plates is one example of efforts to promote political and ethnic cooperation , rücker said .
to enhance freedom of movement for all residents , unmik introduced license plates several years ago that do n't reveal which city the vehicle is from .
previously , nationalist street mobs had attacked returning refugees after identifying from the license plate where they came from . however , the newer standardized plates still are n't in use in serbian-dominated northern kosovo , because they are not officially recognized by neighboring serbia .
serbs from the north drive with serbian license plates or none at all .
they do n't dare to come south , and drivers from the south avoid heading north with standard plates . status decisio n expected by year 's e n d whether with license plates , ethnic reconciliation or economic development , rücker is aware that change wo n't come over night , he said . " it 's very important for us that the residents of kosovo have perspective , " he said .
" this will come with the beginning of the status negotiations , at the latest . " the negotiation process on kosovo 's ultimate political status is being chaired by finnish diplomat martti ahtisaari .
resolving kosovo 's status is a major factor in the stability of the region , rücker said . " we will do everything we can so that mr. ahtisaari and the contact group are able to stay on schedule , " he said .
" that means that they should be able to submit a final decision on kosovo 's status to the security council by the end of the year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.08.2006 germany plans tough measures for stopping terror on the web großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has become the favored medium of radical islamists since the september 11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states , the number of internet sites promoting violent jihad have soared .
germany wants to crack down on such sites and will change the law to do it . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has identified the internet as a " textbook " for terrorists and has announced that action will be taken to prevent the increasing number of manuals on bomb-making being made available online and block islamist forums espousing violent jihad . jörg ziercke , the president of the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- , has added his weight to schäuble 's calls by demanding that internet providers do more to stop such material from going online and is prepared to back stronger laws to enforce this .
at the moment , providers are not legally required to block users or remove content . experts believe that the power of the internet in the hands of terrorists should not be underestimated .
" there are enough reports from the police , the office for the protection of the constitution and news services that say that the internet is the most popular medium for communication between islamic groups , " said bernd carstensen , acting chairman of the federal alliance of german detectives -lrb- bdk -rrb- . estimates put the number of radical islamist web sites at around 5,000 , not including the many thousands of chatrooms in which terrorist groups and individuals keep in contact with each other . huge increase in islamist web presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror has spread on the web since sept .
11 , 2001 the menace is growing .
according to gabriel weimann , a communications expert in haifa and author of the book " terror on the internet , " there were only a dozen or so terrorist web pages online in 1998 .
since the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , experts point out that the terrorist presence on the internet has vastly expanded . terrorists have clearly discovered the huge potential for spreading propaganda online .
" as well as dominating most areas in society , the internet has also expanded the possibilities for radical groups , " said carstensen .
" since the internet offers the technical possibilities of chatrooms , forums and password-protected areas , it is an attractive proposition for terrorists .
they can remain anonymous and secure on the internet . " german police and secret services currently have limited powers to prosecute individuals or groups responsible for spreading islamic propaganda on the internet .
they have , however , filed a number of suits , although there are no official figures . new technology and training needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specially trained police officers would be needed according to the bdk , the police and security forces have teams of operatives monitoring the islamist presence on the internet , but more personnel would be needed if the interior ministry gets its way in securing more wide-ranging powers .
" these operatives would have to be specially trained to search for and analyze results in arabic , " says carstensen . these specialist teams would also have to have search technology that would allow them to reach the outer limits of the web that terrorists inhabit .
they would also need technology to efficiently record what they find .
currently , screenshots and saved data are the only evidence .
when further investigation - and the confiscation of hard drives - is approved , sometimes after days or weeks , the incriminating data may have already disappeared . but the new laws the interior ministry are hoping for are by no means guaranteed .
a special meeting of state interior ministers on sept .
4 in berlin will address the possibility of granting powers like those in place in britain , where phone , video and internet monitoring are all part of the fight against terror . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german federal police see no acute terror danger at home after the arrest of three suspects in germany in connection with the plot to bomb german trains , the head of the country 's federal criminal police office says he sees no immediate danger of further attacks right now .

" the assessment by the lebanese government with the support of the un is that about $ 500 million will be needed for the forthcoming months , " said sweden 's state secretary at the foreign office , annika söders . it used to have one of the most flourishing economies in the middle east , but lebanon has now estimated damage inflicted by the offensive at $ 3.6 billion , with 130,000 homes , 80 bridges and 94 roads destroyed or damaged . aid agencies say the bombardment has left both the country 's infrastructure and economy in tatters . according to oxfam , it coincided with the harvest season and the agricultural sector has therefore been devastated . " beyond the piles of bricks and mortar lies the less visible tragedy of acres of ruined farmland and rotting crops , " said ceo jeremy hobbs on the bbc . immoral un humanitarian chief jan egeland was expected to appeal in stockholm for more money for mine clearance after accusing israel wednesday of conducting a " completely immoral " cluster bomb blitz just before the ceasefire went into effect that has left as many as 100,000 unexploded bomblets in south lebanon . " this conference is about temporary , acute reconstruction so people can start to live their lives during the reconstruction , " swedish aid minister carin jaemtin , who will co-host the conference with foreign minister jan eliasson , told afp ahead of the meeting . immediate needs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan egeland has issued urgent calls for aid to the war-ravaged country the first donors ' conference to be held since the conflict broke out seeks to address the immediate needs for the lebanese people including " access to medical care , key roads and bridges , markets , and removal of unexploded ordnance , " said kathleen cravero of the un development program . repairing schools and repairing water and electricity supplies systems are also priorities . external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner was expected to announce an additional 42 million euros -lrb- $ 54 million -rrb- , taking the european union 's aid to 100 million . around 4 million euros of the new money will go to help the un clear unexploded munitions , which since the end of the fighting have killed 13 people and injured 46 . international aid lebanon has already received emergency aid of $ 500 million from saudi arabia and $ 800 million from kuwait . ministers from numerous eu countries , as well as representatives of south korea , japan , brazil and morocco were set to participate in the conference . senior officials from the united states and the united nations , the world bank , international monetary fund , red cross and world health organization were also expected . lebanese prime minister fuad siniora was also due to attend the conference , where in addition to monetary pledges he was expected to seek donations of mobile homes to temporarily house the tens of thousands who lost their homes . annan cements ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan has been tackling the issue of syrian support for hezbollah meanwhile , un secretary general kofi annan is doing his part on the ground - on a whirl-wind tour through the middle east trying to turn the current ceasefire between israel and hezbollah into a permanent agreement . on the fourth leg of his tour , annan met with palestinian president mahmoud abbas to discuss the palestinian-israeli conflict , which many regard as pivotal for peace in the region . earlier in the day , israel ’ s ongoing air and sea blockade against lebanon was top of his talks with israeli prime minister ehud olmert , during which he called on hezbollah to release the two israeli soldiers who were kidnapped on july 12 . olmert was firm about keeping up the siege until the hostages are released as demanded by un resolution 1701 signed on august 14 which ended the hostilities . on thursday , annan headed for jordan to hold talks with king abdullah ii on bolstering the truce between israel and hezbollah . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german , lebanese leaders discuss un buffer force german chancellor angela merkel and lebanese prime minister fuad siniora have spoken about berlin 's contribution to a beefed-up un peacekeeping force in war-battered southern lebanon .

"
merkel and the jewish council president met wednesday to clear things up . german chancellor angela merkel met charlotte knobloch , the president of germany 's central council of jews , wednesday to address jewish anger over remarks made by overseas development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul about israel 's offensive in lebanon . merkel and knobloch , in the first meeting of its kind since the council 's president took office , discussed the situation of the jewish community in germany , the state of affairs in the middle east and germany 's cooperation with the united nations in stabilizing lebanon for over an hour . the meeting concluded with the chancellor reaffirming that the german government and the central council of jews had " a positive and trusting friendship . " minister called for un investigation of israel the meeting was deemed necessary after wieczorek-zeul came under fire from knobloch and the council when , during a visit to lebanon , she called for a un investigation into claims that israel used carpet bombs in the campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul has defended her comments on israel " i pointed out - and all the aid organizations and even the un also point out - that there are carpet bombs in southern lebanon , " the minister told german broadcaster zdf on thursday .
she has continued to defend her comment and repeated her appeal for a general ban on carpet bombs . the central council of jews has accused wieczorek-zeul of stirring up anti-jewish sentiment in germany . jewish council critical of beirut visit knobloch has also attacked the development minister for visiting beirut last week as part of germany 's pledge to help rebuild lebanon following the devastating 34-day-long israeli offensive to rout hezbollah militia . " the least she could have done was to visit israel first .
she should have reached out first to the attacked , not the attackers , " said the council president . the council 's vice president , salomon korn , told the daily frankfurter rundschau , " the call for a un probe was another knee-jerk reaction from the minister towards israel . " if wieczorek-zeul wanted a un probe this should also take into account the fact that israeli citizens have for years come under rocket fire from lebanese soil , he added . the development minister said thursday on zdf 's " morgenmagazin " that she traveled to lebanon last weekend because germany is participating in rebuilding the country 's infrastructure .
israel , she said , wants to use its own resources to repair damage within its borders and therefore a visit was not necessary . internal differences on middle east policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knobloch became council president in june 2005 the row has highlighted differences of opinion in merkel 's power sharing left-right government on the middle east . when the war in lebanon erupted , the conservative merkel pointed out that hezbollah had started the trouble by seizing israeli soldiers .
though merkel urged restraint she did not join calls by other european leaders for an immediate ceasefire or criticize israel 's use of force as excessive . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said wednesday that germany believed it carries a historical responsibility towards the jewish state because of the holocaust , and said all government ministers respected this policy . wieczorek-zeul had not broken with it by calling for a un probe , nor was she anti-israeli , he added . she is a member of the social democrats , like foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , and is known for lashing out at human rights abuses regardless who may have committed them . steinmeier , who would like to help broker a long-term peace deal in the middle east , came in for criticism from the jewish council at the start of the war when he suggested that israel 's offensive might be disproportionate . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a german minister 's popular dissent on lebanon germany 's minister responsible for development aid has been a lone voice calling for an immediate ceasefire in lebanon .

"
merkel and the jewish council president met wednesday to clear things up . german chancellor angela merkel met charlotte knobloch , the president of germany 's central council of jews , wednesday to address jewish anger over remarks made by overseas development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul about israel 's offensive in lebanon . merkel and knobloch , in the first meeting of its kind since the council 's president took office , discussed the situation of the jewish community in germany , the state of affairs in the middle east and germany 's cooperation with the united nations in stabilizing lebanon for over an hour . the meeting concluded with the chancellor reaffirming that the german government and the central council of jews had " a positive and trusting friendship . " minister called for un investigation of israel the meeting was deemed necessary after wieczorek-zeul came under fire from knobloch and the council when , during a visit to lebanon , she called for a un investigation into claims that israel used carpet bombs in the campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul has defended her comments on israel " i pointed out - and all the aid organizations and even the un also point out - that there are carpet bombs in southern lebanon , " the minister told german broadcaster zdf on thursday .
she has continued to defend her comment and repeated her appeal for a general ban on carpet bombs . the central council of jews has accused wieczorek-zeul of stirring up anti-jewish sentiment in germany . jewish council critical of beirut visit knobloch has also attacked the development minister for visiting beirut last week as part of germany 's pledge to help rebuild lebanon following the devastating 34-day-long israeli offensive to rout hezbollah militia . " the least she could have done was to visit israel first .
she should have reached out first to the attacked , not the attackers , " said the council president . the council 's vice president , salomon korn , told the daily frankfurter rundschau , " the call for a un probe was another knee-jerk reaction from the minister towards israel . " if wieczorek-zeul wanted a un probe this should also take into account the fact that israeli citizens have for years come under rocket fire from lebanese soil , he added . the development minister said thursday on zdf 's " morgenmagazin " that she traveled to lebanon last weekend because germany is participating in rebuilding the country 's infrastructure .
israel , she said , wants to use its own resources to repair damage within its borders and therefore a visit was not necessary . internal differences on middle east policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knobloch became council president in june 2005 the row has highlighted differences of opinion in merkel 's power sharing left-right government on the middle east . when the war in lebanon erupted , the conservative merkel pointed out that hezbollah had started the trouble by seizing israeli soldiers .
though merkel urged restraint she did not join calls by other european leaders for an immediate ceasefire or criticize israel 's use of force as excessive . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said wednesday that germany believed it carries a historical responsibility towards the jewish state because of the holocaust , and said all government ministers respected this policy . wieczorek-zeul had not broken with it by calling for a un probe , nor was she anti-israeli , he added . she is a member of the social democrats , like foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , and is known for lashing out at human rights abuses regardless who may have committed them . steinmeier , who would like to help broker a long-term peace deal in the middle east , came in for criticism from the jewish council at the start of the war when he suggested that israel 's offensive might be disproportionate . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a german minister 's popular dissent on lebanon germany 's minister responsible for development aid has been a lone voice calling for an immediate ceasefire in lebanon .

the focus this year is likely to be high-definition tv and the growing battle between dvd formats . technophiles in berlin might think they have died and gone to high-tech heaven as they roam the aisles of the 46th ifa consumer electronics show in the country 's capital , the world 's largest .
exhibitors from 30 countries have come to show off their latest developments , with the next generation of televisions - high-definition tv -lrb- hdtv -rrb- with lcd and plasma screens - taking center stage . the arrival of hd-tv , high definition television , will mean that pictures will edge closer to cinema quality , and sound will come from eight channels instead of one or two .
the new , slim lcd and plasma sets are selling well here in germany , with sales up 30 percent on last year .
electronics retailers got an additional boost during this summer 's soccer world cup , when sales jumped further .
in western europe , an estimated 14 million hdtvs are expected to have been sold by the end of 2006 . " those figures back up the forecasts of market analysts who say that the roll-out for hd-tv is going to be much faster than it was for color television in the days of black and white , " said rainer hecker , the chairman of germany 's society for consumer electronics . battle of the formats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost all the major industrial groups in the consumer electronics sector are at the ifa much attention at the show is likely to focus on the battle between rival optical-disc formats , blu-ray and hd-dvd , described by some as a 21st-century repeat of the vhs versus beta video tape formats . both insist they have found the perfect successor to today 's dvd movie discs , and will announce players , for sale in european stores , and the first releases of high-definition movies for european sale .
but the rocky start of the technology in the united states in recent weeks suggests the real european launch is still months away and this drama could continue for some time .
it almost certainly will not be resolved at the current show . mobile devices the industry is also registering healthy demand for mobile and hand-held devices .
more than 160 million mobile phones , navigation aids , mp3 players , notebooks and other portable devices were sold in europe in 2005 . " these are all categories that came to the market relatively recently and are displaying a dynamism , quite unlike what we were seeing five years ago , " said hans joachim kamp , head of germany 's consumer electronics trade association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making sure everything 's shiny ever year about 10,000 new consumer electronics products are released onto the market .
the ones that sell well generally have lots of features and boost the image of their owners . however , sales in germany dropped by one-and-a-half percent in the first six months of this year .
this was due largely to falling sales in it and telecommunications products .
but analysts are still confident the whole of the electronics industry will turn in a growth figure of four percent this year .
it is hoped the ifa will help kick-start that growth . the fair opens for consumers on friday .
those visitors can get a sneak preview of the products that the retailers will be ordering and which will appear in stores over the next six months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 31.08.2006 polish pm launches charm offensive in brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski brothers have ushered in a new , less tolerant poland in brussels wednesday , poland 's new conservative prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski was at pains to improve his country 's increasingly negative image in the eu . " please , do not believe in the myth of an anti-semitic , homophobic , xenophobic poland .
please , come to poland , " he said in brussels after talks with european commission president jose manuel barroso . since he came to office last month , kaczynski 's government has appeared isolationist and has raised eyebrows in the eu with its hard-line attitude toward homosexuals , jews and the death penalty . " i can not mention any specific names here but i can tell you that in poland there are homosexuals who take very high positions on the polish political scene , and they also come from the right-wing parties , " he told reporters . " when it comes to anti-semitism , we have certain provisions in poland so that you can not use anti-semitic language , " he said . redressing the balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leader of poland 's conservative law and justice party , jaroslaw kaczynski , does n't usually mince words on arriving for his one-day visit , kaczynski , the twin brother of polish president lech kaczynski , said he was determined to clear up " misunderstandings " about his country 's commitment to the european union . poland joined the bloc in the " big bang " enlargement in may 2004 that saw the eu grow from 15 to 25 member states . " i am convinced that we will dissipate these misunderstandings and that this evening things will be better , " he told reporters traveling with him . " of course , we have our own expectations and our opinions and these sometimes differ from those of other countries , but we are a normal and loyal member of this organization , and we 'll do everything to ensure it has a great future in front of it , " he said . sensitive matters in july , all of poland 's former foreign ministers since the fall of communism in 1989 wrote a letter to condemn his brother 's behavior as " damaging to the interests of poland " and dismissive of its eu partners .
the letter was made public after the president appeared to snub a summit with german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac . at their joint press conference , barroso said he had raised a number of " sensitive matters " with kaczynski about poland 's attitude toward issues ranging from the death penalty to the independence of the central bank . he said he had been satisfied with the response . " i do n't take decisions based on comment , i take decisions based on facts and i think the facts will show poland 's commitment to european values , " barroso said .
" i really believe that poland is a crucially important country for the success of the european project .
i also believe that the european union is crucial for the future of poland and the well-being of the polish people . " warnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demanding equal rights for homosexuals in poland interrupted lech kaczynski speaking in berlin in march kaczynski was due later wednesday to hold talks with josep borrell , the president of the european parliament , whose lawmakers adopted in june a resolution condemning " the general rise in racist , xenophobic , anti-semitic and homophobic intolerance in poland . " kaczynski could also come under fire over an initiative launched by the extreme-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , a junior partner in his coalition government , to collect half a million signatures of eu citizens on a petition demanding the death penalty for pedophile-murderers . that move has already drawn a swift rebuff from the commission .
the eu 's executive body has said that capital punishment " is not compatible with european law or european values . " in a sign he was listening to some eu warnings , the polish premier said his government would send on thursday a " project paper " to the commission to better explain its controversial state aid to three key shipyards . brussels has warned that it expects the polish authorities to clarify by the end of the month its restructuring plans for the gdansk , gdynia and szczecin yards , the country 's biggest and which employ around 16,000 people . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish president 's twin brother becomes prime minister the surprise announcement that the president 's twin , jaroslaw kaczynski , is to be sworn in monday as prime minister has pushed down the value of the polish currency and raised concerns over poland 's nationalist shift .

" when it comes to anti-semitism , we have certain provisions in poland so that you can not use anti-semitic language , " he said . redressing the balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leader of poland 's conservative law and justice party , jaroslaw kaczynski , does n't usually mince words on arriving for his one-day visit , kaczynski , the twin brother of polish president lech kaczynski , said he was determined to clear up " misunderstandings " about his country 's commitment to the european union . poland joined the bloc in the " big bang " enlargement in may 2004 that saw the eu grow from 15 to 25 member states . " i am convinced that we will dissipate these misunderstandings and that this evening things will be better , " he told reporters traveling with him . " of course , we have our own expectations and our opinions and these sometimes differ from those of other countries , but we are a normal and loyal member of this organization , and we 'll do everything to ensure it has a great future in front of it , " he said . sensitive matters in july , all of poland 's former foreign ministers since the fall of communism in 1989 wrote a letter to condemn his brother 's behavior as " damaging to the interests of poland " and dismissive of its eu partners .
the letter was made public after the president appeared to snub a summit with german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac . at their joint press conference , barroso said he had raised a number of " sensitive matters " with kaczynski about poland 's attitude toward issues ranging from the death penalty to the independence of the central bank . he said he had been satisfied with the response . " i do n't take decisions based on comment , i take decisions based on facts and i think the facts will show poland 's commitment to european values , " barroso said .
" i really believe that poland is a crucially important country for the success of the european project .
i also believe that the european union is crucial for the future of poland and the well-being of the polish people . " warnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demanding equal rights for homosexuals in poland interrupted lech kaczynski speaking in berlin in march kaczynski was due later wednesday to hold talks with josep borrell , the president of the european parliament , whose lawmakers adopted in june a resolution condemning " the general rise in racist , xenophobic , anti-semitic and homophobic intolerance in poland . " kaczynski could also come under fire over an initiative launched by the extreme-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , a junior partner in his coalition government , to collect half a million signatures of eu citizens on a petition demanding the death penalty for pedophile-murderers . that move has already drawn a swift rebuff from the commission .
the eu 's executive body has said that capital punishment " is not compatible with european law or european values . " in a sign he was listening to some eu warnings , the polish premier said his government would send on thursday a " project paper " to the commission to better explain its controversial state aid to three key shipyards . brussels has warned that it expects the polish authorities to clarify by the end of the month its restructuring plans for the gdansk , gdynia and szczecin yards , the country 's biggest and which employ around 16,000 people . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish president 's twin brother becomes prime minister the surprise announcement that the president 's twin , jaroslaw kaczynski , is to be sworn in monday as prime minister has pushed down the value of the polish currency and raised concerns over poland 's nationalist shift .

the focus this year is likely to be high-definition tv and the growing battle between dvd formats . technophiles in berlin might think they have died and gone to high-tech heaven as they roam the aisles of the 46th ifa consumer electronics show in the country 's capital , the world 's largest .
exhibitors from 30 countries have come to show off their latest developments , with the next generation of televisions - high-definition tv -lrb- hdtv -rrb- with lcd and plasma screens - taking center stage . the arrival of hd-tv , high definition television , will mean that pictures will edge closer to cinema quality , and sound will come from eight channels instead of one or two .
the new , slim lcd and plasma sets are selling well here in germany , with sales up 30 percent on last year .
electronics retailers got an additional boost during this summer 's soccer world cup , when sales jumped further .
in western europe , an estimated 14 million hdtvs are expected to have been sold by the end of 2006 . " those figures back up the forecasts of market analysts who say that the roll-out for hd-tv is going to be much faster than it was for color television in the days of black and white , " said rainer hecker , the chairman of germany 's society for consumer electronics . battle of the formats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost all the major industrial groups in the consumer electronics sector are at the ifa much attention at the show is likely to focus on the battle between rival optical-disc formats , blu-ray and hd-dvd , described by some as a 21st-century repeat of the vhs versus beta video tape formats . both insist they have found the perfect successor to today 's dvd movie discs , and will announce players , for sale in european stores , and the first releases of high-definition movies for european sale .
but the rocky start of the technology in the united states in recent weeks suggests the real european launch is still months away and this drama could continue for some time .
it almost certainly will not be resolved at the current show . mobile devices the industry is also registering healthy demand for mobile and hand-held devices .
more than 160 million mobile phones , navigation aids , mp3 players , notebooks and other portable devices were sold in europe in 2005 . " these are all categories that came to the market relatively recently and are displaying a dynamism , quite unlike what we were seeing five years ago , " said hans joachim kamp , head of germany 's consumer electronics trade association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making sure everything 's shiny ever year about 10,000 new consumer electronics products are released onto the market .
the ones that sell well generally have lots of features and boost the image of their owners . however , sales in germany dropped by one-and-a-half percent in the first six months of this year .
this was due largely to falling sales in it and telecommunications products .
but analysts are still confident the whole of the electronics industry will turn in a growth figure of four percent this year .
it is hoped the ifa will help kick-start that growth . the fair opens for consumers on friday .
those visitors can get a sneak preview of the products that the retailers will be ordering and which will appear in stores over the next six months .

bavarian officials are calling it an " emergency solution . " homeschooling is illegal in germany , and yet the members of the fundamentalist christian sect " zwölf stämme " -lrb- twelve tribes -rrb- have won a victory of sorts in their fight to educate their children outside of germany 's state school system .
bavarian officials have agreed to let the group 's 32 school-aged children be taught by their own teachers in a private school - albeit one that is subject to state controls .
the school has initially been limited to a timeframe of one year . with the creation of the private school , a " years-long illegal situation has been ended , " said stefan rössle , district administrator for the region of donauwörth in bavaria . long battle with the law because of their religious convictions , parents in the twelve tribes community had been battling with state officials for over four years to keep their children out of state schools .
twelve tribes members take the bible 's teachings literally , and prefer to shield their children from some aspects of the modern world .
in homeschooling , for example , they teach the creation story , not the theory of evolution . but because homeschooling is not allowed in germany , the twelve tribes parents paid a high price for their resistance to state education .
over the years , they 've amassed some 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 167,000 -rrb- in unpaid fines , watched their children be forcibly enrolled in state schools , and stood by as one father was imprisoned for two weeks for his resistance .
through it all , they refused to bow to the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creation of the private school was an " emergency solution , " state officials said the result is a compromise solution .
the bavarian ministry of educational and cultural affairs has approved a curriculum for the group 's new private school in which sex education is absent , but where ethics , rather than religion , will be taught .
the parents can choose the teachers , but they have to foot the bill for the school themselves . " for us , the compromise was mainly about protecting the children 's right to an education , " said a ministry spokesperson . state still has control unlike homeschooling , the school will still be subject to state supervision .
state school officials have the right to visit the school at anytime and check on how lessons are being taught . " we will keep a very watchful eye on the project , " said rössle . green party politicians in the bavarian state parliament have criticized the compromise , saying the state is not acting in the children 's interest when it allows a " questionable religious community " the freedom to educate outside the state system . this latest example in bavaria highlights the difficult position state authorities are in when parents simply refuse to obey the law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.08.2006 germany plans tough measures for stopping terror on the web großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has become the favored medium of radical islamists since the september 11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states , the number of internet sites promoting violent jihad have soared .
germany wants to crack down on such sites and will change the law to do it . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has identified the internet as a " textbook " for terrorists and has announced that action will be taken to prevent the increasing number of manuals on bomb-making being made available online and block islamist forums espousing violent jihad . jörg ziercke , the president of the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- , has added his weight to schäuble 's calls by demanding that internet providers do more to stop such material from going online and is prepared to back stronger laws to enforce this .
at the moment , providers are not legally required to block users or remove content . experts believe that the power of the internet in the hands of terrorists should not be underestimated .
" there are enough reports from the police , the office for the protection of the constitution and news services that say that the internet is the most popular medium for communication between islamic groups , " said bernd carstensen , acting chairman of the federal alliance of german detectives -lrb- bdk -rrb- . estimates put the number of radical islamist web sites at around 5,000 , not including the many thousands of chatrooms in which terrorist groups and individuals keep in contact with each other . huge increase in islamist web presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror has spread on the web since sept .
11 , 2001 the menace is growing .
according to gabriel weimann , a communications expert in haifa and author of the book " terror on the internet , " there were only a dozen or so terrorist web pages online in 1998 .
since the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , experts point out that the terrorist presence on the internet has vastly expanded . terrorists have clearly discovered the huge potential for spreading propaganda online .
" as well as dominating most areas in society , the internet has also expanded the possibilities for radical groups , " said carstensen .
" since the internet offers the technical possibilities of chatrooms , forums and password-protected areas , it is an attractive proposition for terrorists .
they can remain anonymous and secure on the internet . " german police and secret services currently have limited powers to prosecute individuals or groups responsible for spreading islamic propaganda on the internet .
they have , however , filed a number of suits , although there are no official figures . new technology and training needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specially trained police officers would be needed according to the bdk , the police and security forces have teams of operatives monitoring the islamist presence on the internet , but more personnel would be needed if the interior ministry gets its way in securing more wide-ranging powers .
" these operatives would have to be specially trained to search for and analyze results in arabic , " says carstensen . these specialist teams would also have to have search technology that would allow them to reach the outer limits of the web that terrorists inhabit .
they would also need technology to efficiently record what they find .
currently , screenshots and saved data are the only evidence .
when further investigation - and the confiscation of hard drives - is approved , sometimes after days or weeks , the incriminating data may have already disappeared . but the new laws the interior ministry are hoping for are by no means guaranteed .
a special meeting of state interior ministers on sept .
4 in berlin will address the possibility of granting powers like those in place in britain , where phone , video and internet monitoring are all part of the fight against terror . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german federal police see no acute terror danger at home after the arrest of three suspects in germany in connection with the plot to bomb german trains , the head of the country 's federal criminal police office says he sees no immediate danger of further attacks right now .

de la vega followed up a trip on tuesday to current european union presidency holder finland by telling senior eu officials in brussels more had to be done and the bloc as a whole showed a " lack of commitment " in dealing with the problem .
the number of immigrants arriving in 2006 has exceeded the totals of previous years with about 19,000 refugees landing on the spanish islands to date , compared to the previous annual record of 9,900 , in 2002 .
the deputy prime minister stressed that spain could not deal with the constant flow from africa alone and madrid was " concerned at the slowness of certain initiatives . "
more refugee arrivals than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the influx of refugees has stretched spain 's resources according to canary islands authorities , in august alone over 4,700 refugees arrived on their shores , which is more than the total for 2005 .
three months ago de la vega forcibly put spain 's case forward but despite receiving air and sea surveillance assistance from the eu borders monitoring body frontex , the influx has continued unabated with the surveillance programme still not fully operational .
only finland , italy and portugal have so far committed patrol boats or surveillance planes to frontex , operating off mauritania , senegal and cape verde , joining spanish officials already working in the area .
after talks with de la vega , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said : " it is essential that all member states continue to show their political readiness to share the heavy burden which is now carried by a limited number of member states , which do their best to protect the eu external borders . "
frattini announced that the commission would set up a high-level working group on immigration and asylum issues , to be coordinated by de la vega , but acknowledged that " there is no quick fix . "
ineffective eu assistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masses of arrivals could cause a humanitarian crisis hindering frontex efforts further , one italian patrol boat , diciotti , has been stuck for 10 days in the southern spanish port of cadiz with engine trouble , while portugese counterpart baptista de andrade has been patrolling off cape verde for the past 10 days but has yet to report sightings of any illegal immigrants .
with the continual flow of arrivals , there has been increased political pressure on the spanish government , and with the canaries facing regional elections next year , the issue has become highly politicized .
nationally , the main conservative opposition popular party has lambasted the government as incompetent .
immigrants who survive torrid trips to the islands lasting upwards of 10 days are taken to overflowing reception camps and are then transferred to the mainland for up to 40 days , after which they are given an unenforceable document providing for their expulsion .
' ' humanitarian catastrophe " waiting to happen spain announced recently that 11,826 illegal arrivals had been transferred from the canary islands to the mainland since january .
most can not be repatriated in the absence of bilateral agreements with their homeland .
de la vega criticized eu partner states for their slowness in applying article 13 of the cotonou accord on repatriation of immigrants amid the reluctance to commit sufficient resources to the problem .
the canaries government had after monday 's arrivals called on eu states and the international community to help halt " a humanitarian catastrophe " , estimating some 490 would-be immigrants had died at sea this year . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks rapid reaction teams to deal with illegal immigrants the european commission has unveiled plans for rapid reaction teams of border guards to police europe 's frontiers , as spain and malta haggled over who should deal with a fresh wave of illegal immigrants .

" an amount exceeding $ 940 million has been pledged , " swedish foreign minister jan eliasson told the conference , which brought around 60 governments and organizations to the swedish capital on thursday . " the conference has thus met its objective with a wide margin , " he said .
including previous contributions , the total aid pledged so far for lebanon 's acute needs totals 1.2 billion dollars , he added . swedish organizers had originally said they hoped to raise $ 500 million dollars -lrb- 392 million euros -rrb- . lebanese prime minister fuad siniora had spelled out his country 's plight to those in attendance , saying the israeli bombing wiped out " 15 years of postwar development " in a month of fighting with hezbollah militants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister of lebanon fuad siniora , right , got more help than he likely anticipated " lebanon , which only seven weeks ago was full of hope and promise , has been torn to shreds by destruction , displacement , dispossession , desolation and death , " siniora told the conference , saying his country had suffered direct infrastructure damage and indirect damage due to loss of tourism amounting to billions of dollars . us state department aid randall tobias told the gathering that us president george w. bush had pledged $ 230 million -lrb- 180 million euros -rrb- in aid for lebanon . germany has promised to contribute 22 million euros . hezbollah worries some western countries expressed worries that money going to lebanon could end up in the hands of hezbollah .
there were concerns that cash handouts by hezbollah to those whose homes had been damaged or destroyed could boost the militant group 's popularity .
siniora played down any involvement of the militant group in the rebuilding process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 30,000 homes were destroyed " all will be channeled through the government , " siniora said at the conference .

de la vega followed up a trip on tuesday to current european union presidency holder finland by telling senior eu officials in brussels more had to be done and the bloc as a whole showed a " lack of commitment " in dealing with the problem .
the number of immigrants arriving in 2006 has exceeded the totals of previous years with about 19,000 refugees landing on the spanish islands to date , compared to the previous annual record of 9,900 , in 2002 .
the deputy prime minister stressed that spain could not deal with the constant flow from africa alone and madrid was " concerned at the slowness of certain initiatives . "
more refugee arrivals than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the influx of refugees has stretched spain 's resources according to canary islands authorities , in august alone over 4,700 refugees arrived on their shores , which is more than the total for 2005 .
three months ago de la vega forcibly put spain 's case forward but despite receiving air and sea surveillance assistance from the eu borders monitoring body frontex , the influx has continued unabated with the surveillance programme still not fully operational .
only finland , italy and portugal have so far committed patrol boats or surveillance planes to frontex , operating off mauritania , senegal and cape verde , joining spanish officials already working in the area .
after talks with de la vega , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said : " it is essential that all member states continue to show their political readiness to share the heavy burden which is now carried by a limited number of member states , which do their best to protect the eu external borders . "
frattini announced that the commission would set up a high-level working group on immigration and asylum issues , to be coordinated by de la vega , but acknowledged that " there is no quick fix . "
ineffective eu assistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masses of arrivals could cause a humanitarian crisis hindering frontex efforts further , one italian patrol boat , diciotti , has been stuck for 10 days in the southern spanish port of cadiz with engine trouble , while portugese counterpart baptista de andrade has been patrolling off cape verde for the past 10 days but has yet to report sightings of any illegal immigrants .
with the continual flow of arrivals , there has been increased political pressure on the spanish government , and with the canaries facing regional elections next year , the issue has become highly politicized .
nationally , the main conservative opposition popular party has lambasted the government as incompetent .
immigrants who survive torrid trips to the islands lasting upwards of 10 days are taken to overflowing reception camps and are then transferred to the mainland for up to 40 days , after which they are given an unenforceable document providing for their expulsion .
' ' humanitarian catastrophe " waiting to happen spain announced recently that 11,826 illegal arrivals had been transferred from the canary islands to the mainland since january .
most can not be repatriated in the absence of bilateral agreements with their homeland .
de la vega criticized eu partner states for their slowness in applying article 13 of the cotonou accord on repatriation of immigrants amid the reluctance to commit sufficient resources to the problem .
the canaries government had after monday 's arrivals called on eu states and the international community to help halt " a humanitarian catastrophe " , estimating some 490 would-be immigrants had died at sea this year . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks rapid reaction teams to deal with illegal immigrants the european commission has unveiled plans for rapid reaction teams of border guards to police europe 's frontiers , as spain and malta haggled over who should deal with a fresh wave of illegal immigrants .

more refugee arrivals than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the influx of refugees has stretched spain 's resources according to canary islands authorities , in august alone over 4,700 refugees arrived on their shores , which is more than the total for 2005 .
three months ago de la vega forcibly put spain 's case forward but despite receiving air and sea surveillance assistance from the eu borders monitoring body frontex , the influx has continued unabated with the surveillance programme still not fully operational .
only finland , italy and portugal have so far committed patrol boats or surveillance planes to frontex , operating off mauritania , senegal and cape verde , joining spanish officials already working in the area .
after talks with de la vega , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said : " it is essential that all member states continue to show their political readiness to share the heavy burden which is now carried by a limited number of member states , which do their best to protect the eu external borders . "
frattini announced that the commission would set up a high-level working group on immigration and asylum issues , to be coordinated by de la vega , but acknowledged that " there is no quick fix . "
ineffective eu assistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masses of arrivals could cause a humanitarian crisis hindering frontex efforts further , one italian patrol boat , diciotti , has been stuck for 10 days in the southern spanish port of cadiz with engine trouble , while portugese counterpart baptista de andrade has been patrolling off cape verde for the past 10 days but has yet to report sightings of any illegal immigrants .
with the continual flow of arrivals , there has been increased political pressure on the spanish government , and with the canaries facing regional elections next year , the issue has become highly politicized .
nationally , the main conservative opposition popular party has lambasted the government as incompetent .
immigrants who survive torrid trips to the islands lasting upwards of 10 days are taken to overflowing reception camps and are then transferred to the mainland for up to 40 days , after which they are given an unenforceable document providing for their expulsion .
' ' humanitarian catastrophe " waiting to happen spain announced recently that 11,826 illegal arrivals had been transferred from the canary islands to the mainland since january .
most can not be repatriated in the absence of bilateral agreements with their homeland .
de la vega criticized eu partner states for their slowness in applying article 13 of the cotonou accord on repatriation of immigrants amid the reluctance to commit sufficient resources to the problem .
the canaries government had after monday 's arrivals called on eu states and the international community to help halt " a humanitarian catastrophe " , estimating some 490 would-be immigrants had died at sea this year . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks rapid reaction teams to deal with illegal immigrants the european commission has unveiled plans for rapid reaction teams of border guards to police europe 's frontiers , as spain and malta haggled over who should deal with a fresh wave of illegal immigrants .

" an amount exceeding $ 940 million has been pledged , " swedish foreign minister jan eliasson told the conference , which brought around 60 governments and organizations to the swedish capital on thursday . " the conference has thus met its objective with a wide margin , " he said .

" an amount exceeding $ 940 million has been pledged , " swedish foreign minister jan eliasson told the conference , which brought around 60 governments and organizations to the swedish capital on thursday . " the conference has thus met its objective with a wide margin , " he said .
including previous contributions , the total aid pledged so far for lebanon 's acute needs totals 1.2 billion dollars , he added . swedish organizers had originally said they hoped to raise $ 500 million dollars -lrb- 392 million euros -rrb- . lebanese prime minister fuad siniora had spelled out his country 's plight to those in attendance , saying the israeli bombing wiped out " 15 years of postwar development " in a month of fighting with hezbollah militants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister of lebanon fuad siniora , right , got more help than he likely anticipated " lebanon , which only seven weeks ago was full of hope and promise , has been torn to shreds by destruction , displacement , dispossession , desolation and death , " siniora told the conference , saying his country had suffered direct infrastructure damage and indirect damage due to loss of tourism amounting to billions of dollars . us state department aid randall tobias told the gathering that us president george w. bush had pledged $ 230 million -lrb- 180 million euros -rrb- in aid for lebanon . germany has promised to contribute 22 million euros . hezbollah worries some western countries expressed worries that money going to lebanon could end up in the hands of hezbollah .

" the idea that it will be siphoned one way or another to hezbollah is a fallacy . " israel began its bombing campaign in lebanon after hezbollah guerillas captured two israeli soldiers and killed eight in a cross-border raid .
nearly 1,200 people in lebanon , mostly civilians , were killed . lebanon hopes to hold a bigger conference later this year to raise money for longer-term reconstruction . stockholm will play host to a smaller gathering on friday to discuss humanitarian needs in the palestinian territories . support crucial the un 's deputy secretary , mark malloch brown , had said international support would help the central government and warned that withholding support could have serious consequences . " if we , the international community , fail in supporting lebanon now , we fail not just the brave lebanese people but also their national aspiration for a stable , strong and democratic government , " he told the conference participants . among the priorities for short-term relief were thousands of prefabricated homes for a portion of the one million people displaced and the removal of unexploded bombs , including cluster bombs , which the un 's emergency relief coordinator jan egeland said could be waiting for people as they return to their homes and villages . on wednesday , siniora said his government would pay $ 40,000 to each family made homeless to help them rebuild . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de donors conference to pledge aid for lebanon officials from more than 40 countries are in stockholm thursday to raise 392 million euros -lrb- $ 500 million -rrb- for lebanon 's acute humanitarian and reconstruction needs following the devastating israeli offensive .

bavarian officials are calling it an " emergency solution . " homeschooling is illegal in germany , and yet the members of the fundamentalist christian sect " zwölf stämme " -lrb- twelve tribes -rrb- have won a victory of sorts in their fight to educate their children outside of germany 's state school system .
bavarian officials have agreed to let the group 's 32 school-aged children be taught by their own teachers in a private school - albeit one that is subject to state controls .
the school has initially been limited to a timeframe of one year . with the creation of the private school , a " years-long illegal situation has been ended , " said stefan rössle , district administrator for the region of donauwörth in bavaria . long battle with the law because of their religious convictions , parents in the twelve tribes community had been battling with state officials for over four years to keep their children out of state schools .
twelve tribes members take the bible 's teachings literally , and prefer to shield their children from some aspects of the modern world .
in homeschooling , for example , they teach the creation story , not the theory of evolution . but because homeschooling is not allowed in germany , the twelve tribes parents paid a high price for their resistance to state education .
over the years , they 've amassed some 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 167,000 -rrb- in unpaid fines , watched their children be forcibly enrolled in state schools , and stood by as one father was imprisoned for two weeks for his resistance .
through it all , they refused to bow to the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creation of the private school was an " emergency solution , " state officials said the result is a compromise solution .
the bavarian ministry of educational and cultural affairs has approved a curriculum for the group 's new private school in which sex education is absent , but where ethics , rather than religion , will be taught .
the parents can choose the teachers , but they have to foot the bill for the school themselves . " for us , the compromise was mainly about protecting the children 's right to an education , " said a ministry spokesperson . state still has control unlike homeschooling , the school will still be subject to state supervision .
state school officials have the right to visit the school at anytime and check on how lessons are being taught . " we will keep a very watchful eye on the project , " said rössle . green party politicians in the bavarian state parliament have criticized the compromise , saying the state is not acting in the children 's interest when it allows a " questionable religious community " the freedom to educate outside the state system . this latest example in bavaria highlights the difficult position state authorities are in when parents simply refuse to obey the law .
in recent months , there have been several incidents of homeschooling families clashing with truancy officials , mostly for religious reasons . their case histories are documented by several homeschooling initiatives in germany which are lobbying for greater educational freedom . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living room lessons not easy in germany opting to teach your kids at home instead of sending them to school is not an easy decision .

he considers the establishment of sustainable economic development in the region to be the greatest challenge in his new role , particularly in light of the impending transfer of authority in kosovo . the new unmik head is confident this can be achieved , but said that integrating kosovo into the larger markets in southeastern europe and the eu is essential . eco n omic i n tegratio n n ecessary for developme n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rücker has served for three years in the balkans " it 's very good that kosovo is a member of the regional energy league in southeastern europe , which links the regional energy markets , " rücker said .
" without integration , it wo n't work .
investment in the infrastructure - and especially private investment - is necessary .
the privatization program is contributing to this . " rücker , a 55-year-old native of the southwestern german state of baden-württemberg , brings practical experience in solving macro-economic problems .
as mayor of the town of sindelfingen from 1993 to 2001 , he managed to revamp the city 's budget , which had been burdened by heavy debts . " i think that this administrative experience in a town with difficulties is very important , " said franz-lothar altmann , an economic expert for southeastern europe at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" he has shown that he can lead a larger political entity , which is what kosovo is . " repairi n g eth n ic divisio n s in addition to the economic developments , rücker will have to contribute to ethnic conciliation between serbs and albanians in kosovo .
his goal is that , by the end of his mandate , all citizens will be represented through the elected institutions in the region and ethnic minorities will be active in social and political life . " unmik is mandated to administrate kosovo as a whole and structures that work against this can not be tolerated , " said rücker , referring to parallel administrative structures in the region that aim at dividing kosovo between the serbs and albanians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostilities in kosovo disrupted - and ended - many lives the implementation of standardized license plates is one example of efforts to promote political and ethnic cooperation , rücker said .
to enhance freedom of movement for all residents , unmik introduced license plates several years ago that do n't reveal which city the vehicle is from .
previously , nationalist street mobs had attacked returning refugees after identifying from the license plate where they came from . however , the newer standardized plates still are n't in use in serbian-dominated northern kosovo , because they are not officially recognized by neighboring serbia .
serbs from the north drive with serbian license plates or none at all .
they do n't dare to come south , and drivers from the south avoid heading north with standard plates . status decisio n expected by year 's e n d whether with license plates , ethnic reconciliation or economic development , rücker is aware that change wo n't come over night , he said . " it 's very important for us that the residents of kosovo have perspective , " he said .
" this will come with the beginning of the status negotiations , at the latest . " the negotiation process on kosovo 's ultimate political status is being chaired by finnish diplomat martti ahtisaari .
resolving kosovo 's status is a major factor in the stability of the region , rücker said . " we will do everything we can so that mr. ahtisaari and the contact group are able to stay on schedule , " he said .
" that means that they should be able to submit a final decision on kosovo 's status to the security council by the end of the year .

bavarian officials are calling it an " emergency solution . " homeschooling is illegal in germany , and yet the members of the fundamentalist christian sect " zwölf stämme " -lrb- twelve tribes -rrb- have won a victory of sorts in their fight to educate their children outside of germany 's state school system .
bavarian officials have agreed to let the group 's 32 school-aged children be taught by their own teachers in a private school - albeit one that is subject to state controls .
the school has initially been limited to a timeframe of one year . with the creation of the private school , a " years-long illegal situation has been ended , " said stefan rössle , district administrator for the region of donauwörth in bavaria . long battle with the law because of their religious convictions , parents in the twelve tribes community had been battling with state officials for over four years to keep their children out of state schools .
twelve tribes members take the bible 's teachings literally , and prefer to shield their children from some aspects of the modern world .
in homeschooling , for example , they teach the creation story , not the theory of evolution . but because homeschooling is not allowed in germany , the twelve tribes parents paid a high price for their resistance to state education .
over the years , they 've amassed some 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 167,000 -rrb- in unpaid fines , watched their children be forcibly enrolled in state schools , and stood by as one father was imprisoned for two weeks for his resistance .

de la vega followed up a trip on tuesday to current european union presidency holder finland by telling senior eu officials in brussels more had to be done and the bloc as a whole showed a " lack of commitment " in dealing with the problem .
the number of immigrants arriving in 2006 has exceeded the totals of previous years with about 19,000 refugees landing on the spanish islands to date , compared to the previous annual record of 9,900 , in 2002 .
the deputy prime minister stressed that spain could not deal with the constant flow from africa alone and madrid was " concerned at the slowness of certain initiatives . "

three months ago de la vega forcibly put spain 's case forward but despite receiving air and sea surveillance assistance from the eu borders monitoring body frontex , the influx has continued unabated with the surveillance programme still not fully operational .
only finland , italy and portugal have so far committed patrol boats or surveillance planes to frontex , operating off mauritania , senegal and cape verde , joining spanish officials already working in the area .
after talks with de la vega , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said : " it is essential that all member states continue to show their political readiness to share the heavy burden which is now carried by a limited number of member states , which do their best to protect the eu external borders .

with the continual flow of arrivals , there has been increased political pressure on the spanish government , and with the canaries facing regional elections next year , the issue has become highly politicized .

de la vega criticized eu partner states for their slowness in applying article 13 of the cotonou accord on repatriation of immigrants amid the reluctance to commit sufficient resources to the problem .

" the assessment by the lebanese government with the support of the un is that about $ 500 million will be needed for the forthcoming months , " said sweden 's state secretary at the foreign office , annika söders . it used to have one of the most flourishing economies in the middle east , but lebanon has now estimated damage inflicted by the offensive at $ 3.6 billion , with 130,000 homes , 80 bridges and 94 roads destroyed or damaged . aid agencies say the bombardment has left both the country 's infrastructure and economy in tatters . according to oxfam , it coincided with the harvest season and the agricultural sector has therefore been devastated . " beyond the piles of bricks and mortar lies the less visible tragedy of acres of ruined farmland and rotting crops , " said ceo jeremy hobbs on the bbc . immoral un humanitarian chief jan egeland was expected to appeal in stockholm for more money for mine clearance after accusing israel wednesday of conducting a " completely immoral " cluster bomb blitz just before the ceasefire went into effect that has left as many as 100,000 unexploded bomblets in south lebanon . " this conference is about temporary , acute reconstruction so people can start to live their lives during the reconstruction , " swedish aid minister carin jaemtin , who will co-host the conference with foreign minister jan eliasson , told afp ahead of the meeting . immediate needs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan egeland has issued urgent calls for aid to the war-ravaged country the first donors ' conference to be held since the conflict broke out seeks to address the immediate needs for the lebanese people including " access to medical care , key roads and bridges , markets , and removal of unexploded ordnance , " said kathleen cravero of the un development program . repairing schools and repairing water and electricity supplies systems are also priorities . external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner was expected to announce an additional 42 million euros -lrb- $ 54 million -rrb- , taking the european union 's aid to 100 million . around 4 million euros of the new money will go to help the un clear unexploded munitions , which since the end of the fighting have killed 13 people and injured 46 . international aid lebanon has already received emergency aid of $ 500 million from saudi arabia and $ 800 million from kuwait . ministers from numerous eu countries , as well as representatives of south korea , japan , brazil and morocco were set to participate in the conference . senior officials from the united states and the united nations , the world bank , international monetary fund , red cross and world health organization were also expected . lebanese prime minister fuad siniora was also due to attend the conference , where in addition to monetary pledges he was expected to seek donations of mobile homes to temporarily house the tens of thousands who lost their homes . annan cements ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan has been tackling the issue of syrian support for hezbollah meanwhile , un secretary general kofi annan is doing his part on the ground - on a whirl-wind tour through the middle east trying to turn the current ceasefire between israel and hezbollah into a permanent agreement . on the fourth leg of his tour , annan met with palestinian president mahmoud abbas to discuss the palestinian-israeli conflict , which many regard as pivotal for peace in the region . earlier in the day , israel ’ s ongoing air and sea blockade against lebanon was top of his talks with israeli prime minister ehud olmert , during which he called on hezbollah to release the two israeli soldiers who were kidnapped on july 12 . olmert was firm about keeping up the siege until the hostages are released as demanded by un resolution 1701 signed on august 14 which ended the hostilities . on thursday , annan headed for jordan to hold talks with king abdullah ii on bolstering the truce between israel and hezbollah . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german , lebanese leaders discuss un buffer force german chancellor angela merkel and lebanese prime minister fuad siniora have spoken about berlin 's contribution to a beefed-up un peacekeeping force in war-battered southern lebanon .

the 63rd venice film festival originally wanted the first curtain to go up on director tom tykwer 's long-awaited movie adaptation of patrick süskind 's best-selling 1976 novel " perfume . " it would have been the first time a german film opened a major international film festival - apart from the time another tykwer film , " heaven , " opened the berlin film festival in 2002 - and it would have marked a neat closing of a circle for the ' wunderkind ' of german film who wowed critics and audiences when his " run , lola , run " enjoyed its international breakthrough here in 1998 . " a sore point " for venice - and for germany that it was n't to be has been described by festival head marco müller as a " sore point " for his program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd eichinger -lrb- l -rrb- , tom tykwer and lead actor dustin hoffman " it could have been the perfect opening competition movie , " he said . but producer bernd eichinger from constantin film chose not to subject " perfume " to the cut and thrust of the festival fray , instead announcing a german premiere in mid-september for what tykwer says will be promoted as a " specifically german " film despite being shot in english and featuring an international cast . germany 's gems with " perfume " therefore out of the running , it will be up to " black book , " a european co-production directed by paul verhoeven and shot in berlin 's babelsberg studios , to help germany to a golden or silver lion .
the tale of a resistance fighter in world war ii , it features german actors sebastian koch and christian berkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the first " heimat " series also taking the edge off germany 's disappointment is edgar reitz , in town with the fourth installment of his " heimat " epic .
it was in venice that he first unveiled his acclaimed series in 1984 , and he 's been grateful ever since . " there 's always been two sides to the festival , " he said .
" on the one hand there 's the whole showbiz glamour side to it , but at least venice has always done its best to make sure auteur films have a fair chance against more commercial entries . " there 's no shortage of the latter this year .
in the end , headlining the festival wednesday in place of " perfume " was a treatment of another literary classic , james ellroy 's " the black dahlia " directed by brian de palma and starring scarlett johansson .
venice has always been a draw for the glitterati , and other hollywood luminaries expected to tread the red carpet over the next nine days include catherine deneuve , anthony hopkins , sandra bullock and nicolas cage . the rome row it 's hoped the razzle-dazzle will put in the shade a bitter row that 's been simmering in venice ever since rome revealed its plans to launch its own film festival later this year .
it 's already announced its october opening will be graced by none other than nicole kidman , who 's always been a venice favorite . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are there just too many festivals these days ?
with an inadequate infrastructure that 's long put the city at a practical disadvantage compared to rival events in cannes and berlin , venice has good reason to fear it might be submerged by the " festa del cinema . "
it 's retaliating by pulling rank , with müller suggesting rome will only ever be able to secure films venice has rejected . venice mayor massimo cacciari has been equally dismissive .
" venice against rome - that 's like truffaut against james bond , " he sneered . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " perfume " on its way to silver screen it took two decades but production of the movie version of " perfume , " the blockbuster novel by patrick süskind , has begun .

" the assessment by the lebanese government with the support of the un is that about $ 500 million will be needed for the forthcoming months , " said sweden 's state secretary at the foreign office , annika söders . it used to have one of the most flourishing economies in the middle east , but lebanon has now estimated damage inflicted by the offensive at $ 3.6 billion , with 130,000 homes , 80 bridges and 94 roads destroyed or damaged . aid agencies say the bombardment has left both the country 's infrastructure and economy in tatters . according to oxfam , it coincided with the harvest season and the agricultural sector has therefore been devastated . " beyond the piles of bricks and mortar lies the less visible tragedy of acres of ruined farmland and rotting crops , " said ceo jeremy hobbs on the bbc . immoral un humanitarian chief jan egeland was expected to appeal in stockholm for more money for mine clearance after accusing israel wednesday of conducting a " completely immoral " cluster bomb blitz just before the ceasefire went into effect that has left as many as 100,000 unexploded bomblets in south lebanon .

de la vega followed up a trip on tuesday to current european union presidency holder finland by telling senior eu officials in brussels more had to be done and the bloc as a whole showed a " lack of commitment " in dealing with the problem .
the number of immigrants arriving in 2006 has exceeded the totals of previous years with about 19,000 refugees landing on the spanish islands to date , compared to the previous annual record of 9,900 , in 2002 .
the deputy prime minister stressed that spain could not deal with the constant flow from africa alone and madrid was " concerned at the slowness of certain initiatives . "
more refugee arrivals than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the influx of refugees has stretched spain 's resources according to canary islands authorities , in august alone over 4,700 refugees arrived on their shores , which is more than the total for 2005 .
three months ago de la vega forcibly put spain 's case forward but despite receiving air and sea surveillance assistance from the eu borders monitoring body frontex , the influx has continued unabated with the surveillance programme still not fully operational .
only finland , italy and portugal have so far committed patrol boats or surveillance planes to frontex , operating off mauritania , senegal and cape verde , joining spanish officials already working in the area .
after talks with de la vega , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said : " it is essential that all member states continue to show their political readiness to share the heavy burden which is now carried by a limited number of member states , which do their best to protect the eu external borders . "
frattini announced that the commission would set up a high-level working group on immigration and asylum issues , to be coordinated by de la vega , but acknowledged that " there is no quick fix . "
ineffective eu assistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masses of arrivals could cause a humanitarian crisis hindering frontex efforts further , one italian patrol boat , diciotti , has been stuck for 10 days in the southern spanish port of cadiz with engine trouble , while portugese counterpart baptista de andrade has been patrolling off cape verde for the past 10 days but has yet to report sightings of any illegal immigrants .
with the continual flow of arrivals , there has been increased political pressure on the spanish government , and with the canaries facing regional elections next year , the issue has become highly politicized .
nationally , the main conservative opposition popular party has lambasted the government as incompetent .
immigrants who survive torrid trips to the islands lasting upwards of 10 days are taken to overflowing reception camps and are then transferred to the mainland for up to 40 days , after which they are given an unenforceable document providing for their expulsion .
' ' humanitarian catastrophe " waiting to happen spain announced recently that 11,826 illegal arrivals had been transferred from the canary islands to the mainland since january .
most can not be repatriated in the absence of bilateral agreements with their homeland .
de la vega criticized eu partner states for their slowness in applying article 13 of the cotonou accord on repatriation of immigrants amid the reluctance to commit sufficient resources to the problem .
the canaries government had after monday 's arrivals called on eu states and the international community to help halt " a humanitarian catastrophe " , estimating some 490 would-be immigrants had died at sea this year . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks rapid reaction teams to deal with illegal immigrants the european commission has unveiled plans for rapid reaction teams of border guards to police europe 's frontiers , as spain and malta haggled over who should deal with a fresh wave of illegal immigrants .

" these operatives would have to be specially trained to search for and analyze results in arabic , " says carstensen . these specialist teams would also have to have search technology that would allow them to reach the outer limits of the web that terrorists inhabit .
they would also need technology to efficiently record what they find .
currently , screenshots and saved data are the only evidence .
when further investigation - and the confiscation of hard drives - is approved , sometimes after days or weeks , the incriminating data may have already disappeared . but the new laws the interior ministry are hoping for are by no means guaranteed .

iran insists the program is aimed at producing electricity . report : west planning sanctions germany , the united states , france , and britain were reportedly drawing up plans for a three-stage system of international sanctions designed to force iran into compliance . the progressively tougher measures would begin with an embargo on the sale of nuclear-related materials and a limited travel ban for iranian officials , graduating to a broader travel ban and the freezing of overseas assets and then , if these measures fail , restrictions on commercial flights and world bank loans , the new york times reported . the five permanent members of the council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany , have sought to coax tehran into suspending enrichment by offering a package of security , trade and technology incentives . but russia and china have shown great reluctance even to threaten iran with sanctions . us undersecretary of state nicholas burns said on wednesday that he expected sanctions to be imposed within a month . " we believe the sanctions regime will be agreed to in september by the security council and we 're going to work towards that with a great deal of energy and termination , " he told cnn . us state department spokesman sean mccormack said senior officials from britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states would meet in europe early next week to begin discussing sanctions against iran if it is deemed to have flouted the un deadline . ahmadinejad appeals to european powers in an apparent attempt to drive a wedge between the united states and its european partners , president ahmadinejad called on europe to solve the row over iran 's nuclear program through negotiations and act independently of washington , the state-run irna news agency reported on thursday . " by adopting independent and logical policies , the europeans can change for the better the region 's attitude towards them .
the europeans should not follow wrong and aggressive us policies , since the us only thinks about itself , " ahmadinejad was quoted as saying . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopes for an alternative to sanctions in iran stand-off iran 's confident dismissal of the un threat of action caused widespread concern in the international community wednesday , while germany maintained that sanctions were far from definite .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : berlinale 2007 berlinale still a grande dame among film festivals berlin film festival line-up complete film on nazi counterfeiting operation wins oscar 2007 berlinale to open with wartime dramas culture & lifestyle -pipe- 31.08.2006 disappointment for germany at venice film festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it might be feeling insecure , but venice is still putting on the ritz germany 's contribution to this year 's venice film festival is respectable enough - but it could have been so much more . in fact , it could have been a milestone for german cinema .
the 63rd venice film festival originally wanted the first curtain to go up on director tom tykwer 's long-awaited movie adaptation of patrick süskind 's best-selling 1976 novel " perfume . " it would have been the first time a german film opened a major international film festival - apart from the time another tykwer film , " heaven , " opened the berlin film festival in 2002 - and it would have marked a neat closing of a circle for the ' wunderkind ' of german film who wowed critics and audiences when his " run , lola , run " enjoyed its international breakthrough here in 1998 . " a sore point " for venice - and for germany that it was n't to be has been described by festival head marco müller as a " sore point " for his program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd eichinger -lrb- l -rrb- , tom tykwer and lead actor dustin hoffman " it could have been the perfect opening competition movie , " he said . but producer bernd eichinger from constantin film chose not to subject " perfume " to the cut and thrust of the festival fray , instead announcing a german premiere in mid-september for what tykwer says will be promoted as a " specifically german " film despite being shot in english and featuring an international cast . germany 's gems with " perfume " therefore out of the running , it will be up to " black book , " a european co-production directed by paul verhoeven and shot in berlin 's babelsberg studios , to help germany to a golden or silver lion .
the tale of a resistance fighter in world war ii , it features german actors sebastian koch and christian berkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the first " heimat " series also taking the edge off germany 's disappointment is edgar reitz , in town with the fourth installment of his " heimat " epic .
it was in venice that he first unveiled his acclaimed series in 1984 , and he 's been grateful ever since . " there 's always been two sides to the festival , " he said .
" on the one hand there 's the whole showbiz glamour side to it , but at least venice has always done its best to make sure auteur films have a fair chance against more commercial entries . " there 's no shortage of the latter this year .
in the end , headlining the festival wednesday in place of " perfume " was a treatment of another literary classic , james ellroy 's " the black dahlia " directed by brian de palma and starring scarlett johansson .
venice has always been a draw for the glitterati , and other hollywood luminaries expected to tread the red carpet over the next nine days include catherine deneuve , anthony hopkins , sandra bullock and nicolas cage . the rome row it 's hoped the razzle-dazzle will put in the shade a bitter row that 's been simmering in venice ever since rome revealed its plans to launch its own film festival later this year .
it 's already announced its october opening will be graced by none other than nicole kidman , who 's always been a venice favorite . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are there just too many festivals these days ?

the 63rd venice film festival originally wanted the first curtain to go up on director tom tykwer 's long-awaited movie adaptation of patrick süskind 's best-selling 1976 novel " perfume . " it would have been the first time a german film opened a major international film festival - apart from the time another tykwer film , " heaven , " opened the berlin film festival in 2002 - and it would have marked a neat closing of a circle for the ' wunderkind ' of german film who wowed critics and audiences when his " run , lola , run " enjoyed its international breakthrough here in 1998 . " a sore point " for venice - and for germany that it was n't to be has been described by festival head marco müller as a " sore point " for his program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd eichinger -lrb- l -rrb- , tom tykwer and lead actor dustin hoffman " it could have been the perfect opening competition movie , " he said . but producer bernd eichinger from constantin film chose not to subject " perfume " to the cut and thrust of the festival fray , instead announcing a german premiere in mid-september for what tykwer says will be promoted as a " specifically german " film despite being shot in english and featuring an international cast . germany 's gems with " perfume " therefore out of the running , it will be up to " black book , " a european co-production directed by paul verhoeven and shot in berlin 's babelsberg studios , to help germany to a golden or silver lion .
the tale of a resistance fighter in world war ii , it features german actors sebastian koch and christian berkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the first " heimat " series also taking the edge off germany 's disappointment is edgar reitz , in town with the fourth installment of his " heimat " epic .
it was in venice that he first unveiled his acclaimed series in 1984 , and he 's been grateful ever since . " there 's always been two sides to the festival , " he said .
" on the one hand there 's the whole showbiz glamour side to it , but at least venice has always done its best to make sure auteur films have a fair chance against more commercial entries . " there 's no shortage of the latter this year .
in the end , headlining the festival wednesday in place of " perfume " was a treatment of another literary classic , james ellroy 's " the black dahlia " directed by brian de palma and starring scarlett johansson .
venice has always been a draw for the glitterati , and other hollywood luminaries expected to tread the red carpet over the next nine days include catherine deneuve , anthony hopkins , sandra bullock and nicolas cage . the rome row it 's hoped the razzle-dazzle will put in the shade a bitter row that 's been simmering in venice ever since rome revealed its plans to launch its own film festival later this year .
it 's already announced its october opening will be graced by none other than nicole kidman , who 's always been a venice favorite . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are there just too many festivals these days ?
with an inadequate infrastructure that 's long put the city at a practical disadvantage compared to rival events in cannes and berlin , venice has good reason to fear it might be submerged by the " festa del cinema . "
it 's retaliating by pulling rank , with müller suggesting rome will only ever be able to secure films venice has rejected . venice mayor massimo cacciari has been equally dismissive .
" venice against rome - that 's like truffaut against james bond , " he sneered . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " perfume " on its way to silver screen it took two decades but production of the movie version of " perfume , " the blockbuster novel by patrick süskind , has begun .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.08.2006 germany plans tough measures for stopping terror on the web großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has become the favored medium of radical islamists since the september 11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states , the number of internet sites promoting violent jihad have soared .
germany wants to crack down on such sites and will change the law to do it . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has identified the internet as a " textbook " for terrorists and has announced that action will be taken to prevent the increasing number of manuals on bomb-making being made available online and block islamist forums espousing violent jihad . jörg ziercke , the president of the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- , has added his weight to schäuble 's calls by demanding that internet providers do more to stop such material from going online and is prepared to back stronger laws to enforce this .
at the moment , providers are not legally required to block users or remove content . experts believe that the power of the internet in the hands of terrorists should not be underestimated .
" there are enough reports from the police , the office for the protection of the constitution and news services that say that the internet is the most popular medium for communication between islamic groups , " said bernd carstensen , acting chairman of the federal alliance of german detectives -lrb- bdk -rrb- . estimates put the number of radical islamist web sites at around 5,000 , not including the many thousands of chatrooms in which terrorist groups and individuals keep in contact with each other . huge increase in islamist web presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror has spread on the web since sept .
11 , 2001 the menace is growing .
according to gabriel weimann , a communications expert in haifa and author of the book " terror on the internet , " there were only a dozen or so terrorist web pages online in 1998 .
since the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , experts point out that the terrorist presence on the internet has vastly expanded . terrorists have clearly discovered the huge potential for spreading propaganda online .
" as well as dominating most areas in society , the internet has also expanded the possibilities for radical groups , " said carstensen .
" since the internet offers the technical possibilities of chatrooms , forums and password-protected areas , it is an attractive proposition for terrorists .
they can remain anonymous and secure on the internet . " german police and secret services currently have limited powers to prosecute individuals or groups responsible for spreading islamic propaganda on the internet .
they have , however , filed a number of suits , although there are no official figures . new technology and training needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specially trained police officers would be needed according to the bdk , the police and security forces have teams of operatives monitoring the islamist presence on the internet , but more personnel would be needed if the interior ministry gets its way in securing more wide-ranging powers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.08.2006 germany plans tough measures for stopping terror on the web großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has become the favored medium of radical islamists since the september 11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states , the number of internet sites promoting violent jihad have soared .
germany wants to crack down on such sites and will change the law to do it . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has identified the internet as a " textbook " for terrorists and has announced that action will be taken to prevent the increasing number of manuals on bomb-making being made available online and block islamist forums espousing violent jihad . jörg ziercke , the president of the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- , has added his weight to schäuble 's calls by demanding that internet providers do more to stop such material from going online and is prepared to back stronger laws to enforce this .
at the moment , providers are not legally required to block users or remove content . experts believe that the power of the internet in the hands of terrorists should not be underestimated .
" there are enough reports from the police , the office for the protection of the constitution and news services that say that the internet is the most popular medium for communication between islamic groups , " said bernd carstensen , acting chairman of the federal alliance of german detectives -lrb- bdk -rrb- . estimates put the number of radical islamist web sites at around 5,000 , not including the many thousands of chatrooms in which terrorist groups and individuals keep in contact with each other . huge increase in islamist web presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror has spread on the web since sept .
11 , 2001 the menace is growing .
according to gabriel weimann , a communications expert in haifa and author of the book " terror on the internet , " there were only a dozen or so terrorist web pages online in 1998 .
since the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , experts point out that the terrorist presence on the internet has vastly expanded . terrorists have clearly discovered the huge potential for spreading propaganda online .
" as well as dominating most areas in society , the internet has also expanded the possibilities for radical groups , " said carstensen .
" since the internet offers the technical possibilities of chatrooms , forums and password-protected areas , it is an attractive proposition for terrorists .
they can remain anonymous and secure on the internet . " german police and secret services currently have limited powers to prosecute individuals or groups responsible for spreading islamic propaganda on the internet .
they have , however , filed a number of suits , although there are no official figures . new technology and training needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specially trained police officers would be needed according to the bdk , the police and security forces have teams of operatives monitoring the islamist presence on the internet , but more personnel would be needed if the interior ministry gets its way in securing more wide-ranging powers .
" these operatives would have to be specially trained to search for and analyze results in arabic , " says carstensen . these specialist teams would also have to have search technology that would allow them to reach the outer limits of the web that terrorists inhabit .
they would also need technology to efficiently record what they find .

the focus this year is likely to be high-definition tv and the growing battle between dvd formats . technophiles in berlin might think they have died and gone to high-tech heaven as they roam the aisles of the 46th ifa consumer electronics show in the country 's capital , the world 's largest .

the focus this year is likely to be high-definition tv and the growing battle between dvd formats . technophiles in berlin might think they have died and gone to high-tech heaven as they roam the aisles of the 46th ifa consumer electronics show in the country 's capital , the world 's largest .
exhibitors from 30 countries have come to show off their latest developments , with the next generation of televisions - high-definition tv -lrb- hdtv -rrb- with lcd and plasma screens - taking center stage . the arrival of hd-tv , high definition television , will mean that pictures will edge closer to cinema quality , and sound will come from eight channels instead of one or two .
the new , slim lcd and plasma sets are selling well here in germany , with sales up 30 percent on last year .
electronics retailers got an additional boost during this summer 's soccer world cup , when sales jumped further .
in western europe , an estimated 14 million hdtvs are expected to have been sold by the end of 2006 .

but the rocky start of the technology in the united states in recent weeks suggests the real european launch is still months away and this drama could continue for some time .
it almost certainly will not be resolved at the current show . mobile devices the industry is also registering healthy demand for mobile and hand-held devices .
more than 160 million mobile phones , navigation aids , mp3 players , notebooks and other portable devices were sold in europe in 2005 . " these are all categories that came to the market relatively recently and are displaying a dynamism , quite unlike what we were seeing five years ago , " said hans joachim kamp , head of germany 's consumer electronics trade association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making sure everything 's shiny ever year about 10,000 new consumer electronics products are released onto the market .
the ones that sell well generally have lots of features and boost the image of their owners . however , sales in germany dropped by one-and-a-half percent in the first six months of this year .
this was due largely to falling sales in it and telecommunications products .

31 deadline imposed by the un security council for suspending the program . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said he would not buckle in the face of mounting pressure , hours before the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog was expected to report tehran in defiance of the security council . " iran will not back down an inch in the face of intimidation , aggression and will not accept being deprived of its rights , " ahmadinejad said in a speech in northwestern iran on thursday . " the powers of oppression do not want iran to progress .
but i say to them : the iranian people , including young scientists who have succeeded with empty hands and without your help to reach the summits of nuclear technology , can also develop iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's elbaradei is expected to report tehran to the un the un security council has mandated that iran must suspend all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities by aug .

germany wants to crack down on such sites and will change the law to do it . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has identified the internet as a " textbook " for terrorists and has announced that action will be taken to prevent the increasing number of manuals on bomb-making being made available online and block islamist forums espousing violent jihad . jörg ziercke , the president of the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- , has added his weight to schäuble 's calls by demanding that internet providers do more to stop such material from going online and is prepared to back stronger laws to enforce this .
at the moment , providers are not legally required to block users or remove content . experts believe that the power of the internet in the hands of terrorists should not be underestimated .
" there are enough reports from the police , the office for the protection of the constitution and news services that say that the internet is the most popular medium for communication between islamic groups , " said bernd carstensen , acting chairman of the federal alliance of german detectives -lrb- bdk -rrb- . estimates put the number of radical islamist web sites at around 5,000 , not including the many thousands of chatrooms in which terrorist groups and individuals keep in contact with each other . huge increase in islamist web presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror has spread on the web since sept .
11 , 2001 the menace is growing .
according to gabriel weimann , a communications expert in haifa and author of the book " terror on the internet , " there were only a dozen or so terrorist web pages online in 1998 .
since the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , experts point out that the terrorist presence on the internet has vastly expanded . terrorists have clearly discovered the huge potential for spreading propaganda online .
" as well as dominating most areas in society , the internet has also expanded the possibilities for radical groups , " said carstensen .
" since the internet offers the technical possibilities of chatrooms , forums and password-protected areas , it is an attractive proposition for terrorists .
they can remain anonymous and secure on the internet . " german police and secret services currently have limited powers to prosecute individuals or groups responsible for spreading islamic propaganda on the internet .
they have , however , filed a number of suits , although there are no official figures . new technology and training needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specially trained police officers would be needed according to the bdk , the police and security forces have teams of operatives monitoring the islamist presence on the internet , but more personnel would be needed if the interior ministry gets its way in securing more wide-ranging powers .
" these operatives would have to be specially trained to search for and analyze results in arabic , " says carstensen . these specialist teams would also have to have search technology that would allow them to reach the outer limits of the web that terrorists inhabit .
they would also need technology to efficiently record what they find .
currently , screenshots and saved data are the only evidence .
when further investigation - and the confiscation of hard drives - is approved , sometimes after days or weeks , the incriminating data may have already disappeared . but the new laws the interior ministry are hoping for are by no means guaranteed .
a special meeting of state interior ministers on sept .
4 in berlin will address the possibility of granting powers like those in place in britain , where phone , video and internet monitoring are all part of the fight against terror . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german federal police see no acute terror danger at home after the arrest of three suspects in germany in connection with the plot to bomb german trains , the head of the country 's federal criminal police office says he sees no immediate danger of further attacks right now .

bavarian officials are calling it an " emergency solution . " homeschooling is illegal in germany , and yet the members of the fundamentalist christian sect " zwölf stämme " -lrb- twelve tribes -rrb- have won a victory of sorts in their fight to educate their children outside of germany 's state school system .
bavarian officials have agreed to let the group 's 32 school-aged children be taught by their own teachers in a private school - albeit one that is subject to state controls .
the school has initially been limited to a timeframe of one year . with the creation of the private school , a " years-long illegal situation has been ended , " said stefan rössle , district administrator for the region of donauwörth in bavaria . long battle with the law because of their religious convictions , parents in the twelve tribes community had been battling with state officials for over four years to keep their children out of state schools .
twelve tribes members take the bible 's teachings literally , and prefer to shield their children from some aspects of the modern world .
in homeschooling , for example , they teach the creation story , not the theory of evolution . but because homeschooling is not allowed in germany , the twelve tribes parents paid a high price for their resistance to state education .
over the years , they 've amassed some 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 167,000 -rrb- in unpaid fines , watched their children be forcibly enrolled in state schools , and stood by as one father was imprisoned for two weeks for his resistance .
through it all , they refused to bow to the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creation of the private school was an " emergency solution , " state officials said the result is a compromise solution .
the bavarian ministry of educational and cultural affairs has approved a curriculum for the group 's new private school in which sex education is absent , but where ethics , rather than religion , will be taught .
the parents can choose the teachers , but they have to foot the bill for the school themselves . " for us , the compromise was mainly about protecting the children 's right to an education , " said a ministry spokesperson . state still has control unlike homeschooling , the school will still be subject to state supervision .
state school officials have the right to visit the school at anytime and check on how lessons are being taught . " we will keep a very watchful eye on the project , " said rössle . green party politicians in the bavarian state parliament have criticized the compromise , saying the state is not acting in the children 's interest when it allows a " questionable religious community " the freedom to educate outside the state system . this latest example in bavaria highlights the difficult position state authorities are in when parents simply refuse to obey the law .

the school has initially been limited to a timeframe of one year . with the creation of the private school , a " years-long illegal situation has been ended , " said stefan rössle , district administrator for the region of donauwörth in bavaria . long battle with the law because of their religious convictions , parents in the twelve tribes community had been battling with state officials for over four years to keep their children out of state schools .
twelve tribes members take the bible 's teachings literally , and prefer to shield their children from some aspects of the modern world .
in homeschooling , for example , they teach the creation story , not the theory of evolution . but because homeschooling is not allowed in germany , the twelve tribes parents paid a high price for their resistance to state education .
over the years , they 've amassed some 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 167,000 -rrb- in unpaid fines , watched their children be forcibly enrolled in state schools , and stood by as one father was imprisoned for two weeks for his resistance .
through it all , they refused to bow to the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creation of the private school was an " emergency solution , " state officials said the result is a compromise solution .
the bavarian ministry of educational and cultural affairs has approved a curriculum for the group 's new private school in which sex education is absent , but where ethics , rather than religion , will be taught .
the parents can choose the teachers , but they have to foot the bill for the school themselves . " for us , the compromise was mainly about protecting the children 's right to an education , " said a ministry spokesperson . state still has control unlike homeschooling , the school will still be subject to state supervision .
state school officials have the right to visit the school at anytime and check on how lessons are being taught . " we will keep a very watchful eye on the project , " said rössle . green party politicians in the bavarian state parliament have criticized the compromise , saying the state is not acting in the children 's interest when it allows a " questionable religious community " the freedom to educate outside the state system . this latest example in bavaria highlights the difficult position state authorities are in when parents simply refuse to obey the law .
in recent months , there have been several incidents of homeschooling families clashing with truancy officials , mostly for religious reasons . their case histories are documented by several homeschooling initiatives in germany which are lobbying for greater educational freedom . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living room lessons not easy in germany opting to teach your kids at home instead of sending them to school is not an easy decision .

"
merkel and the jewish council president met wednesday to clear things up . german chancellor angela merkel met charlotte knobloch , the president of germany 's central council of jews , wednesday to address jewish anger over remarks made by overseas development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul about israel 's offensive in lebanon . merkel and knobloch , in the first meeting of its kind since the council 's president took office , discussed the situation of the jewish community in germany , the state of affairs in the middle east and germany 's cooperation with the united nations in stabilizing lebanon for over an hour . the meeting concluded with the chancellor reaffirming that the german government and the central council of jews had " a positive and trusting friendship .

she has continued to defend her comment and repeated her appeal for a general ban on carpet bombs . the central council of jews has accused wieczorek-zeul of stirring up anti-jewish sentiment in germany . jewish council critical of beirut visit knobloch has also attacked the development minister for visiting beirut last week as part of germany 's pledge to help rebuild lebanon following the devastating 34-day-long israeli offensive to rout hezbollah militia . " the least she could have done was to visit israel first .
she should have reached out first to the attacked , not the attackers , " said the council president . the council 's vice president , salomon korn , told the daily frankfurter rundschau , " the call for a un probe was another knee-jerk reaction from the minister towards israel . " if wieczorek-zeul wanted a un probe this should also take into account the fact that israeli citizens have for years come under rocket fire from lebanese soil , he added . the development minister said thursday on zdf 's " morgenmagazin " that she traveled to lebanon last weekend because germany is participating in rebuilding the country 's infrastructure .

though merkel urged restraint she did not join calls by other european leaders for an immediate ceasefire or criticize israel 's use of force as excessive . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said wednesday that germany believed it carries a historical responsibility towards the jewish state because of the holocaust , and said all government ministers respected this policy . wieczorek-zeul had not broken with it by calling for a un probe , nor was she anti-israeli , he added . she is a member of the social democrats , like foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , and is known for lashing out at human rights abuses regardless who may have committed them . steinmeier , who would like to help broker a long-term peace deal in the middle east , came in for criticism from the jewish council at the start of the war when he suggested that israel 's offensive might be disproportionate . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a german minister 's popular dissent on lebanon germany 's minister responsible for development aid has been a lone voice calling for an immediate ceasefire in lebanon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 31.08.2006 spanish minister says eu " lacks commitment " on immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain has called on the eu for more assistance with rescuing refugees the spanish deputy prime minister has criticized eu nations for the shortfall in assistance as spain struggles with huge numbers of refugees arriving on the canary islands from north africa . spanish deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega was in brussels wednesday to urge eu states to come to its aid in the struggle to contain the floods of illegal immigrants arriving on the canary islands from north africa .
de la vega followed up a trip on tuesday to current european union presidency holder finland by telling senior eu officials in brussels more had to be done and the bloc as a whole showed a " lack of commitment " in dealing with the problem .
the number of immigrants arriving in 2006 has exceeded the totals of previous years with about 19,000 refugees landing on the spanish islands to date , compared to the previous annual record of 9,900 , in 2002 .
the deputy prime minister stressed that spain could not deal with the constant flow from africa alone and madrid was " concerned at the slowness of certain initiatives . "
more refugee arrivals than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the influx of refugees has stretched spain 's resources according to canary islands authorities , in august alone over 4,700 refugees arrived on their shores , which is more than the total for 2005 .
three months ago de la vega forcibly put spain 's case forward but despite receiving air and sea surveillance assistance from the eu borders monitoring body frontex , the influx has continued unabated with the surveillance programme still not fully operational .
only finland , italy and portugal have so far committed patrol boats or surveillance planes to frontex , operating off mauritania , senegal and cape verde , joining spanish officials already working in the area .
after talks with de la vega , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said : " it is essential that all member states continue to show their political readiness to share the heavy burden which is now carried by a limited number of member states , which do their best to protect the eu external borders . "
frattini announced that the commission would set up a high-level working group on immigration and asylum issues , to be coordinated by de la vega , but acknowledged that " there is no quick fix . "
ineffective eu assistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masses of arrivals could cause a humanitarian crisis hindering frontex efforts further , one italian patrol boat , diciotti , has been stuck for 10 days in the southern spanish port of cadiz with engine trouble , while portugese counterpart baptista de andrade has been patrolling off cape verde for the past 10 days but has yet to report sightings of any illegal immigrants .
with the continual flow of arrivals , there has been increased political pressure on the spanish government , and with the canaries facing regional elections next year , the issue has become highly politicized .
nationally , the main conservative opposition popular party has lambasted the government as incompetent .
immigrants who survive torrid trips to the islands lasting upwards of 10 days are taken to overflowing reception camps and are then transferred to the mainland for up to 40 days , after which they are given an unenforceable document providing for their expulsion .
' ' humanitarian catastrophe " waiting to happen spain announced recently that 11,826 illegal arrivals had been transferred from the canary islands to the mainland since january .
most can not be repatriated in the absence of bilateral agreements with their homeland .
de la vega criticized eu partner states for their slowness in applying article 13 of the cotonou accord on repatriation of immigrants amid the reluctance to commit sufficient resources to the problem .
the canaries government had after monday 's arrivals called on eu states and the international community to help halt " a humanitarian catastrophe " , estimating some 490 would-be immigrants had died at sea this year . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks rapid reaction teams to deal with illegal immigrants the european commission has unveiled plans for rapid reaction teams of border guards to police europe 's frontiers , as spain and malta haggled over who should deal with a fresh wave of illegal immigrants .

de la vega followed up a trip on tuesday to current european union presidency holder finland by telling senior eu officials in brussels more had to be done and the bloc as a whole showed a " lack of commitment " in dealing with the problem .
the number of immigrants arriving in 2006 has exceeded the totals of previous years with about 19,000 refugees landing on the spanish islands to date , compared to the previous annual record of 9,900 , in 2002 .
the deputy prime minister stressed that spain could not deal with the constant flow from africa alone and madrid was " concerned at the slowness of certain initiatives . "
more refugee arrivals than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the influx of refugees has stretched spain 's resources according to canary islands authorities , in august alone over 4,700 refugees arrived on their shores , which is more than the total for 2005 .
three months ago de la vega forcibly put spain 's case forward but despite receiving air and sea surveillance assistance from the eu borders monitoring body frontex , the influx has continued unabated with the surveillance programme still not fully operational .
only finland , italy and portugal have so far committed patrol boats or surveillance planes to frontex , operating off mauritania , senegal and cape verde , joining spanish officials already working in the area .
after talks with de la vega , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said : " it is essential that all member states continue to show their political readiness to share the heavy burden which is now carried by a limited number of member states , which do their best to protect the eu external borders . "
frattini announced that the commission would set up a high-level working group on immigration and asylum issues , to be coordinated by de la vega , but acknowledged that " there is no quick fix . "
ineffective eu assistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masses of arrivals could cause a humanitarian crisis hindering frontex efforts further , one italian patrol boat , diciotti , has been stuck for 10 days in the southern spanish port of cadiz with engine trouble , while portugese counterpart baptista de andrade has been patrolling off cape verde for the past 10 days but has yet to report sightings of any illegal immigrants .
with the continual flow of arrivals , there has been increased political pressure on the spanish government , and with the canaries facing regional elections next year , the issue has become highly politicized .
nationally , the main conservative opposition popular party has lambasted the government as incompetent .
immigrants who survive torrid trips to the islands lasting upwards of 10 days are taken to overflowing reception camps and are then transferred to the mainland for up to 40 days , after which they are given an unenforceable document providing for their expulsion .
' ' humanitarian catastrophe " waiting to happen spain announced recently that 11,826 illegal arrivals had been transferred from the canary islands to the mainland since january .
most can not be repatriated in the absence of bilateral agreements with their homeland .
de la vega criticized eu partner states for their slowness in applying article 13 of the cotonou accord on repatriation of immigrants amid the reluctance to commit sufficient resources to the problem .
the canaries government had after monday 's arrivals called on eu states and the international community to help halt " a humanitarian catastrophe " , estimating some 490 would-be immigrants had died at sea this year . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks rapid reaction teams to deal with illegal immigrants the european commission has unveiled plans for rapid reaction teams of border guards to police europe 's frontiers , as spain and malta haggled over who should deal with a fresh wave of illegal immigrants .

germany 's education and research minister says the goal is 1.5 million new jobs in high-tech fields . ground-breaking research is n't the problem in germany , getting innovative products to the market is , according to annette schavan , minister for education and research .
on wednesday in berlin , she announced plans by the government to step up its investment in high-tech , with the aim to bring creative ideas out of the ivory tower and onto the commercial market . " in many areas , we are at the top in basic research , " she said .
" but in general , across technical fields , putting those ideas into practice does n't work frequently enough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan , federal minister of education and research schavan , a member of the conservative christian democrats , said many of germany 's good ideas get put away in a drawer somewhere or first get turned into money-making products abroad .
the minister said she wants to put the emphasis on scientific research which can lead to products or processes with commercial uses . " fields of innovation " most of the federal money will go to the aerospace and energy technology sectors , although substantial amounts will be directed toward health and medical research , environmental research as well as security technology for nuclear power plants .
all in all , schavan named 17 " fields of innovation , " which range from aerospace to traffic technology to nano- and biotechnology . the funding also includes award money so that small and medium-sized companies can get their research findings to market more quickly . " we also want to ensure that young scientists in this country realize their opportunities and make germany into a place where new talent is forged , " she said . industry groups and economic organizations had mostly praise for the new investment program , although some were critical that even more of the money set aside was not going into efforts to get products to market .

germany wants to crack down on such sites and will change the law to do it . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has identified the internet as a " textbook " for terrorists and has announced that action will be taken to prevent the increasing number of manuals on bomb-making being made available online and block islamist forums espousing violent jihad . jörg ziercke , the president of the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- , has added his weight to schäuble 's calls by demanding that internet providers do more to stop such material from going online and is prepared to back stronger laws to enforce this .
at the moment , providers are not legally required to block users or remove content . experts believe that the power of the internet in the hands of terrorists should not be underestimated .

" since the internet offers the technical possibilities of chatrooms , forums and password-protected areas , it is an attractive proposition for terrorists .

" these operatives would have to be specially trained to search for and analyze results in arabic , " says carstensen . these specialist teams would also have to have search technology that would allow them to reach the outer limits of the web that terrorists inhabit .
they would also need technology to efficiently record what they find .
currently , screenshots and saved data are the only evidence .

31 deadline imposed by the un security council for suspending the program . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said he would not buckle in the face of mounting pressure , hours before the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog was expected to report tehran in defiance of the security council . " iran will not back down an inch in the face of intimidation , aggression and will not accept being deprived of its rights , " ahmadinejad said in a speech in northwestern iran on thursday . " the powers of oppression do not want iran to progress .
but i say to them : the iranian people , including young scientists who have succeeded with empty hands and without your help to reach the summits of nuclear technology , can also develop iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's elbaradei is expected to report tehran to the un the un security council has mandated that iran must suspend all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities by aug .
31 , spurred by fears in the west that tehran is covertly seeking to make the atom bomb .
iran insists the program is aimed at producing electricity . report : west planning sanctions germany , the united states , france , and britain were reportedly drawing up plans for a three-stage system of international sanctions designed to force iran into compliance . the progressively tougher measures would begin with an embargo on the sale of nuclear-related materials and a limited travel ban for iranian officials , graduating to a broader travel ban and the freezing of overseas assets and then , if these measures fail , restrictions on commercial flights and world bank loans , the new york times reported . the five permanent members of the council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany , have sought to coax tehran into suspending enrichment by offering a package of security , trade and technology incentives . but russia and china have shown great reluctance even to threaten iran with sanctions . us undersecretary of state nicholas burns said on wednesday that he expected sanctions to be imposed within a month . " we believe the sanctions regime will be agreed to in september by the security council and we 're going to work towards that with a great deal of energy and termination , " he told cnn . us state department spokesman sean mccormack said senior officials from britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states would meet in europe early next week to begin discussing sanctions against iran if it is deemed to have flouted the un deadline . ahmadinejad appeals to european powers in an apparent attempt to drive a wedge between the united states and its european partners , president ahmadinejad called on europe to solve the row over iran 's nuclear program through negotiations and act independently of washington , the state-run irna news agency reported on thursday . " by adopting independent and logical policies , the europeans can change for the better the region 's attitude towards them .
the europeans should not follow wrong and aggressive us policies , since the us only thinks about itself , " ahmadinejad was quoted as saying . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopes for an alternative to sanctions in iran stand-off iran 's confident dismissal of the un threat of action caused widespread concern in the international community wednesday , while germany maintained that sanctions were far from definite .

the 63rd venice film festival originally wanted the first curtain to go up on director tom tykwer 's long-awaited movie adaptation of patrick süskind 's best-selling 1976 novel " perfume . " it would have been the first time a german film opened a major international film festival - apart from the time another tykwer film , " heaven , " opened the berlin film festival in 2002 - and it would have marked a neat closing of a circle for the ' wunderkind ' of german film who wowed critics and audiences when his " run , lola , run " enjoyed its international breakthrough here in 1998 . " a sore point " for venice - and for germany that it was n't to be has been described by festival head marco müller as a " sore point " for his program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd eichinger -lrb- l -rrb- , tom tykwer and lead actor dustin hoffman " it could have been the perfect opening competition movie , " he said . but producer bernd eichinger from constantin film chose not to subject " perfume " to the cut and thrust of the festival fray , instead announcing a german premiere in mid-september for what tykwer says will be promoted as a " specifically german " film despite being shot in english and featuring an international cast . germany 's gems with " perfume " therefore out of the running , it will be up to " black book , " a european co-production directed by paul verhoeven and shot in berlin 's babelsberg studios , to help germany to a golden or silver lion .
the tale of a resistance fighter in world war ii , it features german actors sebastian koch and christian berkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the first " heimat " series also taking the edge off germany 's disappointment is edgar reitz , in town with the fourth installment of his " heimat " epic .
it was in venice that he first unveiled his acclaimed series in 1984 , and he 's been grateful ever since . " there 's always been two sides to the festival , " he said .
" on the one hand there 's the whole showbiz glamour side to it , but at least venice has always done its best to make sure auteur films have a fair chance against more commercial entries . " there 's no shortage of the latter this year .
in the end , headlining the festival wednesday in place of " perfume " was a treatment of another literary classic , james ellroy 's " the black dahlia " directed by brian de palma and starring scarlett johansson .
venice has always been a draw for the glitterati , and other hollywood luminaries expected to tread the red carpet over the next nine days include catherine deneuve , anthony hopkins , sandra bullock and nicolas cage . the rome row it 's hoped the razzle-dazzle will put in the shade a bitter row that 's been simmering in venice ever since rome revealed its plans to launch its own film festival later this year .
it 's already announced its october opening will be graced by none other than nicole kidman , who 's always been a venice favorite . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are there just too many festivals these days ?
with an inadequate infrastructure that 's long put the city at a practical disadvantage compared to rival events in cannes and berlin , venice has good reason to fear it might be submerged by the " festa del cinema . "
it 's retaliating by pulling rank , with müller suggesting rome will only ever be able to secure films venice has rejected . venice mayor massimo cacciari has been equally dismissive .

germany 's education and research minister says the goal is 1.5 million new jobs in high-tech fields . ground-breaking research is n't the problem in germany , getting innovative products to the market is , according to annette schavan , minister for education and research .
on wednesday in berlin , she announced plans by the government to step up its investment in high-tech , with the aim to bring creative ideas out of the ivory tower and onto the commercial market . " in many areas , we are at the top in basic research , " she said .
" but in general , across technical fields , putting those ideas into practice does n't work frequently enough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan , federal minister of education and research schavan , a member of the conservative christian democrats , said many of germany 's good ideas get put away in a drawer somewhere or first get turned into money-making products abroad .
the minister said she wants to put the emphasis on scientific research which can lead to products or processes with commercial uses . " fields of innovation " most of the federal money will go to the aerospace and energy technology sectors , although substantial amounts will be directed toward health and medical research , environmental research as well as security technology for nuclear power plants .
all in all , schavan named 17 " fields of innovation , " which range from aerospace to traffic technology to nano- and biotechnology . the funding also includes award money so that small and medium-sized companies can get their research findings to market more quickly . " we also want to ensure that young scientists in this country realize their opportunities and make germany into a place where new talent is forged , " she said . industry groups and economic organizations had mostly praise for the new investment program , although some were critical that even more of the money set aside was not going into efforts to get products to market .
the association of the german electronic and electronics industry called on the government to keep its attention on turning technical ideas into reality , rather than just funding new research initiatives . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plans billion-euro investment in universities the german government plans to spend an additional 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- in research and development by the end of 2009 .

he considers the establishment of sustainable economic development in the region to be the greatest challenge in his new role , particularly in light of the impending transfer of authority in kosovo . the new unmik head is confident this can be achieved , but said that integrating kosovo into the larger markets in southeastern europe and the eu is essential . eco n omic i n tegratio n n ecessary for developme n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rücker has served for three years in the balkans " it 's very good that kosovo is a member of the regional energy league in southeastern europe , which links the regional energy markets , " rücker said .
" without integration , it wo n't work .
investment in the infrastructure - and especially private investment - is necessary .
the privatization program is contributing to this . " rücker , a 55-year-old native of the southwestern german state of baden-württemberg , brings practical experience in solving macro-economic problems .
as mayor of the town of sindelfingen from 1993 to 2001 , he managed to revamp the city 's budget , which had been burdened by heavy debts . " i think that this administrative experience in a town with difficulties is very important , " said franz-lothar altmann , an economic expert for southeastern europe at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" he has shown that he can lead a larger political entity , which is what kosovo is . " repairi n g eth n ic divisio n s in addition to the economic developments , rücker will have to contribute to ethnic conciliation between serbs and albanians in kosovo .
his goal is that , by the end of his mandate , all citizens will be represented through the elected institutions in the region and ethnic minorities will be active in social and political life . " unmik is mandated to administrate kosovo as a whole and structures that work against this can not be tolerated , " said rücker , referring to parallel administrative structures in the region that aim at dividing kosovo between the serbs and albanians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostilities in kosovo disrupted - and ended - many lives the implementation of standardized license plates is one example of efforts to promote political and ethnic cooperation , rücker said .
to enhance freedom of movement for all residents , unmik introduced license plates several years ago that do n't reveal which city the vehicle is from .
previously , nationalist street mobs had attacked returning refugees after identifying from the license plate where they came from . however , the newer standardized plates still are n't in use in serbian-dominated northern kosovo , because they are not officially recognized by neighboring serbia .
serbs from the north drive with serbian license plates or none at all .
they do n't dare to come south , and drivers from the south avoid heading north with standard plates . status decisio n expected by year 's e n d whether with license plates , ethnic reconciliation or economic development , rücker is aware that change wo n't come over night , he said . " it 's very important for us that the residents of kosovo have perspective , " he said .
" this will come with the beginning of the status negotiations , at the latest . " the negotiation process on kosovo 's ultimate political status is being chaired by finnish diplomat martti ahtisaari .
resolving kosovo 's status is a major factor in the stability of the region , rücker said . " we will do everything we can so that mr. ahtisaari and the contact group are able to stay on schedule , " he said .
" that means that they should be able to submit a final decision on kosovo 's status to the security council by the end of the year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.08.2006 germany plans tough measures for stopping terror on the web großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has become the favored medium of radical islamists since the september 11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states , the number of internet sites promoting violent jihad have soared .
germany wants to crack down on such sites and will change the law to do it . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has identified the internet as a " textbook " for terrorists and has announced that action will be taken to prevent the increasing number of manuals on bomb-making being made available online and block islamist forums espousing violent jihad . jörg ziercke , the president of the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- , has added his weight to schäuble 's calls by demanding that internet providers do more to stop such material from going online and is prepared to back stronger laws to enforce this .
at the moment , providers are not legally required to block users or remove content . experts believe that the power of the internet in the hands of terrorists should not be underestimated .
" there are enough reports from the police , the office for the protection of the constitution and news services that say that the internet is the most popular medium for communication between islamic groups , " said bernd carstensen , acting chairman of the federal alliance of german detectives -lrb- bdk -rrb- . estimates put the number of radical islamist web sites at around 5,000 , not including the many thousands of chatrooms in which terrorist groups and individuals keep in contact with each other . huge increase in islamist web presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror has spread on the web since sept .
11 , 2001 the menace is growing .
according to gabriel weimann , a communications expert in haifa and author of the book " terror on the internet , " there were only a dozen or so terrorist web pages online in 1998 .
since the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , experts point out that the terrorist presence on the internet has vastly expanded . terrorists have clearly discovered the huge potential for spreading propaganda online .
" as well as dominating most areas in society , the internet has also expanded the possibilities for radical groups , " said carstensen .
" since the internet offers the technical possibilities of chatrooms , forums and password-protected areas , it is an attractive proposition for terrorists .
they can remain anonymous and secure on the internet . " german police and secret services currently have limited powers to prosecute individuals or groups responsible for spreading islamic propaganda on the internet .
they have , however , filed a number of suits , although there are no official figures . new technology and training needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specially trained police officers would be needed according to the bdk , the police and security forces have teams of operatives monitoring the islamist presence on the internet , but more personnel would be needed if the interior ministry gets its way in securing more wide-ranging powers .
" these operatives would have to be specially trained to search for and analyze results in arabic , " says carstensen . these specialist teams would also have to have search technology that would allow them to reach the outer limits of the web that terrorists inhabit .
they would also need technology to efficiently record what they find .
currently , screenshots and saved data are the only evidence .
when further investigation - and the confiscation of hard drives - is approved , sometimes after days or weeks , the incriminating data may have already disappeared . but the new laws the interior ministry are hoping for are by no means guaranteed .
a special meeting of state interior ministers on sept .
4 in berlin will address the possibility of granting powers like those in place in britain , where phone , video and internet monitoring are all part of the fight against terror . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german federal police see no acute terror danger at home after the arrest of three suspects in germany in connection with the plot to bomb german trains , the head of the country 's federal criminal police office says he sees no immediate danger of further attacks right now .

the 63rd venice film festival originally wanted the first curtain to go up on director tom tykwer 's long-awaited movie adaptation of patrick süskind 's best-selling 1976 novel " perfume . " it would have been the first time a german film opened a major international film festival - apart from the time another tykwer film , " heaven , " opened the berlin film festival in 2002 - and it would have marked a neat closing of a circle for the ' wunderkind ' of german film who wowed critics and audiences when his " run , lola , run " enjoyed its international breakthrough here in 1998 . " a sore point " for venice - and for germany that it was n't to be has been described by festival head marco müller as a " sore point " for his program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd eichinger -lrb- l -rrb- , tom tykwer and lead actor dustin hoffman " it could have been the perfect opening competition movie , " he said . but producer bernd eichinger from constantin film chose not to subject " perfume " to the cut and thrust of the festival fray , instead announcing a german premiere in mid-september for what tykwer says will be promoted as a " specifically german " film despite being shot in english and featuring an international cast . germany 's gems with " perfume " therefore out of the running , it will be up to " black book , " a european co-production directed by paul verhoeven and shot in berlin 's babelsberg studios , to help germany to a golden or silver lion .

it was in venice that he first unveiled his acclaimed series in 1984 , and he 's been grateful ever since . " there 's always been two sides to the festival , " he said .
" on the one hand there 's the whole showbiz glamour side to it , but at least venice has always done its best to make sure auteur films have a fair chance against more commercial entries . " there 's no shortage of the latter this year .
in the end , headlining the festival wednesday in place of " perfume " was a treatment of another literary classic , james ellroy 's " the black dahlia " directed by brian de palma and starring scarlett johansson .
venice has always been a draw for the glitterati , and other hollywood luminaries expected to tread the red carpet over the next nine days include catherine deneuve , anthony hopkins , sandra bullock and nicolas cage . the rome row it 's hoped the razzle-dazzle will put in the shade a bitter row that 's been simmering in venice ever since rome revealed its plans to launch its own film festival later this year .

with an inadequate infrastructure that 's long put the city at a practical disadvantage compared to rival events in cannes and berlin , venice has good reason to fear it might be submerged by the " festa del cinema . "
it 's retaliating by pulling rank , with müller suggesting rome will only ever be able to secure films venice has rejected . venice mayor massimo cacciari has been equally dismissive .

bavarian officials are calling it an " emergency solution . " homeschooling is illegal in germany , and yet the members of the fundamentalist christian sect " zwölf stämme " -lrb- twelve tribes -rrb- have won a victory of sorts in their fight to educate their children outside of germany 's state school system .
bavarian officials have agreed to let the group 's 32 school-aged children be taught by their own teachers in a private school - albeit one that is subject to state controls .
the school has initially been limited to a timeframe of one year . with the creation of the private school , a " years-long illegal situation has been ended , " said stefan rössle , district administrator for the region of donauwörth in bavaria . long battle with the law because of their religious convictions , parents in the twelve tribes community had been battling with state officials for over four years to keep their children out of state schools .
twelve tribes members take the bible 's teachings literally , and prefer to shield their children from some aspects of the modern world .
in homeschooling , for example , they teach the creation story , not the theory of evolution . but because homeschooling is not allowed in germany , the twelve tribes parents paid a high price for their resistance to state education .
over the years , they 've amassed some 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 167,000 -rrb- in unpaid fines , watched their children be forcibly enrolled in state schools , and stood by as one father was imprisoned for two weeks for his resistance .

the bavarian ministry of educational and cultural affairs has approved a curriculum for the group 's new private school in which sex education is absent , but where ethics , rather than religion , will be taught .
the parents can choose the teachers , but they have to foot the bill for the school themselves . " for us , the compromise was mainly about protecting the children 's right to an education , " said a ministry spokesperson . state still has control unlike homeschooling , the school will still be subject to state supervision .
state school officials have the right to visit the school at anytime and check on how lessons are being taught . " we will keep a very watchful eye on the project , " said rössle . green party politicians in the bavarian state parliament have criticized the compromise , saying the state is not acting in the children 's interest when it allows a " questionable religious community " the freedom to educate outside the state system . this latest example in bavaria highlights the difficult position state authorities are in when parents simply refuse to obey the law .

he considers the establishment of sustainable economic development in the region to be the greatest challenge in his new role , particularly in light of the impending transfer of authority in kosovo . the new unmik head is confident this can be achieved , but said that integrating kosovo into the larger markets in southeastern europe and the eu is essential . eco n omic i n tegratio n n ecessary for developme n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rücker has served for three years in the balkans " it 's very good that kosovo is a member of the regional energy league in southeastern europe , which links the regional energy markets , " rücker said .
" without integration , it wo n't work .
investment in the infrastructure - and especially private investment - is necessary .
the privatization program is contributing to this . " rücker , a 55-year-old native of the southwestern german state of baden-württemberg , brings practical experience in solving macro-economic problems .
as mayor of the town of sindelfingen from 1993 to 2001 , he managed to revamp the city 's budget , which had been burdened by heavy debts . " i think that this administrative experience in a town with difficulties is very important , " said franz-lothar altmann , an economic expert for southeastern europe at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" he has shown that he can lead a larger political entity , which is what kosovo is . " repairi n g eth n ic divisio n s in addition to the economic developments , rücker will have to contribute to ethnic conciliation between serbs and albanians in kosovo .
his goal is that , by the end of his mandate , all citizens will be represented through the elected institutions in the region and ethnic minorities will be active in social and political life . " unmik is mandated to administrate kosovo as a whole and structures that work against this can not be tolerated , " said rücker , referring to parallel administrative structures in the region that aim at dividing kosovo between the serbs and albanians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostilities in kosovo disrupted - and ended - many lives the implementation of standardized license plates is one example of efforts to promote political and ethnic cooperation , rücker said .
to enhance freedom of movement for all residents , unmik introduced license plates several years ago that do n't reveal which city the vehicle is from .
previously , nationalist street mobs had attacked returning refugees after identifying from the license plate where they came from . however , the newer standardized plates still are n't in use in serbian-dominated northern kosovo , because they are not officially recognized by neighboring serbia .
serbs from the north drive with serbian license plates or none at all .
they do n't dare to come south , and drivers from the south avoid heading north with standard plates . status decisio n expected by year 's e n d whether with license plates , ethnic reconciliation or economic development , rücker is aware that change wo n't come over night , he said . " it 's very important for us that the residents of kosovo have perspective , " he said .
" this will come with the beginning of the status negotiations , at the latest . " the negotiation process on kosovo 's ultimate political status is being chaired by finnish diplomat martti ahtisaari .
resolving kosovo 's status is a major factor in the stability of the region , rücker said . " we will do everything we can so that mr. ahtisaari and the contact group are able to stay on schedule , " he said .
" that means that they should be able to submit a final decision on kosovo 's status to the security council by the end of the year .

bavarian officials are calling it an " emergency solution . " homeschooling is illegal in germany , and yet the members of the fundamentalist christian sect " zwölf stämme " -lrb- twelve tribes -rrb- have won a victory of sorts in their fight to educate their children outside of germany 's state school system .
bavarian officials have agreed to let the group 's 32 school-aged children be taught by their own teachers in a private school - albeit one that is subject to state controls .
the school has initially been limited to a timeframe of one year . with the creation of the private school , a " years-long illegal situation has been ended , " said stefan rössle , district administrator for the region of donauwörth in bavaria . long battle with the law because of their religious convictions , parents in the twelve tribes community had been battling with state officials for over four years to keep their children out of state schools .
twelve tribes members take the bible 's teachings literally , and prefer to shield their children from some aspects of the modern world .
in homeschooling , for example , they teach the creation story , not the theory of evolution . but because homeschooling is not allowed in germany , the twelve tribes parents paid a high price for their resistance to state education .
over the years , they 've amassed some 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 167,000 -rrb- in unpaid fines , watched their children be forcibly enrolled in state schools , and stood by as one father was imprisoned for two weeks for his resistance .
through it all , they refused to bow to the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creation of the private school was an " emergency solution , " state officials said the result is a compromise solution .
the bavarian ministry of educational and cultural affairs has approved a curriculum for the group 's new private school in which sex education is absent , but where ethics , rather than religion , will be taught .
the parents can choose the teachers , but they have to foot the bill for the school themselves . " for us , the compromise was mainly about protecting the children 's right to an education , " said a ministry spokesperson . state still has control unlike homeschooling , the school will still be subject to state supervision .
state school officials have the right to visit the school at anytime and check on how lessons are being taught . " we will keep a very watchful eye on the project , " said rössle . green party politicians in the bavarian state parliament have criticized the compromise , saying the state is not acting in the children 's interest when it allows a " questionable religious community " the freedom to educate outside the state system . this latest example in bavaria highlights the difficult position state authorities are in when parents simply refuse to obey the law .
in recent months , there have been several incidents of homeschooling families clashing with truancy officials , mostly for religious reasons . their case histories are documented by several homeschooling initiatives in germany which are lobbying for greater educational freedom . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living room lessons not easy in germany opting to teach your kids at home instead of sending them to school is not an easy decision .

bavarian officials are calling it an " emergency solution . " homeschooling is illegal in germany , and yet the members of the fundamentalist christian sect " zwölf stämme " -lrb- twelve tribes -rrb- have won a victory of sorts in their fight to educate their children outside of germany 's state school system .
bavarian officials have agreed to let the group 's 32 school-aged children be taught by their own teachers in a private school - albeit one that is subject to state controls .
the school has initially been limited to a timeframe of one year . with the creation of the private school , a " years-long illegal situation has been ended , " said stefan rössle , district administrator for the region of donauwörth in bavaria . long battle with the law because of their religious convictions , parents in the twelve tribes community had been battling with state officials for over four years to keep their children out of state schools .
twelve tribes members take the bible 's teachings literally , and prefer to shield their children from some aspects of the modern world .
in homeschooling , for example , they teach the creation story , not the theory of evolution . but because homeschooling is not allowed in germany , the twelve tribes parents paid a high price for their resistance to state education .
over the years , they 've amassed some 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 167,000 -rrb- in unpaid fines , watched their children be forcibly enrolled in state schools , and stood by as one father was imprisoned for two weeks for his resistance .
through it all , they refused to bow to the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creation of the private school was an " emergency solution , " state officials said the result is a compromise solution .

the 63rd venice film festival originally wanted the first curtain to go up on director tom tykwer 's long-awaited movie adaptation of patrick süskind 's best-selling 1976 novel " perfume . " it would have been the first time a german film opened a major international film festival - apart from the time another tykwer film , " heaven , " opened the berlin film festival in 2002 - and it would have marked a neat closing of a circle for the ' wunderkind ' of german film who wowed critics and audiences when his " run , lola , run " enjoyed its international breakthrough here in 1998 . " a sore point " for venice - and for germany that it was n't to be has been described by festival head marco müller as a " sore point " for his program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd eichinger -lrb- l -rrb- , tom tykwer and lead actor dustin hoffman " it could have been the perfect opening competition movie , " he said . but producer bernd eichinger from constantin film chose not to subject " perfume " to the cut and thrust of the festival fray , instead announcing a german premiere in mid-september for what tykwer says will be promoted as a " specifically german " film despite being shot in english and featuring an international cast . germany 's gems with " perfume " therefore out of the running , it will be up to " black book , " a european co-production directed by paul verhoeven and shot in berlin 's babelsberg studios , to help germany to a golden or silver lion .
the tale of a resistance fighter in world war ii , it features german actors sebastian koch and christian berkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the first " heimat " series also taking the edge off germany 's disappointment is edgar reitz , in town with the fourth installment of his " heimat " epic .
it was in venice that he first unveiled his acclaimed series in 1984 , and he 's been grateful ever since . " there 's always been two sides to the festival , " he said .
" on the one hand there 's the whole showbiz glamour side to it , but at least venice has always done its best to make sure auteur films have a fair chance against more commercial entries . " there 's no shortage of the latter this year .
in the end , headlining the festival wednesday in place of " perfume " was a treatment of another literary classic , james ellroy 's " the black dahlia " directed by brian de palma and starring scarlett johansson .
venice has always been a draw for the glitterati , and other hollywood luminaries expected to tread the red carpet over the next nine days include catherine deneuve , anthony hopkins , sandra bullock and nicolas cage . the rome row it 's hoped the razzle-dazzle will put in the shade a bitter row that 's been simmering in venice ever since rome revealed its plans to launch its own film festival later this year .
it 's already announced its october opening will be graced by none other than nicole kidman , who 's always been a venice favorite . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are there just too many festivals these days ?
with an inadequate infrastructure that 's long put the city at a practical disadvantage compared to rival events in cannes and berlin , venice has good reason to fear it might be submerged by the " festa del cinema . "
it 's retaliating by pulling rank , with müller suggesting rome will only ever be able to secure films venice has rejected . venice mayor massimo cacciari has been equally dismissive .
" venice against rome - that 's like truffaut against james bond , " he sneered . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " perfume " on its way to silver screen it took two decades but production of the movie version of " perfume , " the blockbuster novel by patrick süskind , has begun .

" the assessment by the lebanese government with the support of the un is that about $ 500 million will be needed for the forthcoming months , " said sweden 's state secretary at the foreign office , annika söders . it used to have one of the most flourishing economies in the middle east , but lebanon has now estimated damage inflicted by the offensive at $ 3.6 billion , with 130,000 homes , 80 bridges and 94 roads destroyed or damaged . aid agencies say the bombardment has left both the country 's infrastructure and economy in tatters . according to oxfam , it coincided with the harvest season and the agricultural sector has therefore been devastated . " beyond the piles of bricks and mortar lies the less visible tragedy of acres of ruined farmland and rotting crops , " said ceo jeremy hobbs on the bbc . immoral un humanitarian chief jan egeland was expected to appeal in stockholm for more money for mine clearance after accusing israel wednesday of conducting a " completely immoral " cluster bomb blitz just before the ceasefire went into effect that has left as many as 100,000 unexploded bomblets in south lebanon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 31.08.2006 spanish minister says eu " lacks commitment " on immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain has called on the eu for more assistance with rescuing refugees the spanish deputy prime minister has criticized eu nations for the shortfall in assistance as spain struggles with huge numbers of refugees arriving on the canary islands from north africa . spanish deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega was in brussels wednesday to urge eu states to come to its aid in the struggle to contain the floods of illegal immigrants arriving on the canary islands from north africa .
de la vega followed up a trip on tuesday to current european union presidency holder finland by telling senior eu officials in brussels more had to be done and the bloc as a whole showed a " lack of commitment " in dealing with the problem .
the number of immigrants arriving in 2006 has exceeded the totals of previous years with about 19,000 refugees landing on the spanish islands to date , compared to the previous annual record of 9,900 , in 2002 .
the deputy prime minister stressed that spain could not deal with the constant flow from africa alone and madrid was " concerned at the slowness of certain initiatives . "
more refugee arrivals than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the influx of refugees has stretched spain 's resources according to canary islands authorities , in august alone over 4,700 refugees arrived on their shores , which is more than the total for 2005 .
three months ago de la vega forcibly put spain 's case forward but despite receiving air and sea surveillance assistance from the eu borders monitoring body frontex , the influx has continued unabated with the surveillance programme still not fully operational .
only finland , italy and portugal have so far committed patrol boats or surveillance planes to frontex , operating off mauritania , senegal and cape verde , joining spanish officials already working in the area .
after talks with de la vega , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said : " it is essential that all member states continue to show their political readiness to share the heavy burden which is now carried by a limited number of member states , which do their best to protect the eu external borders . "
frattini announced that the commission would set up a high-level working group on immigration and asylum issues , to be coordinated by de la vega , but acknowledged that " there is no quick fix . "
ineffective eu assistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masses of arrivals could cause a humanitarian crisis hindering frontex efforts further , one italian patrol boat , diciotti , has been stuck for 10 days in the southern spanish port of cadiz with engine trouble , while portugese counterpart baptista de andrade has been patrolling off cape verde for the past 10 days but has yet to report sightings of any illegal immigrants .
with the continual flow of arrivals , there has been increased political pressure on the spanish government , and with the canaries facing regional elections next year , the issue has become highly politicized .
nationally , the main conservative opposition popular party has lambasted the government as incompetent .
immigrants who survive torrid trips to the islands lasting upwards of 10 days are taken to overflowing reception camps and are then transferred to the mainland for up to 40 days , after which they are given an unenforceable document providing for their expulsion .
' ' humanitarian catastrophe " waiting to happen spain announced recently that 11,826 illegal arrivals had been transferred from the canary islands to the mainland since january .
most can not be repatriated in the absence of bilateral agreements with their homeland .
de la vega criticized eu partner states for their slowness in applying article 13 of the cotonou accord on repatriation of immigrants amid the reluctance to commit sufficient resources to the problem .
the canaries government had after monday 's arrivals called on eu states and the international community to help halt " a humanitarian catastrophe " , estimating some 490 would-be immigrants had died at sea this year . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks rapid reaction teams to deal with illegal immigrants the european commission has unveiled plans for rapid reaction teams of border guards to police europe 's frontiers , as spain and malta haggled over who should deal with a fresh wave of illegal immigrants .

bavarian officials are calling it an " emergency solution . " homeschooling is illegal in germany , and yet the members of the fundamentalist christian sect " zwölf stämme " -lrb- twelve tribes -rrb- have won a victory of sorts in their fight to educate their children outside of germany 's state school system .
bavarian officials have agreed to let the group 's 32 school-aged children be taught by their own teachers in a private school - albeit one that is subject to state controls .
the school has initially been limited to a timeframe of one year . with the creation of the private school , a " years-long illegal situation has been ended , " said stefan rössle , district administrator for the region of donauwörth in bavaria . long battle with the law because of their religious convictions , parents in the twelve tribes community had been battling with state officials for over four years to keep their children out of state schools .
twelve tribes members take the bible 's teachings literally , and prefer to shield their children from some aspects of the modern world .
in homeschooling , for example , they teach the creation story , not the theory of evolution . but because homeschooling is not allowed in germany , the twelve tribes parents paid a high price for their resistance to state education .
over the years , they 've amassed some 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 167,000 -rrb- in unpaid fines , watched their children be forcibly enrolled in state schools , and stood by as one father was imprisoned for two weeks for his resistance .
through it all , they refused to bow to the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creation of the private school was an " emergency solution , " state officials said the result is a compromise solution .
the bavarian ministry of educational and cultural affairs has approved a curriculum for the group 's new private school in which sex education is absent , but where ethics , rather than religion , will be taught .
the parents can choose the teachers , but they have to foot the bill for the school themselves . " for us , the compromise was mainly about protecting the children 's right to an education , " said a ministry spokesperson . state still has control unlike homeschooling , the school will still be subject to state supervision .
state school officials have the right to visit the school at anytime and check on how lessons are being taught . " we will keep a very watchful eye on the project , " said rössle . green party politicians in the bavarian state parliament have criticized the compromise , saying the state is not acting in the children 's interest when it allows a " questionable religious community " the freedom to educate outside the state system . this latest example in bavaria highlights the difficult position state authorities are in when parents simply refuse to obey the law .
in recent months , there have been several incidents of homeschooling families clashing with truancy officials , mostly for religious reasons . their case histories are documented by several homeschooling initiatives in germany which are lobbying for greater educational freedom . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living room lessons not easy in germany opting to teach your kids at home instead of sending them to school is not an easy decision .

the focus this year is likely to be high-definition tv and the growing battle between dvd formats . technophiles in berlin might think they have died and gone to high-tech heaven as they roam the aisles of the 46th ifa consumer electronics show in the country 's capital , the world 's largest .
exhibitors from 30 countries have come to show off their latest developments , with the next generation of televisions - high-definition tv -lrb- hdtv -rrb- with lcd and plasma screens - taking center stage . the arrival of hd-tv , high definition television , will mean that pictures will edge closer to cinema quality , and sound will come from eight channels instead of one or two .
the new , slim lcd and plasma sets are selling well here in germany , with sales up 30 percent on last year .
electronics retailers got an additional boost during this summer 's soccer world cup , when sales jumped further .
in western europe , an estimated 14 million hdtvs are expected to have been sold by the end of 2006 . " those figures back up the forecasts of market analysts who say that the roll-out for hd-tv is going to be much faster than it was for color television in the days of black and white , " said rainer hecker , the chairman of germany 's society for consumer electronics . battle of the formats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost all the major industrial groups in the consumer electronics sector are at the ifa much attention at the show is likely to focus on the battle between rival optical-disc formats , blu-ray and hd-dvd , described by some as a 21st-century repeat of the vhs versus beta video tape formats . both insist they have found the perfect successor to today 's dvd movie discs , and will announce players , for sale in european stores , and the first releases of high-definition movies for european sale .
but the rocky start of the technology in the united states in recent weeks suggests the real european launch is still months away and this drama could continue for some time .
it almost certainly will not be resolved at the current show . mobile devices the industry is also registering healthy demand for mobile and hand-held devices .
more than 160 million mobile phones , navigation aids , mp3 players , notebooks and other portable devices were sold in europe in 2005 . " these are all categories that came to the market relatively recently and are displaying a dynamism , quite unlike what we were seeing five years ago , " said hans joachim kamp , head of germany 's consumer electronics trade association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making sure everything 's shiny ever year about 10,000 new consumer electronics products are released onto the market .
the ones that sell well generally have lots of features and boost the image of their owners . however , sales in germany dropped by one-and-a-half percent in the first six months of this year .
this was due largely to falling sales in it and telecommunications products .
but analysts are still confident the whole of the electronics industry will turn in a growth figure of four percent this year .
it is hoped the ifa will help kick-start that growth . the fair opens for consumers on friday .

31 deadline imposed by the un security council for suspending the program . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said he would not buckle in the face of mounting pressure , hours before the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog was expected to report tehran in defiance of the security council . " iran will not back down an inch in the face of intimidation , aggression and will not accept being deprived of its rights , " ahmadinejad said in a speech in northwestern iran on thursday . " the powers of oppression do not want iran to progress .

iran insists the program is aimed at producing electricity . report : west planning sanctions germany , the united states , france , and britain were reportedly drawing up plans for a three-stage system of international sanctions designed to force iran into compliance . the progressively tougher measures would begin with an embargo on the sale of nuclear-related materials and a limited travel ban for iranian officials , graduating to a broader travel ban and the freezing of overseas assets and then , if these measures fail , restrictions on commercial flights and world bank loans , the new york times reported . the five permanent members of the council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany , have sought to coax tehran into suspending enrichment by offering a package of security , trade and technology incentives . but russia and china have shown great reluctance even to threaten iran with sanctions . us undersecretary of state nicholas burns said on wednesday that he expected sanctions to be imposed within a month . " we believe the sanctions regime will be agreed to in september by the security council and we 're going to work towards that with a great deal of energy and termination , " he told cnn . us state department spokesman sean mccormack said senior officials from britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states would meet in europe early next week to begin discussing sanctions against iran if it is deemed to have flouted the un deadline . ahmadinejad appeals to european powers in an apparent attempt to drive a wedge between the united states and its european partners , president ahmadinejad called on europe to solve the row over iran 's nuclear program through negotiations and act independently of washington , the state-run irna news agency reported on thursday . " by adopting independent and logical policies , the europeans can change for the better the region 's attitude towards them .

germany wants to crack down on such sites and will change the law to do it . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has identified the internet as a " textbook " for terrorists and has announced that action will be taken to prevent the increasing number of manuals on bomb-making being made available online and block islamist forums espousing violent jihad . jörg ziercke , the president of the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- , has added his weight to schäuble 's calls by demanding that internet providers do more to stop such material from going online and is prepared to back stronger laws to enforce this .
at the moment , providers are not legally required to block users or remove content . experts believe that the power of the internet in the hands of terrorists should not be underestimated .
" there are enough reports from the police , the office for the protection of the constitution and news services that say that the internet is the most popular medium for communication between islamic groups , " said bernd carstensen , acting chairman of the federal alliance of german detectives -lrb- bdk -rrb- . estimates put the number of radical islamist web sites at around 5,000 , not including the many thousands of chatrooms in which terrorist groups and individuals keep in contact with each other . huge increase in islamist web presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror has spread on the web since sept .

since the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , experts point out that the terrorist presence on the internet has vastly expanded . terrorists have clearly discovered the huge potential for spreading propaganda online .
" as well as dominating most areas in society , the internet has also expanded the possibilities for radical groups , " said carstensen .
" since the internet offers the technical possibilities of chatrooms , forums and password-protected areas , it is an attractive proposition for terrorists .
they can remain anonymous and secure on the internet . " german police and secret services currently have limited powers to prosecute individuals or groups responsible for spreading islamic propaganda on the internet .
they have , however , filed a number of suits , although there are no official figures . new technology and training needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specially trained police officers would be needed according to the bdk , the police and security forces have teams of operatives monitoring the islamist presence on the internet , but more personnel would be needed if the interior ministry gets its way in securing more wide-ranging powers .
" these operatives would have to be specially trained to search for and analyze results in arabic , " says carstensen . these specialist teams would also have to have search technology that would allow them to reach the outer limits of the web that terrorists inhabit .
they would also need technology to efficiently record what they find .
currently , screenshots and saved data are the only evidence .
when further investigation - and the confiscation of hard drives - is approved , sometimes after days or weeks , the incriminating data may have already disappeared . but the new laws the interior ministry are hoping for are by no means guaranteed .

he considers the establishment of sustainable economic development in the region to be the greatest challenge in his new role , particularly in light of the impending transfer of authority in kosovo . the new unmik head is confident this can be achieved , but said that integrating kosovo into the larger markets in southeastern europe and the eu is essential . eco n omic i n tegratio n n ecessary for developme n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rücker has served for three years in the balkans " it 's very good that kosovo is a member of the regional energy league in southeastern europe , which links the regional energy markets , " rücker said .
" without integration , it wo n't work .
investment in the infrastructure - and especially private investment - is necessary .
the privatization program is contributing to this . " rücker , a 55-year-old native of the southwestern german state of baden-württemberg , brings practical experience in solving macro-economic problems .
as mayor of the town of sindelfingen from 1993 to 2001 , he managed to revamp the city 's budget , which had been burdened by heavy debts . " i think that this administrative experience in a town with difficulties is very important , " said franz-lothar altmann , an economic expert for southeastern europe at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" he has shown that he can lead a larger political entity , which is what kosovo is . " repairi n g eth n ic divisio n s in addition to the economic developments , rücker will have to contribute to ethnic conciliation between serbs and albanians in kosovo .
his goal is that , by the end of his mandate , all citizens will be represented through the elected institutions in the region and ethnic minorities will be active in social and political life . " unmik is mandated to administrate kosovo as a whole and structures that work against this can not be tolerated , " said rücker , referring to parallel administrative structures in the region that aim at dividing kosovo between the serbs and albanians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostilities in kosovo disrupted - and ended - many lives the implementation of standardized license plates is one example of efforts to promote political and ethnic cooperation , rücker said .
to enhance freedom of movement for all residents , unmik introduced license plates several years ago that do n't reveal which city the vehicle is from .
previously , nationalist street mobs had attacked returning refugees after identifying from the license plate where they came from . however , the newer standardized plates still are n't in use in serbian-dominated northern kosovo , because they are not officially recognized by neighboring serbia .
serbs from the north drive with serbian license plates or none at all .
they do n't dare to come south , and drivers from the south avoid heading north with standard plates . status decisio n expected by year 's e n d whether with license plates , ethnic reconciliation or economic development , rücker is aware that change wo n't come over night , he said . " it 's very important for us that the residents of kosovo have perspective , " he said .
" this will come with the beginning of the status negotiations , at the latest . " the negotiation process on kosovo 's ultimate political status is being chaired by finnish diplomat martti ahtisaari .
resolving kosovo 's status is a major factor in the stability of the region , rücker said . " we will do everything we can so that mr. ahtisaari and the contact group are able to stay on schedule , " he said .
" that means that they should be able to submit a final decision on kosovo 's status to the security council by the end of the year .

de la vega followed up a trip on tuesday to current european union presidency holder finland by telling senior eu officials in brussels more had to be done and the bloc as a whole showed a " lack of commitment " in dealing with the problem .
the number of immigrants arriving in 2006 has exceeded the totals of previous years with about 19,000 refugees landing on the spanish islands to date , compared to the previous annual record of 9,900 , in 2002 .
the deputy prime minister stressed that spain could not deal with the constant flow from africa alone and madrid was " concerned at the slowness of certain initiatives . "
more refugee arrivals than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the influx of refugees has stretched spain 's resources according to canary islands authorities , in august alone over 4,700 refugees arrived on their shores , which is more than the total for 2005 .
three months ago de la vega forcibly put spain 's case forward but despite receiving air and sea surveillance assistance from the eu borders monitoring body frontex , the influx has continued unabated with the surveillance programme still not fully operational .
only finland , italy and portugal have so far committed patrol boats or surveillance planes to frontex , operating off mauritania , senegal and cape verde , joining spanish officials already working in the area .
after talks with de la vega , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said : " it is essential that all member states continue to show their political readiness to share the heavy burden which is now carried by a limited number of member states , which do their best to protect the eu external borders . "
frattini announced that the commission would set up a high-level working group on immigration and asylum issues , to be coordinated by de la vega , but acknowledged that " there is no quick fix . "
ineffective eu assistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masses of arrivals could cause a humanitarian crisis hindering frontex efforts further , one italian patrol boat , diciotti , has been stuck for 10 days in the southern spanish port of cadiz with engine trouble , while portugese counterpart baptista de andrade has been patrolling off cape verde for the past 10 days but has yet to report sightings of any illegal immigrants .
with the continual flow of arrivals , there has been increased political pressure on the spanish government , and with the canaries facing regional elections next year , the issue has become highly politicized .
nationally , the main conservative opposition popular party has lambasted the government as incompetent .
immigrants who survive torrid trips to the islands lasting upwards of 10 days are taken to overflowing reception camps and are then transferred to the mainland for up to 40 days , after which they are given an unenforceable document providing for their expulsion .
' ' humanitarian catastrophe " waiting to happen spain announced recently that 11,826 illegal arrivals had been transferred from the canary islands to the mainland since january .
most can not be repatriated in the absence of bilateral agreements with their homeland .
de la vega criticized eu partner states for their slowness in applying article 13 of the cotonou accord on repatriation of immigrants amid the reluctance to commit sufficient resources to the problem .
the canaries government had after monday 's arrivals called on eu states and the international community to help halt " a humanitarian catastrophe " , estimating some 490 would-be immigrants had died at sea this year . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks rapid reaction teams to deal with illegal immigrants the european commission has unveiled plans for rapid reaction teams of border guards to police europe 's frontiers , as spain and malta haggled over who should deal with a fresh wave of illegal immigrants .

de la vega followed up a trip on tuesday to current european union presidency holder finland by telling senior eu officials in brussels more had to be done and the bloc as a whole showed a " lack of commitment " in dealing with the problem .
the number of immigrants arriving in 2006 has exceeded the totals of previous years with about 19,000 refugees landing on the spanish islands to date , compared to the previous annual record of 9,900 , in 2002 .
the deputy prime minister stressed that spain could not deal with the constant flow from africa alone and madrid was " concerned at the slowness of certain initiatives . "
more refugee arrivals than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the influx of refugees has stretched spain 's resources according to canary islands authorities , in august alone over 4,700 refugees arrived on their shores , which is more than the total for 2005 .
three months ago de la vega forcibly put spain 's case forward but despite receiving air and sea surveillance assistance from the eu borders monitoring body frontex , the influx has continued unabated with the surveillance programme still not fully operational .
only finland , italy and portugal have so far committed patrol boats or surveillance planes to frontex , operating off mauritania , senegal and cape verde , joining spanish officials already working in the area .
after talks with de la vega , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said : " it is essential that all member states continue to show their political readiness to share the heavy burden which is now carried by a limited number of member states , which do their best to protect the eu external borders . "
frattini announced that the commission would set up a high-level working group on immigration and asylum issues , to be coordinated by de la vega , but acknowledged that " there is no quick fix . "
ineffective eu assistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masses of arrivals could cause a humanitarian crisis hindering frontex efforts further , one italian patrol boat , diciotti , has been stuck for 10 days in the southern spanish port of cadiz with engine trouble , while portugese counterpart baptista de andrade has been patrolling off cape verde for the past 10 days but has yet to report sightings of any illegal immigrants .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.08.2006 germany plans tough measures for stopping terror on the web großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has become the favored medium of radical islamists since the september 11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states , the number of internet sites promoting violent jihad have soared .
germany wants to crack down on such sites and will change the law to do it . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has identified the internet as a " textbook " for terrorists and has announced that action will be taken to prevent the increasing number of manuals on bomb-making being made available online and block islamist forums espousing violent jihad . jörg ziercke , the president of the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- , has added his weight to schäuble 's calls by demanding that internet providers do more to stop such material from going online and is prepared to back stronger laws to enforce this .
at the moment , providers are not legally required to block users or remove content . experts believe that the power of the internet in the hands of terrorists should not be underestimated .
" there are enough reports from the police , the office for the protection of the constitution and news services that say that the internet is the most popular medium for communication between islamic groups , " said bernd carstensen , acting chairman of the federal alliance of german detectives -lrb- bdk -rrb- . estimates put the number of radical islamist web sites at around 5,000 , not including the many thousands of chatrooms in which terrorist groups and individuals keep in contact with each other . huge increase in islamist web presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror has spread on the web since sept .
11 , 2001 the menace is growing .
according to gabriel weimann , a communications expert in haifa and author of the book " terror on the internet , " there were only a dozen or so terrorist web pages online in 1998 .
since the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , experts point out that the terrorist presence on the internet has vastly expanded . terrorists have clearly discovered the huge potential for spreading propaganda online .
" as well as dominating most areas in society , the internet has also expanded the possibilities for radical groups , " said carstensen .
" since the internet offers the technical possibilities of chatrooms , forums and password-protected areas , it is an attractive proposition for terrorists .
they can remain anonymous and secure on the internet . " german police and secret services currently have limited powers to prosecute individuals or groups responsible for spreading islamic propaganda on the internet .
they have , however , filed a number of suits , although there are no official figures . new technology and training needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specially trained police officers would be needed according to the bdk , the police and security forces have teams of operatives monitoring the islamist presence on the internet , but more personnel would be needed if the interior ministry gets its way in securing more wide-ranging powers .
" these operatives would have to be specially trained to search for and analyze results in arabic , " says carstensen . these specialist teams would also have to have search technology that would allow them to reach the outer limits of the web that terrorists inhabit .
they would also need technology to efficiently record what they find .
currently , screenshots and saved data are the only evidence .
when further investigation - and the confiscation of hard drives - is approved , sometimes after days or weeks , the incriminating data may have already disappeared . but the new laws the interior ministry are hoping for are by no means guaranteed .
a special meeting of state interior ministers on sept .
4 in berlin will address the possibility of granting powers like those in place in britain , where phone , video and internet monitoring are all part of the fight against terror . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german federal police see no acute terror danger at home after the arrest of three suspects in germany in connection with the plot to bomb german trains , the head of the country 's federal criminal police office says he sees no immediate danger of further attacks right now .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan , federal minister of education and research schavan , a member of the conservative christian democrats , said many of germany 's good ideas get put away in a drawer somewhere or first get turned into money-making products abroad .
the minister said she wants to put the emphasis on scientific research which can lead to products or processes with commercial uses . " fields of innovation " most of the federal money will go to the aerospace and energy technology sectors , although substantial amounts will be directed toward health and medical research , environmental research as well as security technology for nuclear power plants .
all in all , schavan named 17 " fields of innovation , " which range from aerospace to traffic technology to nano- and biotechnology . the funding also includes award money so that small and medium-sized companies can get their research findings to market more quickly . " we also want to ensure that young scientists in this country realize their opportunities and make germany into a place where new talent is forged , " she said . industry groups and economic organizations had mostly praise for the new investment program , although some were critical that even more of the money set aside was not going into efforts to get products to market .

de la vega followed up a trip on tuesday to current european union presidency holder finland by telling senior eu officials in brussels more had to be done and the bloc as a whole showed a " lack of commitment " in dealing with the problem .
the number of immigrants arriving in 2006 has exceeded the totals of previous years with about 19,000 refugees landing on the spanish islands to date , compared to the previous annual record of 9,900 , in 2002 .
the deputy prime minister stressed that spain could not deal with the constant flow from africa alone and madrid was " concerned at the slowness of certain initiatives . "
more refugee arrivals than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the influx of refugees has stretched spain 's resources according to canary islands authorities , in august alone over 4,700 refugees arrived on their shores , which is more than the total for 2005 .
three months ago de la vega forcibly put spain 's case forward but despite receiving air and sea surveillance assistance from the eu borders monitoring body frontex , the influx has continued unabated with the surveillance programme still not fully operational .
only finland , italy and portugal have so far committed patrol boats or surveillance planes to frontex , operating off mauritania , senegal and cape verde , joining spanish officials already working in the area .
after talks with de la vega , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said : " it is essential that all member states continue to show their political readiness to share the heavy burden which is now carried by a limited number of member states , which do their best to protect the eu external borders . "
frattini announced that the commission would set up a high-level working group on immigration and asylum issues , to be coordinated by de la vega , but acknowledged that " there is no quick fix . "
ineffective eu assistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masses of arrivals could cause a humanitarian crisis hindering frontex efforts further , one italian patrol boat , diciotti , has been stuck for 10 days in the southern spanish port of cadiz with engine trouble , while portugese counterpart baptista de andrade has been patrolling off cape verde for the past 10 days but has yet to report sightings of any illegal immigrants .
with the continual flow of arrivals , there has been increased political pressure on the spanish government , and with the canaries facing regional elections next year , the issue has become highly politicized .
nationally , the main conservative opposition popular party has lambasted the government as incompetent .
immigrants who survive torrid trips to the islands lasting upwards of 10 days are taken to overflowing reception camps and are then transferred to the mainland for up to 40 days , after which they are given an unenforceable document providing for their expulsion .
' ' humanitarian catastrophe " waiting to happen spain announced recently that 11,826 illegal arrivals had been transferred from the canary islands to the mainland since january .
most can not be repatriated in the absence of bilateral agreements with their homeland .
de la vega criticized eu partner states for their slowness in applying article 13 of the cotonou accord on repatriation of immigrants amid the reluctance to commit sufficient resources to the problem .
the canaries government had after monday 's arrivals called on eu states and the international community to help halt " a humanitarian catastrophe " , estimating some 490 would-be immigrants had died at sea this year . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks rapid reaction teams to deal with illegal immigrants the european commission has unveiled plans for rapid reaction teams of border guards to police europe 's frontiers , as spain and malta haggled over who should deal with a fresh wave of illegal immigrants .

31 deadline imposed by the un security council for suspending the program . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said he would not buckle in the face of mounting pressure , hours before the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog was expected to report tehran in defiance of the security council . " iran will not back down an inch in the face of intimidation , aggression and will not accept being deprived of its rights , " ahmadinejad said in a speech in northwestern iran on thursday . " the powers of oppression do not want iran to progress .
but i say to them : the iranian people , including young scientists who have succeeded with empty hands and without your help to reach the summits of nuclear technology , can also develop iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's elbaradei is expected to report tehran to the un the un security council has mandated that iran must suspend all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities by aug .
31 , spurred by fears in the west that tehran is covertly seeking to make the atom bomb .
iran insists the program is aimed at producing electricity . report : west planning sanctions germany , the united states , france , and britain were reportedly drawing up plans for a three-stage system of international sanctions designed to force iran into compliance . the progressively tougher measures would begin with an embargo on the sale of nuclear-related materials and a limited travel ban for iranian officials , graduating to a broader travel ban and the freezing of overseas assets and then , if these measures fail , restrictions on commercial flights and world bank loans , the new york times reported . the five permanent members of the council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany , have sought to coax tehran into suspending enrichment by offering a package of security , trade and technology incentives . but russia and china have shown great reluctance even to threaten iran with sanctions . us undersecretary of state nicholas burns said on wednesday that he expected sanctions to be imposed within a month . " we believe the sanctions regime will be agreed to in september by the security council and we 're going to work towards that with a great deal of energy and termination , " he told cnn . us state department spokesman sean mccormack said senior officials from britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states would meet in europe early next week to begin discussing sanctions against iran if it is deemed to have flouted the un deadline . ahmadinejad appeals to european powers in an apparent attempt to drive a wedge between the united states and its european partners , president ahmadinejad called on europe to solve the row over iran 's nuclear program through negotiations and act independently of washington , the state-run irna news agency reported on thursday . " by adopting independent and logical policies , the europeans can change for the better the region 's attitude towards them .
the europeans should not follow wrong and aggressive us policies , since the us only thinks about itself , " ahmadinejad was quoted as saying . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopes for an alternative to sanctions in iran stand-off iran 's confident dismissal of the un threat of action caused widespread concern in the international community wednesday , while germany maintained that sanctions were far from definite .

exhibitors from 30 countries have come to show off their latest developments , with the next generation of televisions - high-definition tv -lrb- hdtv -rrb- with lcd and plasma screens - taking center stage . the arrival of hd-tv , high definition television , will mean that pictures will edge closer to cinema quality , and sound will come from eight channels instead of one or two .

germany 's education and research minister says the goal is 1.5 million new jobs in high-tech fields . ground-breaking research is n't the problem in germany , getting innovative products to the market is , according to annette schavan , minister for education and research .
on wednesday in berlin , she announced plans by the government to step up its investment in high-tech , with the aim to bring creative ideas out of the ivory tower and onto the commercial market . " in many areas , we are at the top in basic research , " she said .
" but in general , across technical fields , putting those ideas into practice does n't work frequently enough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan , federal minister of education and research schavan , a member of the conservative christian democrats , said many of germany 's good ideas get put away in a drawer somewhere or first get turned into money-making products abroad .
the minister said she wants to put the emphasis on scientific research which can lead to products or processes with commercial uses . " fields of innovation " most of the federal money will go to the aerospace and energy technology sectors , although substantial amounts will be directed toward health and medical research , environmental research as well as security technology for nuclear power plants .
all in all , schavan named 17 " fields of innovation , " which range from aerospace to traffic technology to nano- and biotechnology . the funding also includes award money so that small and medium-sized companies can get their research findings to market more quickly . " we also want to ensure that young scientists in this country realize their opportunities and make germany into a place where new talent is forged , " she said . industry groups and economic organizations had mostly praise for the new investment program , although some were critical that even more of the money set aside was not going into efforts to get products to market .
the association of the german electronic and electronics industry called on the government to keep its attention on turning technical ideas into reality , rather than just funding new research initiatives . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plans billion-euro investment in universities the german government plans to spend an additional 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- in research and development by the end of 2009 .

" please , do not believe in the myth of an anti-semitic , homophobic , xenophobic poland .
please , come to poland , " he said in brussels after talks with european commission president jose manuel barroso . since he came to office last month , kaczynski 's government has appeared isolationist and has raised eyebrows in the eu with its hard-line attitude toward homosexuals , jews and the death penalty . " i can not mention any specific names here but i can tell you that in poland there are homosexuals who take very high positions on the polish political scene , and they also come from the right-wing parties , " he told reporters . " when it comes to anti-semitism , we have certain provisions in poland so that you can not use anti-semitic language , " he said . redressing the balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leader of poland 's conservative law and justice party , jaroslaw kaczynski , does n't usually mince words on arriving for his one-day visit , kaczynski , the twin brother of polish president lech kaczynski , said he was determined to clear up " misunderstandings " about his country 's commitment to the european union . poland joined the bloc in the " big bang " enlargement in may 2004 that saw the eu grow from 15 to 25 member states . " i am convinced that we will dissipate these misunderstandings and that this evening things will be better , " he told reporters traveling with him . " of course , we have our own expectations and our opinions and these sometimes differ from those of other countries , but we are a normal and loyal member of this organization , and we 'll do everything to ensure it has a great future in front of it , " he said . sensitive matters in july , all of poland 's former foreign ministers since the fall of communism in 1989 wrote a letter to condemn his brother 's behavior as " damaging to the interests of poland " and dismissive of its eu partners .
the letter was made public after the president appeared to snub a summit with german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac . at their joint press conference , barroso said he had raised a number of " sensitive matters " with kaczynski about poland 's attitude toward issues ranging from the death penalty to the independence of the central bank . he said he had been satisfied with the response . " i do n't take decisions based on comment , i take decisions based on facts and i think the facts will show poland 's commitment to european values , " barroso said .
" i really believe that poland is a crucially important country for the success of the european project .
i also believe that the european union is crucial for the future of poland and the well-being of the polish people . " warnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demanding equal rights for homosexuals in poland interrupted lech kaczynski speaking in berlin in march kaczynski was due later wednesday to hold talks with josep borrell , the president of the european parliament , whose lawmakers adopted in june a resolution condemning " the general rise in racist , xenophobic , anti-semitic and homophobic intolerance in poland . " kaczynski could also come under fire over an initiative launched by the extreme-right league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , a junior partner in his coalition government , to collect half a million signatures of eu citizens on a petition demanding the death penalty for pedophile-murderers . that move has already drawn a swift rebuff from the commission .
the eu 's executive body has said that capital punishment " is not compatible with european law or european values . " in a sign he was listening to some eu warnings , the polish premier said his government would send on thursday a " project paper " to the commission to better explain its controversial state aid to three key shipyards . brussels has warned that it expects the polish authorities to clarify by the end of the month its restructuring plans for the gdansk , gdynia and szczecin yards , the country 's biggest and which employ around 16,000 people . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish president 's twin brother becomes prime minister the surprise announcement that the president 's twin , jaroslaw kaczynski , is to be sworn in monday as prime minister has pushed down the value of the polish currency and raised concerns over poland 's nationalist shift .

ching cheong , who was the chief china correspondent for singapore 's straits times , has been in detention since april 2005 .
chinese officials accuse him of buying information and passing it to taiwan 's intelligence services over a period of five years from mid-2000 to march 2005 .
both his family and his employers reject the charges .

china sees taiwan as its territory , threatening to use force if the island moves towards formal independence .

ching cheong , who was the chief china correspondent for singapore 's straits times , has been in detention since april 2005 .
chinese officials accuse him of buying information and passing it to taiwan 's intelligence services over a period of five years from mid-2000 to march 2005 .
both his family and his employers reject the charges .
ching is the first hong kong journalist to have been charged with spying since china resumed sovereignty over the territory in 1997 .
the maximum penalty for espionage in china is death .
china and taiwan are believed to actively spy on each other .
china sees taiwan as its territory , threatening to use force if the island moves towards formal independence .
' very unfair ' ching was put on trial behind closed doors two weeks ago .
no information has been received about what was said inside the courtroom , but state news agency xinhua reported on thursday that ching had been sentenced to five years in jail .
china has also jailed zhao yan -lrb- image : new york times -rrb- " we think it 's very unfair , because from the beginning to the end nobody knew what happened , " james lung , coordinator of the hong kong-based rescue ching cheong alliance , told the french news agency afp .
ching was arrested in the southern chinese city of guangzhou in april 2005 .
the state-run xinhua news agency said that he confessed to gathering information about chinese political , economic and military affairs , to pass to taiwanese intelligence officials .
but his supporters insist he is innocent of the charge .
his wife mary lau said he was in guangzhou collecting secret papers linked to the former chinese leader , zhao ziyang , who was ousted for opposing the suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators in tiananmen square in 1989 .
she has reportedly suggested her husband was set up by an unnamed intermediary .

the £ 1.1m , 18-month pilot has been live for three weeks and is backed by the east of england development agency and run by norfolk county council -lrb- ncc -rrb- .
paul adams , from the council who run the service : " it allows people to see the benefit of wireless technology . "
the city centre , county hall and educational establishments such as the university all have wi-fi access .
mr adams , director of corporate resources and cultural services , said : " the original idea was to use it as a demonstration project - to wireless-enable a significant part of the city so we could begin to see what the benefits were in terms of economic development , benefit for the public and public services workers . "
" we do n't know what will happen when the project ends .
technology may have moved on " paul adams more than 200 antennas are positioned around the city , mainly on lampposts , creating blanket wi-fi coverage .
the city is one giant hotspot , utilising a mesh network which means users can get seamless internet access as they wander the streets .
kurt frary , who managed the project at the local authority said : " as a mesh network , if one of the lamppost aerials were to fail , the whole system will compensate to find a way through .
' glitch free ' " we had 1,800 connections in the first week , more than 2,500 in the second and 3,000 in the third .
" it 's been glitch free so far - we have had very few technical problems . "
the network has two speeds - 256kbps for the public and 1mbps for public sector workers - which are slower than typical broadband speeds found in the home .
" the one thing we do n't want to do is compete with commercial companies , " said mr adams .
" we have a speed of 256kbps in order to not compete with wireless hotspots .
but they are still relatively small in a place like norwich . "
users are also limited to a one-hour session and have to reconnect after 60 minutes .
people access the wi-fi simply by agreeing to terms and conditions on a portal page that their web browser will point towards when a connection is made between a device and the network . "
we would advise people to use the same precautions as you would at home " kurt frary , norfolk county council " we designed the portal to be as accessible to as many different wi-fi devices as possible , " said mr frary .
he added : " there are now so many devices that have wi-fi - from laptops , to pdas , playstation portables , mobile phones and even games consoles . "
as an unsecured wi-fi network there are security implications for people considering using the internet access to exchange sensitive information .
' safe as possible ' mr frary said : " we would advise people to use the same precautions as you would at home - using a firewall and anti-virus software .
" for business users we recommend using a vpn -lrb- virtual private network -rrb- to be as safe as possible . "
mr adams said the local authority was interested to see how people used the network .
" what we want to explore is the potential for public service workers out and about to save coming back to offices and to link into information systems back at their base .
" a lot of public service work does go on in or around people 's homes , particularly in such areas as care work .
" another application being explored is mobile cctv . "
mr adams said early figures showed high usage around the university of east anglia , the college in the city and the central library .
" educational use , student use and the virtual learning environment is going to be a big use , " he said , he added : " we are going to be fascinated to see how it grows , where it goes .
as time goes on we will do more research on how people are using it and what applications are going on .
" we do n't know what will happen when the project ends .

the £ 1.1m , 18-month pilot has been live for three weeks and is backed by the east of england development agency and run by norfolk county council -lrb- ncc -rrb- .
paul adams , from the council who run the service : " it allows people to see the benefit of wireless technology . "
the city centre , county hall and educational establishments such as the university all have wi-fi access .
mr adams , director of corporate resources and cultural services , said : " the original idea was to use it as a demonstration project - to wireless-enable a significant part of the city so we could begin to see what the benefits were in terms of economic development , benefit for the public and public services workers .

we do n't know what will happen when the project ends .
technology may have moved on paul adams more than 200 antennas are positioned around the city , mainly on lampposts , creating blanket wi-fi coverage .
the city is one giant hotspot , utilising a mesh network which means users can get seamless internet access as they wander the streets .
kurt frary , who managed the project at the local authority said : " as a mesh network , if one of the lamppost aerials were to fail , the whole system will compensate to find a way through .
' glitch free ' " we had 1,800 connections in the first week , more than 2,500 in the second and 3,000 in the third .
the council says it does not want to impact on commercial services " it 's been glitch free so far - we have had very few technical problems . "
the network has two speeds - 256kbps for the public and 1mbps for public sector workers - which are slower than typical broadband speeds found in the home .
" the one thing we do n't want to do is compete with commercial companies , " said mr adams .
" we have a speed of 256kbps in order to not compete with wireless hotspots .

demand for flat screen tvs , mp3 players and digital and hd tv equipment shows little sign of abating , analysts at the show said ahead of its opening .
for many , continued high demand has raised the stakes in berlin .
" the industry will continue on the road to digital convergence , but i do n't expect major new products , " said jurgen smit , of dutch retailer polectro .
instead , attention at the ifa show is likely to fall on the growing battle between rival hd video formats .
philips is backing the blu-ray format , which goes head to head with rival system hd-dvd .
analyst screen digest recently predicted that the battle between formats to win over consumers would end in stalemate and said the overall market for high-definition dvds would be depressed as a result .
philips is showing trial technologies such as clothing with images philips ' mr covers said he did not think the rivalry was a problem for the consumer and dismissed suggestions that they could be confused .
" in the end the consumer has to make the choice to buy or to wait . "
some analysts predict dual-format dvd players capable of playing both hd-dvd and blu-ray may be the answer but they are not on the horizon for the mass market .

a team of engineers has been restoring the vulcan bomber at bruntingthorpe in leicestershire for nine years .
a £ 500,000 donation means the project has reached its £ 1.2m target needed to allow work to continue .
it is hoped the aircraft will fly again as part of celebrations to mark the 25th anniversary of the falklands conflict next year .
' beautiful aircraft ' the vulcan will roll out of its hangar for the first time in seven years on thursday .
bill taylor , a former pilot of the vulcan , said : " not only was she a beautiful aircraft as all the vulcans were but i in fact did my first cruise solo when i got my vulcan captaincy on that aircraft .
" so , it has a special place in my heart . "
there are more than a dozen remaining vulcans , which were retired from service in 1984 , but the bruntingthorpe plane is the only one with a realistic chance of flying again .
it last flew from raf waddington near lincoln more than a decade ago .
the team of 32 engineers had already been given notice of redundancy before the latest reprieve .

the actor , who appeared in hits like gilda , the big heat and midway , was found dead by paramedics .
his health had been failing for some time .
born in canada , ford moved to california as a child and joined columbia pictures in 1939 .
during a 53-year hollywood career , he featured in more than 100 films from romance to comedy , often portraying the tough , introspective hero .
early in his career , ford turned out a film every five days from columbia pictures ' b-unit .
service in the marines during world war ii interrupted his fledgling career , but only briefly .
ford appeared with henry fonda -lrb- l -rrb- and robert mitchum -lrb- r -rrb- in midway ford went on to establish himself as a leading hollywood star and formed an electric on-screen partnership with rita hayworth , which lasted for six films .
his acting talents ranged from romance to comedy , with famous credits like superman , the sheepman , the gazebo , pocketful of miracles and do n't go near the water .
he also appeared in a number of westerns , including 3:10 to yuma , cowboy , texas , and the fastest gun alive .
an action man both on and off screen , he later took up hang-gliding at the age of 64 and got married for the fourth time at 76 .
but he suffered a series of strokes in the 1990s .
failing health meant ford missed a 90th birthday tribute on 1 may at hollywood 's grauman 's egyptian theatre .
but he did send greetings via video , saying : " i wish i were up and around , but i 'm doing the best that i can .

the firm said its hand had been forced by a similar rise in claim costs over the past two years , during which time insurance rates had remained static .
norwich union said claims for personal injuries had been the main reason for the rise in its costs .
insurance for riskier customers , such as young men , will rise by up to 40 % .
david ross of the norwich union warned that other insurers would probably copy his firm 's example .
" i think we 'll find that most insurance companies will follow our lead - we 're the largest insurer in the country , one of the largest motor insurers , " he said .
" there is an expectation amongst various commentators in the sector that motor premiums will need to rise to reflect the increase in claims costs , particularly from the more litigious society that we find ourselves living in . "
the association of british insurers -lrb- abi -rrb- said costs were rising in several areas .
" the first is personal injury costs - a very large part of your premium covers personal injury - and secondly , there is a major problem around uninsured driving , " said nick starling of the abi .
" there 's around a million uninsured drivers on the road , and all of us pay £ 30 on our premiums to cover those . "

the firm said its hand had been forced by a similar rise in claim costs over the past two years , during which time insurance rates had remained static .
norwich union said claims for personal injuries had been the main reason for the rise in its costs .
insurance for riskier customers , such as young men , will rise by up to 40 % .
david ross of the norwich union warned that other insurers would probably copy his firm 's example .
" i think we 'll find that most insurance companies will follow our lead - we 're the largest insurer in the country , one of the largest motor insurers , " he said .

us researchers followed almost 2,000 people for up to 10 years - providing a powerful set of results .
they found the risk was 76 % lower for those who drank juice more than three times a week , compared with those who drank it less than once a week .
the study appears in the american journal of medicine . "
diet is a magnet for research because it could offer a relatively inexpensive way to fight a disease that ruins countless lives " dr harriet millward alzheimer 's is linked to the accumulation of clumps of beta-amyloid protein in the brain .
there is some evidence to suggest that this process may be controlled by the chemical hydrogen peroxide .
various studies have suggested that polyphenols - chemicals available in many foods - might disrupt these processes and provide some protection against alzheimer 's disease by neutralising the effect of damaging compounds called free radicals .
fruit and vegetable juices are particularly rich in polyphenols .
lead researcher dr qi dai , of vanderbilt university , said : " we found that frequent drinking of fruit and vegetable juices was associated with a substantially decreased risk of alzheimer 's disease .
" these findings are new and suggest that fruit and vegetable juices may play an important role in delaying the onset of alzheimer 's disease . "
the research was carried out on japanese americans , but researchers said the findings were applicable to the general population .
cheap treatment harriet millward , of the alzheimer 's research trust , said : " many scientists believe there is a link between the release of free radicals within the body and early changes to brain cells in people who ultimately go on to develop alzheimer 's disease .
" since fruit and vegetable juices are rich in antioxidants which ' mop up ' free radicals , this interesting piece of research adds weight to this theory . "
dr millward said previous studies had produced mixed results , and some had suggested the benefits of fruit and vegetables were short lived .
but she said the results of the latest study were significant because it was long-term , and had followed a relatively large group of people .
" diet almost certainly plays a part in every person 's alzheimer 's risk - and diet is a magnet for research because it could offer a relatively inexpensive way to fight a disease that ruins countless lives and costs the nhs more than cancer , stroke and heart disease put together . "
clive ballard , director of research at the alzheimer 's society , said fruit and vegetables might also help cut the risk by helping to lower blood pressure , and keep the blood vessels in good order .
alzheimer 's has been linked to poor blood supply to the brain .
his colleague dr susanne sorensen said : " this is an exciting study as it helps build the case that for taking action whilst still in good health may reduce the risk of developing the disease in later life .
" we hope gps will be able to use this information and pass it on to people who are deemed to be at high risk .
" a mediterranean diet of lots of fruits , vegetables , legumes , cereals , some fish and alcohol , and little dairy and meat is recommended , as it is healthy and high in antioxidants .
" it is also important to take exercise and keep mentally active . "

drinking fruit and vegetable juices frequently may significantly cut the risk of developing alzheimer 's disease , a study suggests .
us researchers followed almost 2,000 people for up to 10 years - providing a powerful set of results .
they found the risk was 76 % lower for those who drank juice more than three times a week , compared with those who drank it less than once a week .
the study appears in the american journal of medicine .
diet is a magnet for research because it could offer a relatively inexpensive way to fight a disease that ruins countless lives dr harriet millward alzheimer 's is linked to the accumulation of clumps of beta-amyloid protein in the brain .
there is some evidence to suggest that this process may be controlled by the chemical hydrogen peroxide .
various studies have suggested that polyphenols - chemicals available in many foods - might disrupt these processes and provide some protection against alzheimer 's disease by neutralising the effect of damaging compounds called free radicals .
fruit and vegetable juices are particularly rich in polyphenols .
lead researcher dr qi dai , of vanderbilt university , said : " we found that frequent drinking of fruit and vegetable juices was associated with a substantially decreased risk of alzheimer 's disease .
" these findings are new and suggest that fruit and vegetable juices may play an important role in delaying the onset of alzheimer 's disease . "
the research was carried out on japanese americans , but researchers said the findings were applicable to the general population .
cheap treatment harriet millward , of the alzheimer 's research trust , said : " many scientists believe there is a link between the release of free radicals within the body and early changes to brain cells in people who ultimately go on to develop alzheimer 's disease .
" since fruit and vegetable juices are rich in antioxidants which ' mop up ' free radicals , this interesting piece of research adds weight to this theory . "
dr millward said previous studies had produced mixed results , and some had suggested the benefits of fruit and vegetables were short lived .
but she said the results of the latest study were significant because it was long-term , and had followed a relatively large group of people .
" diet almost certainly plays a part in every person 's alzheimer 's risk - and diet is a magnet for research because it could offer a relatively inexpensive way to fight a disease that ruins countless lives and costs the nhs more than cancer , stroke and heart disease put together . "
clive ballard , director of research at the alzheimer 's society , said fruit and vegetables might also help cut the risk by helping to lower blood pressure , and keep the blood vessels in good order .
alzheimer 's has been linked to poor blood supply to the brain .
his colleague dr susanne sorensen said : " this is an exciting study as it helps build the case that for taking action whilst still in good health may reduce the risk of developing the disease in later life .
" we hope gps will be able to use this information and pass it on to people who are deemed to be at high risk .
" a mediterranean diet of lots of fruits , vegetables , legumes , cereals , some fish and alcohol , and little dairy and meat is recommended , as it is healthy and high in antioxidants .

under the human tissue act , donors will have a legal right to have their wishes followed .
people will also face jail if they remove and store human tissue without consent .
professor alex markham , chief executive of cancer research uk " research using human tissue is essential if we are to improve our understanding of cancer and develop more effective cancer treatments .
" cancer research uk is hopeful that this new regulatory framework will give researchers the support they need to carry out their work . "
dr evan harris , liberal democrat mp and chairman of the all party parliamentary kidney group " i strongly welcome the changes to organ donation to ensure that the wishes of the deceased prevail , reducing the power or opportunity of veto by relatives over a person 's positive decision to save lives by becoming a registered organ donor .
" it is vital however that the government is willing to evaluate the success of these changes after a few years and consider switching to presumed consent with opt out which has been shown to be effective in other countries .
the new guidelines will also enable a technique to be conducted to preserve organs following death until the wishes of the deceased can be established , known as non-heart beating donation .
" if we are to capitalise on the opportunities offered by non-heart beating donation then we must ensure that there is enough capacity - surgeons , beds , co-ordinators - to maximise the number of organs transplanted .
it would be a tragedy if any lives were lost due to a failure by the health service to make full use of this procedure . "
john evans , chairman of the british organ donor society " someone can give a witness statement that they want to be a donor , but there is no mechanism in place by which that can be checked .
" how will doctors be able to make contact with the witnesses if they suddenly need to take the organs .
" the only way of really knowing is if someone is on the national register , so more people need to sign up to it .
" this is altering the bias from asking the family to telling them what 's going to happen , so it is more towards the donor 's wishes .
" we are in favour of it , but we wait to see with time how effective it is . "
timothy statham , chief executive of the national kidney federation " the donation of a body organ from one person to another is a truly selfless and thoroughly altruistic act .
" the national kidney federation warmly welcomes the human tissue act and in particular the recognition that such ' gifts of life ' can , and will , take place between strangers . "
solicitor ian cohen , who represented families involved in liverpool 's alder hey hospital scandal " i think when you look at the codes of practice and the human tissue act 2004 together , a lot of concerns that were raised are addressed .
" it lays out what is proper informed consent , sets out practises of how to obtain consent and deals with how to respect the wishes of families involved .
" it is putting in place safeguards so that what happened at alder hey will never happen again .
but we must not let our guard down now .
" however , there are further aspects here that need further work , substantially more training is required for medical professionals .
" also , under the act it makes it a criminal offence to remove and store tissue without the right consent , but what the code of practice does n't do is lay out when something becomes an offence .
" this is very welcome and does deal with an awful lot of concerns - the authors have obviously listened during the consultation process . "
elizabeth ward , president of the british kidney patients association " i think it 's wrong .
the whole thing is to give people a chance of a life and there is lots of tissue just lying in graveyards that could be used .
" what we need to have is an opt-out system . "
