bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel forgeard -lrb- left -rrb- and gustav humbert were forced out forgeard and humbert had been under intense pressure to quit since the news of the a380 delays in mid-june wiped 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- off eads ’ s market value and left airbus trailing us rival boeing . the chief of france ’ s state-owned sncf rail company , louis gallois , is to replace forgeard .
gallois , 62 , is a former head of french state company aerospatiale , whose toulouse factories are now part of eads . gallois also ran aero-engine manufacturer snecma , now part of the defense and communications group safran .
he is already an eads board member . christian streiff , 51 , a former deputy ceo of french building materials group saint gobain , is to succeed humbert as the head of airbus . streiff is an industry outsider , reportedly brought in because of his experiences in managing complex industrial processes .
bilingual in french and german , he worked for 15 years on behalf of glassmaker saint gobain in germany . german eads head stays on the position of tom enders , who remains the german co-ceo of eads , has now been significantly strengthened .
enders is to assume responsibility for the airbus shareholder committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french rail chief louis gallois is to take over as co-ceo of eads in an effort to preserve the delicate balance of national power inside the company , streiff will report to enders .
under the previous management set-up , humbert had reported to forgeard himself . german economics minister michael glos welcomed the change in eads leadership , saying in a statement on monday that the decision showed the company " recognized its responsibility for its core business , airbus . " glos also said he hoped the new management structure " would be received positively by the market . " but on monday , eads had failed to bounce back from its recently trampled share price .
the group 's shares initially rose as much as 1.7 percent , but then fell again by more than 2 percent . eads shares fell 26 percent when a380 delays were announced on june 14 . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de superjumbo 's delays spell bosses ' demise the french co-chief executive of eads , noel forgeard , and the german chief of european aircraft manufacturer airbus , gustav humbert , resigned on sunday , the european aerospace company said in a statement .

for decades , the rivalry split the town in two . the small aurach river gurgles through the heart of herzogenaurach , population 24,000 , and gives the town its name .
but this peaceful , meandering waterway once symbolized a bitter , protracted family feud that divided the town into two distinct camps . it was all about footwear . " the town became known as the town where people tend to look down because you 'd always tend to look at shoes the person is wearing before you strike up a conversation , " said barbara smit , a dutch financial journalist and one of the authors to tackle the story of the dassler brothers , rudolf and adolf . they started out making shoes together before having a terrible falling out .
their argument resulted in the creation of two sports giants , puma and adidas , both still based in the provincial town . partners , then enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf -lrb- adi -rrb- dassler in 1978 rudolf and younger brother adolf , rudi and adi to friends , began their shoe business in their mother 's laundry room in the 1920s .
at the time , electricity supplies in the town were unreliable , and the brothers sometimes had to use pedal power from a stationary bicycle to run their equipment . " they were very different characters , " said smit .
" adi dassler was always more thoughtful , a craftsman who enjoyed nothing more than fiddling with his shoes .
whereas rudolf dassler was a more abrasive , loudmouthed salesman .
they complemented each other very well to begin with . " their new , lightweight sports shoes began to attract attention and they moved into a location south of the aurach river near the train station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jesse owens the dassler brothers shoe factory jumped onto the world stage in 1936 when they found themselves providing footwear for american jessie owens , who won four gold medals at the berlin olympics . but after the war , the fraternal relationship fell apart .
in smit 's book , " pitch invasion , " she theorizes that it could have had something to do with nazi party links and that after rudolf was picked up by american soldiers and accused of being a member of the ss , he was convinced that his brother had turned him in .
others speculate it could have had something to do with their wives , or a simple misunderstanding in a bomb shelter .
no one really knows for sure . what is certain is that they felt they could no longer work together and in 1948 the dassler brothers shoe factory was split in two . " more of less in the middle of the night , rudolf dassler packed his bags and moved on the other side of the little river , " said smit .
" he established puma on the other side .
from there on in , the town was really split in two like a sort of mini berlin with this little river as a partition in the middle . " and like berlin 's famous wall , it was n't advisable to cross over , at least when it came to shoes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reconstruction of adolf dassler 's early shoe workshop brand loyalty became paramount for many residents .
two camps formed , and dug in . there were stores , bakers and bars which were unofficially known as either loyal to rudolf 's puma , or to adolf 's new company , adidas , which he named using his nickname , adi , and the first three letters of his last name .
there were two soccer teams : the asv herzogenaurach club wore the three stripes ; the 1 fc herzogenaurach had the jumping cat on its footwear .
intermarriage was frowned upon . " i knew a butcher who played for the puma team , " said ernst ditrich who works at the town 's museum .
" he told us the guys from the adidas team did n't need to bother buying at his store .
he did n't want to do business with them .
that sort of thing happened . " wayward son the brothers never did reconcile .
while they are buried in the same cemetery , their graves are about as far apart as possible .
but one of their descendents decided the family feud had gone on long enough . frank dassler is the grandson of rudolf dassler and grew up living and breathing puma .
growing up , he had no contact at all with his great-uncle adolf 's family . " they stayed kind of enemies during the rest of their lives , " he said .
" it 's certainly sad , but from a business point of view it was a good decision , since it motivated both companies to innovate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the adidas " world of sports " headquarters but these days , frank dassler sits not in puma 's new glass-and-steel headquarters on the bank of the river , but in an office at the adidas campus further north , on the site of a former american army barracks .
two years ago , he took a job as the adidas group 's head legal counsel . " my stepmother and my stepbrother were n't very happy about this decision , they thought it would be a betrayal against my grandfather , " he said . his taboo breaking raised more than a few eyebrows in the town and the local newspapers were not always so kind . " but this rivalry was years ago , it 's history now , " he said . lost its punch indeed , young people today seem little concerned with the once-intense rivalry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puma 's had new strength in its spring for the past few years " it 's not so strong anymore .
it was like that before , but now , i do n't think people care so much , " said 14-year-old teresa , who was wearing puma shoes but carrying an adidas bag .
" sometimes puma has something better , sometimes adidas .
it just depends . " but hermann lindner , 41 , who was with his family -lrb- all wearing puma -rrb- at a festival for the argentinian team who is staying in the town for the world cup , says the two camps have n't entirely folded up their tents . " no , it 's not as extreme as it used to be , but you still find people who stick to puma and other who only wear adidas , " he said .
" people do make the distinction . " and while most think things are better now that rivalry has cooled , some knew how to make the most of it when it was raging , frank dassler says .
he remembers that when handymen would come to work at his grandfather 's house , they would sometimes wear adidas shoes on purpose .
when rudolf would see their footwear , he 'd tell them to go to the basement and pick out a pair of puma shoes , which they could have for free .

for decades , the rivalry split the town in two . the small aurach river gurgles through the heart of herzogenaurach , population 24,000 , and gives the town its name .
but this peaceful , meandering waterway once symbolized a bitter , protracted family feud that divided the town into two distinct camps . it was all about footwear . " the town became known as the town where people tend to look down because you 'd always tend to look at shoes the person is wearing before you strike up a conversation , " said barbara smit , a dutch financial journalist and one of the authors to tackle the story of the dassler brothers , rudolf and adolf . they started out making shoes together before having a terrible falling out .
their argument resulted in the creation of two sports giants , puma and adidas , both still based in the provincial town . partners , then enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf -lrb- adi -rrb- dassler in 1978 rudolf and younger brother adolf , rudi and adi to friends , began their shoe business in their mother 's laundry room in the 1920s .
at the time , electricity supplies in the town were unreliable , and the brothers sometimes had to use pedal power from a stationary bicycle to run their equipment . " they were very different characters , " said smit .
" adi dassler was always more thoughtful , a craftsman who enjoyed nothing more than fiddling with his shoes .
whereas rudolf dassler was a more abrasive , loudmouthed salesman .
they complemented each other very well to begin with . " their new , lightweight sports shoes began to attract attention and they moved into a location south of the aurach river near the train station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jesse owens the dassler brothers shoe factory jumped onto the world stage in 1936 when they found themselves providing footwear for american jessie owens , who won four gold medals at the berlin olympics . but after the war , the fraternal relationship fell apart .
in smit 's book , " pitch invasion , " she theorizes that it could have had something to do with nazi party links and that after rudolf was picked up by american soldiers and accused of being a member of the ss , he was convinced that his brother had turned him in .
others speculate it could have had something to do with their wives , or a simple misunderstanding in a bomb shelter .
no one really knows for sure . what is certain is that they felt they could no longer work together and in 1948 the dassler brothers shoe factory was split in two . " more of less in the middle of the night , rudolf dassler packed his bags and moved on the other side of the little river , " said smit .
" he established puma on the other side .
from there on in , the town was really split in two like a sort of mini berlin with this little river as a partition in the middle . " and like berlin 's famous wall , it was n't advisable to cross over , at least when it came to shoes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reconstruction of adolf dassler 's early shoe workshop brand loyalty became paramount for many residents .
two camps formed , and dug in . there were stores , bakers and bars which were unofficially known as either loyal to rudolf 's puma , or to adolf 's new company , adidas , which he named using his nickname , adi , and the first three letters of his last name .
there were two soccer teams : the asv herzogenaurach club wore the three stripes ; the 1 fc herzogenaurach had the jumping cat on its footwear .
intermarriage was frowned upon . " i knew a butcher who played for the puma team , " said ernst ditrich who works at the town 's museum .
" he told us the guys from the adidas team did n't need to bother buying at his store .
he did n't want to do business with them .
that sort of thing happened . " wayward son the brothers never did reconcile .
while they are buried in the same cemetery , their graves are about as far apart as possible .
but one of their descendents decided the family feud had gone on long enough . frank dassler is the grandson of rudolf dassler and grew up living and breathing puma .
growing up , he had no contact at all with his great-uncle adolf 's family . " they stayed kind of enemies during the rest of their lives , " he said .
" it 's certainly sad , but from a business point of view it was a good decision , since it motivated both companies to innovate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the adidas " world of sports " headquarters but these days , frank dassler sits not in puma 's new glass-and-steel headquarters on the bank of the river , but in an office at the adidas campus further north , on the site of a former american army barracks .

one of these teams will win the 2006 world cup .
but which team should win it ?
each country stands to offer something very different to the world by being crowned champions . there is one truism in soccer that continues to hold : the best team does n't always win .
playing great soccer does n't always guarantee success .
given that soccer is as much about good fortune as good performances , maybe we should forget about who has the right to win the world cup on the basis of their displays and look at which team should win the world cup for other reasons . germany has been riding a wave of euphoria ever since the first game of the tournament proved that klinsmann 's kids were not the huge risk that everyone though they would be .
with every game , the nation 's smile has gotten broader . germans have displayed a new enthusiasm and pride in their country which would surely increase even further should the national team with the cup .
the collective hope - now bordering on unwavering belief - that the world cup will stay in germany after july 9 has brought the people together , uniting germans of all backgrounds and ethnicities . this has not been lost on those outside the country 's borders .
the most pleasant side effect of this tournament is the image of germany as an inclusive , friendly and welcoming nation .
the german people themselves have shown that they are not the dull , humorless race of a sausage-scarfing , beer-swilling stereotypes but a nation capable of putting on one hell of a party and playing a great host to those who want to join in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup : uniting people even if germany were to go out to italy in the semi-finals , the enduring image of the world cup will be the millions of germans celebrating together with fans from all over the globe , turning this tournament into a soccer summer of love . but if michael ballack were to lift the trophy in berlin this new german belief , pride and positivity would go to another , hopefully , sustainable level .
it could provide germany , a country which has suffered from collective depression for so long , a solid base for a social recovery .
this is why germany should win . italy : stain of corruption italy find themselves in a real quandary .
if they lift the trophy on july 9 , they may be the first world champions to be crowned on the day that a court rules that their game is endemically corrupt .
the investigation into match-fixing back home could come to a close on the day of the world cup final and , if those at the top of the italian game are found guilty by the findings , soccer in italy could be set back a decade . top clubs like juventus , ac milan , fiorentina and lazio are in the dock as investigators look into allegations that corrupt referees manipulated matches , mostly in favor of champions juventus , who have won four of the past five championships .
the turin club could be stripped of their titles and relegated , meaning a high number of italy 's squad would be returning to second , even third-division soccer . because soccer defeat in italy is something akin to national bereavement , the country would enter a period of mourning that could affect all aspects of italian life for many years to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians could demand a massive clean-up campaign if they would win the world cup , then the italians would have a title to live up to .
such is the pride in their team and their country , the italians would demand that their game be purged of those who have dragged it into the mire . a world cup victory could provide the catalyst for empowerment both in society and in soccer circles , leading to a cleansing of the italian game .
this is why italy should win the world cup . france : public unity when france won the world cup in 1998 , the team was heralded as a success story for the country 's integration policies , fielding descendents from colonies such as surinam , algeria and guadeloupe .
the knock-on effects of that win and of a team built up of players of different ethnicities carried france as country on a wave of unity for many months . history now shows that the gloss of the ' 98 world cup win was no more than paper over the serious cracks in french society and that it was just a matter of time until the failure of france 's integration experiment was once again clear to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars have made way for a huge french love-in the riots of 2005 and the student protests of earlier this year have abated but the sources of french discontent remain .
while the experiences of 1998 tell us that a french world cup win in 2006 will not cure the ills , it would provide some relief .
coming in the year of a presidential election , a wave of optimism flowing from an incredible swansong for zidane and the old guard could sweep through france and bring about real change . the french team have already stood up to the far-right jean marie le pen and have declared unswerving allegiance to la grande nation in the face of nationalistic slurs .
a victory in germany for the multicultural bleus could inspire their splintered country to take similar action and bring the sometimes warring sides together .
this is why france should win the world cup . portugal : reform inspiration portugal may be seen by some as the party-crashers of the semi-finals .
figo and co. find themselves in illustrious company made up of former world champions .
a country which has yet to win an international title , portugal could be the flag-bearers for all those teams outside the perceived hierarchy of " big " teams who are consistently touted as favorites .
a world cup win for portugal would give hope to all those outside that exclusive club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal would be champions by fair means or foul but a world cup win for portugal would also send out another message : that play-acting and cynicism can get you as far as playing the other team off the park .
a victory in berlin for this portuguese team would be a triumph of simulation .
no other team has conned referees or intimidated the opposition more at this world cup , and considering that holland , italy and argentina all featured - that 's worthy of a trophy on its own . in an ideal world , a win for portugal on july 9 would shock soccer 's governing bodies into much-needed action .
a world cup victory for portugal should mean an overhaul of the game 's rules , the clear rewriting of what is unacceptable and widespread reform of the increasingly ugly beautiful game .

the german people themselves have shown that they are not the dull , humorless race of a sausage-scarfing , beer-swilling stereotypes but a nation capable of putting on one hell of a party and playing a great host to those who want to join in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup : uniting people even if germany were to go out to italy in the semi-finals , the enduring image of the world cup will be the millions of germans celebrating together with fans from all over the globe , turning this tournament into a soccer summer of love . but if michael ballack were to lift the trophy in berlin this new german belief , pride and positivity would go to another , hopefully , sustainable level .

the turin club could be stripped of their titles and relegated , meaning a high number of italy 's squad would be returning to second , even third-division soccer . because soccer defeat in italy is something akin to national bereavement , the country would enter a period of mourning that could affect all aspects of italian life for many years to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians could demand a massive clean-up campaign if they would win the world cup , then the italians would have a title to live up to .
such is the pride in their team and their country , the italians would demand that their game be purged of those who have dragged it into the mire . a world cup victory could provide the catalyst for empowerment both in society and in soccer circles , leading to a cleansing of the italian game .
this is why italy should win the world cup . france : public unity when france won the world cup in 1998 , the team was heralded as a success story for the country 's integration policies , fielding descendents from colonies such as surinam , algeria and guadeloupe .
the knock-on effects of that win and of a team built up of players of different ethnicities carried france as country on a wave of unity for many months . history now shows that the gloss of the ' 98 world cup win was no more than paper over the serious cracks in french society and that it was just a matter of time until the failure of france 's integration experiment was once again clear to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars have made way for a huge french love-in the riots of 2005 and the student protests of earlier this year have abated but the sources of french discontent remain .

coming in the year of a presidential election , a wave of optimism flowing from an incredible swansong for zidane and the old guard could sweep through france and bring about real change . the french team have already stood up to the far-right jean marie le pen and have declared unswerving allegiance to la grande nation in the face of nationalistic slurs .

each country stands to offer something very different to the world by being crowned champions . there is one truism in soccer that continues to hold : the best team does n't always win .

the pieces have all fallen into place for germany .
they are the hosts , jürgen klinsmann 's xi are in form , and they have the " big " country monkey off their back .
but germany 's history against italy is not a golden one . between them , germany and italy have collected six world cups , three times each .
coach jürgen klinsmann won it as a player in 1990 in italy .
but that final was against argentina who had knocked out the hosts in the semi-finals on penalties .
in contests with the azzurri however , germany can hardly rely on a successful history .
head-to-head , germany have won only seven times compared to 13 losses in 28 matches . in major competitions , italy have had germany 's number .
they took home the world cup in 1982 , beating germany 3-1 in madrid for what was their third title .
the legendary squadra azzurra led by paolo rossi made short shrift of jupp derwall 's finalists and underlined their claim as being europe 's strongest soccer nation with that championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the azzurri flew higher than germany in the 1982 final as important as that game was since it was a final , it was a semi-final , like the one this tuesday , that has gone down in history and remained etched in the memories of those who lived to see and hear it . under a broiling midday sun in mexico city , germany and italy played 120 minutes , before coach ferruccio valcareggi 's italy came out on top 4-3 in what has recently been voted as the " game of the century " in a fifa poll .
in mexico , the match has such great meaning that a plaque commemorates the contest at the aztec stadium . an injured ' kaiser ' and a high-flying ' bomber ' the circumstances that evolved during the game make it understandable why it is considered the classic game in world cup history .
italy went ahead after just eight minutes .
germany finally leveled in injury time on a goal by karl heinz schnellinger , forcing the match into extra-time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy celebrated at the end of the " game of the century " in mexico germany 's one-man wrecking crew gerd ' der bomber ' müller put germany ahead quickly before italy pulled ahead over the course of five minutes .
müller , who scored ten goals alone in the 1970 finals , got the equalizer in the 110th minute .
but while the replays were still being shown of his goal , gianni rivera won the game for the italians . franz beckenbauer 's heroics would go down in history after he played much of the two extra-time periods with his arm in a sling after sustaining a broken clavicle on an italian foul . stifling defenses in other affairs in their two other world cup meetings , germany and italy did n't provide any fireworks as in the 1970 semifinal .
in 1962 in chile , the two played to a scoreless draw in the first round .
in 1978 , both teams failed to find the net in a second round encounter . at european championships , germany have also failed to beat the southern europeans .
as hosts in 1988 , germany drew against the italians 1-1 .
in england eight years later , fans had to endure a goalless affair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack -lrb- left -rrb- and alessandro nesta battle in march as much as those games were dominated by stingy defenses , they happened long ago .
in their most recent encounter in florence , a world cup warm-up , italy pushed the germans to their nadir with a 4-1 thrashing .
that is a score jürgen klinsmann would like to settle . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup semi-final , 1970 : italy vs. west germany germany were looking for world cup glory after the disappointment of 1966 .

the pieces have all fallen into place for germany .
they are the hosts , jürgen klinsmann 's xi are in form , and they have the " big " country monkey off their back .
but germany 's history against italy is not a golden one . between them , germany and italy have collected six world cups , three times each .
coach jürgen klinsmann won it as a player in 1990 in italy .
but that final was against argentina who had knocked out the hosts in the semi-finals on penalties .
in contests with the azzurri however , germany can hardly rely on a successful history .
head-to-head , germany have won only seven times compared to 13 losses in 28 matches . in major competitions , italy have had germany 's number .
they took home the world cup in 1982 , beating germany 3-1 in madrid for what was their third title .
the legendary squadra azzurra led by paolo rossi made short shrift of jupp derwall 's finalists and underlined their claim as being europe 's strongest soccer nation with that championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the azzurri flew higher than germany in the 1982 final as important as that game was since it was a final , it was a semi-final , like the one this tuesday , that has gone down in history and remained etched in the memories of those who lived to see and hear it . under a broiling midday sun in mexico city , germany and italy played 120 minutes , before coach ferruccio valcareggi 's italy came out on top 4-3 in what has recently been voted as the " game of the century " in a fifa poll .
in mexico , the match has such great meaning that a plaque commemorates the contest at the aztec stadium . an injured ' kaiser ' and a high-flying ' bomber ' the circumstances that evolved during the game make it understandable why it is considered the classic game in world cup history .
italy went ahead after just eight minutes .
germany finally leveled in injury time on a goal by karl heinz schnellinger , forcing the match into extra-time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy celebrated at the end of the " game of the century " in mexico germany 's one-man wrecking crew gerd ' der bomber ' müller put germany ahead quickly before italy pulled ahead over the course of five minutes .
müller , who scored ten goals alone in the 1970 finals , got the equalizer in the 110th minute .
but while the replays were still being shown of his goal , gianni rivera won the game for the italians . franz beckenbauer 's heroics would go down in history after he played much of the two extra-time periods with his arm in a sling after sustaining a broken clavicle on an italian foul . stifling defenses in other affairs in their two other world cup meetings , germany and italy did n't provide any fireworks as in the 1970 semifinal .
in 1962 in chile , the two played to a scoreless draw in the first round .
in 1978 , both teams failed to find the net in a second round encounter . at european championships , germany have also failed to beat the southern europeans .
as hosts in 1988 , germany drew against the italians 1-1 .
in england eight years later , fans had to endure a goalless affair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack -lrb- left -rrb- and alessandro nesta battle in march as much as those games were dominated by stingy defenses , they happened long ago .

but germany 's history against italy is not a golden one . between them , germany and italy have collected six world cups , three times each .
coach jürgen klinsmann won it as a player in 1990 in italy .
but that final was against argentina who had knocked out the hosts in the semi-finals on penalties .
in contests with the azzurri however , germany can hardly rely on a successful history .
head-to-head , germany have won only seven times compared to 13 losses in 28 matches . in major competitions , italy have had germany 's number .
they took home the world cup in 1982 , beating germany 3-1 in madrid for what was their third title .
the legendary squadra azzurra led by paolo rossi made short shrift of jupp derwall 's finalists and underlined their claim as being europe 's strongest soccer nation with that championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the azzurri flew higher than germany in the 1982 final as important as that game was since it was a final , it was a semi-final , like the one this tuesday , that has gone down in history and remained etched in the memories of those who lived to see and hear it . under a broiling midday sun in mexico city , germany and italy played 120 minutes , before coach ferruccio valcareggi 's italy came out on top 4-3 in what has recently been voted as the " game of the century " in a fifa poll .
in mexico , the match has such great meaning that a plaque commemorates the contest at the aztec stadium . an injured ' kaiser ' and a high-flying ' bomber ' the circumstances that evolved during the game make it understandable why it is considered the classic game in world cup history .
italy went ahead after just eight minutes .
germany finally leveled in injury time on a goal by karl heinz schnellinger , forcing the match into extra-time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy celebrated at the end of the " game of the century " in mexico germany 's one-man wrecking crew gerd ' der bomber ' müller put germany ahead quickly before italy pulled ahead over the course of five minutes .
müller , who scored ten goals alone in the 1970 finals , got the equalizer in the 110th minute .
but while the replays were still being shown of his goal , gianni rivera won the game for the italians . franz beckenbauer 's heroics would go down in history after he played much of the two extra-time periods with his arm in a sling after sustaining a broken clavicle on an italian foul . stifling defenses in other affairs in their two other world cup meetings , germany and italy did n't provide any fireworks as in the 1970 semifinal .
in 1962 in chile , the two played to a scoreless draw in the first round .
in 1978 , both teams failed to find the net in a second round encounter . at european championships , germany have also failed to beat the southern europeans .
as hosts in 1988 , germany drew against the italians 1-1 .
in england eight years later , fans had to endure a goalless affair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack -lrb- left -rrb- and alessandro nesta battle in march as much as those games were dominated by stingy defenses , they happened long ago .
in their most recent encounter in florence , a world cup warm-up , italy pushed the germans to their nadir with a 4-1 thrashing .
that is a score jürgen klinsmann would like to settle . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup semi-final , 1970 : italy vs. west germany germany were looking for world cup glory after the disappointment of 1966 .

the fund will pass on money to insurance companies , who - should they require additional funding - can also raise cash directly from their members through a levy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those covered by public insurers began paying more for prescriptions in 2004 in contrast to earlier plans , private health insurers will not contribute to the fund , although they would have to play a bigger part in " stabilizing the health care system , " chancellor merkel said . reduction of overall tax burden for companies the coalition also agreed to reduce the overall tax burden on german companies to just under 30 percent from around 39 percent , bavarian premier edmund stoiber said . a new flat-rate withholding tax at 25 percent will be levied on capital gains , including interest and dividend income and the gains from asset sales . the reforms are a key test of merkel 's government as it seeks to overhaul europe 's biggest economy . the thorniest issue had been the question of how to fund changes to health care , expected to cost at least 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.3 billion -rrb- . conservatives are eager to reduce non-wage labor costs while social democrats want higher earners to shoulder more of the funding burden . merkel said on monday using tax revenue would lead to a drop in employment costs . germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in europe german workers and employers currently jointly contribute around 14 percent of an employee 's wage packet to pay for statutory healthcare , but due to the country 's ageing population and low birth rate the system has come under strain as the number of contributors shrinks . as non-wage employment costs rise to try to compensate , labor becomes too expensive , reducing the incentive for firms to invest in germany and helping to force companies abroad . germany 's healthcare system costs around 140 billion euros a year and results in some of the highest non-wage labor costs in europe . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german coalition agrees on tax for wealthy , other reforms germany 's grand coalition government spent a long night in negotiations over key reforms .

" we will be a neutral party and will not take sides with anyone , " jung said following a meeting with congo 's defense minister , adolphe onusumba , in kinshasa . congo could remain a dangerous area , jung said , until final election results rolled in presumably at the end of august .
however , he said he was certain eu peacekeeping troops would deter violence . jung said the around 2,000 european troops are obligated to remain neutral .
congo 's opposition parties have feared that the european troops would aid the current president , joseph kabila , to remain in office . german help after the elections during his visit , jung is scheduled to meet with representatives of the government and with the independent election commission 's director , muholongu malumalu .
opposition leaders , he said , did not have time to meet . jung promised onusumba additional help from germany following the election , saying continued cooperation would likely center around training congo 's military troops .

their primary purpose will be to fly into congo and rescue united nations election observers should violence break out during the polls .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : explore germany 's rivers rhine river transformed into nearly pristine water stream a cycle trip and tipple along the moselle discovering the altmühl valley a picturesque pedal down the rhine visit germany -pipe- 03.07.2006 a river runs through it großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : go with the flow and get to know germany from another perspective river-faring vessels have access to more than 7,000 kilometers -lrb- 4,350 miles -rrb- of inland waterways in germany .
many routes are sought after by travelers who enjoy relaxing on a cruise ship and letting the world drift by . for some , a cruise is the ultimate upmarket vacation , while for others it means boring bourgeoisie .
but the view from the deck of a cruise ship does n't always have to be drab and monotonous . the alternative to a high-sea tour is to take an inland river cruise on one of germany 's many trafficked waterways - and take in german cultural history along the way .
opportunities for multiple-day trips are plentiful - whether on the rhine , the weser , the danube or the moselle . the river rhine - muse of poets and painters the rhine is germany 's most famous river , in part because so much has been written about it .

for decades , the rivalry split the town in two . the small aurach river gurgles through the heart of herzogenaurach , population 24,000 , and gives the town its name .
but this peaceful , meandering waterway once symbolized a bitter , protracted family feud that divided the town into two distinct camps . it was all about footwear . " the town became known as the town where people tend to look down because you 'd always tend to look at shoes the person is wearing before you strike up a conversation , " said barbara smit , a dutch financial journalist and one of the authors to tackle the story of the dassler brothers , rudolf and adolf . they started out making shoes together before having a terrible falling out .
their argument resulted in the creation of two sports giants , puma and adidas , both still based in the provincial town . partners , then enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf -lrb- adi -rrb- dassler in 1978 rudolf and younger brother adolf , rudi and adi to friends , began their shoe business in their mother 's laundry room in the 1920s .
at the time , electricity supplies in the town were unreliable , and the brothers sometimes had to use pedal power from a stationary bicycle to run their equipment . " they were very different characters , " said smit .
" adi dassler was always more thoughtful , a craftsman who enjoyed nothing more than fiddling with his shoes .
whereas rudolf dassler was a more abrasive , loudmouthed salesman .
they complemented each other very well to begin with . " their new , lightweight sports shoes began to attract attention and they moved into a location south of the aurach river near the train station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jesse owens the dassler brothers shoe factory jumped onto the world stage in 1936 when they found themselves providing footwear for american jessie owens , who won four gold medals at the berlin olympics . but after the war , the fraternal relationship fell apart .
in smit 's book , " pitch invasion , " she theorizes that it could have had something to do with nazi party links and that after rudolf was picked up by american soldiers and accused of being a member of the ss , he was convinced that his brother had turned him in .
others speculate it could have had something to do with their wives , or a simple misunderstanding in a bomb shelter .
no one really knows for sure . what is certain is that they felt they could no longer work together and in 1948 the dassler brothers shoe factory was split in two . " more of less in the middle of the night , rudolf dassler packed his bags and moved on the other side of the little river , " said smit .
" he established puma on the other side .
from there on in , the town was really split in two like a sort of mini berlin with this little river as a partition in the middle . " and like berlin 's famous wall , it was n't advisable to cross over , at least when it came to shoes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reconstruction of adolf dassler 's early shoe workshop brand loyalty became paramount for many residents .
two camps formed , and dug in . there were stores , bakers and bars which were unofficially known as either loyal to rudolf 's puma , or to adolf 's new company , adidas , which he named using his nickname , adi , and the first three letters of his last name .
there were two soccer teams : the asv herzogenaurach club wore the three stripes ; the 1 fc herzogenaurach had the jumping cat on its footwear .
intermarriage was frowned upon . " i knew a butcher who played for the puma team , " said ernst ditrich who works at the town 's museum .
" he told us the guys from the adidas team did n't need to bother buying at his store .
he did n't want to do business with them .
that sort of thing happened . " wayward son the brothers never did reconcile .
while they are buried in the same cemetery , their graves are about as far apart as possible .
but one of their descendents decided the family feud had gone on long enough . frank dassler is the grandson of rudolf dassler and grew up living and breathing puma .
growing up , he had no contact at all with his great-uncle adolf 's family . " they stayed kind of enemies during the rest of their lives , " he said .
" it 's certainly sad , but from a business point of view it was a good decision , since it motivated both companies to innovate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the adidas " world of sports " headquarters but these days , frank dassler sits not in puma 's new glass-and-steel headquarters on the bank of the river , but in an office at the adidas campus further north , on the site of a former american army barracks .
two years ago , he took a job as the adidas group 's head legal counsel . " my stepmother and my stepbrother were n't very happy about this decision , they thought it would be a betrayal against my grandfather , " he said . his taboo breaking raised more than a few eyebrows in the town and the local newspapers were not always so kind . " but this rivalry was years ago , it 's history now , " he said . lost its punch indeed , young people today seem little concerned with the once-intense rivalry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puma 's had new strength in its spring for the past few years " it 's not so strong anymore .
it was like that before , but now , i do n't think people care so much , " said 14-year-old teresa , who was wearing puma shoes but carrying an adidas bag .
" sometimes puma has something better , sometimes adidas .
it just depends . " but hermann lindner , 41 , who was with his family -lrb- all wearing puma -rrb- at a festival for the argentinian team who is staying in the town for the world cup , says the two camps have n't entirely folded up their tents . " no , it 's not as extreme as it used to be , but you still find people who stick to puma and other who only wear adidas , " he said .
" people do make the distinction . " and while most think things are better now that rivalry has cooled , some knew how to make the most of it when it was raging , frank dassler says .
he remembers that when handymen would come to work at his grandfather 's house , they would sometimes wear adidas shoes on purpose .
when rudolf would see their footwear , he 'd tell them to go to the basement and pick out a pair of puma shoes , which they could have for free .

at the time , electricity supplies in the town were unreliable , and the brothers sometimes had to use pedal power from a stationary bicycle to run their equipment . " they were very different characters , " said smit .
" adi dassler was always more thoughtful , a craftsman who enjoyed nothing more than fiddling with his shoes .
whereas rudolf dassler was a more abrasive , loudmouthed salesman .
they complemented each other very well to begin with . " their new , lightweight sports shoes began to attract attention and they moved into a location south of the aurach river near the train station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jesse owens the dassler brothers shoe factory jumped onto the world stage in 1936 when they found themselves providing footwear for american jessie owens , who won four gold medals at the berlin olympics . but after the war , the fraternal relationship fell apart .
in smit 's book , " pitch invasion , " she theorizes that it could have had something to do with nazi party links and that after rudolf was picked up by american soldiers and accused of being a member of the ss , he was convinced that his brother had turned him in .
others speculate it could have had something to do with their wives , or a simple misunderstanding in a bomb shelter .
no one really knows for sure . what is certain is that they felt they could no longer work together and in 1948 the dassler brothers shoe factory was split in two . " more of less in the middle of the night , rudolf dassler packed his bags and moved on the other side of the little river , " said smit .
" he established puma on the other side .
from there on in , the town was really split in two like a sort of mini berlin with this little river as a partition in the middle . " and like berlin 's famous wall , it was n't advisable to cross over , at least when it came to shoes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reconstruction of adolf dassler 's early shoe workshop brand loyalty became paramount for many residents .
two camps formed , and dug in . there were stores , bakers and bars which were unofficially known as either loyal to rudolf 's puma , or to adolf 's new company , adidas , which he named using his nickname , adi , and the first three letters of his last name .
there were two soccer teams : the asv herzogenaurach club wore the three stripes ; the 1 fc herzogenaurach had the jumping cat on its footwear .
intermarriage was frowned upon . " i knew a butcher who played for the puma team , " said ernst ditrich who works at the town 's museum .
" he told us the guys from the adidas team did n't need to bother buying at his store .
he did n't want to do business with them .
that sort of thing happened . " wayward son the brothers never did reconcile .
while they are buried in the same cemetery , their graves are about as far apart as possible .
but one of their descendents decided the family feud had gone on long enough . frank dassler is the grandson of rudolf dassler and grew up living and breathing puma .
growing up , he had no contact at all with his great-uncle adolf 's family . " they stayed kind of enemies during the rest of their lives , " he said .
" it 's certainly sad , but from a business point of view it was a good decision , since it motivated both companies to innovate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the adidas " world of sports " headquarters but these days , frank dassler sits not in puma 's new glass-and-steel headquarters on the bank of the river , but in an office at the adidas campus further north , on the site of a former american army barracks .
two years ago , he took a job as the adidas group 's head legal counsel . " my stepmother and my stepbrother were n't very happy about this decision , they thought it would be a betrayal against my grandfather , " he said . his taboo breaking raised more than a few eyebrows in the town and the local newspapers were not always so kind . " but this rivalry was years ago , it 's history now , " he said . lost its punch indeed , young people today seem little concerned with the once-intense rivalry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puma 's had new strength in its spring for the past few years " it 's not so strong anymore .
it was like that before , but now , i do n't think people care so much , " said 14-year-old teresa , who was wearing puma shoes but carrying an adidas bag .
" sometimes puma has something better , sometimes adidas .
it just depends . " but hermann lindner , 41 , who was with his family -lrb- all wearing puma -rrb- at a festival for the argentinian team who is staying in the town for the world cup , says the two camps have n't entirely folded up their tents . " no , it 's not as extreme as it used to be , but you still find people who stick to puma and other who only wear adidas , " he said .
" people do make the distinction . " and while most think things are better now that rivalry has cooled , some knew how to make the most of it when it was raging , frank dassler says .
he remembers that when handymen would come to work at his grandfather 's house , they would sometimes wear adidas shoes on purpose .

the pieces have all fallen into place for germany .
they are the hosts , jürgen klinsmann 's xi are in form , and they have the " big " country monkey off their back .
but germany 's history against italy is not a golden one . between them , germany and italy have collected six world cups , three times each .
coach jürgen klinsmann won it as a player in 1990 in italy .
but that final was against argentina who had knocked out the hosts in the semi-finals on penalties .
in contests with the azzurri however , germany can hardly rely on a successful history .
head-to-head , germany have won only seven times compared to 13 losses in 28 matches . in major competitions , italy have had germany 's number .
they took home the world cup in 1982 , beating germany 3-1 in madrid for what was their third title .
the legendary squadra azzurra led by paolo rossi made short shrift of jupp derwall 's finalists and underlined their claim as being europe 's strongest soccer nation with that championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the azzurri flew higher than germany in the 1982 final as important as that game was since it was a final , it was a semi-final , like the one this tuesday , that has gone down in history and remained etched in the memories of those who lived to see and hear it . under a broiling midday sun in mexico city , germany and italy played 120 minutes , before coach ferruccio valcareggi 's italy came out on top 4-3 in what has recently been voted as the " game of the century " in a fifa poll .
in mexico , the match has such great meaning that a plaque commemorates the contest at the aztec stadium . an injured ' kaiser ' and a high-flying ' bomber ' the circumstances that evolved during the game make it understandable why it is considered the classic game in world cup history .
italy went ahead after just eight minutes .
germany finally leveled in injury time on a goal by karl heinz schnellinger , forcing the match into extra-time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy celebrated at the end of the " game of the century " in mexico germany 's one-man wrecking crew gerd ' der bomber ' müller put germany ahead quickly before italy pulled ahead over the course of five minutes .
müller , who scored ten goals alone in the 1970 finals , got the equalizer in the 110th minute .
but while the replays were still being shown of his goal , gianni rivera won the game for the italians . franz beckenbauer 's heroics would go down in history after he played much of the two extra-time periods with his arm in a sling after sustaining a broken clavicle on an italian foul . stifling defenses in other affairs in their two other world cup meetings , germany and italy did n't provide any fireworks as in the 1970 semifinal .
in 1962 in chile , the two played to a scoreless draw in the first round .
in 1978 , both teams failed to find the net in a second round encounter . at european championships , germany have also failed to beat the southern europeans .
as hosts in 1988 , germany drew against the italians 1-1 .
in england eight years later , fans had to endure a goalless affair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack -lrb- left -rrb- and alessandro nesta battle in march as much as those games were dominated by stingy defenses , they happened long ago .
in their most recent encounter in florence , a world cup warm-up , italy pushed the germans to their nadir with a 4-1 thrashing .
that is a score jürgen klinsmann would like to settle . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup semi-final , 1970 : italy vs. west germany germany were looking for world cup glory after the disappointment of 1966 .

the pieces have all fallen into place for germany .
they are the hosts , jürgen klinsmann 's xi are in form , and they have the " big " country monkey off their back .
but germany 's history against italy is not a golden one . between them , germany and italy have collected six world cups , three times each .
coach jürgen klinsmann won it as a player in 1990 in italy .
but that final was against argentina who had knocked out the hosts in the semi-finals on penalties .
in contests with the azzurri however , germany can hardly rely on a successful history .
head-to-head , germany have won only seven times compared to 13 losses in 28 matches . in major competitions , italy have had germany 's number .
they took home the world cup in 1982 , beating germany 3-1 in madrid for what was their third title .
the legendary squadra azzurra led by paolo rossi made short shrift of jupp derwall 's finalists and underlined their claim as being europe 's strongest soccer nation with that championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the azzurri flew higher than germany in the 1982 final as important as that game was since it was a final , it was a semi-final , like the one this tuesday , that has gone down in history and remained etched in the memories of those who lived to see and hear it . under a broiling midday sun in mexico city , germany and italy played 120 minutes , before coach ferruccio valcareggi 's italy came out on top 4-3 in what has recently been voted as the " game of the century " in a fifa poll .
in mexico , the match has such great meaning that a plaque commemorates the contest at the aztec stadium . an injured ' kaiser ' and a high-flying ' bomber ' the circumstances that evolved during the game make it understandable why it is considered the classic game in world cup history .
italy went ahead after just eight minutes .
germany finally leveled in injury time on a goal by karl heinz schnellinger , forcing the match into extra-time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy celebrated at the end of the " game of the century " in mexico germany 's one-man wrecking crew gerd ' der bomber ' müller put germany ahead quickly before italy pulled ahead over the course of five minutes .
müller , who scored ten goals alone in the 1970 finals , got the equalizer in the 110th minute .
but while the replays were still being shown of his goal , gianni rivera won the game for the italians . franz beckenbauer 's heroics would go down in history after he played much of the two extra-time periods with his arm in a sling after sustaining a broken clavicle on an italian foul . stifling defenses in other affairs in their two other world cup meetings , germany and italy did n't provide any fireworks as in the 1970 semifinal .
in 1962 in chile , the two played to a scoreless draw in the first round .
in 1978 , both teams failed to find the net in a second round encounter . at european championships , germany have also failed to beat the southern europeans .
as hosts in 1988 , germany drew against the italians 1-1 .
in england eight years later , fans had to endure a goalless affair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack -lrb- left -rrb- and alessandro nesta battle in march as much as those games were dominated by stingy defenses , they happened long ago .
in their most recent encounter in florence , a world cup warm-up , italy pushed the germans to their nadir with a 4-1 thrashing .

" this is an important breakthrough we have succeeded in making , " merkel said after the late-night huddle . from 2008 , tax revenues will incrementally be used to fund the system . around 1.5 billion in tax revenue will go toward health insurance for children in 2008 and double that amount in 2009 . a central health-care fund will be introduced to pool contributions made by workers and employees as well as the tax money .
the fund will pass on money to insurance companies , who - should they require additional funding - can also raise cash directly from their members through a levy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those covered by public insurers began paying more for prescriptions in 2004 in contrast to earlier plans , private health insurers will not contribute to the fund , although they would have to play a bigger part in " stabilizing the health care system , " chancellor merkel said . reduction of overall tax burden for companies the coalition also agreed to reduce the overall tax burden on german companies to just under 30 percent from around 39 percent , bavarian premier edmund stoiber said . a new flat-rate withholding tax at 25 percent will be levied on capital gains , including interest and dividend income and the gains from asset sales . the reforms are a key test of merkel 's government as it seeks to overhaul europe 's biggest economy . the thorniest issue had been the question of how to fund changes to health care , expected to cost at least 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.3 billion -rrb- . conservatives are eager to reduce non-wage labor costs while social democrats want higher earners to shoulder more of the funding burden . merkel said on monday using tax revenue would lead to a drop in employment costs . germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in europe german workers and employers currently jointly contribute around 14 percent of an employee 's wage packet to pay for statutory healthcare , but due to the country 's ageing population and low birth rate the system has come under strain as the number of contributors shrinks . as non-wage employment costs rise to try to compensate , labor becomes too expensive , reducing the incentive for firms to invest in germany and helping to force companies abroad . germany 's healthcare system costs around 140 billion euros a year and results in some of the highest non-wage labor costs in europe . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german coalition agrees on tax for wealthy , other reforms germany 's grand coalition government spent a long night in negotiations over key reforms .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel forgeard -lrb- left -rrb- and gustav humbert were forced out forgeard and humbert had been under intense pressure to quit since the news of the a380 delays in mid-june wiped 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- off eads ’ s market value and left airbus trailing us rival boeing . the chief of france ’ s state-owned sncf rail company , louis gallois , is to replace forgeard .
gallois , 62 , is a former head of french state company aerospatiale , whose toulouse factories are now part of eads . gallois also ran aero-engine manufacturer snecma , now part of the defense and communications group safran .
he is already an eads board member . christian streiff , 51 , a former deputy ceo of french building materials group saint gobain , is to succeed humbert as the head of airbus . streiff is an industry outsider , reportedly brought in because of his experiences in managing complex industrial processes .
bilingual in french and german , he worked for 15 years on behalf of glassmaker saint gobain in germany . german eads head stays on the position of tom enders , who remains the german co-ceo of eads , has now been significantly strengthened .
enders is to assume responsibility for the airbus shareholder committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french rail chief louis gallois is to take over as co-ceo of eads in an effort to preserve the delicate balance of national power inside the company , streiff will report to enders .
under the previous management set-up , humbert had reported to forgeard himself . german economics minister michael glos welcomed the change in eads leadership , saying in a statement on monday that the decision showed the company " recognized its responsibility for its core business , airbus . " glos also said he hoped the new management structure " would be received positively by the market . " but on monday , eads had failed to bounce back from its recently trampled share price .
the group 's shares initially rose as much as 1.7 percent , but then fell again by more than 2 percent . eads shares fell 26 percent when a380 delays were announced on june 14 . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de superjumbo 's delays spell bosses ' demise the french co-chief executive of eads , noel forgeard , and the german chief of european aircraft manufacturer airbus , gustav humbert , resigned on sunday , the european aerospace company said in a statement .

one of these teams will win the 2006 world cup .
but which team should win it ?
each country stands to offer something very different to the world by being crowned champions . there is one truism in soccer that continues to hold : the best team does n't always win .
playing great soccer does n't always guarantee success .
given that soccer is as much about good fortune as good performances , maybe we should forget about who has the right to win the world cup on the basis of their displays and look at which team should win the world cup for other reasons . germany has been riding a wave of euphoria ever since the first game of the tournament proved that klinsmann 's kids were not the huge risk that everyone though they would be .
with every game , the nation 's smile has gotten broader . germans have displayed a new enthusiasm and pride in their country which would surely increase even further should the national team with the cup .
the collective hope - now bordering on unwavering belief - that the world cup will stay in germany after july 9 has brought the people together , uniting germans of all backgrounds and ethnicities . this has not been lost on those outside the country 's borders .
the most pleasant side effect of this tournament is the image of germany as an inclusive , friendly and welcoming nation .
the german people themselves have shown that they are not the dull , humorless race of a sausage-scarfing , beer-swilling stereotypes but a nation capable of putting on one hell of a party and playing a great host to those who want to join in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup : uniting people even if germany were to go out to italy in the semi-finals , the enduring image of the world cup will be the millions of germans celebrating together with fans from all over the globe , turning this tournament into a soccer summer of love . but if michael ballack were to lift the trophy in berlin this new german belief , pride and positivity would go to another , hopefully , sustainable level .
it could provide germany , a country which has suffered from collective depression for so long , a solid base for a social recovery .
this is why germany should win . italy : stain of corruption italy find themselves in a real quandary .
if they lift the trophy on july 9 , they may be the first world champions to be crowned on the day that a court rules that their game is endemically corrupt .
the investigation into match-fixing back home could come to a close on the day of the world cup final and , if those at the top of the italian game are found guilty by the findings , soccer in italy could be set back a decade . top clubs like juventus , ac milan , fiorentina and lazio are in the dock as investigators look into allegations that corrupt referees manipulated matches , mostly in favor of champions juventus , who have won four of the past five championships .
the turin club could be stripped of their titles and relegated , meaning a high number of italy 's squad would be returning to second , even third-division soccer . because soccer defeat in italy is something akin to national bereavement , the country would enter a period of mourning that could affect all aspects of italian life for many years to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians could demand a massive clean-up campaign if they would win the world cup , then the italians would have a title to live up to .
such is the pride in their team and their country , the italians would demand that their game be purged of those who have dragged it into the mire . a world cup victory could provide the catalyst for empowerment both in society and in soccer circles , leading to a cleansing of the italian game .
this is why italy should win the world cup . france : public unity when france won the world cup in 1998 , the team was heralded as a success story for the country 's integration policies , fielding descendents from colonies such as surinam , algeria and guadeloupe .
the knock-on effects of that win and of a team built up of players of different ethnicities carried france as country on a wave of unity for many months . history now shows that the gloss of the ' 98 world cup win was no more than paper over the serious cracks in french society and that it was just a matter of time until the failure of france 's integration experiment was once again clear to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars have made way for a huge french love-in the riots of 2005 and the student protests of earlier this year have abated but the sources of french discontent remain .
while the experiences of 1998 tell us that a french world cup win in 2006 will not cure the ills , it would provide some relief .
coming in the year of a presidential election , a wave of optimism flowing from an incredible swansong for zidane and the old guard could sweep through france and bring about real change . the french team have already stood up to the far-right jean marie le pen and have declared unswerving allegiance to la grande nation in the face of nationalistic slurs .
a victory in germany for the multicultural bleus could inspire their splintered country to take similar action and bring the sometimes warring sides together .
this is why france should win the world cup . portugal : reform inspiration portugal may be seen by some as the party-crashers of the semi-finals .
figo and co. find themselves in illustrious company made up of former world champions .
a country which has yet to win an international title , portugal could be the flag-bearers for all those teams outside the perceived hierarchy of " big " teams who are consistently touted as favorites .
a world cup win for portugal would give hope to all those outside that exclusive club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal would be champions by fair means or foul but a world cup win for portugal would also send out another message : that play-acting and cynicism can get you as far as playing the other team off the park .
a victory in berlin for this portuguese team would be a triumph of simulation .
no other team has conned referees or intimidated the opposition more at this world cup , and considering that holland , italy and argentina all featured - that 's worthy of a trophy on its own . in an ideal world , a win for portugal on july 9 would shock soccer 's governing bodies into much-needed action .
a world cup victory for portugal should mean an overhaul of the game 's rules , the clear rewriting of what is unacceptable and widespread reform of the increasingly ugly beautiful game .

one of these teams will win the 2006 world cup .
but which team should win it ?
each country stands to offer something very different to the world by being crowned champions . there is one truism in soccer that continues to hold : the best team does n't always win .
playing great soccer does n't always guarantee success .
given that soccer is as much about good fortune as good performances , maybe we should forget about who has the right to win the world cup on the basis of their displays and look at which team should win the world cup for other reasons . germany has been riding a wave of euphoria ever since the first game of the tournament proved that klinsmann 's kids were not the huge risk that everyone though they would be .
with every game , the nation 's smile has gotten broader . germans have displayed a new enthusiasm and pride in their country which would surely increase even further should the national team with the cup .
the collective hope - now bordering on unwavering belief - that the world cup will stay in germany after july 9 has brought the people together , uniting germans of all backgrounds and ethnicities . this has not been lost on those outside the country 's borders .
the most pleasant side effect of this tournament is the image of germany as an inclusive , friendly and welcoming nation .
the german people themselves have shown that they are not the dull , humorless race of a sausage-scarfing , beer-swilling stereotypes but a nation capable of putting on one hell of a party and playing a great host to those who want to join in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup : uniting people even if germany were to go out to italy in the semi-finals , the enduring image of the world cup will be the millions of germans celebrating together with fans from all over the globe , turning this tournament into a soccer summer of love . but if michael ballack were to lift the trophy in berlin this new german belief , pride and positivity would go to another , hopefully , sustainable level .
it could provide germany , a country which has suffered from collective depression for so long , a solid base for a social recovery .
this is why germany should win . italy : stain of corruption italy find themselves in a real quandary .
if they lift the trophy on july 9 , they may be the first world champions to be crowned on the day that a court rules that their game is endemically corrupt .
the investigation into match-fixing back home could come to a close on the day of the world cup final and , if those at the top of the italian game are found guilty by the findings , soccer in italy could be set back a decade . top clubs like juventus , ac milan , fiorentina and lazio are in the dock as investigators look into allegations that corrupt referees manipulated matches , mostly in favor of champions juventus , who have won four of the past five championships .
the turin club could be stripped of their titles and relegated , meaning a high number of italy 's squad would be returning to second , even third-division soccer . because soccer defeat in italy is something akin to national bereavement , the country would enter a period of mourning that could affect all aspects of italian life for many years to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians could demand a massive clean-up campaign if they would win the world cup , then the italians would have a title to live up to .
such is the pride in their team and their country , the italians would demand that their game be purged of those who have dragged it into the mire . a world cup victory could provide the catalyst for empowerment both in society and in soccer circles , leading to a cleansing of the italian game .
this is why italy should win the world cup . france : public unity when france won the world cup in 1998 , the team was heralded as a success story for the country 's integration policies , fielding descendents from colonies such as surinam , algeria and guadeloupe .
the knock-on effects of that win and of a team built up of players of different ethnicities carried france as country on a wave of unity for many months . history now shows that the gloss of the ' 98 world cup win was no more than paper over the serious cracks in french society and that it was just a matter of time until the failure of france 's integration experiment was once again clear to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars have made way for a huge french love-in the riots of 2005 and the student protests of earlier this year have abated but the sources of french discontent remain .
while the experiences of 1998 tell us that a french world cup win in 2006 will not cure the ills , it would provide some relief .
coming in the year of a presidential election , a wave of optimism flowing from an incredible swansong for zidane and the old guard could sweep through france and bring about real change . the french team have already stood up to the far-right jean marie le pen and have declared unswerving allegiance to la grande nation in the face of nationalistic slurs .
a victory in germany for the multicultural bleus could inspire their splintered country to take similar action and bring the sometimes warring sides together .
this is why france should win the world cup . portugal : reform inspiration portugal may be seen by some as the party-crashers of the semi-finals .
figo and co. find themselves in illustrious company made up of former world champions .
a country which has yet to win an international title , portugal could be the flag-bearers for all those teams outside the perceived hierarchy of " big " teams who are consistently touted as favorites .
a world cup win for portugal would give hope to all those outside that exclusive club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal would be champions by fair means or foul but a world cup win for portugal would also send out another message : that play-acting and cynicism can get you as far as playing the other team off the park .
a victory in berlin for this portuguese team would be a triumph of simulation .
no other team has conned referees or intimidated the opposition more at this world cup , and considering that holland , italy and argentina all featured - that 's worthy of a trophy on its own . in an ideal world , a win for portugal on july 9 would shock soccer 's governing bodies into much-needed action .

many routes are sought after by travelers who enjoy relaxing on a cruise ship and letting the world drift by . for some , a cruise is the ultimate upmarket vacation , while for others it means boring bourgeoisie .
but the view from the deck of a cruise ship does n't always have to be drab and monotonous . the alternative to a high-sea tour is to take an inland river cruise on one of germany 's many trafficked waterways - and take in german cultural history along the way .
opportunities for multiple-day trips are plentiful - whether on the rhine , the weser , the danube or the moselle . the river rhine - muse of poets and painters the rhine is germany 's most famous river , in part because so much has been written about it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loreley on the rhine has been an inspiration to creative minds for centuries it was mainly the romantic painters and poets of the mid-19th century that turned their attention to the water cutting through the western edge of germany .
heinrich heine -lrb- 1797-1856 -rrb- , for example , dedicated one of his world famous poems to the lorelei cliffs that overlook the rhine near st. goarshausen . a trip down the rhine can be particularly romantic , despite the occasional turbulence-causing shallows . following the footprints of the romantics for the traveler interested in learning more about the history and culture of southern germany , a cruise on the danube river would be a good choice .
europe 's second longest river , the danube has a wealth of history to offer its visitors - even the romans left their traces along the river . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medieval regensburg is a highlight on europe 's second longest river , the beautiful blue danube the danube flows by the medieval city of regensburg , then crosses the german border and continues on to vienna and budapest .

visitors glide past natural parks like the maerkische schweiz and unique everglades like the oderbruch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some unusual musicians await visitors in bremen on the weser a river trip from magdeburg to prague is a good option for the traveler with plenty of time .
the elbe , the most important waterway between southeastern and northeastern europe , is over 1,000 kilometers -lrb- 621 miles -rrb- long .
the bauhaus city of dessau and martin luther 's wittenberg are located near the banks of the elbe , as are meissen with its china manufacturers and dresden , the capital of saxony . fairy tale travels on the weser many german fairy tales and legends have their roots on the river .
a traveler on the weser river , for example , passes through northern germany where the legendary musicians attract visitors to bremen and , a bit further upriver , the pied piper whistles river-drifters to hamelin . dw staff -lrb- pt / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de florence on the elbe turns 800 dresden was once one of europe ’ s most beautiful cities , but in 1945 allied bombers turned what was known as " florence on the elbe " into a pile of rubble .

the pieces have all fallen into place for germany .
they are the hosts , jürgen klinsmann 's xi are in form , and they have the " big " country monkey off their back .
but germany 's history against italy is not a golden one . between them , germany and italy have collected six world cups , three times each .
coach jürgen klinsmann won it as a player in 1990 in italy .
but that final was against argentina who had knocked out the hosts in the semi-finals on penalties .
in contests with the azzurri however , germany can hardly rely on a successful history .
head-to-head , germany have won only seven times compared to 13 losses in 28 matches . in major competitions , italy have had germany 's number .
they took home the world cup in 1982 , beating germany 3-1 in madrid for what was their third title .
the legendary squadra azzurra led by paolo rossi made short shrift of jupp derwall 's finalists and underlined their claim as being europe 's strongest soccer nation with that championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the azzurri flew higher than germany in the 1982 final as important as that game was since it was a final , it was a semi-final , like the one this tuesday , that has gone down in history and remained etched in the memories of those who lived to see and hear it . under a broiling midday sun in mexico city , germany and italy played 120 minutes , before coach ferruccio valcareggi 's italy came out on top 4-3 in what has recently been voted as the " game of the century " in a fifa poll .
in mexico , the match has such great meaning that a plaque commemorates the contest at the aztec stadium . an injured ' kaiser ' and a high-flying ' bomber ' the circumstances that evolved during the game make it understandable why it is considered the classic game in world cup history .
italy went ahead after just eight minutes .
germany finally leveled in injury time on a goal by karl heinz schnellinger , forcing the match into extra-time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy celebrated at the end of the " game of the century " in mexico germany 's one-man wrecking crew gerd ' der bomber ' müller put germany ahead quickly before italy pulled ahead over the course of five minutes .
müller , who scored ten goals alone in the 1970 finals , got the equalizer in the 110th minute .
but while the replays were still being shown of his goal , gianni rivera won the game for the italians . franz beckenbauer 's heroics would go down in history after he played much of the two extra-time periods with his arm in a sling after sustaining a broken clavicle on an italian foul . stifling defenses in other affairs in their two other world cup meetings , germany and italy did n't provide any fireworks as in the 1970 semifinal .
in 1962 in chile , the two played to a scoreless draw in the first round .
in 1978 , both teams failed to find the net in a second round encounter . at european championships , germany have also failed to beat the southern europeans .
as hosts in 1988 , germany drew against the italians 1-1 .
in england eight years later , fans had to endure a goalless affair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack -lrb- left -rrb- and alessandro nesta battle in march as much as those games were dominated by stingy defenses , they happened long ago .
in their most recent encounter in florence , a world cup warm-up , italy pushed the germans to their nadir with a 4-1 thrashing .
that is a score jürgen klinsmann would like to settle . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup semi-final , 1970 : italy vs. west germany germany were looking for world cup glory after the disappointment of 1966 .

" we will be a neutral party and will not take sides with anyone , " jung said following a meeting with congo 's defense minister , adolphe onusumba , in kinshasa . congo could remain a dangerous area , jung said , until final election results rolled in presumably at the end of august .
however , he said he was certain eu peacekeeping troops would deter violence . jung said the around 2,000 european troops are obligated to remain neutral .
congo 's opposition parties have feared that the european troops would aid the current president , joseph kabila , to remain in office . german help after the elections during his visit , jung is scheduled to meet with representatives of the government and with the independent election commission 's director , muholongu malumalu .
opposition leaders , he said , did not have time to meet . jung promised onusumba additional help from germany following the election , saying continued cooperation would likely center around training congo 's military troops .
the goal , jung said , is to help congo be able to ensure stability and security alone in the future . after years of civil war , congo is currently building up a regular army of 120,000 soldiers . jung intends to stay in the region until tuesday .
he will be viewing the european troops ' military bases in kinshasa and neighboring gabon 's capital , libreville . german troops may guard polling stations germany currently has less than 100 peacekeepers in the region , but that figure will rise to 500 german troops and 280 support personnel by election day on july 30th when 25 million congolese go to the polls to choose a new president and parliament . most of the german troops will be deployed in gabon .
their primary purpose will be to fly into congo and rescue united nations election observers should violence break out during the polls .
the dpa news agency , however , reported that sources in kinshasa said german troops may guard election stations and transport polling ballots . the german troops are part of a 2,000-strong european union force with a four-month mandate that is supporting an existing 17,000-soldier un peacekeeping force in the country and surrounding area . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soldiers barred from congo mission after sex scandal the german defense ministry has said that a group of paratroopers allegedly involved in bizarre sexual practices in the barracks wo n't participate in the dr congo mission to safeguard elections there .

for decades , the rivalry split the town in two . the small aurach river gurgles through the heart of herzogenaurach , population 24,000 , and gives the town its name .
but this peaceful , meandering waterway once symbolized a bitter , protracted family feud that divided the town into two distinct camps . it was all about footwear . " the town became known as the town where people tend to look down because you 'd always tend to look at shoes the person is wearing before you strike up a conversation , " said barbara smit , a dutch financial journalist and one of the authors to tackle the story of the dassler brothers , rudolf and adolf . they started out making shoes together before having a terrible falling out .
their argument resulted in the creation of two sports giants , puma and adidas , both still based in the provincial town . partners , then enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf -lrb- adi -rrb- dassler in 1978 rudolf and younger brother adolf , rudi and adi to friends , began their shoe business in their mother 's laundry room in the 1920s .
at the time , electricity supplies in the town were unreliable , and the brothers sometimes had to use pedal power from a stationary bicycle to run their equipment . " they were very different characters , " said smit .
" adi dassler was always more thoughtful , a craftsman who enjoyed nothing more than fiddling with his shoes .
whereas rudolf dassler was a more abrasive , loudmouthed salesman .
they complemented each other very well to begin with . " their new , lightweight sports shoes began to attract attention and they moved into a location south of the aurach river near the train station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jesse owens the dassler brothers shoe factory jumped onto the world stage in 1936 when they found themselves providing footwear for american jessie owens , who won four gold medals at the berlin olympics . but after the war , the fraternal relationship fell apart .
in smit 's book , " pitch invasion , " she theorizes that it could have had something to do with nazi party links and that after rudolf was picked up by american soldiers and accused of being a member of the ss , he was convinced that his brother had turned him in .
others speculate it could have had something to do with their wives , or a simple misunderstanding in a bomb shelter .
no one really knows for sure . what is certain is that they felt they could no longer work together and in 1948 the dassler brothers shoe factory was split in two . " more of less in the middle of the night , rudolf dassler packed his bags and moved on the other side of the little river , " said smit .
" he established puma on the other side .
from there on in , the town was really split in two like a sort of mini berlin with this little river as a partition in the middle . " and like berlin 's famous wall , it was n't advisable to cross over , at least when it came to shoes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reconstruction of adolf dassler 's early shoe workshop brand loyalty became paramount for many residents .
two camps formed , and dug in . there were stores , bakers and bars which were unofficially known as either loyal to rudolf 's puma , or to adolf 's new company , adidas , which he named using his nickname , adi , and the first three letters of his last name .
there were two soccer teams : the asv herzogenaurach club wore the three stripes ; the 1 fc herzogenaurach had the jumping cat on its footwear .
intermarriage was frowned upon . " i knew a butcher who played for the puma team , " said ernst ditrich who works at the town 's museum .
" he told us the guys from the adidas team did n't need to bother buying at his store .
he did n't want to do business with them .
that sort of thing happened . " wayward son the brothers never did reconcile .
while they are buried in the same cemetery , their graves are about as far apart as possible .
but one of their descendents decided the family feud had gone on long enough . frank dassler is the grandson of rudolf dassler and grew up living and breathing puma .
growing up , he had no contact at all with his great-uncle adolf 's family . " they stayed kind of enemies during the rest of their lives , " he said .
" it 's certainly sad , but from a business point of view it was a good decision , since it motivated both companies to innovate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the adidas " world of sports " headquarters but these days , frank dassler sits not in puma 's new glass-and-steel headquarters on the bank of the river , but in an office at the adidas campus further north , on the site of a former american army barracks .
two years ago , he took a job as the adidas group 's head legal counsel . " my stepmother and my stepbrother were n't very happy about this decision , they thought it would be a betrayal against my grandfather , " he said . his taboo breaking raised more than a few eyebrows in the town and the local newspapers were not always so kind . " but this rivalry was years ago , it 's history now , " he said . lost its punch indeed , young people today seem little concerned with the once-intense rivalry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puma 's had new strength in its spring for the past few years " it 's not so strong anymore .
it was like that before , but now , i do n't think people care so much , " said 14-year-old teresa , who was wearing puma shoes but carrying an adidas bag .
" sometimes puma has something better , sometimes adidas .
it just depends .

however , he said he was certain eu peacekeeping troops would deter violence . jung said the around 2,000 european troops are obligated to remain neutral .
congo 's opposition parties have feared that the european troops would aid the current president , joseph kabila , to remain in office . german help after the elections during his visit , jung is scheduled to meet with representatives of the government and with the independent election commission 's director , muholongu malumalu .

bruno has gained so much popularity and support both in germany and around the world that 300 people staged a protest near the berlin cathedral on saturday . demonstration leader kurt eicher told the afp news agency that evidence clearly showed that bruno had been wrongly shot .
eicher also accused the bavarian environment ministry of violating the law protecting endangered animals by giving the " shoot-to-kill " order to hunters . animal protection groups file formal complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : idyllic bavaria is where bruno met his death last week bavarian environment minister werner schnappauf has been under fire himself for his shoot-to-kill order .
munich prosecutors said they have received a flood of requests asking that criminal charges be brought against schnappauf and others responsible for the decision to kill the bear . the public prosecutor 's office said it would decide at the end of the week whether it would begin preliminary proceedings . a poll last week by the forsa institute of over 1,000 germans said 70 percent of germans agreed with the shooting , but regretted bruno 's death .

according to the ap and dpa news agencies , italian environment minister alfonso pecoraro scanio will formally ask germany on monday to give back bruno 's body . bruno was killed by a government-sanctioned hunter in bavaria last week after having first been spotted in germany in may .
part of a project to reintroduce the predators to northern italy , the bear roamed into austria and germany , killed sheep and rabbits , stole honey and was in the headlines across europe for weeks . fearing the two-year-old bear would one day target humans , officials in the southern state of bavaria granted permission to kill him even though he was the first wild bear to be seen in germany since 1835 . italian environment minister alfonso pecoraro scanio has protested the killing and said that the bear should have been shot with tranquilizers and transported back to italy . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vacationing a no-no in bear-killing bavaria what 's an animal rights activist with summer vacation plans in bavaria to do ?

only 24 percent said they were relieved that the bear no longer posed a threat . still , bruno was on world cup fans ' minds over the weekend .

bruno , however , stemmed from the italian region of trentino .
according to the ap and dpa news agencies , italian environment minister alfonso pecoraro scanio will formally ask germany on monday to give back bruno 's body . bruno was killed by a government-sanctioned hunter in bavaria last week after having first been spotted in germany in may .
part of a project to reintroduce the predators to northern italy , the bear roamed into austria and germany , killed sheep and rabbits , stole honey and was in the headlines across europe for weeks . fearing the two-year-old bear would one day target humans , officials in the southern state of bavaria granted permission to kill him even though he was the first wild bear to be seen in germany since 1835 . italian environment minister alfonso pecoraro scanio has protested the killing and said that the bear should have been shot with tranquilizers and transported back to italy . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vacationing a no-no in bear-killing bavaria what 's an animal rights activist with summer vacation plans in bavaria to do ?

the pieces have all fallen into place for germany .
they are the hosts , jürgen klinsmann 's xi are in form , and they have the " big " country monkey off their back .
but germany 's history against italy is not a golden one . between them , germany and italy have collected six world cups , three times each .
coach jürgen klinsmann won it as a player in 1990 in italy .
but that final was against argentina who had knocked out the hosts in the semi-finals on penalties .
in contests with the azzurri however , germany can hardly rely on a successful history .
head-to-head , germany have won only seven times compared to 13 losses in 28 matches . in major competitions , italy have had germany 's number .

in mexico , the match has such great meaning that a plaque commemorates the contest at the aztec stadium . an injured ' kaiser ' and a high-flying ' bomber ' the circumstances that evolved during the game make it understandable why it is considered the classic game in world cup history .

the pieces have all fallen into place for germany .
they are the hosts , jürgen klinsmann 's xi are in form , and they have the " big " country monkey off their back .
but germany 's history against italy is not a golden one . between them , germany and italy have collected six world cups , three times each .
coach jürgen klinsmann won it as a player in 1990 in italy .
but that final was against argentina who had knocked out the hosts in the semi-finals on penalties .
in contests with the azzurri however , germany can hardly rely on a successful history .
head-to-head , germany have won only seven times compared to 13 losses in 28 matches . in major competitions , italy have had germany 's number .
they took home the world cup in 1982 , beating germany 3-1 in madrid for what was their third title .
the legendary squadra azzurra led by paolo rossi made short shrift of jupp derwall 's finalists and underlined their claim as being europe 's strongest soccer nation with that championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the azzurri flew higher than germany in the 1982 final as important as that game was since it was a final , it was a semi-final , like the one this tuesday , that has gone down in history and remained etched in the memories of those who lived to see and hear it . under a broiling midday sun in mexico city , germany and italy played 120 minutes , before coach ferruccio valcareggi 's italy came out on top 4-3 in what has recently been voted as the " game of the century " in a fifa poll .
in mexico , the match has such great meaning that a plaque commemorates the contest at the aztec stadium . an injured ' kaiser ' and a high-flying ' bomber ' the circumstances that evolved during the game make it understandable why it is considered the classic game in world cup history .
italy went ahead after just eight minutes .
germany finally leveled in injury time on a goal by karl heinz schnellinger , forcing the match into extra-time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy celebrated at the end of the " game of the century " in mexico germany 's one-man wrecking crew gerd ' der bomber ' müller put germany ahead quickly before italy pulled ahead over the course of five minutes .
müller , who scored ten goals alone in the 1970 finals , got the equalizer in the 110th minute .
but while the replays were still being shown of his goal , gianni rivera won the game for the italians . franz beckenbauer 's heroics would go down in history after he played much of the two extra-time periods with his arm in a sling after sustaining a broken clavicle on an italian foul . stifling defenses in other affairs in their two other world cup meetings , germany and italy did n't provide any fireworks as in the 1970 semifinal .
in 1962 in chile , the two played to a scoreless draw in the first round .
in 1978 , both teams failed to find the net in a second round encounter . at european championships , germany have also failed to beat the southern europeans .
as hosts in 1988 , germany drew against the italians 1-1 .
in england eight years later , fans had to endure a goalless affair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack -lrb- left -rrb- and alessandro nesta battle in march as much as those games were dominated by stingy defenses , they happened long ago .

" we will be a neutral party and will not take sides with anyone , " jung said following a meeting with congo 's defense minister , adolphe onusumba , in kinshasa . congo could remain a dangerous area , jung said , until final election results rolled in presumably at the end of august .
however , he said he was certain eu peacekeeping troops would deter violence . jung said the around 2,000 european troops are obligated to remain neutral .
congo 's opposition parties have feared that the european troops would aid the current president , joseph kabila , to remain in office . german help after the elections during his visit , jung is scheduled to meet with representatives of the government and with the independent election commission 's director , muholongu malumalu .
opposition leaders , he said , did not have time to meet . jung promised onusumba additional help from germany following the election , saying continued cooperation would likely center around training congo 's military troops .
the goal , jung said , is to help congo be able to ensure stability and security alone in the future . after years of civil war , congo is currently building up a regular army of 120,000 soldiers . jung intends to stay in the region until tuesday .
he will be viewing the european troops ' military bases in kinshasa and neighboring gabon 's capital , libreville . german troops may guard polling stations germany currently has less than 100 peacekeepers in the region , but that figure will rise to 500 german troops and 280 support personnel by election day on july 30th when 25 million congolese go to the polls to choose a new president and parliament . most of the german troops will be deployed in gabon .
their primary purpose will be to fly into congo and rescue united nations election observers should violence break out during the polls .

for decades , the rivalry split the town in two . the small aurach river gurgles through the heart of herzogenaurach , population 24,000 , and gives the town its name .
but this peaceful , meandering waterway once symbolized a bitter , protracted family feud that divided the town into two distinct camps . it was all about footwear . " the town became known as the town where people tend to look down because you 'd always tend to look at shoes the person is wearing before you strike up a conversation , " said barbara smit , a dutch financial journalist and one of the authors to tackle the story of the dassler brothers , rudolf and adolf . they started out making shoes together before having a terrible falling out .
their argument resulted in the creation of two sports giants , puma and adidas , both still based in the provincial town . partners , then enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf -lrb- adi -rrb- dassler in 1978 rudolf and younger brother adolf , rudi and adi to friends , began their shoe business in their mother 's laundry room in the 1920s .
at the time , electricity supplies in the town were unreliable , and the brothers sometimes had to use pedal power from a stationary bicycle to run their equipment . " they were very different characters , " said smit .
" adi dassler was always more thoughtful , a craftsman who enjoyed nothing more than fiddling with his shoes .
whereas rudolf dassler was a more abrasive , loudmouthed salesman .
they complemented each other very well to begin with . " their new , lightweight sports shoes began to attract attention and they moved into a location south of the aurach river near the train station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jesse owens the dassler brothers shoe factory jumped onto the world stage in 1936 when they found themselves providing footwear for american jessie owens , who won four gold medals at the berlin olympics . but after the war , the fraternal relationship fell apart .
in smit 's book , " pitch invasion , " she theorizes that it could have had something to do with nazi party links and that after rudolf was picked up by american soldiers and accused of being a member of the ss , he was convinced that his brother had turned him in .
others speculate it could have had something to do with their wives , or a simple misunderstanding in a bomb shelter .
no one really knows for sure . what is certain is that they felt they could no longer work together and in 1948 the dassler brothers shoe factory was split in two . " more of less in the middle of the night , rudolf dassler packed his bags and moved on the other side of the little river , " said smit .
" he established puma on the other side .
from there on in , the town was really split in two like a sort of mini berlin with this little river as a partition in the middle . " and like berlin 's famous wall , it was n't advisable to cross over , at least when it came to shoes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reconstruction of adolf dassler 's early shoe workshop brand loyalty became paramount for many residents .
two camps formed , and dug in . there were stores , bakers and bars which were unofficially known as either loyal to rudolf 's puma , or to adolf 's new company , adidas , which he named using his nickname , adi , and the first three letters of his last name .
there were two soccer teams : the asv herzogenaurach club wore the three stripes ; the 1 fc herzogenaurach had the jumping cat on its footwear .
intermarriage was frowned upon . " i knew a butcher who played for the puma team , " said ernst ditrich who works at the town 's museum .
" he told us the guys from the adidas team did n't need to bother buying at his store .
he did n't want to do business with them .
that sort of thing happened . " wayward son the brothers never did reconcile .
while they are buried in the same cemetery , their graves are about as far apart as possible .
but one of their descendents decided the family feud had gone on long enough . frank dassler is the grandson of rudolf dassler and grew up living and breathing puma .
growing up , he had no contact at all with his great-uncle adolf 's family . " they stayed kind of enemies during the rest of their lives , " he said .
" it 's certainly sad , but from a business point of view it was a good decision , since it motivated both companies to innovate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the adidas " world of sports " headquarters but these days , frank dassler sits not in puma 's new glass-and-steel headquarters on the bank of the river , but in an office at the adidas campus further north , on the site of a former american army barracks .
two years ago , he took a job as the adidas group 's head legal counsel . " my stepmother and my stepbrother were n't very happy about this decision , they thought it would be a betrayal against my grandfather , " he said . his taboo breaking raised more than a few eyebrows in the town and the local newspapers were not always so kind . " but this rivalry was years ago , it 's history now , " he said . lost its punch indeed , young people today seem little concerned with the once-intense rivalry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puma 's had new strength in its spring for the past few years " it 's not so strong anymore .
it was like that before , but now , i do n't think people care so much , " said 14-year-old teresa , who was wearing puma shoes but carrying an adidas bag .
" sometimes puma has something better , sometimes adidas .
it just depends .

" people do make the distinction . " and while most think things are better now that rivalry has cooled , some knew how to make the most of it when it was raging , frank dassler says .
he remembers that when handymen would come to work at his grandfather 's house , they would sometimes wear adidas shoes on purpose .
when rudolf would see their footwear , he 'd tell them to go to the basement and pick out a pair of puma shoes , which they could have for free .

for decades , the rivalry split the town in two . the small aurach river gurgles through the heart of herzogenaurach , population 24,000 , and gives the town its name .
but this peaceful , meandering waterway once symbolized a bitter , protracted family feud that divided the town into two distinct camps . it was all about footwear . " the town became known as the town where people tend to look down because you 'd always tend to look at shoes the person is wearing before you strike up a conversation , " said barbara smit , a dutch financial journalist and one of the authors to tackle the story of the dassler brothers , rudolf and adolf . they started out making shoes together before having a terrible falling out .
their argument resulted in the creation of two sports giants , puma and adidas , both still based in the provincial town . partners , then enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf -lrb- adi -rrb- dassler in 1978 rudolf and younger brother adolf , rudi and adi to friends , began their shoe business in their mother 's laundry room in the 1920s .
at the time , electricity supplies in the town were unreliable , and the brothers sometimes had to use pedal power from a stationary bicycle to run their equipment . " they were very different characters , " said smit .
" adi dassler was always more thoughtful , a craftsman who enjoyed nothing more than fiddling with his shoes .
whereas rudolf dassler was a more abrasive , loudmouthed salesman .
they complemented each other very well to begin with . " their new , lightweight sports shoes began to attract attention and they moved into a location south of the aurach river near the train station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jesse owens the dassler brothers shoe factory jumped onto the world stage in 1936 when they found themselves providing footwear for american jessie owens , who won four gold medals at the berlin olympics . but after the war , the fraternal relationship fell apart .
in smit 's book , " pitch invasion , " she theorizes that it could have had something to do with nazi party links and that after rudolf was picked up by american soldiers and accused of being a member of the ss , he was convinced that his brother had turned him in .
others speculate it could have had something to do with their wives , or a simple misunderstanding in a bomb shelter .
no one really knows for sure . what is certain is that they felt they could no longer work together and in 1948 the dassler brothers shoe factory was split in two . " more of less in the middle of the night , rudolf dassler packed his bags and moved on the other side of the little river , " said smit .
" he established puma on the other side .
from there on in , the town was really split in two like a sort of mini berlin with this little river as a partition in the middle . " and like berlin 's famous wall , it was n't advisable to cross over , at least when it came to shoes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reconstruction of adolf dassler 's early shoe workshop brand loyalty became paramount for many residents .
two camps formed , and dug in . there were stores , bakers and bars which were unofficially known as either loyal to rudolf 's puma , or to adolf 's new company , adidas , which he named using his nickname , adi , and the first three letters of his last name .
there were two soccer teams : the asv herzogenaurach club wore the three stripes ; the 1 fc herzogenaurach had the jumping cat on its footwear .
intermarriage was frowned upon . " i knew a butcher who played for the puma team , " said ernst ditrich who works at the town 's museum .
" he told us the guys from the adidas team did n't need to bother buying at his store .
he did n't want to do business with them .
that sort of thing happened . " wayward son the brothers never did reconcile .
while they are buried in the same cemetery , their graves are about as far apart as possible .
but one of their descendents decided the family feud had gone on long enough . frank dassler is the grandson of rudolf dassler and grew up living and breathing puma .
growing up , he had no contact at all with his great-uncle adolf 's family . " they stayed kind of enemies during the rest of their lives , " he said .
" it 's certainly sad , but from a business point of view it was a good decision , since it motivated both companies to innovate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the adidas " world of sports " headquarters but these days , frank dassler sits not in puma 's new glass-and-steel headquarters on the bank of the river , but in an office at the adidas campus further north , on the site of a former american army barracks .
two years ago , he took a job as the adidas group 's head legal counsel . " my stepmother and my stepbrother were n't very happy about this decision , they thought it would be a betrayal against my grandfather , " he said . his taboo breaking raised more than a few eyebrows in the town and the local newspapers were not always so kind . " but this rivalry was years ago , it 's history now , " he said . lost its punch indeed , young people today seem little concerned with the once-intense rivalry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puma 's had new strength in its spring for the past few years " it 's not so strong anymore .
it was like that before , but now , i do n't think people care so much , " said 14-year-old teresa , who was wearing puma shoes but carrying an adidas bag .
" sometimes puma has something better , sometimes adidas .
it just depends . " but hermann lindner , 41 , who was with his family -lrb- all wearing puma -rrb- at a festival for the argentinian team who is staying in the town for the world cup , says the two camps have n't entirely folded up their tents . " no , it 's not as extreme as it used to be , but you still find people who stick to puma and other who only wear adidas , " he said .
" people do make the distinction . " and while most think things are better now that rivalry has cooled , some knew how to make the most of it when it was raging , frank dassler says .
he remembers that when handymen would come to work at his grandfather 's house , they would sometimes wear adidas shoes on purpose .
when rudolf would see their footwear , he 'd tell them to go to the basement and pick out a pair of puma shoes , which they could have for free .

one of these teams will win the 2006 world cup .
but which team should win it ?
each country stands to offer something very different to the world by being crowned champions . there is one truism in soccer that continues to hold : the best team does n't always win .
playing great soccer does n't always guarantee success .
given that soccer is as much about good fortune as good performances , maybe we should forget about who has the right to win the world cup on the basis of their displays and look at which team should win the world cup for other reasons . germany has been riding a wave of euphoria ever since the first game of the tournament proved that klinsmann 's kids were not the huge risk that everyone though they would be .
with every game , the nation 's smile has gotten broader . germans have displayed a new enthusiasm and pride in their country which would surely increase even further should the national team with the cup .
the collective hope - now bordering on unwavering belief - that the world cup will stay in germany after july 9 has brought the people together , uniting germans of all backgrounds and ethnicities . this has not been lost on those outside the country 's borders .
the most pleasant side effect of this tournament is the image of germany as an inclusive , friendly and welcoming nation .
the german people themselves have shown that they are not the dull , humorless race of a sausage-scarfing , beer-swilling stereotypes but a nation capable of putting on one hell of a party and playing a great host to those who want to join in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup : uniting people even if germany were to go out to italy in the semi-finals , the enduring image of the world cup will be the millions of germans celebrating together with fans from all over the globe , turning this tournament into a soccer summer of love . but if michael ballack were to lift the trophy in berlin this new german belief , pride and positivity would go to another , hopefully , sustainable level .
it could provide germany , a country which has suffered from collective depression for so long , a solid base for a social recovery .
this is why germany should win . italy : stain of corruption italy find themselves in a real quandary .
if they lift the trophy on july 9 , they may be the first world champions to be crowned on the day that a court rules that their game is endemically corrupt .
the investigation into match-fixing back home could come to a close on the day of the world cup final and , if those at the top of the italian game are found guilty by the findings , soccer in italy could be set back a decade . top clubs like juventus , ac milan , fiorentina and lazio are in the dock as investigators look into allegations that corrupt referees manipulated matches , mostly in favor of champions juventus , who have won four of the past five championships .
the turin club could be stripped of their titles and relegated , meaning a high number of italy 's squad would be returning to second , even third-division soccer . because soccer defeat in italy is something akin to national bereavement , the country would enter a period of mourning that could affect all aspects of italian life for many years to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians could demand a massive clean-up campaign if they would win the world cup , then the italians would have a title to live up to .
such is the pride in their team and their country , the italians would demand that their game be purged of those who have dragged it into the mire . a world cup victory could provide the catalyst for empowerment both in society and in soccer circles , leading to a cleansing of the italian game .
this is why italy should win the world cup . france : public unity when france won the world cup in 1998 , the team was heralded as a success story for the country 's integration policies , fielding descendents from colonies such as surinam , algeria and guadeloupe .
the knock-on effects of that win and of a team built up of players of different ethnicities carried france as country on a wave of unity for many months . history now shows that the gloss of the ' 98 world cup win was no more than paper over the serious cracks in french society and that it was just a matter of time until the failure of france 's integration experiment was once again clear to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars have made way for a huge french love-in the riots of 2005 and the student protests of earlier this year have abated but the sources of french discontent remain .
while the experiences of 1998 tell us that a french world cup win in 2006 will not cure the ills , it would provide some relief .
coming in the year of a presidential election , a wave of optimism flowing from an incredible swansong for zidane and the old guard could sweep through france and bring about real change . the french team have already stood up to the far-right jean marie le pen and have declared unswerving allegiance to la grande nation in the face of nationalistic slurs .
a victory in germany for the multicultural bleus could inspire their splintered country to take similar action and bring the sometimes warring sides together .
this is why france should win the world cup . portugal : reform inspiration portugal may be seen by some as the party-crashers of the semi-finals .
figo and co. find themselves in illustrious company made up of former world champions .
a country which has yet to win an international title , portugal could be the flag-bearers for all those teams outside the perceived hierarchy of " big " teams who are consistently touted as favorites .
a world cup win for portugal would give hope to all those outside that exclusive club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal would be champions by fair means or foul but a world cup win for portugal would also send out another message : that play-acting and cynicism can get you as far as playing the other team off the park .
a victory in berlin for this portuguese team would be a triumph of simulation .
no other team has conned referees or intimidated the opposition more at this world cup , and considering that holland , italy and argentina all featured - that 's worthy of a trophy on its own . in an ideal world , a win for portugal on july 9 would shock soccer 's governing bodies into much-needed action .
a world cup victory for portugal should mean an overhaul of the game 's rules , the clear rewriting of what is unacceptable and widespread reform of the increasingly ugly beautiful game .
that is why portugal should win the world cup . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an all-european fight for the world cup brazil and argentina are packing their bags for home , leaving the 2006 world cup to be battled for amongst four european teams .

one of these teams will win the 2006 world cup .
but which team should win it ?
each country stands to offer something very different to the world by being crowned champions . there is one truism in soccer that continues to hold : the best team does n't always win .
playing great soccer does n't always guarantee success .
given that soccer is as much about good fortune as good performances , maybe we should forget about who has the right to win the world cup on the basis of their displays and look at which team should win the world cup for other reasons . germany has been riding a wave of euphoria ever since the first game of the tournament proved that klinsmann 's kids were not the huge risk that everyone though they would be .
with every game , the nation 's smile has gotten broader . germans have displayed a new enthusiasm and pride in their country which would surely increase even further should the national team with the cup .
the collective hope - now bordering on unwavering belief - that the world cup will stay in germany after july 9 has brought the people together , uniting germans of all backgrounds and ethnicities . this has not been lost on those outside the country 's borders .
the most pleasant side effect of this tournament is the image of germany as an inclusive , friendly and welcoming nation .
the german people themselves have shown that they are not the dull , humorless race of a sausage-scarfing , beer-swilling stereotypes but a nation capable of putting on one hell of a party and playing a great host to those who want to join in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup : uniting people even if germany were to go out to italy in the semi-finals , the enduring image of the world cup will be the millions of germans celebrating together with fans from all over the globe , turning this tournament into a soccer summer of love . but if michael ballack were to lift the trophy in berlin this new german belief , pride and positivity would go to another , hopefully , sustainable level .
it could provide germany , a country which has suffered from collective depression for so long , a solid base for a social recovery .
this is why germany should win . italy : stain of corruption italy find themselves in a real quandary .
if they lift the trophy on july 9 , they may be the first world champions to be crowned on the day that a court rules that their game is endemically corrupt .
the investigation into match-fixing back home could come to a close on the day of the world cup final and , if those at the top of the italian game are found guilty by the findings , soccer in italy could be set back a decade . top clubs like juventus , ac milan , fiorentina and lazio are in the dock as investigators look into allegations that corrupt referees manipulated matches , mostly in favor of champions juventus , who have won four of the past five championships .
the turin club could be stripped of their titles and relegated , meaning a high number of italy 's squad would be returning to second , even third-division soccer . because soccer defeat in italy is something akin to national bereavement , the country would enter a period of mourning that could affect all aspects of italian life for many years to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians could demand a massive clean-up campaign if they would win the world cup , then the italians would have a title to live up to .
such is the pride in their team and their country , the italians would demand that their game be purged of those who have dragged it into the mire . a world cup victory could provide the catalyst for empowerment both in society and in soccer circles , leading to a cleansing of the italian game .
this is why italy should win the world cup . france : public unity when france won the world cup in 1998 , the team was heralded as a success story for the country 's integration policies , fielding descendents from colonies such as surinam , algeria and guadeloupe .

one of these teams will win the 2006 world cup .
but which team should win it ?
each country stands to offer something very different to the world by being crowned champions . there is one truism in soccer that continues to hold : the best team does n't always win .
playing great soccer does n't always guarantee success .
given that soccer is as much about good fortune as good performances , maybe we should forget about who has the right to win the world cup on the basis of their displays and look at which team should win the world cup for other reasons . germany has been riding a wave of euphoria ever since the first game of the tournament proved that klinsmann 's kids were not the huge risk that everyone though they would be .
with every game , the nation 's smile has gotten broader . germans have displayed a new enthusiasm and pride in their country which would surely increase even further should the national team with the cup .
the collective hope - now bordering on unwavering belief - that the world cup will stay in germany after july 9 has brought the people together , uniting germans of all backgrounds and ethnicities . this has not been lost on those outside the country 's borders .
the most pleasant side effect of this tournament is the image of germany as an inclusive , friendly and welcoming nation .
the german people themselves have shown that they are not the dull , humorless race of a sausage-scarfing , beer-swilling stereotypes but a nation capable of putting on one hell of a party and playing a great host to those who want to join in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup : uniting people even if germany were to go out to italy in the semi-finals , the enduring image of the world cup will be the millions of germans celebrating together with fans from all over the globe , turning this tournament into a soccer summer of love . but if michael ballack were to lift the trophy in berlin this new german belief , pride and positivity would go to another , hopefully , sustainable level .
it could provide germany , a country which has suffered from collective depression for so long , a solid base for a social recovery .
this is why germany should win . italy : stain of corruption italy find themselves in a real quandary .
if they lift the trophy on july 9 , they may be the first world champions to be crowned on the day that a court rules that their game is endemically corrupt .
the investigation into match-fixing back home could come to a close on the day of the world cup final and , if those at the top of the italian game are found guilty by the findings , soccer in italy could be set back a decade . top clubs like juventus , ac milan , fiorentina and lazio are in the dock as investigators look into allegations that corrupt referees manipulated matches , mostly in favor of champions juventus , who have won four of the past five championships .
the turin club could be stripped of their titles and relegated , meaning a high number of italy 's squad would be returning to second , even third-division soccer . because soccer defeat in italy is something akin to national bereavement , the country would enter a period of mourning that could affect all aspects of italian life for many years to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians could demand a massive clean-up campaign if they would win the world cup , then the italians would have a title to live up to .
such is the pride in their team and their country , the italians would demand that their game be purged of those who have dragged it into the mire . a world cup victory could provide the catalyst for empowerment both in society and in soccer circles , leading to a cleansing of the italian game .
this is why italy should win the world cup . france : public unity when france won the world cup in 1998 , the team was heralded as a success story for the country 's integration policies , fielding descendents from colonies such as surinam , algeria and guadeloupe .
the knock-on effects of that win and of a team built up of players of different ethnicities carried france as country on a wave of unity for many months . history now shows that the gloss of the ' 98 world cup win was no more than paper over the serious cracks in french society and that it was just a matter of time until the failure of france 's integration experiment was once again clear to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars have made way for a huge french love-in the riots of 2005 and the student protests of earlier this year have abated but the sources of french discontent remain .
while the experiences of 1998 tell us that a french world cup win in 2006 will not cure the ills , it would provide some relief .
coming in the year of a presidential election , a wave of optimism flowing from an incredible swansong for zidane and the old guard could sweep through france and bring about real change . the french team have already stood up to the far-right jean marie le pen and have declared unswerving allegiance to la grande nation in the face of nationalistic slurs .
a victory in germany for the multicultural bleus could inspire their splintered country to take similar action and bring the sometimes warring sides together .
this is why france should win the world cup . portugal : reform inspiration portugal may be seen by some as the party-crashers of the semi-finals .
figo and co. find themselves in illustrious company made up of former world champions .
a country which has yet to win an international title , portugal could be the flag-bearers for all those teams outside the perceived hierarchy of " big " teams who are consistently touted as favorites .
a world cup win for portugal would give hope to all those outside that exclusive club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal would be champions by fair means or foul but a world cup win for portugal would also send out another message : that play-acting and cynicism can get you as far as playing the other team off the park .
a victory in berlin for this portuguese team would be a triumph of simulation .
no other team has conned referees or intimidated the opposition more at this world cup , and considering that holland , italy and argentina all featured - that 's worthy of a trophy on its own . in an ideal world , a win for portugal on july 9 would shock soccer 's governing bodies into much-needed action .
a world cup victory for portugal should mean an overhaul of the game 's rules , the clear rewriting of what is unacceptable and widespread reform of the increasingly ugly beautiful game .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel forgeard -lrb- left -rrb- and gustav humbert were forced out forgeard and humbert had been under intense pressure to quit since the news of the a380 delays in mid-june wiped 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- off eads ’ s market value and left airbus trailing us rival boeing . the chief of france ’ s state-owned sncf rail company , louis gallois , is to replace forgeard .
gallois , 62 , is a former head of french state company aerospatiale , whose toulouse factories are now part of eads . gallois also ran aero-engine manufacturer snecma , now part of the defense and communications group safran .
he is already an eads board member . christian streiff , 51 , a former deputy ceo of french building materials group saint gobain , is to succeed humbert as the head of airbus . streiff is an industry outsider , reportedly brought in because of his experiences in managing complex industrial processes .
bilingual in french and german , he worked for 15 years on behalf of glassmaker saint gobain in germany . german eads head stays on the position of tom enders , who remains the german co-ceo of eads , has now been significantly strengthened .
enders is to assume responsibility for the airbus shareholder committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french rail chief louis gallois is to take over as co-ceo of eads in an effort to preserve the delicate balance of national power inside the company , streiff will report to enders .
under the previous management set-up , humbert had reported to forgeard himself . german economics minister michael glos welcomed the change in eads leadership , saying in a statement on monday that the decision showed the company " recognized its responsibility for its core business , airbus . " glos also said he hoped the new management structure " would be received positively by the market . " but on monday , eads had failed to bounce back from its recently trampled share price .
the group 's shares initially rose as much as 1.7 percent , but then fell again by more than 2 percent . eads shares fell 26 percent when a380 delays were announced on june 14 . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de superjumbo 's delays spell bosses ' demise the french co-chief executive of eads , noel forgeard , and the german chief of european aircraft manufacturer airbus , gustav humbert , resigned on sunday , the european aerospace company said in a statement .

the pieces have all fallen into place for germany .
they are the hosts , jürgen klinsmann 's xi are in form , and they have the " big " country monkey off their back .
but germany 's history against italy is not a golden one . between them , germany and italy have collected six world cups , three times each .
coach jürgen klinsmann won it as a player in 1990 in italy .
but that final was against argentina who had knocked out the hosts in the semi-finals on penalties .
in contests with the azzurri however , germany can hardly rely on a successful history .
head-to-head , germany have won only seven times compared to 13 losses in 28 matches . in major competitions , italy have had germany 's number .
they took home the world cup in 1982 , beating germany 3-1 in madrid for what was their third title .
the legendary squadra azzurra led by paolo rossi made short shrift of jupp derwall 's finalists and underlined their claim as being europe 's strongest soccer nation with that championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the azzurri flew higher than germany in the 1982 final as important as that game was since it was a final , it was a semi-final , like the one this tuesday , that has gone down in history and remained etched in the memories of those who lived to see and hear it . under a broiling midday sun in mexico city , germany and italy played 120 minutes , before coach ferruccio valcareggi 's italy came out on top 4-3 in what has recently been voted as the " game of the century " in a fifa poll .
in mexico , the match has such great meaning that a plaque commemorates the contest at the aztec stadium . an injured ' kaiser ' and a high-flying ' bomber ' the circumstances that evolved during the game make it understandable why it is considered the classic game in world cup history .
italy went ahead after just eight minutes .
germany finally leveled in injury time on a goal by karl heinz schnellinger , forcing the match into extra-time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy celebrated at the end of the " game of the century " in mexico germany 's one-man wrecking crew gerd ' der bomber ' müller put germany ahead quickly before italy pulled ahead over the course of five minutes .
müller , who scored ten goals alone in the 1970 finals , got the equalizer in the 110th minute .
but while the replays were still being shown of his goal , gianni rivera won the game for the italians . franz beckenbauer 's heroics would go down in history after he played much of the two extra-time periods with his arm in a sling after sustaining a broken clavicle on an italian foul . stifling defenses in other affairs in their two other world cup meetings , germany and italy did n't provide any fireworks as in the 1970 semifinal .
in 1962 in chile , the two played to a scoreless draw in the first round .
in 1978 , both teams failed to find the net in a second round encounter . at european championships , germany have also failed to beat the southern europeans .
as hosts in 1988 , germany drew against the italians 1-1 .
in england eight years later , fans had to endure a goalless affair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack -lrb- left -rrb- and alessandro nesta battle in march as much as those games were dominated by stingy defenses , they happened long ago .
in their most recent encounter in florence , a world cup warm-up , italy pushed the germans to their nadir with a 4-1 thrashing .
that is a score jürgen klinsmann would like to settle . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup semi-final , 1970 : italy vs. west germany germany were looking for world cup glory after the disappointment of 1966 .

germany won the shoot-out 4-2 .
-lrb- july 1 , 2006 -rrb- italy make light work of ukraine to meet hosts in semi-finals despite surviving a few scares , italy finally turned on the style and beat ukraine in a 3-0 win and waltzed into the semi-finals of the world cup and a date with hosts germany in dortmund on tuesday .

for decades , the rivalry split the town in two . the small aurach river gurgles through the heart of herzogenaurach , population 24,000 , and gives the town its name .
but this peaceful , meandering waterway once symbolized a bitter , protracted family feud that divided the town into two distinct camps . it was all about footwear . " the town became known as the town where people tend to look down because you 'd always tend to look at shoes the person is wearing before you strike up a conversation , " said barbara smit , a dutch financial journalist and one of the authors to tackle the story of the dassler brothers , rudolf and adolf . they started out making shoes together before having a terrible falling out .
their argument resulted in the creation of two sports giants , puma and adidas , both still based in the provincial town . partners , then enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf -lrb- adi -rrb- dassler in 1978 rudolf and younger brother adolf , rudi and adi to friends , began their shoe business in their mother 's laundry room in the 1920s .
at the time , electricity supplies in the town were unreliable , and the brothers sometimes had to use pedal power from a stationary bicycle to run their equipment . " they were very different characters , " said smit .
" adi dassler was always more thoughtful , a craftsman who enjoyed nothing more than fiddling with his shoes .
whereas rudolf dassler was a more abrasive , loudmouthed salesman .
they complemented each other very well to begin with . " their new , lightweight sports shoes began to attract attention and they moved into a location south of the aurach river near the train station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jesse owens the dassler brothers shoe factory jumped onto the world stage in 1936 when they found themselves providing footwear for american jessie owens , who won four gold medals at the berlin olympics . but after the war , the fraternal relationship fell apart .
in smit 's book , " pitch invasion , " she theorizes that it could have had something to do with nazi party links and that after rudolf was picked up by american soldiers and accused of being a member of the ss , he was convinced that his brother had turned him in .
others speculate it could have had something to do with their wives , or a simple misunderstanding in a bomb shelter .
no one really knows for sure . what is certain is that they felt they could no longer work together and in 1948 the dassler brothers shoe factory was split in two . " more of less in the middle of the night , rudolf dassler packed his bags and moved on the other side of the little river , " said smit .
" he established puma on the other side .
from there on in , the town was really split in two like a sort of mini berlin with this little river as a partition in the middle . " and like berlin 's famous wall , it was n't advisable to cross over , at least when it came to shoes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reconstruction of adolf dassler 's early shoe workshop brand loyalty became paramount for many residents .
two camps formed , and dug in . there were stores , bakers and bars which were unofficially known as either loyal to rudolf 's puma , or to adolf 's new company , adidas , which he named using his nickname , adi , and the first three letters of his last name .
there were two soccer teams : the asv herzogenaurach club wore the three stripes ; the 1 fc herzogenaurach had the jumping cat on its footwear .
intermarriage was frowned upon . " i knew a butcher who played for the puma team , " said ernst ditrich who works at the town 's museum .
" he told us the guys from the adidas team did n't need to bother buying at his store .
he did n't want to do business with them .
that sort of thing happened . " wayward son the brothers never did reconcile .
while they are buried in the same cemetery , their graves are about as far apart as possible .
but one of their descendents decided the family feud had gone on long enough . frank dassler is the grandson of rudolf dassler and grew up living and breathing puma .
growing up , he had no contact at all with his great-uncle adolf 's family . " they stayed kind of enemies during the rest of their lives , " he said .
" it 's certainly sad , but from a business point of view it was a good decision , since it motivated both companies to innovate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the adidas " world of sports " headquarters but these days , frank dassler sits not in puma 's new glass-and-steel headquarters on the bank of the river , but in an office at the adidas campus further north , on the site of a former american army barracks .
two years ago , he took a job as the adidas group 's head legal counsel . " my stepmother and my stepbrother were n't very happy about this decision , they thought it would be a betrayal against my grandfather , " he said . his taboo breaking raised more than a few eyebrows in the town and the local newspapers were not always so kind . " but this rivalry was years ago , it 's history now , " he said . lost its punch indeed , young people today seem little concerned with the once-intense rivalry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puma 's had new strength in its spring for the past few years " it 's not so strong anymore .
it was like that before , but now , i do n't think people care so much , " said 14-year-old teresa , who was wearing puma shoes but carrying an adidas bag .
" sometimes puma has something better , sometimes adidas .
it just depends . " but hermann lindner , 41 , who was with his family -lrb- all wearing puma -rrb- at a festival for the argentinian team who is staying in the town for the world cup , says the two camps have n't entirely folded up their tents . " no , it 's not as extreme as it used to be , but you still find people who stick to puma and other who only wear adidas , " he said .
" people do make the distinction . " and while most think things are better now that rivalry has cooled , some knew how to make the most of it when it was raging , frank dassler says .
he remembers that when handymen would come to work at his grandfather 's house , they would sometimes wear adidas shoes on purpose .
when rudolf would see their footwear , he 'd tell them to go to the basement and pick out a pair of puma shoes , which they could have for free .

many have requested criminal charges be brought against those responsible for the bear 's death . with all the hype , you 'd think bruno were staging yet another publicity stunt - this time , from the grave .
bruno has gained so much popularity and support both in germany and around the world that 300 people staged a protest near the berlin cathedral on saturday . demonstration leader kurt eicher told the afp news agency that evidence clearly showed that bruno had been wrongly shot .
eicher also accused the bavarian environment ministry of violating the law protecting endangered animals by giving the " shoot-to-kill " order to hunters . animal protection groups file formal complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : idyllic bavaria is where bruno met his death last week bavarian environment minister werner schnappauf has been under fire himself for his shoot-to-kill order .
munich prosecutors said they have received a flood of requests asking that criminal charges be brought against schnappauf and others responsible for the decision to kill the bear . the public prosecutor 's office said it would decide at the end of the week whether it would begin preliminary proceedings . a poll last week by the forsa institute of over 1,000 germans said 70 percent of germans agreed with the shooting , but regretted bruno 's death .
only 24 percent said they were relieved that the bear no longer posed a threat . still , bruno was on world cup fans ' minds over the weekend .
as toymakers prepare to produce a teddy bear to immortalize the animal , some fans on berlin 's fan mile and at the quarter-final win over argentina waved placards in his memory .
" revenge for bruno , " read one . the web site that originally coined a song to commemorate the bear and " hunt bruno " game have since created the " bruno 's revenge " game . italy wants its bear back meanwhile , the cadaver of the bear the media dubbed " bruno " is currently in deep freeze , but is scheduled to be stuffed and placed in a museum .
bruno , however , stemmed from the italian region of trentino .
according to the ap and dpa news agencies , italian environment minister alfonso pecoraro scanio will formally ask germany on monday to give back bruno 's body . bruno was killed by a government-sanctioned hunter in bavaria last week after having first been spotted in germany in may .
part of a project to reintroduce the predators to northern italy , the bear roamed into austria and germany , killed sheep and rabbits , stole honey and was in the headlines across europe for weeks . fearing the two-year-old bear would one day target humans , officials in the southern state of bavaria granted permission to kill him even though he was the first wild bear to be seen in germany since 1835 . italian environment minister alfonso pecoraro scanio has protested the killing and said that the bear should have been shot with tranquilizers and transported back to italy . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vacationing a no-no in bear-killing bavaria what 's an animal rights activist with summer vacation plans in bavaria to do ?

for decades , the rivalry split the town in two . the small aurach river gurgles through the heart of herzogenaurach , population 24,000 , and gives the town its name .
but this peaceful , meandering waterway once symbolized a bitter , protracted family feud that divided the town into two distinct camps . it was all about footwear . " the town became known as the town where people tend to look down because you 'd always tend to look at shoes the person is wearing before you strike up a conversation , " said barbara smit , a dutch financial journalist and one of the authors to tackle the story of the dassler brothers , rudolf and adolf . they started out making shoes together before having a terrible falling out .
their argument resulted in the creation of two sports giants , puma and adidas , both still based in the provincial town . partners , then enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf -lrb- adi -rrb- dassler in 1978 rudolf and younger brother adolf , rudi and adi to friends , began their shoe business in their mother 's laundry room in the 1920s .
at the time , electricity supplies in the town were unreliable , and the brothers sometimes had to use pedal power from a stationary bicycle to run their equipment . " they were very different characters , " said smit .
" adi dassler was always more thoughtful , a craftsman who enjoyed nothing more than fiddling with his shoes .
whereas rudolf dassler was a more abrasive , loudmouthed salesman .
they complemented each other very well to begin with . " their new , lightweight sports shoes began to attract attention and they moved into a location south of the aurach river near the train station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jesse owens the dassler brothers shoe factory jumped onto the world stage in 1936 when they found themselves providing footwear for american jessie owens , who won four gold medals at the berlin olympics . but after the war , the fraternal relationship fell apart .
in smit 's book , " pitch invasion , " she theorizes that it could have had something to do with nazi party links and that after rudolf was picked up by american soldiers and accused of being a member of the ss , he was convinced that his brother had turned him in .
others speculate it could have had something to do with their wives , or a simple misunderstanding in a bomb shelter .
no one really knows for sure . what is certain is that they felt they could no longer work together and in 1948 the dassler brothers shoe factory was split in two . " more of less in the middle of the night , rudolf dassler packed his bags and moved on the other side of the little river , " said smit .
" he established puma on the other side .
from there on in , the town was really split in two like a sort of mini berlin with this little river as a partition in the middle . " and like berlin 's famous wall , it was n't advisable to cross over , at least when it came to shoes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reconstruction of adolf dassler 's early shoe workshop brand loyalty became paramount for many residents .
two camps formed , and dug in . there were stores , bakers and bars which were unofficially known as either loyal to rudolf 's puma , or to adolf 's new company , adidas , which he named using his nickname , adi , and the first three letters of his last name .
there were two soccer teams : the asv herzogenaurach club wore the three stripes ; the 1 fc herzogenaurach had the jumping cat on its footwear .
intermarriage was frowned upon . " i knew a butcher who played for the puma team , " said ernst ditrich who works at the town 's museum .
" he told us the guys from the adidas team did n't need to bother buying at his store .
he did n't want to do business with them .
that sort of thing happened . " wayward son the brothers never did reconcile .
while they are buried in the same cemetery , their graves are about as far apart as possible .
but one of their descendents decided the family feud had gone on long enough . frank dassler is the grandson of rudolf dassler and grew up living and breathing puma .
growing up , he had no contact at all with his great-uncle adolf 's family . " they stayed kind of enemies during the rest of their lives , " he said .
" it 's certainly sad , but from a business point of view it was a good decision , since it motivated both companies to innovate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the adidas " world of sports " headquarters but these days , frank dassler sits not in puma 's new glass-and-steel headquarters on the bank of the river , but in an office at the adidas campus further north , on the site of a former american army barracks .
two years ago , he took a job as the adidas group 's head legal counsel . " my stepmother and my stepbrother were n't very happy about this decision , they thought it would be a betrayal against my grandfather , " he said . his taboo breaking raised more than a few eyebrows in the town and the local newspapers were not always so kind . " but this rivalry was years ago , it 's history now , " he said . lost its punch indeed , young people today seem little concerned with the once-intense rivalry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puma 's had new strength in its spring for the past few years " it 's not so strong anymore .
it was like that before , but now , i do n't think people care so much , " said 14-year-old teresa , who was wearing puma shoes but carrying an adidas bag .
" sometimes puma has something better , sometimes adidas .
it just depends . " but hermann lindner , 41 , who was with his family -lrb- all wearing puma -rrb- at a festival for the argentinian team who is staying in the town for the world cup , says the two camps have n't entirely folded up their tents . " no , it 's not as extreme as it used to be , but you still find people who stick to puma and other who only wear adidas , " he said .
" people do make the distinction . " and while most think things are better now that rivalry has cooled , some knew how to make the most of it when it was raging , frank dassler says .
he remembers that when handymen would come to work at his grandfather 's house , they would sometimes wear adidas shoes on purpose .
when rudolf would see their footwear , he 'd tell them to go to the basement and pick out a pair of puma shoes , which they could have for free . " rudolf simply could n't stand the fact that someone was wearing an adidas shoe in his private home , " dassler said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de adidas cashes in on the world cup german sports giant adidas is using its dominance in the soccer gear business during the upcoming world cup to kit out the german national team as well as five others .

the pieces have all fallen into place for germany .
they are the hosts , jürgen klinsmann 's xi are in form , and they have the " big " country monkey off their back .
but germany 's history against italy is not a golden one . between them , germany and italy have collected six world cups , three times each .
coach jürgen klinsmann won it as a player in 1990 in italy .
but that final was against argentina who had knocked out the hosts in the semi-finals on penalties .
in contests with the azzurri however , germany can hardly rely on a successful history .
head-to-head , germany have won only seven times compared to 13 losses in 28 matches . in major competitions , italy have had germany 's number .
they took home the world cup in 1982 , beating germany 3-1 in madrid for what was their third title .
the legendary squadra azzurra led by paolo rossi made short shrift of jupp derwall 's finalists and underlined their claim as being europe 's strongest soccer nation with that championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the azzurri flew higher than germany in the 1982 final as important as that game was since it was a final , it was a semi-final , like the one this tuesday , that has gone down in history and remained etched in the memories of those who lived to see and hear it . under a broiling midday sun in mexico city , germany and italy played 120 minutes , before coach ferruccio valcareggi 's italy came out on top 4-3 in what has recently been voted as the " game of the century " in a fifa poll .
in mexico , the match has such great meaning that a plaque commemorates the contest at the aztec stadium . an injured ' kaiser ' and a high-flying ' bomber ' the circumstances that evolved during the game make it understandable why it is considered the classic game in world cup history .
italy went ahead after just eight minutes .
germany finally leveled in injury time on a goal by karl heinz schnellinger , forcing the match into extra-time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy celebrated at the end of the " game of the century " in mexico germany 's one-man wrecking crew gerd ' der bomber ' müller put germany ahead quickly before italy pulled ahead over the course of five minutes .
müller , who scored ten goals alone in the 1970 finals , got the equalizer in the 110th minute .
but while the replays were still being shown of his goal , gianni rivera won the game for the italians . franz beckenbauer 's heroics would go down in history after he played much of the two extra-time periods with his arm in a sling after sustaining a broken clavicle on an italian foul . stifling defenses in other affairs in their two other world cup meetings , germany and italy did n't provide any fireworks as in the 1970 semifinal .
in 1962 in chile , the two played to a scoreless draw in the first round .
in 1978 , both teams failed to find the net in a second round encounter . at european championships , germany have also failed to beat the southern europeans .
as hosts in 1988 , germany drew against the italians 1-1 .
in england eight years later , fans had to endure a goalless affair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack -lrb- left -rrb- and alessandro nesta battle in march as much as those games were dominated by stingy defenses , they happened long ago .
in their most recent encounter in florence , a world cup warm-up , italy pushed the germans to their nadir with a 4-1 thrashing .
that is a score jürgen klinsmann would like to settle . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup semi-final , 1970 : italy vs. west germany germany were looking for world cup glory after the disappointment of 1966 .

the pieces have all fallen into place for germany .
they are the hosts , jürgen klinsmann 's xi are in form , and they have the " big " country monkey off their back .
but germany 's history against italy is not a golden one . between them , germany and italy have collected six world cups , three times each .
coach jürgen klinsmann won it as a player in 1990 in italy .
but that final was against argentina who had knocked out the hosts in the semi-finals on penalties .
in contests with the azzurri however , germany can hardly rely on a successful history .
head-to-head , germany have won only seven times compared to 13 losses in 28 matches . in major competitions , italy have had germany 's number .
they took home the world cup in 1982 , beating germany 3-1 in madrid for what was their third title .
the legendary squadra azzurra led by paolo rossi made short shrift of jupp derwall 's finalists and underlined their claim as being europe 's strongest soccer nation with that championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the azzurri flew higher than germany in the 1982 final as important as that game was since it was a final , it was a semi-final , like the one this tuesday , that has gone down in history and remained etched in the memories of those who lived to see and hear it . under a broiling midday sun in mexico city , germany and italy played 120 minutes , before coach ferruccio valcareggi 's italy came out on top 4-3 in what has recently been voted as the " game of the century " in a fifa poll .
in mexico , the match has such great meaning that a plaque commemorates the contest at the aztec stadium . an injured ' kaiser ' and a high-flying ' bomber ' the circumstances that evolved during the game make it understandable why it is considered the classic game in world cup history .
italy went ahead after just eight minutes .
germany finally leveled in injury time on a goal by karl heinz schnellinger , forcing the match into extra-time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy celebrated at the end of the " game of the century " in mexico germany 's one-man wrecking crew gerd ' der bomber ' müller put germany ahead quickly before italy pulled ahead over the course of five minutes .
müller , who scored ten goals alone in the 1970 finals , got the equalizer in the 110th minute .
but while the replays were still being shown of his goal , gianni rivera won the game for the italians . franz beckenbauer 's heroics would go down in history after he played much of the two extra-time periods with his arm in a sling after sustaining a broken clavicle on an italian foul . stifling defenses in other affairs in their two other world cup meetings , germany and italy did n't provide any fireworks as in the 1970 semifinal .
in 1962 in chile , the two played to a scoreless draw in the first round .
in 1978 , both teams failed to find the net in a second round encounter . at european championships , germany have also failed to beat the southern europeans .
as hosts in 1988 , germany drew against the italians 1-1 .
in england eight years later , fans had to endure a goalless affair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack -lrb- left -rrb- and alessandro nesta battle in march as much as those games were dominated by stingy defenses , they happened long ago .
in their most recent encounter in florence , a world cup warm-up , italy pushed the germans to their nadir with a 4-1 thrashing .

the pieces have all fallen into place for germany .
they are the hosts , jürgen klinsmann 's xi are in form , and they have the " big " country monkey off their back .
but germany 's history against italy is not a golden one . between them , germany and italy have collected six world cups , three times each .
coach jürgen klinsmann won it as a player in 1990 in italy .
but that final was against argentina who had knocked out the hosts in the semi-finals on penalties .
in contests with the azzurri however , germany can hardly rely on a successful history .
head-to-head , germany have won only seven times compared to 13 losses in 28 matches . in major competitions , italy have had germany 's number .
they took home the world cup in 1982 , beating germany 3-1 in madrid for what was their third title .
the legendary squadra azzurra led by paolo rossi made short shrift of jupp derwall 's finalists and underlined their claim as being europe 's strongest soccer nation with that championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the azzurri flew higher than germany in the 1982 final as important as that game was since it was a final , it was a semi-final , like the one this tuesday , that has gone down in history and remained etched in the memories of those who lived to see and hear it . under a broiling midday sun in mexico city , germany and italy played 120 minutes , before coach ferruccio valcareggi 's italy came out on top 4-3 in what has recently been voted as the " game of the century " in a fifa poll .
in mexico , the match has such great meaning that a plaque commemorates the contest at the aztec stadium . an injured ' kaiser ' and a high-flying ' bomber ' the circumstances that evolved during the game make it understandable why it is considered the classic game in world cup history .
italy went ahead after just eight minutes .
germany finally leveled in injury time on a goal by karl heinz schnellinger , forcing the match into extra-time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy celebrated at the end of the " game of the century " in mexico germany 's one-man wrecking crew gerd ' der bomber ' müller put germany ahead quickly before italy pulled ahead over the course of five minutes .
müller , who scored ten goals alone in the 1970 finals , got the equalizer in the 110th minute .
but while the replays were still being shown of his goal , gianni rivera won the game for the italians . franz beckenbauer 's heroics would go down in history after he played much of the two extra-time periods with his arm in a sling after sustaining a broken clavicle on an italian foul . stifling defenses in other affairs in their two other world cup meetings , germany and italy did n't provide any fireworks as in the 1970 semifinal .
in 1962 in chile , the two played to a scoreless draw in the first round .
in 1978 , both teams failed to find the net in a second round encounter . at european championships , germany have also failed to beat the southern europeans .
as hosts in 1988 , germany drew against the italians 1-1 .
in england eight years later , fans had to endure a goalless affair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack -lrb- left -rrb- and alessandro nesta battle in march as much as those games were dominated by stingy defenses , they happened long ago .
in their most recent encounter in florence , a world cup warm-up , italy pushed the germans to their nadir with a 4-1 thrashing .

for decades , the rivalry split the town in two . the small aurach river gurgles through the heart of herzogenaurach , population 24,000 , and gives the town its name .
but this peaceful , meandering waterway once symbolized a bitter , protracted family feud that divided the town into two distinct camps . it was all about footwear . " the town became known as the town where people tend to look down because you 'd always tend to look at shoes the person is wearing before you strike up a conversation , " said barbara smit , a dutch financial journalist and one of the authors to tackle the story of the dassler brothers , rudolf and adolf . they started out making shoes together before having a terrible falling out .
their argument resulted in the creation of two sports giants , puma and adidas , both still based in the provincial town . partners , then enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf -lrb- adi -rrb- dassler in 1978 rudolf and younger brother adolf , rudi and adi to friends , began their shoe business in their mother 's laundry room in the 1920s .
at the time , electricity supplies in the town were unreliable , and the brothers sometimes had to use pedal power from a stationary bicycle to run their equipment . " they were very different characters , " said smit .
" adi dassler was always more thoughtful , a craftsman who enjoyed nothing more than fiddling with his shoes .
whereas rudolf dassler was a more abrasive , loudmouthed salesman .
they complemented each other very well to begin with . " their new , lightweight sports shoes began to attract attention and they moved into a location south of the aurach river near the train station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jesse owens the dassler brothers shoe factory jumped onto the world stage in 1936 when they found themselves providing footwear for american jessie owens , who won four gold medals at the berlin olympics . but after the war , the fraternal relationship fell apart .
in smit 's book , " pitch invasion , " she theorizes that it could have had something to do with nazi party links and that after rudolf was picked up by american soldiers and accused of being a member of the ss , he was convinced that his brother had turned him in .
others speculate it could have had something to do with their wives , or a simple misunderstanding in a bomb shelter .
no one really knows for sure . what is certain is that they felt they could no longer work together and in 1948 the dassler brothers shoe factory was split in two . " more of less in the middle of the night , rudolf dassler packed his bags and moved on the other side of the little river , " said smit .
" he established puma on the other side .

for decades , the rivalry split the town in two . the small aurach river gurgles through the heart of herzogenaurach , population 24,000 , and gives the town its name .
but this peaceful , meandering waterway once symbolized a bitter , protracted family feud that divided the town into two distinct camps . it was all about footwear . " the town became known as the town where people tend to look down because you 'd always tend to look at shoes the person is wearing before you strike up a conversation , " said barbara smit , a dutch financial journalist and one of the authors to tackle the story of the dassler brothers , rudolf and adolf . they started out making shoes together before having a terrible falling out .
their argument resulted in the creation of two sports giants , puma and adidas , both still based in the provincial town . partners , then enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf -lrb- adi -rrb- dassler in 1978 rudolf and younger brother adolf , rudi and adi to friends , began their shoe business in their mother 's laundry room in the 1920s .
at the time , electricity supplies in the town were unreliable , and the brothers sometimes had to use pedal power from a stationary bicycle to run their equipment . " they were very different characters , " said smit .
" adi dassler was always more thoughtful , a craftsman who enjoyed nothing more than fiddling with his shoes .
whereas rudolf dassler was a more abrasive , loudmouthed salesman .
they complemented each other very well to begin with . " their new , lightweight sports shoes began to attract attention and they moved into a location south of the aurach river near the train station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jesse owens the dassler brothers shoe factory jumped onto the world stage in 1936 when they found themselves providing footwear for american jessie owens , who won four gold medals at the berlin olympics . but after the war , the fraternal relationship fell apart .
in smit 's book , " pitch invasion , " she theorizes that it could have had something to do with nazi party links and that after rudolf was picked up by american soldiers and accused of being a member of the ss , he was convinced that his brother had turned him in .
others speculate it could have had something to do with their wives , or a simple misunderstanding in a bomb shelter .
no one really knows for sure . what is certain is that they felt they could no longer work together and in 1948 the dassler brothers shoe factory was split in two . " more of less in the middle of the night , rudolf dassler packed his bags and moved on the other side of the little river , " said smit .
" he established puma on the other side .
from there on in , the town was really split in two like a sort of mini berlin with this little river as a partition in the middle . " and like berlin 's famous wall , it was n't advisable to cross over , at least when it came to shoes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reconstruction of adolf dassler 's early shoe workshop brand loyalty became paramount for many residents .

for decades , the rivalry split the town in two . the small aurach river gurgles through the heart of herzogenaurach , population 24,000 , and gives the town its name .
but this peaceful , meandering waterway once symbolized a bitter , protracted family feud that divided the town into two distinct camps . it was all about footwear . " the town became known as the town where people tend to look down because you 'd always tend to look at shoes the person is wearing before you strike up a conversation , " said barbara smit , a dutch financial journalist and one of the authors to tackle the story of the dassler brothers , rudolf and adolf . they started out making shoes together before having a terrible falling out .
their argument resulted in the creation of two sports giants , puma and adidas , both still based in the provincial town . partners , then enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf -lrb- adi -rrb- dassler in 1978 rudolf and younger brother adolf , rudi and adi to friends , began their shoe business in their mother 's laundry room in the 1920s .
at the time , electricity supplies in the town were unreliable , and the brothers sometimes had to use pedal power from a stationary bicycle to run their equipment . " they were very different characters , " said smit .
" adi dassler was always more thoughtful , a craftsman who enjoyed nothing more than fiddling with his shoes .
whereas rudolf dassler was a more abrasive , loudmouthed salesman .
they complemented each other very well to begin with . " their new , lightweight sports shoes began to attract attention and they moved into a location south of the aurach river near the train station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jesse owens the dassler brothers shoe factory jumped onto the world stage in 1936 when they found themselves providing footwear for american jessie owens , who won four gold medals at the berlin olympics . but after the war , the fraternal relationship fell apart .
in smit 's book , " pitch invasion , " she theorizes that it could have had something to do with nazi party links and that after rudolf was picked up by american soldiers and accused of being a member of the ss , he was convinced that his brother had turned him in .
others speculate it could have had something to do with their wives , or a simple misunderstanding in a bomb shelter .
no one really knows for sure . what is certain is that they felt they could no longer work together and in 1948 the dassler brothers shoe factory was split in two . " more of less in the middle of the night , rudolf dassler packed his bags and moved on the other side of the little river , " said smit .
" he established puma on the other side .
from there on in , the town was really split in two like a sort of mini berlin with this little river as a partition in the middle . " and like berlin 's famous wall , it was n't advisable to cross over , at least when it came to shoes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reconstruction of adolf dassler 's early shoe workshop brand loyalty became paramount for many residents .
two camps formed , and dug in . there were stores , bakers and bars which were unofficially known as either loyal to rudolf 's puma , or to adolf 's new company , adidas , which he named using his nickname , adi , and the first three letters of his last name .
there were two soccer teams : the asv herzogenaurach club wore the three stripes ; the 1 fc herzogenaurach had the jumping cat on its footwear .
intermarriage was frowned upon . " i knew a butcher who played for the puma team , " said ernst ditrich who works at the town 's museum .
" he told us the guys from the adidas team did n't need to bother buying at his store .
he did n't want to do business with them .
that sort of thing happened . " wayward son the brothers never did reconcile .
while they are buried in the same cemetery , their graves are about as far apart as possible .
but one of their descendents decided the family feud had gone on long enough . frank dassler is the grandson of rudolf dassler and grew up living and breathing puma .
growing up , he had no contact at all with his great-uncle adolf 's family . " they stayed kind of enemies during the rest of their lives , " he said .
" it 's certainly sad , but from a business point of view it was a good decision , since it motivated both companies to innovate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the adidas " world of sports " headquarters but these days , frank dassler sits not in puma 's new glass-and-steel headquarters on the bank of the river , but in an office at the adidas campus further north , on the site of a former american army barracks .
two years ago , he took a job as the adidas group 's head legal counsel . " my stepmother and my stepbrother were n't very happy about this decision , they thought it would be a betrayal against my grandfather , " he said . his taboo breaking raised more than a few eyebrows in the town and the local newspapers were not always so kind . " but this rivalry was years ago , it 's history now , " he said . lost its punch indeed , young people today seem little concerned with the once-intense rivalry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puma 's had new strength in its spring for the past few years " it 's not so strong anymore .
it was like that before , but now , i do n't think people care so much , " said 14-year-old teresa , who was wearing puma shoes but carrying an adidas bag .
" sometimes puma has something better , sometimes adidas .
it just depends . " but hermann lindner , 41 , who was with his family -lrb- all wearing puma -rrb- at a festival for the argentinian team who is staying in the town for the world cup , says the two camps have n't entirely folded up their tents . " no , it 's not as extreme as it used to be , but you still find people who stick to puma and other who only wear adidas , " he said .
" people do make the distinction . " and while most think things are better now that rivalry has cooled , some knew how to make the most of it when it was raging , frank dassler says .
he remembers that when handymen would come to work at his grandfather 's house , they would sometimes wear adidas shoes on purpose .
when rudolf would see their footwear , he 'd tell them to go to the basement and pick out a pair of puma shoes , which they could have for free . " rudolf simply could n't stand the fact that someone was wearing an adidas shoe in his private home , " dassler said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de adidas cashes in on the world cup german sports giant adidas is using its dominance in the soccer gear business during the upcoming world cup to kit out the german national team as well as five others .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de features -pipe- 03.07.2006 opinion : who should win the world cup and why großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german victory would have the country in such a rapture that the effects could be long lasting germany , italy , portugal and france .
one of these teams will win the 2006 world cup .
but which team should win it ?
each country stands to offer something very different to the world by being crowned champions . there is one truism in soccer that continues to hold : the best team does n't always win .
playing great soccer does n't always guarantee success .
given that soccer is as much about good fortune as good performances , maybe we should forget about who has the right to win the world cup on the basis of their displays and look at which team should win the world cup for other reasons . germany has been riding a wave of euphoria ever since the first game of the tournament proved that klinsmann 's kids were not the huge risk that everyone though they would be .
with every game , the nation 's smile has gotten broader . germans have displayed a new enthusiasm and pride in their country which would surely increase even further should the national team with the cup .
the collective hope - now bordering on unwavering belief - that the world cup will stay in germany after july 9 has brought the people together , uniting germans of all backgrounds and ethnicities . this has not been lost on those outside the country 's borders .
the most pleasant side effect of this tournament is the image of germany as an inclusive , friendly and welcoming nation .
the german people themselves have shown that they are not the dull , humorless race of a sausage-scarfing , beer-swilling stereotypes but a nation capable of putting on one hell of a party and playing a great host to those who want to join in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup : uniting people even if germany were to go out to italy in the semi-finals , the enduring image of the world cup will be the millions of germans celebrating together with fans from all over the globe , turning this tournament into a soccer summer of love . but if michael ballack were to lift the trophy in berlin this new german belief , pride and positivity would go to another , hopefully , sustainable level .
it could provide germany , a country which has suffered from collective depression for so long , a solid base for a social recovery .
this is why germany should win . italy : stain of corruption italy find themselves in a real quandary .
if they lift the trophy on july 9 , they may be the first world champions to be crowned on the day that a court rules that their game is endemically corrupt .
the investigation into match-fixing back home could come to a close on the day of the world cup final and , if those at the top of the italian game are found guilty by the findings , soccer in italy could be set back a decade . top clubs like juventus , ac milan , fiorentina and lazio are in the dock as investigators look into allegations that corrupt referees manipulated matches , mostly in favor of champions juventus , who have won four of the past five championships .
the turin club could be stripped of their titles and relegated , meaning a high number of italy 's squad would be returning to second , even third-division soccer . because soccer defeat in italy is something akin to national bereavement , the country would enter a period of mourning that could affect all aspects of italian life for many years to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians could demand a massive clean-up campaign if they would win the world cup , then the italians would have a title to live up to .
such is the pride in their team and their country , the italians would demand that their game be purged of those who have dragged it into the mire . a world cup victory could provide the catalyst for empowerment both in society and in soccer circles , leading to a cleansing of the italian game .
this is why italy should win the world cup . france : public unity when france won the world cup in 1998 , the team was heralded as a success story for the country 's integration policies , fielding descendents from colonies such as surinam , algeria and guadeloupe .
the knock-on effects of that win and of a team built up of players of different ethnicities carried france as country on a wave of unity for many months . history now shows that the gloss of the ' 98 world cup win was no more than paper over the serious cracks in french society and that it was just a matter of time until the failure of france 's integration experiment was once again clear to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars have made way for a huge french love-in the riots of 2005 and the student protests of earlier this year have abated but the sources of french discontent remain .
while the experiences of 1998 tell us that a french world cup win in 2006 will not cure the ills , it would provide some relief .
coming in the year of a presidential election , a wave of optimism flowing from an incredible swansong for zidane and the old guard could sweep through france and bring about real change . the french team have already stood up to the far-right jean marie le pen and have declared unswerving allegiance to la grande nation in the face of nationalistic slurs .
a victory in germany for the multicultural bleus could inspire their splintered country to take similar action and bring the sometimes warring sides together .
this is why france should win the world cup . portugal : reform inspiration portugal may be seen by some as the party-crashers of the semi-finals .
figo and co. find themselves in illustrious company made up of former world champions .
a country which has yet to win an international title , portugal could be the flag-bearers for all those teams outside the perceived hierarchy of " big " teams who are consistently touted as favorites .
a world cup win for portugal would give hope to all those outside that exclusive club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal would be champions by fair means or foul but a world cup win for portugal would also send out another message : that play-acting and cynicism can get you as far as playing the other team off the park .
a victory in berlin for this portuguese team would be a triumph of simulation .
no other team has conned referees or intimidated the opposition more at this world cup , and considering that holland , italy and argentina all featured - that 's worthy of a trophy on its own . in an ideal world , a win for portugal on july 9 would shock soccer 's governing bodies into much-needed action .
a world cup victory for portugal should mean an overhaul of the game 's rules , the clear rewriting of what is unacceptable and widespread reform of the increasingly ugly beautiful game .

one of these teams will win the 2006 world cup .
but which team should win it ?
each country stands to offer something very different to the world by being crowned champions . there is one truism in soccer that continues to hold : the best team does n't always win .
playing great soccer does n't always guarantee success .
given that soccer is as much about good fortune as good performances , maybe we should forget about who has the right to win the world cup on the basis of their displays and look at which team should win the world cup for other reasons . germany has been riding a wave of euphoria ever since the first game of the tournament proved that klinsmann 's kids were not the huge risk that everyone though they would be .
with every game , the nation 's smile has gotten broader . germans have displayed a new enthusiasm and pride in their country which would surely increase even further should the national team with the cup .
the collective hope - now bordering on unwavering belief - that the world cup will stay in germany after july 9 has brought the people together , uniting germans of all backgrounds and ethnicities . this has not been lost on those outside the country 's borders .
the most pleasant side effect of this tournament is the image of germany as an inclusive , friendly and welcoming nation .
the german people themselves have shown that they are not the dull , humorless race of a sausage-scarfing , beer-swilling stereotypes but a nation capable of putting on one hell of a party and playing a great host to those who want to join in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup : uniting people even if germany were to go out to italy in the semi-finals , the enduring image of the world cup will be the millions of germans celebrating together with fans from all over the globe , turning this tournament into a soccer summer of love . but if michael ballack were to lift the trophy in berlin this new german belief , pride and positivity would go to another , hopefully , sustainable level .
it could provide germany , a country which has suffered from collective depression for so long , a solid base for a social recovery .
this is why germany should win . italy : stain of corruption italy find themselves in a real quandary .
if they lift the trophy on july 9 , they may be the first world champions to be crowned on the day that a court rules that their game is endemically corrupt .
the investigation into match-fixing back home could come to a close on the day of the world cup final and , if those at the top of the italian game are found guilty by the findings , soccer in italy could be set back a decade . top clubs like juventus , ac milan , fiorentina and lazio are in the dock as investigators look into allegations that corrupt referees manipulated matches , mostly in favor of champions juventus , who have won four of the past five championships .
the turin club could be stripped of their titles and relegated , meaning a high number of italy 's squad would be returning to second , even third-division soccer . because soccer defeat in italy is something akin to national bereavement , the country would enter a period of mourning that could affect all aspects of italian life for many years to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians could demand a massive clean-up campaign if they would win the world cup , then the italians would have a title to live up to .
such is the pride in their team and their country , the italians would demand that their game be purged of those who have dragged it into the mire . a world cup victory could provide the catalyst for empowerment both in society and in soccer circles , leading to a cleansing of the italian game .
this is why italy should win the world cup . france : public unity when france won the world cup in 1998 , the team was heralded as a success story for the country 's integration policies , fielding descendents from colonies such as surinam , algeria and guadeloupe .
the knock-on effects of that win and of a team built up of players of different ethnicities carried france as country on a wave of unity for many months . history now shows that the gloss of the ' 98 world cup win was no more than paper over the serious cracks in french society and that it was just a matter of time until the failure of france 's integration experiment was once again clear to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars have made way for a huge french love-in the riots of 2005 and the student protests of earlier this year have abated but the sources of french discontent remain .
while the experiences of 1998 tell us that a french world cup win in 2006 will not cure the ills , it would provide some relief .
coming in the year of a presidential election , a wave of optimism flowing from an incredible swansong for zidane and the old guard could sweep through france and bring about real change . the french team have already stood up to the far-right jean marie le pen and have declared unswerving allegiance to la grande nation in the face of nationalistic slurs .
a victory in germany for the multicultural bleus could inspire their splintered country to take similar action and bring the sometimes warring sides together .
this is why france should win the world cup . portugal : reform inspiration portugal may be seen by some as the party-crashers of the semi-finals .
figo and co. find themselves in illustrious company made up of former world champions .
a country which has yet to win an international title , portugal could be the flag-bearers for all those teams outside the perceived hierarchy of " big " teams who are consistently touted as favorites .
a world cup win for portugal would give hope to all those outside that exclusive club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal would be champions by fair means or foul but a world cup win for portugal would also send out another message : that play-acting and cynicism can get you as far as playing the other team off the park .
a victory in berlin for this portuguese team would be a triumph of simulation .
no other team has conned referees or intimidated the opposition more at this world cup , and considering that holland , italy and argentina all featured - that 's worthy of a trophy on its own . in an ideal world , a win for portugal on july 9 would shock soccer 's governing bodies into much-needed action .
a world cup victory for portugal should mean an overhaul of the game 's rules , the clear rewriting of what is unacceptable and widespread reform of the increasingly ugly beautiful game .

one of these teams will win the 2006 world cup .
but which team should win it ?
each country stands to offer something very different to the world by being crowned champions . there is one truism in soccer that continues to hold : the best team does n't always win .
playing great soccer does n't always guarantee success .
given that soccer is as much about good fortune as good performances , maybe we should forget about who has the right to win the world cup on the basis of their displays and look at which team should win the world cup for other reasons . germany has been riding a wave of euphoria ever since the first game of the tournament proved that klinsmann 's kids were not the huge risk that everyone though they would be .
with every game , the nation 's smile has gotten broader . germans have displayed a new enthusiasm and pride in their country which would surely increase even further should the national team with the cup .
the collective hope - now bordering on unwavering belief - that the world cup will stay in germany after july 9 has brought the people together , uniting germans of all backgrounds and ethnicities . this has not been lost on those outside the country 's borders .
the most pleasant side effect of this tournament is the image of germany as an inclusive , friendly and welcoming nation .
the german people themselves have shown that they are not the dull , humorless race of a sausage-scarfing , beer-swilling stereotypes but a nation capable of putting on one hell of a party and playing a great host to those who want to join in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup : uniting people even if germany were to go out to italy in the semi-finals , the enduring image of the world cup will be the millions of germans celebrating together with fans from all over the globe , turning this tournament into a soccer summer of love . but if michael ballack were to lift the trophy in berlin this new german belief , pride and positivity would go to another , hopefully , sustainable level .
it could provide germany , a country which has suffered from collective depression for so long , a solid base for a social recovery .
this is why germany should win . italy : stain of corruption italy find themselves in a real quandary .
if they lift the trophy on july 9 , they may be the first world champions to be crowned on the day that a court rules that their game is endemically corrupt .
the investigation into match-fixing back home could come to a close on the day of the world cup final and , if those at the top of the italian game are found guilty by the findings , soccer in italy could be set back a decade . top clubs like juventus , ac milan , fiorentina and lazio are in the dock as investigators look into allegations that corrupt referees manipulated matches , mostly in favor of champions juventus , who have won four of the past five championships .
the turin club could be stripped of their titles and relegated , meaning a high number of italy 's squad would be returning to second , even third-division soccer . because soccer defeat in italy is something akin to national bereavement , the country would enter a period of mourning that could affect all aspects of italian life for many years to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians could demand a massive clean-up campaign if they would win the world cup , then the italians would have a title to live up to .
such is the pride in their team and their country , the italians would demand that their game be purged of those who have dragged it into the mire . a world cup victory could provide the catalyst for empowerment both in society and in soccer circles , leading to a cleansing of the italian game .
this is why italy should win the world cup . france : public unity when france won the world cup in 1998 , the team was heralded as a success story for the country 's integration policies , fielding descendents from colonies such as surinam , algeria and guadeloupe .
the knock-on effects of that win and of a team built up of players of different ethnicities carried france as country on a wave of unity for many months . history now shows that the gloss of the ' 98 world cup win was no more than paper over the serious cracks in french society and that it was just a matter of time until the failure of france 's integration experiment was once again clear to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars have made way for a huge french love-in the riots of 2005 and the student protests of earlier this year have abated but the sources of french discontent remain .
while the experiences of 1998 tell us that a french world cup win in 2006 will not cure the ills , it would provide some relief .
coming in the year of a presidential election , a wave of optimism flowing from an incredible swansong for zidane and the old guard could sweep through france and bring about real change . the french team have already stood up to the far-right jean marie le pen and have declared unswerving allegiance to la grande nation in the face of nationalistic slurs .
a victory in germany for the multicultural bleus could inspire their splintered country to take similar action and bring the sometimes warring sides together .
this is why france should win the world cup . portugal : reform inspiration portugal may be seen by some as the party-crashers of the semi-finals .
figo and co. find themselves in illustrious company made up of former world champions .
a country which has yet to win an international title , portugal could be the flag-bearers for all those teams outside the perceived hierarchy of " big " teams who are consistently touted as favorites .
a world cup win for portugal would give hope to all those outside that exclusive club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal would be champions by fair means or foul but a world cup win for portugal would also send out another message : that play-acting and cynicism can get you as far as playing the other team off the park .
a victory in berlin for this portuguese team would be a triumph of simulation .
no other team has conned referees or intimidated the opposition more at this world cup , and considering that holland , italy and argentina all featured - that 's worthy of a trophy on its own . in an ideal world , a win for portugal on july 9 would shock soccer 's governing bodies into much-needed action .

" this is an important breakthrough we have succeeded in making , " merkel said after the late-night huddle . from 2008 , tax revenues will incrementally be used to fund the system . around 1.5 billion in tax revenue will go toward health insurance for children in 2008 and double that amount in 2009 . a central health-care fund will be introduced to pool contributions made by workers and employees as well as the tax money .
the fund will pass on money to insurance companies , who - should they require additional funding - can also raise cash directly from their members through a levy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those covered by public insurers began paying more for prescriptions in 2004 in contrast to earlier plans , private health insurers will not contribute to the fund , although they would have to play a bigger part in " stabilizing the health care system , " chancellor merkel said . reduction of overall tax burden for companies the coalition also agreed to reduce the overall tax burden on german companies to just under 30 percent from around 39 percent , bavarian premier edmund stoiber said . a new flat-rate withholding tax at 25 percent will be levied on capital gains , including interest and dividend income and the gains from asset sales . the reforms are a key test of merkel 's government as it seeks to overhaul europe 's biggest economy . the thorniest issue had been the question of how to fund changes to health care , expected to cost at least 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.3 billion -rrb- . conservatives are eager to reduce non-wage labor costs while social democrats want higher earners to shoulder more of the funding burden . merkel said on monday using tax revenue would lead to a drop in employment costs . germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in europe german workers and employers currently jointly contribute around 14 percent of an employee 's wage packet to pay for statutory healthcare , but due to the country 's ageing population and low birth rate the system has come under strain as the number of contributors shrinks . as non-wage employment costs rise to try to compensate , labor becomes too expensive , reducing the incentive for firms to invest in germany and helping to force companies abroad . germany 's healthcare system costs around 140 billion euros a year and results in some of the highest non-wage labor costs in europe . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german coalition agrees on tax for wealthy , other reforms germany 's grand coalition government spent a long night in negotiations over key reforms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : explore germany 's rivers rhine river transformed into nearly pristine water stream a cycle trip and tipple along the moselle discovering the altmühl valley a picturesque pedal down the rhine visit germany -pipe- 03.07.2006 a river runs through it großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : go with the flow and get to know germany from another perspective river-faring vessels have access to more than 7,000 kilometers -lrb- 4,350 miles -rrb- of inland waterways in germany .
many routes are sought after by travelers who enjoy relaxing on a cruise ship and letting the world drift by . for some , a cruise is the ultimate upmarket vacation , while for others it means boring bourgeoisie .
but the view from the deck of a cruise ship does n't always have to be drab and monotonous . the alternative to a high-sea tour is to take an inland river cruise on one of germany 's many trafficked waterways - and take in german cultural history along the way .
opportunities for multiple-day trips are plentiful - whether on the rhine , the weser , the danube or the moselle . the river rhine - muse of poets and painters the rhine is germany 's most famous river , in part because so much has been written about it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loreley on the rhine has been an inspiration to creative minds for centuries it was mainly the romantic painters and poets of the mid-19th century that turned their attention to the water cutting through the western edge of germany .
heinrich heine -lrb- 1797-1856 -rrb- , for example , dedicated one of his world famous poems to the lorelei cliffs that overlook the rhine near st. goarshausen . a trip down the rhine can be particularly romantic , despite the occasional turbulence-causing shallows . following the footprints of the romantics for the traveler interested in learning more about the history and culture of southern germany , a cruise on the danube river would be a good choice .
europe 's second longest river , the danube has a wealth of history to offer its visitors - even the romans left their traces along the river . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medieval regensburg is a highlight on europe 's second longest river , the beautiful blue danube the danube flows by the medieval city of regensburg , then crosses the german border and continues on to vienna and budapest .
castles , chateaus and vineyards are visible from the river and invite travelers to disembark and try their land legs . nature and culture a river cruise on the oder , germany 's eastern most river , is also an exploration of the german-polish border .
visitors glide past natural parks like the maerkische schweiz and unique everglades like the oderbruch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some unusual musicians await visitors in bremen on the weser a river trip from magdeburg to prague is a good option for the traveler with plenty of time .
the elbe , the most important waterway between southeastern and northeastern europe , is over 1,000 kilometers -lrb- 621 miles -rrb- long .
the bauhaus city of dessau and martin luther 's wittenberg are located near the banks of the elbe , as are meissen with its china manufacturers and dresden , the capital of saxony . fairy tale travels on the weser many german fairy tales and legends have their roots on the river .
a traveler on the weser river , for example , passes through northern germany where the legendary musicians attract visitors to bremen and , a bit further upriver , the pied piper whistles river-drifters to hamelin . dw staff -lrb- pt / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de florence on the elbe turns 800 dresden was once one of europe ’ s most beautiful cities , but in 1945 allied bombers turned what was known as " florence on the elbe " into a pile of rubble .

for decades , the rivalry split the town in two . the small aurach river gurgles through the heart of herzogenaurach , population 24,000 , and gives the town its name .
but this peaceful , meandering waterway once symbolized a bitter , protracted family feud that divided the town into two distinct camps . it was all about footwear . " the town became known as the town where people tend to look down because you 'd always tend to look at shoes the person is wearing before you strike up a conversation , " said barbara smit , a dutch financial journalist and one of the authors to tackle the story of the dassler brothers , rudolf and adolf . they started out making shoes together before having a terrible falling out .
their argument resulted in the creation of two sports giants , puma and adidas , both still based in the provincial town . partners , then enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf -lrb- adi -rrb- dassler in 1978 rudolf and younger brother adolf , rudi and adi to friends , began their shoe business in their mother 's laundry room in the 1920s .
at the time , electricity supplies in the town were unreliable , and the brothers sometimes had to use pedal power from a stationary bicycle to run their equipment . " they were very different characters , " said smit .
" adi dassler was always more thoughtful , a craftsman who enjoyed nothing more than fiddling with his shoes .
whereas rudolf dassler was a more abrasive , loudmouthed salesman .
they complemented each other very well to begin with . " their new , lightweight sports shoes began to attract attention and they moved into a location south of the aurach river near the train station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jesse owens the dassler brothers shoe factory jumped onto the world stage in 1936 when they found themselves providing footwear for american jessie owens , who won four gold medals at the berlin olympics . but after the war , the fraternal relationship fell apart .
in smit 's book , " pitch invasion , " she theorizes that it could have had something to do with nazi party links and that after rudolf was picked up by american soldiers and accused of being a member of the ss , he was convinced that his brother had turned him in .
others speculate it could have had something to do with their wives , or a simple misunderstanding in a bomb shelter .
no one really knows for sure . what is certain is that they felt they could no longer work together and in 1948 the dassler brothers shoe factory was split in two . " more of less in the middle of the night , rudolf dassler packed his bags and moved on the other side of the little river , " said smit .
" he established puma on the other side .
from there on in , the town was really split in two like a sort of mini berlin with this little river as a partition in the middle . " and like berlin 's famous wall , it was n't advisable to cross over , at least when it came to shoes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reconstruction of adolf dassler 's early shoe workshop brand loyalty became paramount for many residents .
two camps formed , and dug in . there were stores , bakers and bars which were unofficially known as either loyal to rudolf 's puma , or to adolf 's new company , adidas , which he named using his nickname , adi , and the first three letters of his last name .
there were two soccer teams : the asv herzogenaurach club wore the three stripes ; the 1 fc herzogenaurach had the jumping cat on its footwear .
intermarriage was frowned upon . " i knew a butcher who played for the puma team , " said ernst ditrich who works at the town 's museum .
" he told us the guys from the adidas team did n't need to bother buying at his store .
he did n't want to do business with them .
that sort of thing happened . " wayward son the brothers never did reconcile .
while they are buried in the same cemetery , their graves are about as far apart as possible .
but one of their descendents decided the family feud had gone on long enough . frank dassler is the grandson of rudolf dassler and grew up living and breathing puma .
growing up , he had no contact at all with his great-uncle adolf 's family . " they stayed kind of enemies during the rest of their lives , " he said .
" it 's certainly sad , but from a business point of view it was a good decision , since it motivated both companies to innovate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the adidas " world of sports " headquarters but these days , frank dassler sits not in puma 's new glass-and-steel headquarters on the bank of the river , but in an office at the adidas campus further north , on the site of a former american army barracks .
two years ago , he took a job as the adidas group 's head legal counsel . " my stepmother and my stepbrother were n't very happy about this decision , they thought it would be a betrayal against my grandfather , " he said . his taboo breaking raised more than a few eyebrows in the town and the local newspapers were not always so kind . " but this rivalry was years ago , it 's history now , " he said . lost its punch indeed , young people today seem little concerned with the once-intense rivalry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puma 's had new strength in its spring for the past few years " it 's not so strong anymore .
it was like that before , but now , i do n't think people care so much , " said 14-year-old teresa , who was wearing puma shoes but carrying an adidas bag .
" sometimes puma has something better , sometimes adidas .
it just depends . " but hermann lindner , 41 , who was with his family -lrb- all wearing puma -rrb- at a festival for the argentinian team who is staying in the town for the world cup , says the two camps have n't entirely folded up their tents . " no , it 's not as extreme as it used to be , but you still find people who stick to puma and other who only wear adidas , " he said .
" people do make the distinction . " and while most think things are better now that rivalry has cooled , some knew how to make the most of it when it was raging , frank dassler says .
he remembers that when handymen would come to work at his grandfather 's house , they would sometimes wear adidas shoes on purpose .
when rudolf would see their footwear , he 'd tell them to go to the basement and pick out a pair of puma shoes , which they could have for free . " rudolf simply could n't stand the fact that someone was wearing an adidas shoe in his private home , " dassler said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de adidas cashes in on the world cup german sports giant adidas is using its dominance in the soccer gear business during the upcoming world cup to kit out the german national team as well as five others .

for decades , the rivalry split the town in two . the small aurach river gurgles through the heart of herzogenaurach , population 24,000 , and gives the town its name .
but this peaceful , meandering waterway once symbolized a bitter , protracted family feud that divided the town into two distinct camps . it was all about footwear . " the town became known as the town where people tend to look down because you 'd always tend to look at shoes the person is wearing before you strike up a conversation , " said barbara smit , a dutch financial journalist and one of the authors to tackle the story of the dassler brothers , rudolf and adolf . they started out making shoes together before having a terrible falling out .
their argument resulted in the creation of two sports giants , puma and adidas , both still based in the provincial town . partners , then enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf -lrb- adi -rrb- dassler in 1978 rudolf and younger brother adolf , rudi and adi to friends , began their shoe business in their mother 's laundry room in the 1920s .
at the time , electricity supplies in the town were unreliable , and the brothers sometimes had to use pedal power from a stationary bicycle to run their equipment . " they were very different characters , " said smit .
" adi dassler was always more thoughtful , a craftsman who enjoyed nothing more than fiddling with his shoes .
whereas rudolf dassler was a more abrasive , loudmouthed salesman .
they complemented each other very well to begin with . " their new , lightweight sports shoes began to attract attention and they moved into a location south of the aurach river near the train station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jesse owens the dassler brothers shoe factory jumped onto the world stage in 1936 when they found themselves providing footwear for american jessie owens , who won four gold medals at the berlin olympics . but after the war , the fraternal relationship fell apart .
in smit 's book , " pitch invasion , " she theorizes that it could have had something to do with nazi party links and that after rudolf was picked up by american soldiers and accused of being a member of the ss , he was convinced that his brother had turned him in .
others speculate it could have had something to do with their wives , or a simple misunderstanding in a bomb shelter .
no one really knows for sure . what is certain is that they felt they could no longer work together and in 1948 the dassler brothers shoe factory was split in two . " more of less in the middle of the night , rudolf dassler packed his bags and moved on the other side of the little river , " said smit .
" he established puma on the other side .
from there on in , the town was really split in two like a sort of mini berlin with this little river as a partition in the middle . " and like berlin 's famous wall , it was n't advisable to cross over , at least when it came to shoes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reconstruction of adolf dassler 's early shoe workshop brand loyalty became paramount for many residents .
two camps formed , and dug in . there were stores , bakers and bars which were unofficially known as either loyal to rudolf 's puma , or to adolf 's new company , adidas , which he named using his nickname , adi , and the first three letters of his last name .
there were two soccer teams : the asv herzogenaurach club wore the three stripes ; the 1 fc herzogenaurach had the jumping cat on its footwear .
intermarriage was frowned upon . " i knew a butcher who played for the puma team , " said ernst ditrich who works at the town 's museum .
" he told us the guys from the adidas team did n't need to bother buying at his store .
he did n't want to do business with them .
that sort of thing happened . " wayward son the brothers never did reconcile .
while they are buried in the same cemetery , their graves are about as far apart as possible .
but one of their descendents decided the family feud had gone on long enough . frank dassler is the grandson of rudolf dassler and grew up living and breathing puma .
growing up , he had no contact at all with his great-uncle adolf 's family . " they stayed kind of enemies during the rest of their lives , " he said .
" it 's certainly sad , but from a business point of view it was a good decision , since it motivated both companies to innovate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the adidas " world of sports " headquarters but these days , frank dassler sits not in puma 's new glass-and-steel headquarters on the bank of the river , but in an office at the adidas campus further north , on the site of a former american army barracks .
two years ago , he took a job as the adidas group 's head legal counsel . " my stepmother and my stepbrother were n't very happy about this decision , they thought it would be a betrayal against my grandfather , " he said . his taboo breaking raised more than a few eyebrows in the town and the local newspapers were not always so kind . " but this rivalry was years ago , it 's history now , " he said . lost its punch indeed , young people today seem little concerned with the once-intense rivalry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puma 's had new strength in its spring for the past few years " it 's not so strong anymore .
it was like that before , but now , i do n't think people care so much , " said 14-year-old teresa , who was wearing puma shoes but carrying an adidas bag .

the pieces have all fallen into place for germany .
they are the hosts , jürgen klinsmann 's xi are in form , and they have the " big " country monkey off their back .
but germany 's history against italy is not a golden one . between them , germany and italy have collected six world cups , three times each .
coach jürgen klinsmann won it as a player in 1990 in italy .
but that final was against argentina who had knocked out the hosts in the semi-finals on penalties .
in contests with the azzurri however , germany can hardly rely on a successful history .
head-to-head , germany have won only seven times compared to 13 losses in 28 matches . in major competitions , italy have had germany 's number .
they took home the world cup in 1982 , beating germany 3-1 in madrid for what was their third title .
the legendary squadra azzurra led by paolo rossi made short shrift of jupp derwall 's finalists and underlined their claim as being europe 's strongest soccer nation with that championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the azzurri flew higher than germany in the 1982 final as important as that game was since it was a final , it was a semi-final , like the one this tuesday , that has gone down in history and remained etched in the memories of those who lived to see and hear it . under a broiling midday sun in mexico city , germany and italy played 120 minutes , before coach ferruccio valcareggi 's italy came out on top 4-3 in what has recently been voted as the " game of the century " in a fifa poll .
in mexico , the match has such great meaning that a plaque commemorates the contest at the aztec stadium . an injured ' kaiser ' and a high-flying ' bomber ' the circumstances that evolved during the game make it understandable why it is considered the classic game in world cup history .
italy went ahead after just eight minutes .

the pieces have all fallen into place for germany .
they are the hosts , jürgen klinsmann 's xi are in form , and they have the " big " country monkey off their back .
but germany 's history against italy is not a golden one . between them , germany and italy have collected six world cups , three times each .
coach jürgen klinsmann won it as a player in 1990 in italy .
but that final was against argentina who had knocked out the hosts in the semi-finals on penalties .
in contests with the azzurri however , germany can hardly rely on a successful history .
head-to-head , germany have won only seven times compared to 13 losses in 28 matches . in major competitions , italy have had germany 's number .
they took home the world cup in 1982 , beating germany 3-1 in madrid for what was their third title .
the legendary squadra azzurra led by paolo rossi made short shrift of jupp derwall 's finalists and underlined their claim as being europe 's strongest soccer nation with that championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the azzurri flew higher than germany in the 1982 final as important as that game was since it was a final , it was a semi-final , like the one this tuesday , that has gone down in history and remained etched in the memories of those who lived to see and hear it . under a broiling midday sun in mexico city , germany and italy played 120 minutes , before coach ferruccio valcareggi 's italy came out on top 4-3 in what has recently been voted as the " game of the century " in a fifa poll .
in mexico , the match has such great meaning that a plaque commemorates the contest at the aztec stadium . an injured ' kaiser ' and a high-flying ' bomber ' the circumstances that evolved during the game make it understandable why it is considered the classic game in world cup history .
italy went ahead after just eight minutes .
germany finally leveled in injury time on a goal by karl heinz schnellinger , forcing the match into extra-time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy celebrated at the end of the " game of the century " in mexico germany 's one-man wrecking crew gerd ' der bomber ' müller put germany ahead quickly before italy pulled ahead over the course of five minutes .

the fund will pass on money to insurance companies , who - should they require additional funding - can also raise cash directly from their members through a levy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those covered by public insurers began paying more for prescriptions in 2004 in contrast to earlier plans , private health insurers will not contribute to the fund , although they would have to play a bigger part in " stabilizing the health care system , " chancellor merkel said . reduction of overall tax burden for companies the coalition also agreed to reduce the overall tax burden on german companies to just under 30 percent from around 39 percent , bavarian premier edmund stoiber said . a new flat-rate withholding tax at 25 percent will be levied on capital gains , including interest and dividend income and the gains from asset sales . the reforms are a key test of merkel 's government as it seeks to overhaul europe 's biggest economy . the thorniest issue had been the question of how to fund changes to health care , expected to cost at least 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.3 billion -rrb- . conservatives are eager to reduce non-wage labor costs while social democrats want higher earners to shoulder more of the funding burden . merkel said on monday using tax revenue would lead to a drop in employment costs . germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in europe german workers and employers currently jointly contribute around 14 percent of an employee 's wage packet to pay for statutory healthcare , but due to the country 's ageing population and low birth rate the system has come under strain as the number of contributors shrinks . as non-wage employment costs rise to try to compensate , labor becomes too expensive , reducing the incentive for firms to invest in germany and helping to force companies abroad . germany 's healthcare system costs around 140 billion euros a year and results in some of the highest non-wage labor costs in europe . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german coalition agrees on tax for wealthy , other reforms germany 's grand coalition government spent a long night in negotiations over key reforms .

the pieces have all fallen into place for germany .
they are the hosts , jürgen klinsmann 's xi are in form , and they have the " big " country monkey off their back .
but germany 's history against italy is not a golden one . between them , germany and italy have collected six world cups , three times each .
coach jürgen klinsmann won it as a player in 1990 in italy .
but that final was against argentina who had knocked out the hosts in the semi-finals on penalties .
in contests with the azzurri however , germany can hardly rely on a successful history .
head-to-head , germany have won only seven times compared to 13 losses in 28 matches . in major competitions , italy have had germany 's number .

in mexico , the match has such great meaning that a plaque commemorates the contest at the aztec stadium . an injured ' kaiser ' and a high-flying ' bomber ' the circumstances that evolved during the game make it understandable why it is considered the classic game in world cup history .
italy went ahead after just eight minutes .
germany finally leveled in injury time on a goal by karl heinz schnellinger , forcing the match into extra-time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy celebrated at the end of the " game of the century " in mexico germany 's one-man wrecking crew gerd ' der bomber ' müller put germany ahead quickly before italy pulled ahead over the course of five minutes .

many have requested criminal charges be brought against those responsible for the bear 's death . with all the hype , you 'd think bruno were staging yet another publicity stunt - this time , from the grave .
bruno has gained so much popularity and support both in germany and around the world that 300 people staged a protest near the berlin cathedral on saturday . demonstration leader kurt eicher told the afp news agency that evidence clearly showed that bruno had been wrongly shot .
eicher also accused the bavarian environment ministry of violating the law protecting endangered animals by giving the " shoot-to-kill " order to hunters . animal protection groups file formal complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : idyllic bavaria is where bruno met his death last week bavarian environment minister werner schnappauf has been under fire himself for his shoot-to-kill order .
munich prosecutors said they have received a flood of requests asking that criminal charges be brought against schnappauf and others responsible for the decision to kill the bear . the public prosecutor 's office said it would decide at the end of the week whether it would begin preliminary proceedings . a poll last week by the forsa institute of over 1,000 germans said 70 percent of germans agreed with the shooting , but regretted bruno 's death .
only 24 percent said they were relieved that the bear no longer posed a threat . still , bruno was on world cup fans ' minds over the weekend .
as toymakers prepare to produce a teddy bear to immortalize the animal , some fans on berlin 's fan mile and at the quarter-final win over argentina waved placards in his memory .
" revenge for bruno , " read one . the web site that originally coined a song to commemorate the bear and " hunt bruno " game have since created the " bruno 's revenge " game . italy wants its bear back meanwhile , the cadaver of the bear the media dubbed " bruno " is currently in deep freeze , but is scheduled to be stuffed and placed in a museum .
bruno , however , stemmed from the italian region of trentino .
according to the ap and dpa news agencies , italian environment minister alfonso pecoraro scanio will formally ask germany on monday to give back bruno 's body . bruno was killed by a government-sanctioned hunter in bavaria last week after having first been spotted in germany in may .
part of a project to reintroduce the predators to northern italy , the bear roamed into austria and germany , killed sheep and rabbits , stole honey and was in the headlines across europe for weeks . fearing the two-year-old bear would one day target humans , officials in the southern state of bavaria granted permission to kill him even though he was the first wild bear to be seen in germany since 1835 . italian environment minister alfonso pecoraro scanio has protested the killing and said that the bear should have been shot with tranquilizers and transported back to italy . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vacationing a no-no in bear-killing bavaria what 's an animal rights activist with summer vacation plans in bavaria to do ?

" we will be a neutral party and will not take sides with anyone , " jung said following a meeting with congo 's defense minister , adolphe onusumba , in kinshasa . congo could remain a dangerous area , jung said , until final election results rolled in presumably at the end of august .
however , he said he was certain eu peacekeeping troops would deter violence . jung said the around 2,000 european troops are obligated to remain neutral .
congo 's opposition parties have feared that the european troops would aid the current president , joseph kabila , to remain in office . german help after the elections during his visit , jung is scheduled to meet with representatives of the government and with the independent election commission 's director , muholongu malumalu .

he will be viewing the european troops ' military bases in kinshasa and neighboring gabon 's capital , libreville . german troops may guard polling stations germany currently has less than 100 peacekeepers in the region , but that figure will rise to 500 german troops and 280 support personnel by election day on july 30th when 25 million congolese go to the polls to choose a new president and parliament . most of the german troops will be deployed in gabon .
their primary purpose will be to fly into congo and rescue united nations election observers should violence break out during the polls .

playing great soccer does n't always guarantee success .
given that soccer is as much about good fortune as good performances , maybe we should forget about who has the right to win the world cup on the basis of their displays and look at which team should win the world cup for other reasons . germany has been riding a wave of euphoria ever since the first game of the tournament proved that klinsmann 's kids were not the huge risk that everyone though they would be .
with every game , the nation 's smile has gotten broader . germans have displayed a new enthusiasm and pride in their country which would surely increase even further should the national team with the cup .
the collective hope - now bordering on unwavering belief - that the world cup will stay in germany after july 9 has brought the people together , uniting germans of all backgrounds and ethnicities . this has not been lost on those outside the country 's borders .
the most pleasant side effect of this tournament is the image of germany as an inclusive , friendly and welcoming nation .
the german people themselves have shown that they are not the dull , humorless race of a sausage-scarfing , beer-swilling stereotypes but a nation capable of putting on one hell of a party and playing a great host to those who want to join in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup : uniting people even if germany were to go out to italy in the semi-finals , the enduring image of the world cup will be the millions of germans celebrating together with fans from all over the globe , turning this tournament into a soccer summer of love . but if michael ballack were to lift the trophy in berlin this new german belief , pride and positivity would go to another , hopefully , sustainable level .
it could provide germany , a country which has suffered from collective depression for so long , a solid base for a social recovery .
this is why germany should win . italy : stain of corruption italy find themselves in a real quandary .
if they lift the trophy on july 9 , they may be the first world champions to be crowned on the day that a court rules that their game is endemically corrupt .
the investigation into match-fixing back home could come to a close on the day of the world cup final and , if those at the top of the italian game are found guilty by the findings , soccer in italy could be set back a decade . top clubs like juventus , ac milan , fiorentina and lazio are in the dock as investigators look into allegations that corrupt referees manipulated matches , mostly in favor of champions juventus , who have won four of the past five championships .
the turin club could be stripped of their titles and relegated , meaning a high number of italy 's squad would be returning to second , even third-division soccer . because soccer defeat in italy is something akin to national bereavement , the country would enter a period of mourning that could affect all aspects of italian life for many years to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians could demand a massive clean-up campaign if they would win the world cup , then the italians would have a title to live up to .
such is the pride in their team and their country , the italians would demand that their game be purged of those who have dragged it into the mire . a world cup victory could provide the catalyst for empowerment both in society and in soccer circles , leading to a cleansing of the italian game .
this is why italy should win the world cup . france : public unity when france won the world cup in 1998 , the team was heralded as a success story for the country 's integration policies , fielding descendents from colonies such as surinam , algeria and guadeloupe .
the knock-on effects of that win and of a team built up of players of different ethnicities carried france as country on a wave of unity for many months . history now shows that the gloss of the ' 98 world cup win was no more than paper over the serious cracks in french society and that it was just a matter of time until the failure of france 's integration experiment was once again clear to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars have made way for a huge french love-in the riots of 2005 and the student protests of earlier this year have abated but the sources of french discontent remain .
while the experiences of 1998 tell us that a french world cup win in 2006 will not cure the ills , it would provide some relief .
coming in the year of a presidential election , a wave of optimism flowing from an incredible swansong for zidane and the old guard could sweep through france and bring about real change . the french team have already stood up to the far-right jean marie le pen and have declared unswerving allegiance to la grande nation in the face of nationalistic slurs .
a victory in germany for the multicultural bleus could inspire their splintered country to take similar action and bring the sometimes warring sides together .

the knock-on effects of that win and of a team built up of players of different ethnicities carried france as country on a wave of unity for many months . history now shows that the gloss of the ' 98 world cup win was no more than paper over the serious cracks in french society and that it was just a matter of time until the failure of france 's integration experiment was once again clear to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars have made way for a huge french love-in the riots of 2005 and the student protests of earlier this year have abated but the sources of french discontent remain .
while the experiences of 1998 tell us that a french world cup win in 2006 will not cure the ills , it would provide some relief .
coming in the year of a presidential election , a wave of optimism flowing from an incredible swansong for zidane and the old guard could sweep through france and bring about real change . the french team have already stood up to the far-right jean marie le pen and have declared unswerving allegiance to la grande nation in the face of nationalistic slurs .
a victory in germany for the multicultural bleus could inspire their splintered country to take similar action and bring the sometimes warring sides together .
this is why france should win the world cup . portugal : reform inspiration portugal may be seen by some as the party-crashers of the semi-finals .
figo and co. find themselves in illustrious company made up of former world champions .
a country which has yet to win an international title , portugal could be the flag-bearers for all those teams outside the perceived hierarchy of " big " teams who are consistently touted as favorites .
a world cup win for portugal would give hope to all those outside that exclusive club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal would be champions by fair means or foul but a world cup win for portugal would also send out another message : that play-acting and cynicism can get you as far as playing the other team off the park .
a victory in berlin for this portuguese team would be a triumph of simulation .
no other team has conned referees or intimidated the opposition more at this world cup , and considering that holland , italy and argentina all featured - that 's worthy of a trophy on its own . in an ideal world , a win for portugal on july 9 would shock soccer 's governing bodies into much-needed action .
a world cup victory for portugal should mean an overhaul of the game 's rules , the clear rewriting of what is unacceptable and widespread reform of the increasingly ugly beautiful game .
that is why portugal should win the world cup . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an all-european fight for the world cup brazil and argentina are packing their bags for home , leaving the 2006 world cup to be battled for amongst four european teams .

many have requested criminal charges be brought against those responsible for the bear 's death . with all the hype , you 'd think bruno were staging yet another publicity stunt - this time , from the grave .
bruno has gained so much popularity and support both in germany and around the world that 300 people staged a protest near the berlin cathedral on saturday . demonstration leader kurt eicher told the afp news agency that evidence clearly showed that bruno had been wrongly shot .
eicher also accused the bavarian environment ministry of violating the law protecting endangered animals by giving the " shoot-to-kill " order to hunters . animal protection groups file formal complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : idyllic bavaria is where bruno met his death last week bavarian environment minister werner schnappauf has been under fire himself for his shoot-to-kill order .
munich prosecutors said they have received a flood of requests asking that criminal charges be brought against schnappauf and others responsible for the decision to kill the bear . the public prosecutor 's office said it would decide at the end of the week whether it would begin preliminary proceedings . a poll last week by the forsa institute of over 1,000 germans said 70 percent of germans agreed with the shooting , but regretted bruno 's death .
only 24 percent said they were relieved that the bear no longer posed a threat . still , bruno was on world cup fans ' minds over the weekend .
as toymakers prepare to produce a teddy bear to immortalize the animal , some fans on berlin 's fan mile and at the quarter-final win over argentina waved placards in his memory .
" revenge for bruno , " read one . the web site that originally coined a song to commemorate the bear and " hunt bruno " game have since created the " bruno 's revenge " game . italy wants its bear back meanwhile , the cadaver of the bear the media dubbed " bruno " is currently in deep freeze , but is scheduled to be stuffed and placed in a museum .
bruno , however , stemmed from the italian region of trentino .
according to the ap and dpa news agencies , italian environment minister alfonso pecoraro scanio will formally ask germany on monday to give back bruno 's body . bruno was killed by a government-sanctioned hunter in bavaria last week after having first been spotted in germany in may .
part of a project to reintroduce the predators to northern italy , the bear roamed into austria and germany , killed sheep and rabbits , stole honey and was in the headlines across europe for weeks . fearing the two-year-old bear would one day target humans , officials in the southern state of bavaria granted permission to kill him even though he was the first wild bear to be seen in germany since 1835 . italian environment minister alfonso pecoraro scanio has protested the killing and said that the bear should have been shot with tranquilizers and transported back to italy . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vacationing a no-no in bear-killing bavaria what 's an animal rights activist with summer vacation plans in bavaria to do ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel forgeard -lrb- left -rrb- and gustav humbert were forced out forgeard and humbert had been under intense pressure to quit since the news of the a380 delays in mid-june wiped 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- off eads ’ s market value and left airbus trailing us rival boeing . the chief of france ’ s state-owned sncf rail company , louis gallois , is to replace forgeard .
gallois , 62 , is a former head of french state company aerospatiale , whose toulouse factories are now part of eads . gallois also ran aero-engine manufacturer snecma , now part of the defense and communications group safran .
he is already an eads board member . christian streiff , 51 , a former deputy ceo of french building materials group saint gobain , is to succeed humbert as the head of airbus . streiff is an industry outsider , reportedly brought in because of his experiences in managing complex industrial processes .
bilingual in french and german , he worked for 15 years on behalf of glassmaker saint gobain in germany . german eads head stays on the position of tom enders , who remains the german co-ceo of eads , has now been significantly strengthened .
enders is to assume responsibility for the airbus shareholder committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french rail chief louis gallois is to take over as co-ceo of eads in an effort to preserve the delicate balance of national power inside the company , streiff will report to enders .
under the previous management set-up , humbert had reported to forgeard himself . german economics minister michael glos welcomed the change in eads leadership , saying in a statement on monday that the decision showed the company " recognized its responsibility for its core business , airbus . " glos also said he hoped the new management structure " would be received positively by the market . " but on monday , eads had failed to bounce back from its recently trampled share price .
the group 's shares initially rose as much as 1.7 percent , but then fell again by more than 2 percent . eads shares fell 26 percent when a380 delays were announced on june 14 . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de superjumbo 's delays spell bosses ' demise the french co-chief executive of eads , noel forgeard , and the german chief of european aircraft manufacturer airbus , gustav humbert , resigned on sunday , the european aerospace company said in a statement .

the pieces have all fallen into place for germany .
they are the hosts , jürgen klinsmann 's xi are in form , and they have the " big " country monkey off their back .
but germany 's history against italy is not a golden one . between them , germany and italy have collected six world cups , three times each .
coach jürgen klinsmann won it as a player in 1990 in italy .
but that final was against argentina who had knocked out the hosts in the semi-finals on penalties .
in contests with the azzurri however , germany can hardly rely on a successful history .
head-to-head , germany have won only seven times compared to 13 losses in 28 matches . in major competitions , italy have had germany 's number .
they took home the world cup in 1982 , beating germany 3-1 in madrid for what was their third title .
the legendary squadra azzurra led by paolo rossi made short shrift of jupp derwall 's finalists and underlined their claim as being europe 's strongest soccer nation with that championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the azzurri flew higher than germany in the 1982 final as important as that game was since it was a final , it was a semi-final , like the one this tuesday , that has gone down in history and remained etched in the memories of those who lived to see and hear it . under a broiling midday sun in mexico city , germany and italy played 120 minutes , before coach ferruccio valcareggi 's italy came out on top 4-3 in what has recently been voted as the " game of the century " in a fifa poll .
in mexico , the match has such great meaning that a plaque commemorates the contest at the aztec stadium . an injured ' kaiser ' and a high-flying ' bomber ' the circumstances that evolved during the game make it understandable why it is considered the classic game in world cup history .
italy went ahead after just eight minutes .
germany finally leveled in injury time on a goal by karl heinz schnellinger , forcing the match into extra-time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy celebrated at the end of the " game of the century " in mexico germany 's one-man wrecking crew gerd ' der bomber ' müller put germany ahead quickly before italy pulled ahead over the course of five minutes .
müller , who scored ten goals alone in the 1970 finals , got the equalizer in the 110th minute .
but while the replays were still being shown of his goal , gianni rivera won the game for the italians . franz beckenbauer 's heroics would go down in history after he played much of the two extra-time periods with his arm in a sling after sustaining a broken clavicle on an italian foul . stifling defenses in other affairs in their two other world cup meetings , germany and italy did n't provide any fireworks as in the 1970 semifinal .
in 1962 in chile , the two played to a scoreless draw in the first round .
in 1978 , both teams failed to find the net in a second round encounter . at european championships , germany have also failed to beat the southern europeans .
as hosts in 1988 , germany drew against the italians 1-1 .
in england eight years later , fans had to endure a goalless affair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack -lrb- left -rrb- and alessandro nesta battle in march as much as those games were dominated by stingy defenses , they happened long ago .
in their most recent encounter in florence , a world cup warm-up , italy pushed the germans to their nadir with a 4-1 thrashing .
that is a score jürgen klinsmann would like to settle . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup semi-final , 1970 : italy vs. west germany germany were looking for world cup glory after the disappointment of 1966 .

the pieces have all fallen into place for germany .
they are the hosts , jürgen klinsmann 's xi are in form , and they have the " big " country monkey off their back .
but germany 's history against italy is not a golden one . between them , germany and italy have collected six world cups , three times each .
coach jürgen klinsmann won it as a player in 1990 in italy .
but that final was against argentina who had knocked out the hosts in the semi-finals on penalties .
in contests with the azzurri however , germany can hardly rely on a successful history .
head-to-head , germany have won only seven times compared to 13 losses in 28 matches . in major competitions , italy have had germany 's number .
they took home the world cup in 1982 , beating germany 3-1 in madrid for what was their third title .
the legendary squadra azzurra led by paolo rossi made short shrift of jupp derwall 's finalists and underlined their claim as being europe 's strongest soccer nation with that championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the azzurri flew higher than germany in the 1982 final as important as that game was since it was a final , it was a semi-final , like the one this tuesday , that has gone down in history and remained etched in the memories of those who lived to see and hear it . under a broiling midday sun in mexico city , germany and italy played 120 minutes , before coach ferruccio valcareggi 's italy came out on top 4-3 in what has recently been voted as the " game of the century " in a fifa poll .
in mexico , the match has such great meaning that a plaque commemorates the contest at the aztec stadium . an injured ' kaiser ' and a high-flying ' bomber ' the circumstances that evolved during the game make it understandable why it is considered the classic game in world cup history .
italy went ahead after just eight minutes .
germany finally leveled in injury time on a goal by karl heinz schnellinger , forcing the match into extra-time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy celebrated at the end of the " game of the century " in mexico germany 's one-man wrecking crew gerd ' der bomber ' müller put germany ahead quickly before italy pulled ahead over the course of five minutes .
müller , who scored ten goals alone in the 1970 finals , got the equalizer in the 110th minute .
but while the replays were still being shown of his goal , gianni rivera won the game for the italians . franz beckenbauer 's heroics would go down in history after he played much of the two extra-time periods with his arm in a sling after sustaining a broken clavicle on an italian foul . stifling defenses in other affairs in their two other world cup meetings , germany and italy did n't provide any fireworks as in the 1970 semifinal .
in 1962 in chile , the two played to a scoreless draw in the first round .
in 1978 , both teams failed to find the net in a second round encounter . at european championships , germany have also failed to beat the southern europeans .
as hosts in 1988 , germany drew against the italians 1-1 .
in england eight years later , fans had to endure a goalless affair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack -lrb- left -rrb- and alessandro nesta battle in march as much as those games were dominated by stingy defenses , they happened long ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de features -pipe- 03.07.2006 opinion : who should win the world cup and why großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german victory would have the country in such a rapture that the effects could be long lasting germany , italy , portugal and france .
one of these teams will win the 2006 world cup .
but which team should win it ?
each country stands to offer something very different to the world by being crowned champions . there is one truism in soccer that continues to hold : the best team does n't always win .
playing great soccer does n't always guarantee success .
given that soccer is as much about good fortune as good performances , maybe we should forget about who has the right to win the world cup on the basis of their displays and look at which team should win the world cup for other reasons . germany has been riding a wave of euphoria ever since the first game of the tournament proved that klinsmann 's kids were not the huge risk that everyone though they would be .
with every game , the nation 's smile has gotten broader . germans have displayed a new enthusiasm and pride in their country which would surely increase even further should the national team with the cup .
the collective hope - now bordering on unwavering belief - that the world cup will stay in germany after july 9 has brought the people together , uniting germans of all backgrounds and ethnicities . this has not been lost on those outside the country 's borders .
the most pleasant side effect of this tournament is the image of germany as an inclusive , friendly and welcoming nation .
the german people themselves have shown that they are not the dull , humorless race of a sausage-scarfing , beer-swilling stereotypes but a nation capable of putting on one hell of a party and playing a great host to those who want to join in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup : uniting people even if germany were to go out to italy in the semi-finals , the enduring image of the world cup will be the millions of germans celebrating together with fans from all over the globe , turning this tournament into a soccer summer of love . but if michael ballack were to lift the trophy in berlin this new german belief , pride and positivity would go to another , hopefully , sustainable level .
it could provide germany , a country which has suffered from collective depression for so long , a solid base for a social recovery .
this is why germany should win . italy : stain of corruption italy find themselves in a real quandary .
if they lift the trophy on july 9 , they may be the first world champions to be crowned on the day that a court rules that their game is endemically corrupt .
the investigation into match-fixing back home could come to a close on the day of the world cup final and , if those at the top of the italian game are found guilty by the findings , soccer in italy could be set back a decade . top clubs like juventus , ac milan , fiorentina and lazio are in the dock as investigators look into allegations that corrupt referees manipulated matches , mostly in favor of champions juventus , who have won four of the past five championships .
the turin club could be stripped of their titles and relegated , meaning a high number of italy 's squad would be returning to second , even third-division soccer . because soccer defeat in italy is something akin to national bereavement , the country would enter a period of mourning that could affect all aspects of italian life for many years to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians could demand a massive clean-up campaign if they would win the world cup , then the italians would have a title to live up to .
such is the pride in their team and their country , the italians would demand that their game be purged of those who have dragged it into the mire . a world cup victory could provide the catalyst for empowerment both in society and in soccer circles , leading to a cleansing of the italian game .
this is why italy should win the world cup . france : public unity when france won the world cup in 1998 , the team was heralded as a success story for the country 's integration policies , fielding descendents from colonies such as surinam , algeria and guadeloupe .
the knock-on effects of that win and of a team built up of players of different ethnicities carried france as country on a wave of unity for many months . history now shows that the gloss of the ' 98 world cup win was no more than paper over the serious cracks in french society and that it was just a matter of time until the failure of france 's integration experiment was once again clear to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars have made way for a huge french love-in the riots of 2005 and the student protests of earlier this year have abated but the sources of french discontent remain .
while the experiences of 1998 tell us that a french world cup win in 2006 will not cure the ills , it would provide some relief .
coming in the year of a presidential election , a wave of optimism flowing from an incredible swansong for zidane and the old guard could sweep through france and bring about real change . the french team have already stood up to the far-right jean marie le pen and have declared unswerving allegiance to la grande nation in the face of nationalistic slurs .
a victory in germany for the multicultural bleus could inspire their splintered country to take similar action and bring the sometimes warring sides together .
this is why france should win the world cup . portugal : reform inspiration portugal may be seen by some as the party-crashers of the semi-finals .
figo and co. find themselves in illustrious company made up of former world champions .
a country which has yet to win an international title , portugal could be the flag-bearers for all those teams outside the perceived hierarchy of " big " teams who are consistently touted as favorites .
a world cup win for portugal would give hope to all those outside that exclusive club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal would be champions by fair means or foul but a world cup win for portugal would also send out another message : that play-acting and cynicism can get you as far as playing the other team off the park .
a victory in berlin for this portuguese team would be a triumph of simulation .
no other team has conned referees or intimidated the opposition more at this world cup , and considering that holland , italy and argentina all featured - that 's worthy of a trophy on its own . in an ideal world , a win for portugal on july 9 would shock soccer 's governing bodies into much-needed action .
a world cup victory for portugal should mean an overhaul of the game 's rules , the clear rewriting of what is unacceptable and widespread reform of the increasingly ugly beautiful game .
that is why portugal should win the world cup . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an all-european fight for the world cup brazil and argentina are packing their bags for home , leaving the 2006 world cup to be battled for amongst four european teams .

one of these teams will win the 2006 world cup .
but which team should win it ?
each country stands to offer something very different to the world by being crowned champions . there is one truism in soccer that continues to hold : the best team does n't always win .
playing great soccer does n't always guarantee success .
given that soccer is as much about good fortune as good performances , maybe we should forget about who has the right to win the world cup on the basis of their displays and look at which team should win the world cup for other reasons . germany has been riding a wave of euphoria ever since the first game of the tournament proved that klinsmann 's kids were not the huge risk that everyone though they would be .
with every game , the nation 's smile has gotten broader . germans have displayed a new enthusiasm and pride in their country which would surely increase even further should the national team with the cup .
the collective hope - now bordering on unwavering belief - that the world cup will stay in germany after july 9 has brought the people together , uniting germans of all backgrounds and ethnicities . this has not been lost on those outside the country 's borders .
the most pleasant side effect of this tournament is the image of germany as an inclusive , friendly and welcoming nation .
the german people themselves have shown that they are not the dull , humorless race of a sausage-scarfing , beer-swilling stereotypes but a nation capable of putting on one hell of a party and playing a great host to those who want to join in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup : uniting people even if germany were to go out to italy in the semi-finals , the enduring image of the world cup will be the millions of germans celebrating together with fans from all over the globe , turning this tournament into a soccer summer of love . but if michael ballack were to lift the trophy in berlin this new german belief , pride and positivity would go to another , hopefully , sustainable level .
it could provide germany , a country which has suffered from collective depression for so long , a solid base for a social recovery .
this is why germany should win . italy : stain of corruption italy find themselves in a real quandary .
if they lift the trophy on july 9 , they may be the first world champions to be crowned on the day that a court rules that their game is endemically corrupt .
the investigation into match-fixing back home could come to a close on the day of the world cup final and , if those at the top of the italian game are found guilty by the findings , soccer in italy could be set back a decade . top clubs like juventus , ac milan , fiorentina and lazio are in the dock as investigators look into allegations that corrupt referees manipulated matches , mostly in favor of champions juventus , who have won four of the past five championships .
the turin club could be stripped of their titles and relegated , meaning a high number of italy 's squad would be returning to second , even third-division soccer . because soccer defeat in italy is something akin to national bereavement , the country would enter a period of mourning that could affect all aspects of italian life for many years to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians could demand a massive clean-up campaign if they would win the world cup , then the italians would have a title to live up to .
such is the pride in their team and their country , the italians would demand that their game be purged of those who have dragged it into the mire . a world cup victory could provide the catalyst for empowerment both in society and in soccer circles , leading to a cleansing of the italian game .
this is why italy should win the world cup . france : public unity when france won the world cup in 1998 , the team was heralded as a success story for the country 's integration policies , fielding descendents from colonies such as surinam , algeria and guadeloupe .
the knock-on effects of that win and of a team built up of players of different ethnicities carried france as country on a wave of unity for many months . history now shows that the gloss of the ' 98 world cup win was no more than paper over the serious cracks in french society and that it was just a matter of time until the failure of france 's integration experiment was once again clear to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars have made way for a huge french love-in the riots of 2005 and the student protests of earlier this year have abated but the sources of french discontent remain .
while the experiences of 1998 tell us that a french world cup win in 2006 will not cure the ills , it would provide some relief .
coming in the year of a presidential election , a wave of optimism flowing from an incredible swansong for zidane and the old guard could sweep through france and bring about real change . the french team have already stood up to the far-right jean marie le pen and have declared unswerving allegiance to la grande nation in the face of nationalistic slurs .
a victory in germany for the multicultural bleus could inspire their splintered country to take similar action and bring the sometimes warring sides together .
this is why france should win the world cup . portugal : reform inspiration portugal may be seen by some as the party-crashers of the semi-finals .
figo and co. find themselves in illustrious company made up of former world champions .
a country which has yet to win an international title , portugal could be the flag-bearers for all those teams outside the perceived hierarchy of " big " teams who are consistently touted as favorites .
a world cup win for portugal would give hope to all those outside that exclusive club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal would be champions by fair means or foul but a world cup win for portugal would also send out another message : that play-acting and cynicism can get you as far as playing the other team off the park .
a victory in berlin for this portuguese team would be a triumph of simulation .
no other team has conned referees or intimidated the opposition more at this world cup , and considering that holland , italy and argentina all featured - that 's worthy of a trophy on its own . in an ideal world , a win for portugal on july 9 would shock soccer 's governing bodies into much-needed action .
a world cup victory for portugal should mean an overhaul of the game 's rules , the clear rewriting of what is unacceptable and widespread reform of the increasingly ugly beautiful game .

this is why germany should win . italy : stain of corruption italy find themselves in a real quandary .
if they lift the trophy on july 9 , they may be the first world champions to be crowned on the day that a court rules that their game is endemically corrupt .
the investigation into match-fixing back home could come to a close on the day of the world cup final and , if those at the top of the italian game are found guilty by the findings , soccer in italy could be set back a decade . top clubs like juventus , ac milan , fiorentina and lazio are in the dock as investigators look into allegations that corrupt referees manipulated matches , mostly in favor of champions juventus , who have won four of the past five championships .
the turin club could be stripped of their titles and relegated , meaning a high number of italy 's squad would be returning to second , even third-division soccer . because soccer defeat in italy is something akin to national bereavement , the country would enter a period of mourning that could affect all aspects of italian life for many years to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians could demand a massive clean-up campaign if they would win the world cup , then the italians would have a title to live up to .
such is the pride in their team and their country , the italians would demand that their game be purged of those who have dragged it into the mire . a world cup victory could provide the catalyst for empowerment both in society and in soccer circles , leading to a cleansing of the italian game .
this is why italy should win the world cup . france : public unity when france won the world cup in 1998 , the team was heralded as a success story for the country 's integration policies , fielding descendents from colonies such as surinam , algeria and guadeloupe .
the knock-on effects of that win and of a team built up of players of different ethnicities carried france as country on a wave of unity for many months . history now shows that the gloss of the ' 98 world cup win was no more than paper over the serious cracks in french society and that it was just a matter of time until the failure of france 's integration experiment was once again clear to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burning cars have made way for a huge french love-in the riots of 2005 and the student protests of earlier this year have abated but the sources of french discontent remain .
while the experiences of 1998 tell us that a french world cup win in 2006 will not cure the ills , it would provide some relief .
coming in the year of a presidential election , a wave of optimism flowing from an incredible swansong for zidane and the old guard could sweep through france and bring about real change . the french team have already stood up to the far-right jean marie le pen and have declared unswerving allegiance to la grande nation in the face of nationalistic slurs .
a victory in germany for the multicultural bleus could inspire their splintered country to take similar action and bring the sometimes warring sides together .
this is why france should win the world cup . portugal : reform inspiration portugal may be seen by some as the party-crashers of the semi-finals .
figo and co. find themselves in illustrious company made up of former world champions .
a country which has yet to win an international title , portugal could be the flag-bearers for all those teams outside the perceived hierarchy of " big " teams who are consistently touted as favorites .
a world cup win for portugal would give hope to all those outside that exclusive club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal would be champions by fair means or foul but a world cup win for portugal would also send out another message : that play-acting and cynicism can get you as far as playing the other team off the park .
a victory in berlin for this portuguese team would be a triumph of simulation .
no other team has conned referees or intimidated the opposition more at this world cup , and considering that holland , italy and argentina all featured - that 's worthy of a trophy on its own . in an ideal world , a win for portugal on july 9 would shock soccer 's governing bodies into much-needed action .
a world cup victory for portugal should mean an overhaul of the game 's rules , the clear rewriting of what is unacceptable and widespread reform of the increasingly ugly beautiful game .
that is why portugal should win the world cup . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an all-european fight for the world cup brazil and argentina are packing their bags for home , leaving the 2006 world cup to be battled for amongst four european teams .

" we will be a neutral party and will not take sides with anyone , " jung said following a meeting with congo 's defense minister , adolphe onusumba , in kinshasa . congo could remain a dangerous area , jung said , until final election results rolled in presumably at the end of august .
however , he said he was certain eu peacekeeping troops would deter violence . jung said the around 2,000 european troops are obligated to remain neutral .
congo 's opposition parties have feared that the european troops would aid the current president , joseph kabila , to remain in office . german help after the elections during his visit , jung is scheduled to meet with representatives of the government and with the independent election commission 's director , muholongu malumalu .
opposition leaders , he said , did not have time to meet . jung promised onusumba additional help from germany following the election , saying continued cooperation would likely center around training congo 's military troops .
the goal , jung said , is to help congo be able to ensure stability and security alone in the future . after years of civil war , congo is currently building up a regular army of 120,000 soldiers . jung intends to stay in the region until tuesday .
he will be viewing the european troops ' military bases in kinshasa and neighboring gabon 's capital , libreville . german troops may guard polling stations germany currently has less than 100 peacekeepers in the region , but that figure will rise to 500 german troops and 280 support personnel by election day on july 30th when 25 million congolese go to the polls to choose a new president and parliament . most of the german troops will be deployed in gabon .

for decades , the rivalry split the town in two . the small aurach river gurgles through the heart of herzogenaurach , population 24,000 , and gives the town its name .
but this peaceful , meandering waterway once symbolized a bitter , protracted family feud that divided the town into two distinct camps . it was all about footwear . " the town became known as the town where people tend to look down because you 'd always tend to look at shoes the person is wearing before you strike up a conversation , " said barbara smit , a dutch financial journalist and one of the authors to tackle the story of the dassler brothers , rudolf and adolf . they started out making shoes together before having a terrible falling out .
their argument resulted in the creation of two sports giants , puma and adidas , both still based in the provincial town . partners , then enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf -lrb- adi -rrb- dassler in 1978 rudolf and younger brother adolf , rudi and adi to friends , began their shoe business in their mother 's laundry room in the 1920s .
at the time , electricity supplies in the town were unreliable , and the brothers sometimes had to use pedal power from a stationary bicycle to run their equipment . " they were very different characters , " said smit .
" adi dassler was always more thoughtful , a craftsman who enjoyed nothing more than fiddling with his shoes .
whereas rudolf dassler was a more abrasive , loudmouthed salesman .
they complemented each other very well to begin with . " their new , lightweight sports shoes began to attract attention and they moved into a location south of the aurach river near the train station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jesse owens the dassler brothers shoe factory jumped onto the world stage in 1936 when they found themselves providing footwear for american jessie owens , who won four gold medals at the berlin olympics . but after the war , the fraternal relationship fell apart .
in smit 's book , " pitch invasion , " she theorizes that it could have had something to do with nazi party links and that after rudolf was picked up by american soldiers and accused of being a member of the ss , he was convinced that his brother had turned him in .
others speculate it could have had something to do with their wives , or a simple misunderstanding in a bomb shelter .
no one really knows for sure . what is certain is that they felt they could no longer work together and in 1948 the dassler brothers shoe factory was split in two . " more of less in the middle of the night , rudolf dassler packed his bags and moved on the other side of the little river , " said smit .
" he established puma on the other side .
from there on in , the town was really split in two like a sort of mini berlin with this little river as a partition in the middle . " and like berlin 's famous wall , it was n't advisable to cross over , at least when it came to shoes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reconstruction of adolf dassler 's early shoe workshop brand loyalty became paramount for many residents .
two camps formed , and dug in . there were stores , bakers and bars which were unofficially known as either loyal to rudolf 's puma , or to adolf 's new company , adidas , which he named using his nickname , adi , and the first three letters of his last name .
there were two soccer teams : the asv herzogenaurach club wore the three stripes ; the 1 fc herzogenaurach had the jumping cat on its footwear .
intermarriage was frowned upon . " i knew a butcher who played for the puma team , " said ernst ditrich who works at the town 's museum .
" he told us the guys from the adidas team did n't need to bother buying at his store .
he did n't want to do business with them .
that sort of thing happened . " wayward son the brothers never did reconcile .
while they are buried in the same cemetery , their graves are about as far apart as possible .
but one of their descendents decided the family feud had gone on long enough . frank dassler is the grandson of rudolf dassler and grew up living and breathing puma .
growing up , he had no contact at all with his great-uncle adolf 's family . " they stayed kind of enemies during the rest of their lives , " he said .
" it 's certainly sad , but from a business point of view it was a good decision , since it motivated both companies to innovate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the adidas " world of sports " headquarters but these days , frank dassler sits not in puma 's new glass-and-steel headquarters on the bank of the river , but in an office at the adidas campus further north , on the site of a former american army barracks .
two years ago , he took a job as the adidas group 's head legal counsel . " my stepmother and my stepbrother were n't very happy about this decision , they thought it would be a betrayal against my grandfather , " he said . his taboo breaking raised more than a few eyebrows in the town and the local newspapers were not always so kind . " but this rivalry was years ago , it 's history now , " he said . lost its punch indeed , young people today seem little concerned with the once-intense rivalry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puma 's had new strength in its spring for the past few years " it 's not so strong anymore .
it was like that before , but now , i do n't think people care so much , " said 14-year-old teresa , who was wearing puma shoes but carrying an adidas bag .
" sometimes puma has something better , sometimes adidas .
it just depends . " but hermann lindner , 41 , who was with his family -lrb- all wearing puma -rrb- at a festival for the argentinian team who is staying in the town for the world cup , says the two camps have n't entirely folded up their tents . " no , it 's not as extreme as it used to be , but you still find people who stick to puma and other who only wear adidas , " he said .
" people do make the distinction . " and while most think things are better now that rivalry has cooled , some knew how to make the most of it when it was raging , frank dassler says .
he remembers that when handymen would come to work at his grandfather 's house , they would sometimes wear adidas shoes on purpose .
when rudolf would see their footwear , he 'd tell them to go to the basement and pick out a pair of puma shoes , which they could have for free . " rudolf simply could n't stand the fact that someone was wearing an adidas shoe in his private home , " dassler said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de adidas cashes in on the world cup german sports giant adidas is using its dominance in the soccer gear business during the upcoming world cup to kit out the german national team as well as five others .

for decades , the rivalry split the town in two . the small aurach river gurgles through the heart of herzogenaurach , population 24,000 , and gives the town its name .
but this peaceful , meandering waterway once symbolized a bitter , protracted family feud that divided the town into two distinct camps . it was all about footwear . " the town became known as the town where people tend to look down because you 'd always tend to look at shoes the person is wearing before you strike up a conversation , " said barbara smit , a dutch financial journalist and one of the authors to tackle the story of the dassler brothers , rudolf and adolf . they started out making shoes together before having a terrible falling out .

at the time , electricity supplies in the town were unreliable , and the brothers sometimes had to use pedal power from a stationary bicycle to run their equipment . " they were very different characters , " said smit .
" adi dassler was always more thoughtful , a craftsman who enjoyed nothing more than fiddling with his shoes .
whereas rudolf dassler was a more abrasive , loudmouthed salesman .
they complemented each other very well to begin with . " their new , lightweight sports shoes began to attract attention and they moved into a location south of the aurach river near the train station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jesse owens the dassler brothers shoe factory jumped onto the world stage in 1936 when they found themselves providing footwear for american jessie owens , who won four gold medals at the berlin olympics . but after the war , the fraternal relationship fell apart .
in smit 's book , " pitch invasion , " she theorizes that it could have had something to do with nazi party links and that after rudolf was picked up by american soldiers and accused of being a member of the ss , he was convinced that his brother had turned him in .
others speculate it could have had something to do with their wives , or a simple misunderstanding in a bomb shelter .
no one really knows for sure . what is certain is that they felt they could no longer work together and in 1948 the dassler brothers shoe factory was split in two . " more of less in the middle of the night , rudolf dassler packed his bags and moved on the other side of the little river , " said smit .
" he established puma on the other side .
from there on in , the town was really split in two like a sort of mini berlin with this little river as a partition in the middle .

many have requested criminal charges be brought against those responsible for the bear 's death . with all the hype , you 'd think bruno were staging yet another publicity stunt - this time , from the grave .
bruno has gained so much popularity and support both in germany and around the world that 300 people staged a protest near the berlin cathedral on saturday . demonstration leader kurt eicher told the afp news agency that evidence clearly showed that bruno had been wrongly shot .
eicher also accused the bavarian environment ministry of violating the law protecting endangered animals by giving the " shoot-to-kill " order to hunters . animal protection groups file formal complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : idyllic bavaria is where bruno met his death last week bavarian environment minister werner schnappauf has been under fire himself for his shoot-to-kill order .
munich prosecutors said they have received a flood of requests asking that criminal charges be brought against schnappauf and others responsible for the decision to kill the bear . the public prosecutor 's office said it would decide at the end of the week whether it would begin preliminary proceedings . a poll last week by the forsa institute of over 1,000 germans said 70 percent of germans agreed with the shooting , but regretted bruno 's death .
only 24 percent said they were relieved that the bear no longer posed a threat . still , bruno was on world cup fans ' minds over the weekend .
as toymakers prepare to produce a teddy bear to immortalize the animal , some fans on berlin 's fan mile and at the quarter-final win over argentina waved placards in his memory .
" revenge for bruno , " read one . the web site that originally coined a song to commemorate the bear and " hunt bruno " game have since created the " bruno 's revenge " game . italy wants its bear back meanwhile , the cadaver of the bear the media dubbed " bruno " is currently in deep freeze , but is scheduled to be stuffed and placed in a museum .
bruno , however , stemmed from the italian region of trentino .
according to the ap and dpa news agencies , italian environment minister alfonso pecoraro scanio will formally ask germany on monday to give back bruno 's body . bruno was killed by a government-sanctioned hunter in bavaria last week after having first been spotted in germany in may .
part of a project to reintroduce the predators to northern italy , the bear roamed into austria and germany , killed sheep and rabbits , stole honey and was in the headlines across europe for weeks . fearing the two-year-old bear would one day target humans , officials in the southern state of bavaria granted permission to kill him even though he was the first wild bear to be seen in germany since 1835 . italian environment minister alfonso pecoraro scanio has protested the killing and said that the bear should have been shot with tranquilizers and transported back to italy . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vacationing a no-no in bear-killing bavaria what 's an animal rights activist with summer vacation plans in bavaria to do ?

his wife , gladys , was killed on her way to work , when the fourth bomber detonated his lethal backpack on a bus in tavistock square .

large firms responding to the bank of japan 's quarterly tankan survey said they were feeling even happier about the three months to september .
they reported plans to raise spending on new factories and equipment by 11.6 % this year , ahead of market forecasts .
the survey has reinforced predictions that the bank will lift interest rates from zero at next week 's meeting .
' long-lasting ' recovery the tankan survey showed that confidence among the 9,964 surveyed companies had improved , despite the poor performance of the stock market during june , when the study was conducted .
" a rate hike this month is almost a done deal , " said tsutomu kawasaki , a fund manager at the pension fund association .
" japan is heading for a long-lasting economic recovery . "
the bank 's next rate-setting meeting starts on 13 july .
a rate rise would mark an end to the bank of japan 's long-held zero- rate policy - introduced to stimulate consumer spending and business investment in an economy plagued by deflation , or falling prices .
now central bankers are poised to lift rates for the first time in six years in a bid to keep a check on the level of consumer spending and corporate investment , which could lead to the economy overheating if they are allowed to rise too fast .
the improvement in business sentiment was demonstrated by the bank of japan 's tankan confidence index for large manufacturers , which rose to 21 during the april-june quarter , up from 20 in the january-march period .
a positive number means optimistic companies outnumber the pessimists .

large firms responding to the bank of japan 's quarterly tankan survey said they were feeling even happier about the three months to september .
they reported plans to raise spending on new factories and equipment by 11.6 % this year , ahead of market forecasts .
the survey has reinforced predictions that the bank will lift interest rates from zero at next week 's meeting .
' long-lasting ' recovery the tankan survey showed that confidence among the 9,964 surveyed companies had improved , despite the poor performance of the stock market during june , when the study was conducted .
" a rate hike this month is almost a done deal , " said tsutomu kawasaki , a fund manager at the pension fund association .
" japan is heading for a long-lasting economic recovery . "
the bank 's next rate-setting meeting starts on 13 july .
a rate rise would mark an end to the bank of japan 's long-held zero- rate policy - introduced to stimulate consumer spending and business investment in an economy plagued by deflation , or falling prices .
now central bankers are poised to lift rates for the first time in six years in a bid to keep a check on the level of consumer spending and corporate investment , which could lead to the economy overheating if they are allowed to rise too fast .
the improvement in business sentiment was demonstrated by the bank of japan 's tankan confidence index for large manufacturers , which rose to 21 during the april-june quarter , up from 20 in the january-march period .
a positive number means optimistic companies outnumber the pessimists .

by august 2009 junior doctors will be allowed to work only 48 hours a week - far less than they can at the moment .
the assembly government is warning the law will only be met by restructuring , and this at a time when there are already plans to centralise services .
chief medical officer tony jewell said it was " absolutely critical " .
if you break the law you break the law and there are consequences chief medical officer tony jewell " we need to work differently - hospitals need to work together - teams need to work differently to be compliant .
" we 've known about the european working time directive for several years now .
" we 're also changing the way doctors are trained and that is affecting the way services are organised , " said dr jewell .
the assembly government 's evaluation report , called designed to comply , found that based on current working patterns fewer than one in three welsh hospitals will meet the 48-hour target .
after august 2009 , any hospital trust breeching the hours rule for junior doctors will face a fine of £ 5,000 a day - or even prison for the chief executive .

the firm wants the money to invest in infrastructure on busy commuter routes to cope with rising passenger numbers .
passenger numbers are set to rise by a third over the next decade and extra money is needed to extend stations and put in new lines , says the firm .
the £ 7bn is in addition to the £ 20bn it is already tipped to request for the period from 2009 to 2014 .
the operator will ask for the money from the office of rail regulation amid wider funding talks with the government .
the news comes after the firm recently posted annual pre-tax losses of £ 232m , up from £ 47m in 2005 .
more passengers the department for transport was recently reported to be considering letting train operators offset increasing demand by increasing passenger fares .
have your say the answer is staring the government in the face - renationalise the railways joe baldwin , chesham , bucks send us your comments network rail instead favours making the necessary investments to improve the network , to cope with rising passenger numbers and reduce overcrowding .
the firm says commuter lines such as those into london and birmingham need new sections to cope with demand .
network rail receives about £ 5bn to run its network at present , but says this does not allow for improvements .
the operator says it should be able to operate on £ 4bn at a future date , but this is still at the higher end of the office of rail regulation 's estimates .
the firm 's latest losses , which were posted in may , were largely down to paying interest on money it had borrowed to fix the railway network .
on releasing its results , network rail said train punctuality had reached at a six-year high , and £ 3bn had been invested in the network , including 700 miles of new track .
the firm , whose top executives are due to receive big bonuses , hopes to be profitable this financial year .

it has already allocated $ 700m for the march 2005 blast , which killed 15 people and injured 180 .
bp has also suspended three traders from its us natural gas business .
regulators allege its bp products north america subsidy artificially forced up prices by buying up huge propane stocks only to withhold them from the market .
boosting production in a trading update , bp said its oil and gas production levels would fall 2.5 % for the second quarter compared with the same period in 2005 .
it expected to pump 4.01 million barrels of oil and gas per day , compared with 4.112 million barrels last year .
last february , bp said that it expected to produce between 4.1 and 4.2 million barrels a day this year , compared with 4.01 million in 2005 and 3.99 million in 2004 .
it wants to boost production by 4 % a year up to 2010 .
production levels are expected to rise in the second half of 2006 , when bp hopes to have its hurricane-damaged thunder horse platform in the gulf of mexico up and running .
bp said it had started the " phased re-commissioning " of the explosion-hit texas city oil refinery in march .

obesity surgery , gastric by-passes , or gastric bands , are offered to obese patients when other methods of weight loss have failed .
what is your job ?
i am a consultant in general and upper gastroenterology and a bariatric , or obesity surgeon .
i work at the nhs hospital , the royal hallamshire and in the private sector for the bmi thornbury .
my job is almost entirely dealing with upper gastroenterology problems , such as cancer of the oesophagus , the stomach , reflux and obesity surgery .
my work is about one third cancers , one third obesity and one third benign conditions .
what is the most common condition ?
these days it is definitely the obesity work .
there is an obesity epidemic . "
i am at capacity now and i ca n't do any more " roger ackroyd and because of a growing awareness by people and gps , more people are looking at surgical options .
what is the most common procedure ?
in my obesity work this is 99 % gastric banding or gastric bypasses .
through keyhole surgery we can put a band around the stomach , which restricts what a patient can eat , so they lose weight .
the gastric bypass is a more complicated procedure , but even this we can do by keyhole surgery .
this procedure takes about an hour , compared to the band , which takes about half an hour .
we did about 350 of these operations last year .
obesity 1.2 million people in the uk are considered morbidly obese , with a body mass index of over 40 -lrb- 20-25 is healthy -rrb- many have associated problems such as arthritis , type 2 diabetes , hypertension and heart and lung problems following the nice guidelines you are eligible for the treatment if you have a body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- of 40 , or 35 if you have an additional condition such as diabetes , or asthma .
there is a problem with the nhs at the moment .
i do think it is a problem of capacity rather than funding , but despite the nice guidelines we can not take patients now unless they have a bmi of 50 or more , or 45 , with problems .
what is the hardest thing about your job ?
juggling my time .
i am constantly busy doing two things at once , there are not enough hours in the day .
and it is going to get worse .
i am at capacity now and i ca n't do any more .
i am sure there are going to be more obesity surgeons in the future to meet demand .
we are currently looking at training and getting people accredited .
what is your most satisfying case ?
there have been a lot of satisfying cases .
people who are 29 or 30 stones are pretty immobile .
once they have had surgery , we see them regularly over a period of 18 months and watch their weight steadily decrease to about 11 stones .
i 've had patients with fertility problems who have reduced their weight and then gone on to have babies .
then there are the patients who lose so much weight that you do n't recognise them when they come back for a review .
these are often younger people with a major problem with their weight and we can change their lives .
i also operate on people with cancer of the oesophagus or stomach , the difference is that despite your very best efforts , their cancer may be too advanced and they still may die .
i am not saying that this means we should not operate , what i am saying is that with obesity surgery there is far more scope to change a patient 's life and you can see a very real difference both physically and emotionally .
why did you choose this specialty ?
i am not quite sure .
i am not quite sure how i ended up doing medicine , or how i ended up in this speciality .
i suppose i got into surgery because it interested me and i worked for a couple of guys who did obesity surgery so i took it on myself , but it was not a conscious decision .
since doing this job i have lost weight .
i did not have to lose weight , but because you are working with people with obesity you do become more conscious about what you are eating .
if you had your time again would you change your specialty ?
no , i feel very lucky that things have worked out as they have .
how do you see the role developing in the future ?
i think i would like to see the service expand and to expand the research work .

i also operate on people with cancer of the oesophagus or stomach , the difference is that despite your very best efforts , their cancer may be too advanced and they still may die .
i am not saying that this means we should not operate , what i am saying is that with obesity surgery there is far more scope to change a patient 's life and you can see a very real difference both physically and emotionally .
why did you choose this specialty ?
i am not quite sure .
i am not quite sure how i ended up doing medicine , or how i ended up in this speciality .
i suppose i got into surgery because it interested me and i worked for a couple of guys who did obesity surgery so i took it on myself , but it was not a conscious decision .
since doing this job i have lost weight .
i did not have to lose weight , but because you are working with people with obesity you do become more conscious about what you are eating .
if you had your time again would you change your specialty ?
no , i feel very lucky that things have worked out as they have .
how do you see the role developing in the future ?
i think i would like to see the service expand and to expand the research work .

obesity surgery , gastric by-passes , or gastric bands , are offered to obese patients when other methods of weight loss have failed .
mr roger ackroyd 's cv what is your job ?
i am a consultant in general and upper gastroenterology and a bariatric , or obesity surgeon .
i work at the nhs hospital , the royal hallamshire and in the private sector for the bmi thornbury .
my job is almost entirely dealing with upper gastroenterology problems , such as cancer of the oesophagus , the stomach , reflux and obesity surgery .
my work is about one third cancers , one third obesity and one third benign conditions .
what is the most common condition ?
these days it is definitely the obesity work .
there is an obesity epidemic .
i am at capacity now and i ca n't do any more roger ackroyd and because of a growing awareness by people and gps , more people are looking at surgical options .
what is the most common procedure ?
in my obesity work this is 99 % gastric banding or gastric bypasses .
through keyhole surgery we can put a band around the stomach , which restricts what a patient can eat , so they lose weight .
the gastric bypass is a more complicated procedure , but even this we can do by keyhole surgery .
this procedure takes about an hour , compared to the band , which takes about half an hour .
we did about 350 of these operations last year .
obesity 1.2 million people in the uk are considered morbidly obese , with a body mass index of over 40 -lrb- 20-25 is healthy -rrb- many have associated problems such as arthritis , type 2 diabetes , hypertension and heart and lung problems following the nice guidelines you are eligible for the treatment if you have a body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- of 40 , or 35 if you have an additional condition such as diabetes , or asthma .
there is a problem with the nhs at the moment .
i do think it is a problem of capacity rather than funding , but despite the nice guidelines we can not take patients now unless they have a bmi of 50 or more , or 45 , with problems .
what is the hardest thing about your job ?
juggling my time .
i am constantly busy doing two things at once , there are not enough hours in the day .
and it is going to get worse .
i am at capacity now and i ca n't do any more .
i am sure there are going to be more obesity surgeons in the future to meet demand .
we are currently looking at training and getting people accredited .
what is your most satisfying case ?
there have been a lot of satisfying cases .
people who are 29 or 30 stones are pretty immobile .
once they have had surgery , we see them regularly over a period of 18 months and watch their weight steadily decrease to about 11 stones .
i 've had patients with fertility problems who have reduced their weight and then gone on to have babies .
then there are the patients who lose so much weight that you do n't recognise them when they come back for a review .
these are often younger people with a major problem with their weight and we can change their lives .
i also operate on people with cancer of the oesophagus or stomach , the difference is that despite your very best efforts , their cancer may be too advanced and they still may die .
i am not saying that this means we should not operate , what i am saying is that with obesity surgery there is far more scope to change a patient 's life and you can see a very real difference both physically and emotionally .

i 've had patients with fertility problems who have reduced their weight and then gone on to have babies .
then there are the patients who lose so much weight that you do n't recognise them when they come back for a review .
these are often younger people with a major problem with their weight and we can change their lives .
i also operate on people with cancer of the oesophagus or stomach , the difference is that despite your very best efforts , their cancer may be too advanced and they still may die .
i am not saying that this means we should not operate , what i am saying is that with obesity surgery there is far more scope to change a patient 's life and you can see a very real difference both physically and emotionally .
why did you choose this specialty ?
i am not quite sure .
i am not quite sure how i ended up doing medicine , or how i ended up in this speciality .
i suppose i got into surgery because it interested me and i worked for a couple of guys who did obesity surgery so i took it on myself , but it was not a conscious decision .
since doing this job i have lost weight .
i did not have to lose weight , but because you are working with people with obesity you do become more conscious about what you are eating .
if you had your time again would you change your specialty ?
no , i feel very lucky that things have worked out as they have .
how do you see the role developing in the future ?
i think i would like to see the service expand and to expand the research work .

obesity surgery , gastric by-passes , or gastric bands , are offered to obese patients when other methods of weight loss have failed .
mr roger ackroyd 's cv what is your job ?
i am a consultant in general and upper gastroenterology and a bariatric , or obesity surgeon .
i work at the nhs hospital , the royal hallamshire and in the private sector for the bmi thornbury .
my job is almost entirely dealing with upper gastroenterology problems , such as cancer of the oesophagus , the stomach , reflux and obesity surgery .
my work is about one third cancers , one third obesity and one third benign conditions .
what is the most common condition ?
these days it is definitely the obesity work .
there is an obesity epidemic .
i am at capacity now and i ca n't do any more roger ackroyd and because of a growing awareness by people and gps , more people are looking at surgical options .
what is the most common procedure ?
in my obesity work this is 99 % gastric banding or gastric bypasses .
through keyhole surgery we can put a band around the stomach , which restricts what a patient can eat , so they lose weight .
the gastric bypass is a more complicated procedure , but even this we can do by keyhole surgery .
this procedure takes about an hour , compared to the band , which takes about half an hour .
we did about 350 of these operations last year .
obesity 1.2 million people in the uk are considered morbidly obese , with a body mass index of over 40 -lrb- 20-25 is healthy -rrb- many have associated problems such as arthritis , type 2 diabetes , hypertension and heart and lung problems following the nice guidelines you are eligible for the treatment if you have a body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- of 40 , or 35 if you have an additional condition such as diabetes , or asthma .
there is a problem with the nhs at the moment .
i do think it is a problem of capacity rather than funding , but despite the nice guidelines we can not take patients now unless they have a bmi of 50 or more , or 45 , with problems .
what is the hardest thing about your job ?
juggling my time .
i am constantly busy doing two things at once , there are not enough hours in the day .
and it is going to get worse .
i am at capacity now and i ca n't do any more .
i am sure there are going to be more obesity surgeons in the future to meet demand .
we are currently looking at training and getting people accredited .
what is your most satisfying case ?
there have been a lot of satisfying cases .
people who are 29 or 30 stones are pretty immobile .
once they have had surgery , we see them regularly over a period of 18 months and watch their weight steadily decrease to about 11 stones .
i 've had patients with fertility problems who have reduced their weight and then gone on to have babies .
then there are the patients who lose so much weight that you do n't recognise them when they come back for a review .

talented actor he may be , but punctuality is not something johnny depp is famous for .
as i , and several other reporters , waited at a posh beverly hills hotel to interview the star of pirates of the caribbean : dead man 's chest , we were told he had gone to lunch and would be back in his own time .
more than two hours late , depp finally burst in , clearly oblivious to the simmering unease in the hotel corridor where we were left to twiddle our thumbs .
but the 43-year-old actor is the ultimate charmer .
humorous casually dressed in his familiar grey hat , he smiled , hugged someone and was ushered into the interview room .
we were ready for action .
because the day 's schedule had gone hopelessly to pot , we were told that each reporter would have only three minutes with depp .
it would not be an in-depth interview .
" you 've got a big one , " he quipped , as i sat down with a rather large ' gun ' microphone , to prepare for our brief chat .
it broke the ice .
we joked for a second or two and then got down to business .
bloom plays the straight man to depp 's eccentric pirate in dead man 's chest , depp returns as captain jack sparrow , the lovable rogue of the high seas who sets sail for another rollercoaster of an adventure .
the original film , pirates of the caribbean : curse of the black pearl , was a huge hit in 2003 - despite what studio executives feared was an overly hammed-up performance by the actor , as the camp pirate with a tendency to mince around the deck .
depp says he never had any doubt over his portrayal of the character .
" i do n't think it 's changed very much from my perspective since the second that he came to life around me .
he 's pretty much the same guy .
this time we get to see a little bit of a slightly different angle on him , " he says .
free reign the studio 's concerns over depp 's unconventional performance melted away as the movie took the box office by storm .
" they were nervous and i guess in some way rightfully so , because they had a rather large investment in the film .
" and here i came in prancing around , doing the weirdness that i was doing and scared them , but now they 're a bit more understanding . "
does that feel good ?
bill nighy plays davy jones " it does feel good to be able to win that battle with the studio , because the whole thing was , ' you 've hired me to do this job , this is my area of my work and you 're meddling in it and it 's uncomfortable . " '
bill nighy , who plays davy jones , jack sparrow 's arch nemesis in dead man 's chest , believes depp deserves high praise for moulding his character 's personality .
" it would n't have occurred to anyone else but johnny to play this part in this particular way , to deliver it in this fashion , it 's so original and so witty , " he says .
" i think he brings a big-heartedness to it - he 's an assassin in terms of comedy .
it 's a master-class technically speaking and he 's imbued it with this wonderfully rascally , scampish , lovable sort of quality which is very generous and deeply funny . "
orlando bloom returns in the sequel as blacksmith will turner , still besotted with his childhood friend , elizabeth swan , played by keira knightley .
academy recognition " he 's really taken the movie to another level , " bloom says of depp .
" it certainly did n't read like that on the page for the first movie and i was wondering how i was going to play opposite him .
" they were two swashbuckling pirates but he really created this fantastic character which left me to play the kind of straight guy , heroic pirate-type role which develops more in the second movie than from the first , " adds bloom .
depp earned an oscar nomination for his first outing as jack sparrow , but he would prefer it if the executives at disney were still on tenterhooks .
" you want to keep pushing and , not that i get any perverse enjoyment out of it , but i think that it 's healthy to keep them a little nervous , " he says .
early reviews for the film suggest the film-makers have nothing to worry about , with dead man 's chest expected to dominate the summer box office .
the studio may be resting on its laurels for the time being , but a third pirates movie is in the works and depp has a twinkle in his eye .
" if the studio 's not nervous now , wait till pirates 3 , " he says .
" we 've got some plans . "
can you give me any hints ?
" no , " he laughs , heartily .

the original film , pirates of the caribbean : curse of the black pearl , was a huge hit in 2003 - despite what studio executives feared was an overly hammed-up performance by the actor , as the camp pirate with a tendency to mince around the deck .
depp says he never had any doubt over his portrayal of the character .
" i do n't think it 's changed very much from my perspective since the second that he came to life around me .
he 's pretty much the same guy .
this time we get to see a little bit of a slightly different angle on him , " he says .
free reign the studio 's concerns over depp 's unconventional performance melted away as the movie took the box office by storm .
" they were nervous and i guess in some way rightfully so , because they had a rather large investment in the film .
" and here i came in prancing around , doing the weirdness that i was doing and scared them , but now they 're a bit more understanding . "
does that feel good ?
bill nighy plays davy jones " it does feel good to be able to win that battle with the studio , because the whole thing was , ' you 've hired me to do this job , this is my area of my work and you 're meddling in it and it 's uncomfortable . " '
bill nighy , who plays davy jones , jack sparrow 's arch nemesis in dead man 's chest , believes depp deserves high praise for moulding his character 's personality .
" it would n't have occurred to anyone else but johnny to play this part in this particular way , to deliver it in this fashion , it 's so original and so witty , " he says .
" i think he brings a big-heartedness to it - he 's an assassin in terms of comedy .
it 's a master-class technically speaking and he 's imbued it with this wonderfully rascally , scampish , lovable sort of quality which is very generous and deeply funny . "
orlando bloom returns in the sequel as blacksmith will turner , still besotted with his childhood friend , elizabeth swan , played by keira knightley .
academy recognition " he 's really taken the movie to another level , " bloom says of depp .
" it certainly did n't read like that on the page for the first movie and i was wondering how i was going to play opposite him .
" they were two swashbuckling pirates but he really created this fantastic character which left me to play the kind of straight guy , heroic pirate-type role which develops more in the second movie than from the first , " adds bloom .
depp earned an oscar nomination for his first outing as jack sparrow , but he would prefer it if the executives at disney were still on tenterhooks .
" you want to keep pushing and , not that i get any perverse enjoyment out of it , but i think that it 's healthy to keep them a little nervous , " he says .
early reviews for the film suggest the film-makers have nothing to worry about , with dead man 's chest expected to dominate the summer box office .
the studio may be resting on its laurels for the time being , but a third pirates movie is in the works and depp has a twinkle in his eye .
" if the studio 's not nervous now , wait till pirates 3 , " he says .
" we 've got some plans . "
can you give me any hints ?
" no , " he laughs , heartily .

' long process ' " we need to do work to the battlements , stonework , interior , some of the roofs and timberwork , " said charles berkeley .

the latest project in its portfolio of services is an online payments system which aims to compete with auction giant ebay .
the service , known as google checkout , is just one of a series of online products launched by the california based company .
however , none of the new ventures launched over the past four years have established themselves as a market leader , reported online magazine business week .

google video google earth google earth combines satellite imagery and maps into an application that allows users to point and zoom to any location on the planet .
users can search by location , landmark or by category such as schools , parks , or restaurants .
various overlays allow people to see roads and tourist attractions .
unofficial " mash-ups " combine the program with other data to provide interactive maps on everything from internet connections in africa to new theme parks .
a similar program called google mars allows people to explore the red planet , while a french program , known as geoportail , offers high-definition images of the country .
return to top of page google talk google talk unites net telephony with an instant messaging -lrb- im -rrb- network .
based on the open software , known as jabber , the program allows different im systems to talk to one another .
google entered the field of im and voip -lrb- voice over internet protocol -rrb- later than many of its rivals who already have an established user base .
in 2005 , america online had more than 40 million users on its aim and icq instant messaging networks .
yahoo had 20 million users and msn messenger had 14 million .
skype , the largest voip network , claims to have over 50 million users .
google talk ranks number 10 in the list of im clients , with just 2 % of the number of users for market leader msn messenger , according to net traffic firm comscore media metrix .
return to top of page google picasa google picasa allows people to manage , share and organise their digital photos .
the program automatically catalogues all of the pictures on your pc and sorts them into searchable albums .
it also offers a series of tools , such as red eye correction , to manipulate digital snaps .
photo sharing site flickr already enjoys huge popularity , hosting millions of pictures .
the photo sharing site is now owned by yahoo and allows users to tag images .

critics say the results do not take into account the credibility of the source .
the service has recently been launched on mobile phones .
return to top of page google spreadsheet the free , web-based spreadsheet application was launched on a trial basis in 2006 .
the rival to microsoft 's excel program allows up to 10 users to work on the same spreadsheet .
the application is aimed at small business users .
google recently bought writely , an online word-processing application .
along with its e-mail program , gmail , its online calendar and the google desktop search tool , the company is increasingly competing with microsoft 's office software .
return to top of page google video google video is the company 's answer to apple 's move into offering video through its itunes download service .
google 's version allows people to search for , buy and download films and tv programmes .
as part of the service , the search giant has done a deal with cbs to offer some of its big blockbuster hits , such as csi and survivor .

a survey by the university of glamorgan found as many as seven out of 10 people using gyms in the region take drugs to help their training .
more inactive lifestyles mean people are turning to steroids to get the shape they want , the study author says .
the research is unveiled on the bbc radio wales programme eye on wales .
professor bruce davies carried out the research in gyms dedicated to heavy lifting in the south wales valleys area , and says the findings replicate those of studies carried out in other parts of wales . "
i suspect there 's a significant number of people using anabolic steroids in wales " professor bruce davies he said : " we found by going into big lifting gyms that 70 % of the attendants were using anabolic steroids .
" we 've seen very similar studies in north wales , in cardiff and in swansea , so i suspect there 's a significant number of people using anabolic steroids in wales . "
side-effects of the drugs can include baldness , impotence , developing milk-producing breasts in men and acne , and in misuse of anabolic steroids can cause heart and liver failure .
professor davies believes use has risen in former mining areas because of social changes .
" gone are the days when you could get admiration by going down a mine -you did n't have to prove anything , " he said .
" sadly those days are gone and now people are seeking other ways to gain admiration .
" when you think about it these days , most people are semi-debauched , we 're not a very active society so the only way to acquire the muscles these people want is to weight train using anabolic steroids . "
dealing one 20-year-old weight-training enthusiast , who gained five stone in three years after taking steroids , thinks the risks of the drug have been overstated .
" it 's down to the individual - if your diet 's good and your training 's good you should be fine , " he said .
" ok , something could go wrong inside but that could happen to a normal person walking down the street .
a lot -lsb- of the risks -rsb- are just word of mouth and i think a lot of things are exaggerated totally out of perspective . "
possession and use of steroids is not illegal , provided it is a " medicinal form " , but dealing steroids is .
katy swaine , head of legal services at drug charity release , thinks there is some ambiguity about what constitutes a medicinal form of the drug .
" the law -lsb- on steroids -rsb- still remains in a slightly unclear state and could certainly do with clarification now , " she said .
the research , entitled steroid and prescription medicine - abuses in the recreational gym user - a regional study , questioned 210 people at 100 heaving lifting gyms in the former mid glamorgan county area in 2005 .

" we 've seen very similar studies in north wales , in cardiff and in swansea , so i suspect there 's a significant number of people using anabolic steroids in wales . "
side-effects of the drugs can include baldness , impotence , developing milk-producing breasts in men and acne , and in misuse of anabolic steroids can cause heart and liver failure .
professor davies believes use has risen in former mining areas because of social changes .
" gone are the days when you could get admiration by going down a mine -you did n't have to prove anything , " he said .
" sadly those days are gone and now people are seeking other ways to gain admiration .
" when you think about it these days , most people are semi-debauched , we 're not a very active society so the only way to acquire the muscles these people want is to weight train using anabolic steroids . "
dealing one 20-year-old weight-training enthusiast , who gained five stone in three years after taking steroids , thinks the risks of the drug have been overstated .
" it 's down to the individual - if your diet 's good and your training 's good you should be fine , " he said .
" ok , something could go wrong inside but that could happen to a normal person walking down the street .
a lot -lsb- of the risks -rsb- are just word of mouth and i think a lot of things are exaggerated totally out of perspective . "
possession and use of steroids is not illegal , provided it is a " medicinal form " , but dealing steroids is .
katy swaine , head of legal services at drug charity release , thinks there is some ambiguity about what constitutes a medicinal form of the drug .
" the law -lsb- on steroids -rsb- still remains in a slightly unclear state and could certainly do with clarification now , " she said .
the research , entitled steroid and prescription medicine - abuses in the recreational gym user - a regional study , questioned 210 people at 100 heaving lifting gyms in the former mid glamorgan county area in 2005 .
eye on wales is broadcast on bbc radio wales on monday 3 july at 1800 bst .

warner bros said the film had also achieved the most successful five-day opening in the studio 's history .
it has taken $ 84m -lrb- £ 45m -rrb- since last wednesday , studio estimates suggest .
early reviews of the film , which cost more than $ 200m -lrb- £ 108m -rrb- , have been positive .
directed by bryan singer , it stars brandon routh and kevin spacey .
fashion magazine satire the devil wears prada , starring meryl streep , took second place in the chart with an estimated opening weekend take of $ 27m -lrb- £ 15m -rrb- .

stricter targets need to be set by ofwat , and money from fines should go to customers as a rebate , it found .
the assembly criticised the fact that repeated failures to meet leak targets , had not resulted in fines .
thames water has imposed a hosepipe ban and requested a drought order .
it says it has reduced leaks to their lowest level for four years .
rainfall in south-east england has been below average since november 2004 - leading the region to face its worst drought in 30 years .
the capital 's water supply is under threat and more must be done joanne mccartney thames water , which recently announced a 31 % rise in pre-tax profits to £ 346.5m , has missed its target for reducing leaks for the third year in a row .
the company , which supplies 5m people in london , has reduced leaks , but still loses 894m litres of water a day .
joanne mccartney , chairwoman of the assembly 's health and public services committee , said targets set by ofwat were laughable , as tokyo 's leakage rate was 4 % .
" last year thames water reduced leakage by a measly 2 % , while its profits rose by almost a third and customers ' bills increased by 20 % , " she said .
" the capital 's water supply is under threat and more must be done . "
leaky victorian mains the report also called for more water meters to be installed , as most customers found it was cheaper , and it reduced demand on water supply .
a thames water spokesman said it was not for the company to comment on whether money raised through fines should be offered as a rebate to customers .
in the past 12 months , he said , requests for water meters had doubled and they were installed free of charge .

" our position is that search is a very hard problem .
we have still a lot of work to do , " said douglas merrill , who looks after internal engineering .
google remains the world 's most popular search engine but in recent years has expanded activities to include e-mail , instant messaging and online mapping .
mr merrill said 70 % of the company 's activities remained focused on search .
" it is not enough to have the information , the information should be right , " said mr merrill .
" sometimes the problem is figuring out what the users mean not what the user said , " he added .
mr merrill said google 's search focus for the future included better search for mobiles , personalised search , language translation , accessing offline information and defeating web spam .
spam is an arms race douglas merrill , google google 's online empire " spam is an arms race , " said mr merrill , adding it was a multi-million dollar industry which was trying to fool search engines .
unlike spam e-mail , web spam tries to trick search engines into featuring websites selling products such as drugs high up on a list of search results .
the spammers exploit the way search engines work by bombarding blogs and comments pages with links to their websites .
google prioritises websites in their search results if a particular page is linked to by other sites .
mr merrill said : " spammers are highly motivated .
there is a lot of money at stake . "
' world 's information ' the google executive said online language translation was important because the company 's philosophy was to provide access to " all the world 's information " .
" we are doing a lot of work in our labs on mechanised translation , " he said .
" it -lrb- search -rrb- should not be stuff in languages we just happen to speak right now . "
mr merrill said the company pledged never to intermingle search results adverts without clear signposting .
" you should never mix search results and ads because it is dishonest to the user , " he explained .
he also defended the company 's policy of releasing new services and tools to users before they were finished products .
tools such as google chat and google mail are beta products , requiring users to give feedback on problems and suggestions .
" in general we think it is better for our users if we post things in the cloud , " he said .
" we launch things and then hear back from the users . "
but according to a recent report on the company 's track record of new services , google had yet to attain market leadership in any of its product areas outside search .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- consultation on smoking age rule bbc news / health graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- health contents : medical notes monday , 3 july 2006 , 09:29 gmt 10:29 uk consultation on smoking age rule the government is launching a consultation on whether or not to raise the legal age for buying tobacco .
three options have been proposed for england and wales - raising the limit to 17 or 18 or leaving it as it is .
the current law dates back to 1908 .
ministers are also asking whether the sanctions against retailers who sell to under-age children should be tightened .
but campaigners questioned how much impact changing the limit would have on under-age smoking . "
the problem is how will it be enforced " simon clark forest one in 10 under 15s smoke , but prosecution rates for shops which sell cigarettes and other tobacco products to under 16s tend to be low and fines are small , despite the maximum penalty standing at £ 3,500 .
the government argues that raising the legal age would make it easier for retailers to spot under-age smokers and lead to a fall in the number of teenagers who get addicted .
proposals to toughen up these sanctions include prohibition orders banning repeat offenders from selling tobacco .
launching the consultation , public health minister caroline flint said the younger people started smoking , the more likely they were to be hooked on the habit for life .
as a result , someone who starts smoking at the age of 15 is three times more likely to die of cancer due to smoking than someone who starts in their late 20s .
cutting inequalities ms flint said : " access to cigarettes by under 16s is not as difficult as it should be , and this is partly due to retailers selling tobacco to those under the legal age .
young smokers about 9 % of children aged between 11 and 15 smoke nearly 70 % of 11 to 15-year-old smokers say they buy their cigarettes from small shops such as newsagents and corner shops in 2004-5 , 117 retailers were successfully prosecuted for selling cigarettes to children under 16 .
penalties ranged from a conditional discharge to £ 1,000 fines " if a particular shop is known locally as the place for children and teenagers to easily buy tobacco , we want to stop that shop selling it .
" these proposals demonstrate our determination to reduce the number of teenagers from smoking , thereby reducing the number of people with preventable diseases and the incidence of health inequalities . "
ian willmore , of the anti-smoking charity action on smoking and health , said : " in principle , we support raising the limit to 18 to bring it in line with alcohol , which does not do as much harm as smoking .
" but in reality , i do n't think it will affect the number of young smokers , as children smoke because it is seen as an adult habit , so in a way you are giving children even more incentive to start . "
and simon clark , director of smokers lobby group forest , said : " we would not oppose raising the age , smoking should be an adult past-time so anything that encourages children not to smoke is good .
the problem is how will it be enforced . "
the british medical association also called for the age limit to be increased to 18 at its annual conference last year .
and a poll conducted in 2004 for the bbc found that four out of five people backed lifting the legal age to 18 , which would bring england and wales in line with the us and other eu states .
of the 1,010 adults surveyed , 55 % said the minimum age should go up to 21 .
the consultation will last three months .
the government believes raising the age limit will highlight the dangers of smoking and help retailers spot under-age buyers .
