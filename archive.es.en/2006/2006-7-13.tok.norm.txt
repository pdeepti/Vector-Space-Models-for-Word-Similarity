but a new report says germany is falling behind in recognizing the principle of universal jurisdiction . this is when national courts prosecute grave crimes , even in cases where the victims and the suspected perpetrators are foreign citizens and the crimes took place in a different country .
offenses such as war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity fall into this category . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new study human rights watch 's recent report , " universal jurisdiction in europe : the state of the art , " finds that law-enforcement agencies in many european countries are increasingly willing to investigate and prosecute people suspected of grave international crimes . the report cites the examples of belgium 's national court , which in 2001 and again in 2005 convicted several rwandan citizens for crimes against humanity committed during rwanda 's 1994 civil war . international criminal court prompted the trend jürgen schurr , one of the report 's authors , said the founding of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague in 2002 kick-started the trend to recognize universal jurisdiction . schurr said these changes came about because european countries were legally bound to include in their national criminal code the offenses recognised by the icc . previously in germany , the maximum charge for people suspected of genocide was murder , which severely underestimated the gravity of many crimes , schurr said .

the investigators have access to the department 's extensive resources and 300 staff members . germany , france lagging behind germany and france receive bad marks in the hrw report .
in france , it still is not possible to prosecute war crimes suspects because the offense is not recognized under french national law . both countries also dedicate few resources to investigating crimes of this severity . schurr found this surprising in germany 's case .
from 1993 to 2003 , the center for combating war crimes , based in the federal criminal police office , was actively investigating war crimes from the former yugoslavia .
now there 's only one person responsible for grave crimes , he says . inquiries fail on political grounds the german legal code provides an excellent basis for the prosecution of grave crimes , according to schurr .

" there is a real political will to dedicate resources to allow for the prosecution of these crimes , " schurr said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internationale criminal court although great britain employs only two people to investigate international crimes , they are both placed in the anti-terror department of london 's metropolitan police .
the investigators have access to the department 's extensive resources and 300 staff members . germany , france lagging behind germany and france receive bad marks in the hrw report .
in france , it still is not possible to prosecute war crimes suspects because the offense is not recognized under french national law . both countries also dedicate few resources to investigating crimes of this severity . schurr found this surprising in germany 's case .
from 1993 to 2003 , the center for combating war crimes , based in the federal criminal police office , was actively investigating war crimes from the former yugoslavia .
now there 's only one person responsible for grave crimes , he says . inquiries fail on political grounds the german legal code provides an excellent basis for the prosecution of grave crimes , according to schurr .
but , he says , there is a lack of political will . " the federal prosecutor has been allowed a bigger latitude of judgement , " he said .
in other words , the court " can be , but does n't have to be , active . " schurr pointed to the situation in 2005 when germany 's constitutional court dismissed allegations that us defense secretary donald rumsfeld was responsible for the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal .
federal prosecutor kay nehm said german authorities could only pursue the case if us authorities refused to do so . new imperialism ? not everyone believes that the principle of universal jurisdiction is progressive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian tomuschat christian tomuschat , emeritus professor for human rights at berlin 's humboldt university , agreed that some countries have made " in-roads " and have even tried and sentenced war crime perpetrators .
but in reality , the concept is controversial , he said . tomuschat used the example of belgium , which he said seems to have laid claimed to the right to try international crimes at a national level . " that is presumptuous , and could be viewed by other countries as a new type of imperialism , " he said . tomuschat said the national prosecution of crimes against humanity or genocide should only be used as " a last resort .

it provides europe with an energy alternative to the middle east and russia . on thursday , the three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- baku-tbilisi-ceyhan -lrb- btc -rrb- pipeline project was opened at the turkish mediterranean port .
the event , however , is not only significant for british oil giant bp who is directing the pipeline project . attending the ceremony were leaders from over 20 countries in the region that are expected to profit from oil and gas revenues .
turkey , where the pipeline terminates , has an increasing appetite for energy , but the united states and europe also have a vested interest in the btc project also . " we understand very well the significance of the btc project and we have conducted delicate energy diplomacy for its successful implementation , " said turkish energy minister hilmi guler , adding that the pipeline " will not only bring turkey big economic benefits , but also huge political dividends . " bottlenecks and geopolitical hotspots being avoided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil giants are considering building refineries in ceyhan the 1760-kilometer pipeline , the second-longest in the world , will deliver more than a million barrels of oil per day by 2008 .
the oil comes from the central asian states of kazakhstan and azerbaijan .
the region used to be part of the former soviet union and that is why this pipeline is seen as having not only economic importance but political as well . for the united states , one of the pipeline 's main political backers , it is seen as a crucial step not only to unlocking urgently needed resources but also to giving the energy-rich region greater independence from its former russian master . crucially it avoids the volatile middle east , giving world markets an important alternative supply .
but the pipeline also breaks russia ’ s monopoly on the distribution of energy for former soviet union states . " the pipelines do not only bring energy security they bring hope , " said david gorokva , head of the georgian gas and oil corporation .

europe at once felt very dependent on the goodwill of russia . both democratic and republican administrations have strongly backed the new pipeline as a means of breaking moscow 's iron grip on the region .
much to moscow 's irritation , us special forces have been sent to georgia to help protect the pipeline as the region is one of most volatile in the world . russia maintains a strong military presence in the caucasus region , which the pipeline passes through .
the region is strewn with ethnic rivalries and unresolved conflicts .

it provides europe with an energy alternative to the middle east and russia . on thursday , the three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- baku-tbilisi-ceyhan -lrb- btc -rrb- pipeline project was opened at the turkish mediterranean port .
the event , however , is not only significant for british oil giant bp who is directing the pipeline project . attending the ceremony were leaders from over 20 countries in the region that are expected to profit from oil and gas revenues .
turkey , where the pipeline terminates , has an increasing appetite for energy , but the united states and europe also have a vested interest in the btc project also . " we understand very well the significance of the btc project and we have conducted delicate energy diplomacy for its successful implementation , " said turkish energy minister hilmi guler , adding that the pipeline " will not only bring turkey big economic benefits , but also huge political dividends . " bottlenecks and geopolitical hotspots being avoided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil giants are considering building refineries in ceyhan the 1760-kilometer pipeline , the second-longest in the world , will deliver more than a million barrels of oil per day by 2008 .
the oil comes from the central asian states of kazakhstan and azerbaijan .
the region used to be part of the former soviet union and that is why this pipeline is seen as having not only economic importance but political as well . for the united states , one of the pipeline 's main political backers , it is seen as a crucial step not only to unlocking urgently needed resources but also to giving the energy-rich region greater independence from its former russian master . crucially it avoids the volatile middle east , giving world markets an important alternative supply .
but the pipeline also breaks russia ’ s monopoly on the distribution of energy for former soviet union states . " the pipelines do not only bring energy security they bring hope , " said david gorokva , head of the georgian gas and oil corporation .
" countries like us are not secure despite the fact of the rose revolution , it is all going to die one day if there is no secure energy resources and i think we should take this into consideration . " political implications in caucasus great bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine and russia quarreled over gas prices this winter last winter , russia without warning doubled the prices of energy to both georgia and the ukraine after pro-russian administrations were ousted by mass protests .
russia claimed the price hike simply mirrored market prices , but washington blasted the move accusing moscow of strong-armed tactics .
europe at once felt very dependent on the goodwill of russia . both democratic and republican administrations have strongly backed the new pipeline as a means of breaking moscow 's iron grip on the region .
much to moscow 's irritation , us special forces have been sent to georgia to help protect the pipeline as the region is one of most volatile in the world . russia maintains a strong military presence in the caucasus region , which the pipeline passes through .
the region is strewn with ethnic rivalries and unresolved conflicts .
in georgia , there are two breakaway states , which fought georgian forces to a standstill in the 1990s .
an uneasy ceasefire also exists between neighboring armenia and azerbaijan . bildunterschrift : the pipeline runs through hotspots in the caucasus " this region has always been volatile if you look at the history and it still is and there is big potential for future conflicts , " said tatiana mitrova , an energy security expert and adviser to the russian presidency .
" there are many rivals who want to gain control over the region because it is the heart of eurasia , and it is the future growth road of all energy routes .
but i am afraid that as the whole political tension is getting stronger and stronger , tension in this region will also rise . " the success of the btc pipeline ultimately depends on the stability of one of world 's most volatile regions .
without stability , the long-term dreams of turkey and the us of opening up a secure east-west energy corridor that exports oil and gas and imports independence and security to former soviet states will remain unfulfilled . dorian jones -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe searches for alternatives to russian gas following the gas price row between russia and ukraine , europe is eyeing new pipeline projects and transportation methods to lessen its dependence on deliveries from russia .

the world cup review : success off the field , controversy on it world cup scores goal for german economy the final eleven : the 2006 world cup in numbers world cup 2006 -pipe- 13.07.2006 strict refs and good prep made for fewer world cup injuries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team doctors were called out 156 times in the world cup the fifa medical commission has good news : this year 's world cup saw a dramatic decline in injuries and not a single doping case .
still , sports doctors are looking to curb kung fu moves and fakers . not only was the 2006 world cup healthy for business in germany , it also proved healthy for the participants , reported the official sports doctors .
with 736 professional soccer players fighting tooth and nail through 64 games for the title , somebody is bound to get hurt . jiri dvorak , head of fifa 's medical department , said there was on average only 2.2 injuries per game this year .
that is considerably fewer than in the 2002 world cup , where the average was 2.7 injuries per game .
for dvorak , it 's " an encouraging decline . " everything 's on tape " after every game we count up all the injuries that occurred .
we get it in writing from the doctors and afterward we watch the tape to see everything that led up to the injury .
then we make a scientific assessment of it , " dvorak said . even minor abrasions and bruises were recorded .
in the 2006 world cup , only one fourth of the total injuries were severe enough that the affected player missed one or more games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was an average of 2.2 injuries per game less than half as many head injuries at the 2002 world cup in japan and korea , elbowing resulted in 25 head injuries , said dvorak .
concerted efforts were made to reduce the number this year . " fifa specifically instructed the referee committee and the referees to penalize incidences of elbowing , " dvorak said . fifa 's chief doctor said he believes the referees ' strict approach contributed to a reduction in head injuries .
only 11 occurred in 2006 , less than half the number of head injuries in 2002 . dvorak attributes the decline in injuries not only to referees but also to more advanced training methods .
the better a team is physically prepared for the championship , the smaller the chances are that the players will sustain injuries . it was for good reason that the fifa insisted on a total of six game-free weeks prior to the world cup . kung fu on the field despite the positive injury statistics , the fifa medical committee has a few recommendations for future soccer events , especially concerning injury simulations that break the flow of play .
team doctors were called to the field 156 times in this world cup , but only 88 of these cases constituted a real injury . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the refs ' dedication to fair play leads to fewer injuries dvorak also said he discovered a new kind of foul this year : " we certainly have to get a handle on the kung fu moves . " the medical committee plans to recommend harsher consequences for players who stick out their leg in the direction of another player 's upper body . in contrast to other sporting events ... the positive - or rather , negative - results of routine doping tests before and during the world cup rounded out the fifa medical report . " about 16 players from each team were tested at a time .
i think we can confidently say that there is no evidence of systematic doping in soccer , " dvorak said . that makes the 2006 world cup the third in a row without a single case of doping . tim brockmeier -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fifa committee responds to referee criticism the referees committee of fifa , world soccer 's governing body , rejected charges of poor officiating during the world cup and added that quality of refereeing has been higher than ever .

his aim ?
to get to know merkel and other " real germans " better - if only security staff will let him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush pretends to eat an imaginary herring president bush 's stralsund visit got off to a sunny start on thursday when he was formally welcomed in the city square by german chancellor angela merkel .
the president shook hands with the smiling germans in the crowd , then accepted a small ceremonial barrel of herring , miming eating one of the fish in jest . " i bring a message from the american people : we 're honored to call the german people friends and allies , " the us president said .
" america and germany stand side by side . " the president touched down in germany late wednesday in the northern city of rostock en route to the group of eight summit of industrialized nations in st. petersburg , which merkel will also attend . following his welcome in stralsund , bush signed the town 's " golden book " before sitting down with merkel before a fireplace in the town hall for talks .
the two discussed the renewed violence between israel and lebanon , as well as how to respond to iran after it failed to respond to incentives aimed at ending an impassse over its nuclear program . the two-day stop in merkel 's constituency on the baltic sea coast is meant to give the two leaders time to get to know each other better , as well as show bush the " real germany . " during bush 's last visit to germany to the southwestern city of mainz in february 2005 , germans displayed their talent for thoroughness by effectively removing any signs of life from the city 's streets .
bush reportedly said himself that he thought the security precautions were exaggerated .
he is keen for his experience in stralsund to be different . but those in charge of security just ca n't help themselves , it seems .
for days now , helicopters have been circling over the stralsund while security personnel have been busy repeating precautions taken in mainz - welding shut manholes , sealing off letter boxes , and cordoning off the historic town center . will the real germans please stand up ? many locals and tourists in stralsund are less than amused at the way their lives have been turned upside down in order to ensure the safety of merkel 's prominent guest . " look at the shops here in the town center , " one tourist said .
" they 'll all be closed during the president 's stay .
we 're here on holiday and want to have a good time shopping , but they just wo n't let us . " " according to the politicians in berlin , the whole town should be happy to welcome the president , " a resident said .
" but then most of the people here are locked away from the president so as not to present a threat to him .
that does n't make any sense to me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this couple arrived early to meet bush in stralsund 's market square though bush got the desired contact with the locals during thursday 's market square welcome , he met a crowd of handpicked stralsunders who had undergone extensive background checks .
a quarter of the crowd was made up of students from the nearby naval academy .
critics say it was hardly an authentic encounter with the people of stralsund , most of whom - like merkel - experienced life under the communist east german regime and the transition to democracy following reunification .
many say it 's precisely that experience of recent history that makes merkel and her constituency so fascinating to the president . bonding over roast boar the president and the chancellor will have a further chance to bond over a wild game barbecue night in the nearby village of trinwillershagen .
meant to echo the type of informal barbecues the bushes frequently host at their texas ranch , the atmosphere of merkel 's grill party is planned to be " deliberately relaxed " - at least as relaxed as you can be with 12,000 police officers on alert all around you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters are being kept far from the action and , as was the case in mainz last year , bush 's visit to stralsund will also be accompanied by protest rallies .
an estimated 5,000 people intend to demonstrate against the us administration 's foreign policy , and especially , the ongoing conflict in iraq .
but they 'll mainly be protesting for their own satisfaction because just as in mainz , bush is unlikely to see any of the campaigners and protesters , who 've been relegated to the outskirts of the city . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush visit sign of closer us-german relations us president george w. bush heads to german chancellor angela merkel 's constituency in former east germany on thursday for a visit that underlines the improving ties between the two leaders .

still , sports doctors are looking to curb kung fu moves and fakers . not only was the 2006 world cup healthy for business in germany , it also proved healthy for the participants , reported the official sports doctors .
with 736 professional soccer players fighting tooth and nail through 64 games for the title , somebody is bound to get hurt . jiri dvorak , head of fifa 's medical department , said there was on average only 2.2 injuries per game this year .
that is considerably fewer than in the 2002 world cup , where the average was 2.7 injuries per game .
for dvorak , it 's " an encouraging decline . " everything 's on tape " after every game we count up all the injuries that occurred .
we get it in writing from the doctors and afterward we watch the tape to see everything that led up to the injury .

only 11 occurred in 2006 , less than half the number of head injuries in 2002 . dvorak attributes the decline in injuries not only to referees but also to more advanced training methods .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.07.2006 bush visit : bonding over barbecue on the baltic sea großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush go on walkabout to meet " real germans " in stralsund us president george w. bush has arrived for his two-day visit with chancellor merkel in her parliamentary district .
his aim ?
to get to know merkel and other " real germans " better - if only security staff will let him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush pretends to eat an imaginary herring president bush 's stralsund visit got off to a sunny start on thursday when he was formally welcomed in the city square by german chancellor angela merkel .
the president shook hands with the smiling germans in the crowd , then accepted a small ceremonial barrel of herring , miming eating one of the fish in jest . " i bring a message from the american people : we 're honored to call the german people friends and allies , " the us president said .
" america and germany stand side by side . " the president touched down in germany late wednesday in the northern city of rostock en route to the group of eight summit of industrialized nations in st. petersburg , which merkel will also attend . following his welcome in stralsund , bush signed the town 's " golden book " before sitting down with merkel before a fireplace in the town hall for talks .
the two discussed the renewed violence between israel and lebanon , as well as how to respond to iran after it failed to respond to incentives aimed at ending an impassse over its nuclear program . the two-day stop in merkel 's constituency on the baltic sea coast is meant to give the two leaders time to get to know each other better , as well as show bush the " real germany . " during bush 's last visit to germany to the southwestern city of mainz in february 2005 , germans displayed their talent for thoroughness by effectively removing any signs of life from the city 's streets .
bush reportedly said himself that he thought the security precautions were exaggerated .
he is keen for his experience in stralsund to be different . but those in charge of security just ca n't help themselves , it seems .
for days now , helicopters have been circling over the stralsund while security personnel have been busy repeating precautions taken in mainz - welding shut manholes , sealing off letter boxes , and cordoning off the historic town center . will the real germans please stand up ? many locals and tourists in stralsund are less than amused at the way their lives have been turned upside down in order to ensure the safety of merkel 's prominent guest . " look at the shops here in the town center , " one tourist said .
" they 'll all be closed during the president 's stay .
we 're here on holiday and want to have a good time shopping , but they just wo n't let us . " " according to the politicians in berlin , the whole town should be happy to welcome the president , " a resident said .
" but then most of the people here are locked away from the president so as not to present a threat to him .
that does n't make any sense to me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this couple arrived early to meet bush in stralsund 's market square though bush got the desired contact with the locals during thursday 's market square welcome , he met a crowd of handpicked stralsunders who had undergone extensive background checks .
a quarter of the crowd was made up of students from the nearby naval academy .
critics say it was hardly an authentic encounter with the people of stralsund , most of whom - like merkel - experienced life under the communist east german regime and the transition to democracy following reunification .
many say it 's precisely that experience of recent history that makes merkel and her constituency so fascinating to the president . bonding over roast boar the president and the chancellor will have a further chance to bond over a wild game barbecue night in the nearby village of trinwillershagen .
meant to echo the type of informal barbecues the bushes frequently host at their texas ranch , the atmosphere of merkel 's grill party is planned to be " deliberately relaxed " - at least as relaxed as you can be with 12,000 police officers on alert all around you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters are being kept far from the action and , as was the case in mainz last year , bush 's visit to stralsund will also be accompanied by protest rallies .

his aim ?
to get to know merkel and other " real germans " better - if only security staff will let him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush pretends to eat an imaginary herring president bush 's stralsund visit got off to a sunny start on thursday when he was formally welcomed in the city square by german chancellor angela merkel .
the president shook hands with the smiling germans in the crowd , then accepted a small ceremonial barrel of herring , miming eating one of the fish in jest . " i bring a message from the american people : we 're honored to call the german people friends and allies , " the us president said .
" america and germany stand side by side . " the president touched down in germany late wednesday in the northern city of rostock en route to the group of eight summit of industrialized nations in st. petersburg , which merkel will also attend . following his welcome in stralsund , bush signed the town 's " golden book " before sitting down with merkel before a fireplace in the town hall for talks .
the two discussed the renewed violence between israel and lebanon , as well as how to respond to iran after it failed to respond to incentives aimed at ending an impassse over its nuclear program . the two-day stop in merkel 's constituency on the baltic sea coast is meant to give the two leaders time to get to know each other better , as well as show bush the " real germany . " during bush 's last visit to germany to the southwestern city of mainz in february 2005 , germans displayed their talent for thoroughness by effectively removing any signs of life from the city 's streets .
bush reportedly said himself that he thought the security precautions were exaggerated .
he is keen for his experience in stralsund to be different . but those in charge of security just ca n't help themselves , it seems .
for days now , helicopters have been circling over the stralsund while security personnel have been busy repeating precautions taken in mainz - welding shut manholes , sealing off letter boxes , and cordoning off the historic town center . will the real germans please stand up ? many locals and tourists in stralsund are less than amused at the way their lives have been turned upside down in order to ensure the safety of merkel 's prominent guest . " look at the shops here in the town center , " one tourist said .
" they 'll all be closed during the president 's stay .
we 're here on holiday and want to have a good time shopping , but they just wo n't let us . " " according to the politicians in berlin , the whole town should be happy to welcome the president , " a resident said .
" but then most of the people here are locked away from the president so as not to present a threat to him .
that does n't make any sense to me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this couple arrived early to meet bush in stralsund 's market square though bush got the desired contact with the locals during thursday 's market square welcome , he met a crowd of handpicked stralsunders who had undergone extensive background checks .
a quarter of the crowd was made up of students from the nearby naval academy .
critics say it was hardly an authentic encounter with the people of stralsund , most of whom - like merkel - experienced life under the communist east german regime and the transition to democracy following reunification .
many say it 's precisely that experience of recent history that makes merkel and her constituency so fascinating to the president . bonding over roast boar the president and the chancellor will have a further chance to bond over a wild game barbecue night in the nearby village of trinwillershagen .
meant to echo the type of informal barbecues the bushes frequently host at their texas ranch , the atmosphere of merkel 's grill party is planned to be " deliberately relaxed " - at least as relaxed as you can be with 12,000 police officers on alert all around you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters are being kept far from the action and , as was the case in mainz last year , bush 's visit to stralsund will also be accompanied by protest rallies .
an estimated 5,000 people intend to demonstrate against the us administration 's foreign policy , and especially , the ongoing conflict in iraq .
but they 'll mainly be protesting for their own satisfaction because just as in mainz , bush is unlikely to see any of the campaigners and protesters , who 've been relegated to the outskirts of the city . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush visit sign of closer us-german relations us president george w. bush heads to german chancellor angela merkel 's constituency in former east germany on thursday for a visit that underlines the improving ties between the two leaders .

" my biggest concern is whether or not actions taken will weaken the siniora government , " he said , referring to lebanese prime minister fuad siniora .
" democracy in lebanon is an important part of laying a foundation for peace in that region .
we have worked really hard to get syria out of lebanon . " worst violence in a decade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss for angela - bush arrived in stralsund late wednesday the american president was speaking from the eastern german town of stralsund on the baltic coast where he is meeting with german chancellor angela merkel before heading off to the g-8 summit in russia over the weekend . german chancellor angela merkel too called for a " de-escalation " of the conflict in the middle east - the worst cross border violence in a decade - after israeli fighter jets bombed lebanon 's only international airport and killed 28 civilians in a wave of retaliatory strikes over the killing and capture of soldiers by hezbollah guerrillas on wednesday . an israeli woman was also killed when hezbollah fired off a barrage of rockets across the volatile border , sending panicked residents of communities in northern israel into bomb shelters . merkel said the violence had been sparked by the capture of the soldiers , but added : " we can only call on everyone to stop the violence , to release the soldiers and to stop the rocket attacks on israel . " telephone diplomacy bush accused hezbollah and hamas of trying to derail efforts to bring peace to the middle east by creating an independent palestinian state existing side-by-side with israel . " it 's really sad where people are willing to take innocent life to stop that process .
matter of fact , it 's pathetic , " said bush , who has refused to recognize the palestinian government led by hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli warplanes targeted the rafik hariri international airport in beirut " hezbollah does n't want there to be peace , the militant arm of hamas does n't want there to be peace , and those of us who do want peace will continue to work together to encourage peace , " bush said . " there are a group of terrorists who want to stop the advance of peace , and those of us who are peace-loving must work together to help the agents of peace , " he said .
" things looked positive , and terrorists stepped up . " bush said that us secretary of state condoleezza rice had iniatiated telephone diplomacy to try to calm the situation , and added : " i 'll be making calls " as well . the us president said damascus , a patron of hezbollah , must pressure the lebanese militia to free captured israeli soldiers . " syria needs to be held to account " over a dramatic escalation of violence in the middle east , " bush said .
president assad needs to show some leadership towards peace . " france , russia slam israel 's actions the eu ’ s 25 foreign ministers are meeting next monday to discuss the middle east peace plan which is essentially only a piece of paper at this point .
as part of the so-called middle east peace quartet , the bloc has spent years trying to move the process along but is now unsure how to position itself in the current crisis . one group of eu countries , including the uk , belgium , italy and germany , which had been reluctant to openly criticise israel finally did so on thursday saying it was using excessive force in lebanon .
france is one of the countries which has taken an even sharper tone publicly about the israeli retaliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : douste-blazy has used strong language to condemn israeli bombardment of lebanon french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said on europe 1 radio on thursday that israel 's bombardment of lebanon was " an act of war " .
he added that israel " runs the risk of plunging lebanon back into the worst years of war . " the russian ministry said it supported lebanon 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , but also condemned the abduction of israeli soldiers by hezbollah and palestinian militants .
" acts of terrorism are completely unacceptable , " the statement said . italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema called israel 's actions in the palestinian territories " counterproductive . " un weighs in un secretary-general kofi annan has decided to send a three-person team to the middle east to urge all parties to exercise restraint and help defuse the major crisis in the region . the team will first visit cairo to meet with egyptian officials and consult with arab league foreign ministers meeting there on saturday .

" my biggest concern is whether or not actions taken will weaken the siniora government , " he said , referring to lebanese prime minister fuad siniora .
" democracy in lebanon is an important part of laying a foundation for peace in that region .
we have worked really hard to get syria out of lebanon . " worst violence in a decade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss for angela - bush arrived in stralsund late wednesday the american president was speaking from the eastern german town of stralsund on the baltic coast where he is meeting with german chancellor angela merkel before heading off to the g-8 summit in russia over the weekend . german chancellor angela merkel too called for a " de-escalation " of the conflict in the middle east - the worst cross border violence in a decade - after israeli fighter jets bombed lebanon 's only international airport and killed 28 civilians in a wave of retaliatory strikes over the killing and capture of soldiers by hezbollah guerrillas on wednesday . an israeli woman was also killed when hezbollah fired off a barrage of rockets across the volatile border , sending panicked residents of communities in northern israel into bomb shelters . merkel said the violence had been sparked by the capture of the soldiers , but added : " we can only call on everyone to stop the violence , to release the soldiers and to stop the rocket attacks on israel . " telephone diplomacy bush accused hezbollah and hamas of trying to derail efforts to bring peace to the middle east by creating an independent palestinian state existing side-by-side with israel . " it 's really sad where people are willing to take innocent life to stop that process .
matter of fact , it 's pathetic , " said bush , who has refused to recognize the palestinian government led by hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli warplanes targeted the rafik hariri international airport in beirut " hezbollah does n't want there to be peace , the militant arm of hamas does n't want there to be peace , and those of us who do want peace will continue to work together to encourage peace , " bush said . " there are a group of terrorists who want to stop the advance of peace , and those of us who are peace-loving must work together to help the agents of peace , " he said .
" things looked positive , and terrorists stepped up . " bush said that us secretary of state condoleezza rice had iniatiated telephone diplomacy to try to calm the situation , and added : " i 'll be making calls " as well . the us president said damascus , a patron of hezbollah , must pressure the lebanese militia to free captured israeli soldiers . " syria needs to be held to account " over a dramatic escalation of violence in the middle east , " bush said .
president assad needs to show some leadership towards peace . " france , russia slam israel 's actions the eu ’ s 25 foreign ministers are meeting next monday to discuss the middle east peace plan which is essentially only a piece of paper at this point .
as part of the so-called middle east peace quartet , the bloc has spent years trying to move the process along but is now unsure how to position itself in the current crisis . one group of eu countries , including the uk , belgium , italy and germany , which had been reluctant to openly criticise israel finally did so on thursday saying it was using excessive force in lebanon .
france is one of the countries which has taken an even sharper tone publicly about the israeli retaliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : douste-blazy has used strong language to condemn israeli bombardment of lebanon french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said on europe 1 radio on thursday that israel 's bombardment of lebanon was " an act of war " .
he added that israel " runs the risk of plunging lebanon back into the worst years of war . " the russian ministry said it supported lebanon 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , but also condemned the abduction of israeli soldiers by hezbollah and palestinian militants .
" acts of terrorism are completely unacceptable , " the statement said . italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema called israel 's actions in the palestinian territories " counterproductive . " un weighs in un secretary-general kofi annan has decided to send a three-person team to the middle east to urge all parties to exercise restraint and help defuse the major crisis in the region . the team will first visit cairo to meet with egyptian officials and consult with arab league foreign ministers meeting there on saturday .
the un team is then expected to head to israel , the palestinian territories , lebanon , syria and possibly other destinations . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : israel 's right to exist " must never be questioned " speaking at the american jewish committee -lrb- ajc -rrb- annual meeting in washington , german chancellor angela merkel denounced iran and the palestinian militant group hamas for questioning israel 's right to exist .
-lrb- may 5 , 2006 -rrb- europe 's role in middle east waning as part of the middle east quartet , germany and the eu have a vested interest in the israeli elections .

but a new report says germany is falling behind in recognizing the principle of universal jurisdiction . this is when national courts prosecute grave crimes , even in cases where the victims and the suspected perpetrators are foreign citizens and the crimes took place in a different country .
offenses such as war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity fall into this category . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new study human rights watch 's recent report , " universal jurisdiction in europe : the state of the art , " finds that law-enforcement agencies in many european countries are increasingly willing to investigate and prosecute people suspected of grave international crimes . the report cites the examples of belgium 's national court , which in 2001 and again in 2005 convicted several rwandan citizens for crimes against humanity committed during rwanda 's 1994 civil war . international criminal court prompted the trend jürgen schurr , one of the report 's authors , said the founding of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague in 2002 kick-started the trend to recognize universal jurisdiction . schurr said these changes came about because european countries were legally bound to include in their national criminal code the offenses recognised by the icc . previously in germany , the maximum charge for people suspected of genocide was murder , which severely underestimated the gravity of many crimes , schurr said .
that situation changed with the introduction of germany 's code of crimes against international law in 2002 . the hrw report takes a close took at eight countries – belgium , denmark , germany , france , great britain , the netherlands , norway and spain . netherlands comes up trumps in hrw report netherlands and great britain receive the most glowing reports .

" there is a real political will to dedicate resources to allow for the prosecution of these crimes , " schurr said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internationale criminal court although great britain employs only two people to investigate international crimes , they are both placed in the anti-terror department of london 's metropolitan police .
the investigators have access to the department 's extensive resources and 300 staff members . germany , france lagging behind germany and france receive bad marks in the hrw report .
in france , it still is not possible to prosecute war crimes suspects because the offense is not recognized under french national law . both countries also dedicate few resources to investigating crimes of this severity . schurr found this surprising in germany 's case .
from 1993 to 2003 , the center for combating war crimes , based in the federal criminal police office , was actively investigating war crimes from the former yugoslavia .
now there 's only one person responsible for grave crimes , he says . inquiries fail on political grounds the german legal code provides an excellent basis for the prosecution of grave crimes , according to schurr .
but , he says , there is a lack of political will . " the federal prosecutor has been allowed a bigger latitude of judgement , " he said .
in other words , the court " can be , but does n't have to be , active . " schurr pointed to the situation in 2005 when germany 's constitutional court dismissed allegations that us defense secretary donald rumsfeld was responsible for the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal .

but in reality , the concept is controversial , he said . tomuschat used the example of belgium , which he said seems to have laid claimed to the right to try international crimes at a national level .

offenses such as war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity fall into this category . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new study human rights watch 's recent report , " universal jurisdiction in europe : the state of the art , " finds that law-enforcement agencies in many european countries are increasingly willing to investigate and prosecute people suspected of grave international crimes . the report cites the examples of belgium 's national court , which in 2001 and again in 2005 convicted several rwandan citizens for crimes against humanity committed during rwanda 's 1994 civil war . international criminal court prompted the trend jürgen schurr , one of the report 's authors , said the founding of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague in 2002 kick-started the trend to recognize universal jurisdiction . schurr said these changes came about because european countries were legally bound to include in their national criminal code the offenses recognised by the icc . previously in germany , the maximum charge for people suspected of genocide was murder , which severely underestimated the gravity of many crimes , schurr said .

the investigators have access to the department 's extensive resources and 300 staff members . germany , france lagging behind germany and france receive bad marks in the hrw report .
in france , it still is not possible to prosecute war crimes suspects because the offense is not recognized under french national law . both countries also dedicate few resources to investigating crimes of this severity . schurr found this surprising in germany 's case .

but , he says , there is a lack of political will . " the federal prosecutor has been allowed a bigger latitude of judgement , " he said .
in other words , the court " can be , but does n't have to be , active . " schurr pointed to the situation in 2005 when germany 's constitutional court dismissed allegations that us defense secretary donald rumsfeld was responsible for the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal .

" america and germany stand side by side . " " we share common values and common interests .
we want to work together to keep the peace .
we want to work together to promote freedom .
there 's so much we can do , working together , " he said . the visit was marked by good spirits and humor as bush accepted a small ceremonial barrel of herring and jokingly mimed eating one of the fish . " this is a very good opportunity , indeed , to say a word of thanks , " a beaming merkel said .
" we owe you a big debt of gratitude for being able to finally live within one country in peace and freedom ; one country - germany . " leaders urge restraint in mideast at a joint public appearance later , the two leaders accused the lebanon-based hezbollah movement of sparking some of the worst middle east violence in a decade by abducting israeli soldiers and firing rockets at targets inside israel . bush pointedly defended israel 's " right to defend herself " but urged restraint , saying that " whatever israel does should not weaken " the fragile government of lebanese prime minister fuad siniora . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke rises from an israeli air raid that targeted a bridge in the zahrani region in lebanon " my biggest concern is whether or not actions taken will weaken the siniora government , " he said .
" democracy in lebanon is an important part of laying a foundation for peace in that region . " " the attacks did not start from the israeli side , but from hezbollah 's side , " said merkel .
" we call on the powers in the region to seek to bring about a de-escalation of the situation . " losing patience with iran ? the two leaders jointly warned iran that they were taking the dispute over tehran 's nuclear program to the un security council and urged the islamic republic to freeze sensitive atomic activities as a precondition for talks . " i truly think they 're trying to wait us out .
they think it 's a matter of time before people lose their nerve , " bush said .
" i think they 're going to be disappointed that this coalition is a lot firmer than they think .

it provides europe with an energy alternative to the middle east and russia . on thursday , the three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- baku-tbilisi-ceyhan -lrb- btc -rrb- pipeline project was opened at the turkish mediterranean port .
the event , however , is not only significant for british oil giant bp who is directing the pipeline project . attending the ceremony were leaders from over 20 countries in the region that are expected to profit from oil and gas revenues .
turkey , where the pipeline terminates , has an increasing appetite for energy , but the united states and europe also have a vested interest in the btc project also . " we understand very well the significance of the btc project and we have conducted delicate energy diplomacy for its successful implementation , " said turkish energy minister hilmi guler , adding that the pipeline " will not only bring turkey big economic benefits , but also huge political dividends . " bottlenecks and geopolitical hotspots being avoided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil giants are considering building refineries in ceyhan the 1760-kilometer pipeline , the second-longest in the world , will deliver more than a million barrels of oil per day by 2008 .
the oil comes from the central asian states of kazakhstan and azerbaijan .
the region used to be part of the former soviet union and that is why this pipeline is seen as having not only economic importance but political as well . for the united states , one of the pipeline 's main political backers , it is seen as a crucial step not only to unlocking urgently needed resources but also to giving the energy-rich region greater independence from its former russian master . crucially it avoids the volatile middle east , giving world markets an important alternative supply .
but the pipeline also breaks russia ’ s monopoly on the distribution of energy for former soviet union states . " the pipelines do not only bring energy security they bring hope , " said david gorokva , head of the georgian gas and oil corporation .
" countries like us are not secure despite the fact of the rose revolution , it is all going to die one day if there is no secure energy resources and i think we should take this into consideration . " political implications in caucasus great bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine and russia quarreled over gas prices this winter last winter , russia without warning doubled the prices of energy to both georgia and the ukraine after pro-russian administrations were ousted by mass protests .
russia claimed the price hike simply mirrored market prices , but washington blasted the move accusing moscow of strong-armed tactics .
europe at once felt very dependent on the goodwill of russia . both democratic and republican administrations have strongly backed the new pipeline as a means of breaking moscow 's iron grip on the region .
much to moscow 's irritation , us special forces have been sent to georgia to help protect the pipeline as the region is one of most volatile in the world . russia maintains a strong military presence in the caucasus region , which the pipeline passes through .
the region is strewn with ethnic rivalries and unresolved conflicts .
in georgia , there are two breakaway states , which fought georgian forces to a standstill in the 1990s .
an uneasy ceasefire also exists between neighboring armenia and azerbaijan . bildunterschrift : the pipeline runs through hotspots in the caucasus " this region has always been volatile if you look at the history and it still is and there is big potential for future conflicts , " said tatiana mitrova , an energy security expert and adviser to the russian presidency .
" there are many rivals who want to gain control over the region because it is the heart of eurasia , and it is the future growth road of all energy routes .
but i am afraid that as the whole political tension is getting stronger and stronger , tension in this region will also rise . " the success of the btc pipeline ultimately depends on the stability of one of world 's most volatile regions .
without stability , the long-term dreams of turkey and the us of opening up a secure east-west energy corridor that exports oil and gas and imports independence and security to former soviet states will remain unfulfilled . dorian jones -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe searches for alternatives to russian gas following the gas price row between russia and ukraine , europe is eyeing new pipeline projects and transportation methods to lessen its dependence on deliveries from russia .

it provides europe with an energy alternative to the middle east and russia . on thursday , the three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- baku-tbilisi-ceyhan -lrb- btc -rrb- pipeline project was opened at the turkish mediterranean port .
the event , however , is not only significant for british oil giant bp who is directing the pipeline project . attending the ceremony were leaders from over 20 countries in the region that are expected to profit from oil and gas revenues .
turkey , where the pipeline terminates , has an increasing appetite for energy , but the united states and europe also have a vested interest in the btc project also . " we understand very well the significance of the btc project and we have conducted delicate energy diplomacy for its successful implementation , " said turkish energy minister hilmi guler , adding that the pipeline " will not only bring turkey big economic benefits , but also huge political dividends . " bottlenecks and geopolitical hotspots being avoided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil giants are considering building refineries in ceyhan the 1760-kilometer pipeline , the second-longest in the world , will deliver more than a million barrels of oil per day by 2008 .
the oil comes from the central asian states of kazakhstan and azerbaijan .
the region used to be part of the former soviet union and that is why this pipeline is seen as having not only economic importance but political as well . for the united states , one of the pipeline 's main political backers , it is seen as a crucial step not only to unlocking urgently needed resources but also to giving the energy-rich region greater independence from its former russian master . crucially it avoids the volatile middle east , giving world markets an important alternative supply .
but the pipeline also breaks russia ’ s monopoly on the distribution of energy for former soviet union states . " the pipelines do not only bring energy security they bring hope , " said david gorokva , head of the georgian gas and oil corporation .

europe at once felt very dependent on the goodwill of russia . both democratic and republican administrations have strongly backed the new pipeline as a means of breaking moscow 's iron grip on the region .
much to moscow 's irritation , us special forces have been sent to georgia to help protect the pipeline as the region is one of most volatile in the world . russia maintains a strong military presence in the caucasus region , which the pipeline passes through .
the region is strewn with ethnic rivalries and unresolved conflicts .

an uneasy ceasefire also exists between neighboring armenia and azerbaijan . bildunterschrift : the pipeline runs through hotspots in the caucasus " this region has always been volatile if you look at the history and it still is and there is big potential for future conflicts , " said tatiana mitrova , an energy security expert and adviser to the russian presidency .

turkey , where the pipeline terminates , has an increasing appetite for energy , but the united states and europe also have a vested interest in the btc project also . " we understand very well the significance of the btc project and we have conducted delicate energy diplomacy for its successful implementation , " said turkish energy minister hilmi guler , adding that the pipeline " will not only bring turkey big economic benefits , but also huge political dividends . " bottlenecks and geopolitical hotspots being avoided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil giants are considering building refineries in ceyhan the 1760-kilometer pipeline , the second-longest in the world , will deliver more than a million barrels of oil per day by 2008 .
the oil comes from the central asian states of kazakhstan and azerbaijan .
the region used to be part of the former soviet union and that is why this pipeline is seen as having not only economic importance but political as well . for the united states , one of the pipeline 's main political backers , it is seen as a crucial step not only to unlocking urgently needed resources but also to giving the energy-rich region greater independence from its former russian master . crucially it avoids the volatile middle east , giving world markets an important alternative supply .
but the pipeline also breaks russia ’ s monopoly on the distribution of energy for former soviet union states . " the pipelines do not only bring energy security they bring hope , " said david gorokva , head of the georgian gas and oil corporation .
" countries like us are not secure despite the fact of the rose revolution , it is all going to die one day if there is no secure energy resources and i think we should take this into consideration . " political implications in caucasus great bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine and russia quarreled over gas prices this winter last winter , russia without warning doubled the prices of energy to both georgia and the ukraine after pro-russian administrations were ousted by mass protests .
russia claimed the price hike simply mirrored market prices , but washington blasted the move accusing moscow of strong-armed tactics .
europe at once felt very dependent on the goodwill of russia . both democratic and republican administrations have strongly backed the new pipeline as a means of breaking moscow 's iron grip on the region .
much to moscow 's irritation , us special forces have been sent to georgia to help protect the pipeline as the region is one of most volatile in the world . russia maintains a strong military presence in the caucasus region , which the pipeline passes through .
the region is strewn with ethnic rivalries and unresolved conflicts .
in georgia , there are two breakaway states , which fought georgian forces to a standstill in the 1990s .
an uneasy ceasefire also exists between neighboring armenia and azerbaijan . bildunterschrift : the pipeline runs through hotspots in the caucasus " this region has always been volatile if you look at the history and it still is and there is big potential for future conflicts , " said tatiana mitrova , an energy security expert and adviser to the russian presidency .
" there are many rivals who want to gain control over the region because it is the heart of eurasia , and it is the future growth road of all energy routes .
but i am afraid that as the whole political tension is getting stronger and stronger , tension in this region will also rise . " the success of the btc pipeline ultimately depends on the stability of one of world 's most volatile regions .
without stability , the long-term dreams of turkey and the us of opening up a secure east-west energy corridor that exports oil and gas and imports independence and security to former soviet states will remain unfulfilled . dorian jones -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe searches for alternatives to russian gas following the gas price row between russia and ukraine , europe is eyeing new pipeline projects and transportation methods to lessen its dependence on deliveries from russia .

us companies are bringing funds and much needed jobs to the former communist region . president george bush on thursday is visiting angela merkel in stralsund on the baltic sea .
the german chancellor invited her american counterpart to her own electoral district in eastern germany , in part so he could form his own impressions of the " new " states nearly 16 years after german reunification . though unemployment is still uncomfortably high in the east - between 20 and 30 percent in stralsund - bush 's countrymen and women have been playing a significant role in the recovery of the eastern german economy .
american investors are attracted to the central european region , primarily because of its opportune geographical location , and numerous american companies have written their success stories there . billions from the us since reunification " the us is the most important investor in the east german states , " said the american ambassador to germany , william r. timken .

" what has been built up in the micro-electronic cluster in saxony has so much potential that we are going to see growth in the future .
i 'm certain of that . " at amd , growth is well underway : the chip producer recently announced plans to invest an additional $ 2.5 billion in its dresden plant .
twenty percent of that will come from the german taxpayers in the form of investment bonuses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxony is one of germany 's 16 federal states state subsidies are yet another alluring aspect of investing in former east germany .
the european union , the federal government and the new german states all seek to attract potential investors by offering investment bonuses and tax breaks . federal government seeks to cut red tape even if the advantages of investment in eastern germany seem to outweigh the disadvantages , there are a few drawbacks the new states will have to resolve if they want to enhance their global competitiveness . issues like recognizing american drivers ' licenses in germany or providing language training for employees are among the less formidable hurdles , but excessive bureaucracy is more critical . " germany still has the reputation of being overly bureaucratic , having too many rules and too much red tape , " tiefensee said .

us companies are bringing funds and much needed jobs to the former communist region . president george bush on thursday is visiting angela merkel in stralsund on the baltic sea .
the german chancellor invited her american counterpart to her own electoral district in eastern germany , in part so he could form his own impressions of the " new " states nearly 16 years after german reunification . though unemployment is still uncomfortably high in the east - between 20 and 30 percent in stralsund - bush 's countrymen and women have been playing a significant role in the recovery of the eastern german economy .
american investors are attracted to the central european region , primarily because of its opportune geographical location , and numerous american companies have written their success stories there . billions from the us since reunification " the us is the most important investor in the east german states , " said the american ambassador to germany , william r. timken .
" american companies employ nearly 40,000 people there and we americans are an important part of the eastern german economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet auction site e-bay is a california based company that has put down roots in east germany after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 and german reunification in 1990 , around 400 american companies set up shop in former east germany - from dow chemical , e-bay and general motors to coca-cola , goodyear and smaller businesses , too . american companies have since invested a total of 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.7 billion -rrb- in the east german economy . gateway to the east its proximity to new eastern european , southeastern european and asian markets makes former east germany particularly attractive to american investors , said wolfgang tiefensee , federal minister for the new german states . " the new german states serve as a gateway to these new markets for the investors , " he said . however , geography is not the only plus to investing in former east germany . " germany offers security : legal security and financial security for the investment , " tiefensee said .
" and that gives it an advantage over other countries . " us chip maker in saxony 's micro-electronic cluster amd , the world 's leading producer of computer chips next to intel , is one of the american companies that have invested in eastern germany .
they came to saxony , which even during communist times had been a hub for the micro-electronic industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amd opened its largest semi-conductor plant outside the us in dresden in 1999 wages are lower in saxony than in western germany , as is the case in all five new states .
the labor market is also more flexible and cities with major universities , like dresden in saxony , have highly qualified specialists . amd manager hans deppe has n't regretted the move to saxony and has a positive outlook on the future , in spite of challenging market conditions . competition on the global market " we face global competition in the semi-conductor industry , which is not limited to just the european union , " deppe said .
" what has been built up in the micro-electronic cluster in saxony has so much potential that we are going to see growth in the future .
i 'm certain of that . " at amd , growth is well underway : the chip producer recently announced plans to invest an additional $ 2.5 billion in its dresden plant .
twenty percent of that will come from the german taxpayers in the form of investment bonuses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxony is one of germany 's 16 federal states state subsidies are yet another alluring aspect of investing in former east germany .
the european union , the federal government and the new german states all seek to attract potential investors by offering investment bonuses and tax breaks . federal government seeks to cut red tape even if the advantages of investment in eastern germany seem to outweigh the disadvantages , there are a few drawbacks the new states will have to resolve if they want to enhance their global competitiveness . issues like recognizing american drivers ' licenses in germany or providing language training for employees are among the less formidable hurdles , but excessive bureaucracy is more critical . " germany still has the reputation of being overly bureaucratic , having too many rules and too much red tape , " tiefensee said .
" that 's something we have to deal with and the federal government is doing that through de-bureaucratizing and by accelerating planning processes .

still , sports doctors are looking to curb kung fu moves and fakers . not only was the 2006 world cup healthy for business in germany , it also proved healthy for the participants , reported the official sports doctors .
with 736 professional soccer players fighting tooth and nail through 64 games for the title , somebody is bound to get hurt . jiri dvorak , head of fifa 's medical department , said there was on average only 2.2 injuries per game this year .
that is considerably fewer than in the 2002 world cup , where the average was 2.7 injuries per game .
for dvorak , it 's " an encouraging decline . " everything 's on tape " after every game we count up all the injuries that occurred .
we get it in writing from the doctors and afterward we watch the tape to see everything that led up to the injury .
then we make a scientific assessment of it , " dvorak said . even minor abrasions and bruises were recorded .
in the 2006 world cup , only one fourth of the total injuries were severe enough that the affected player missed one or more games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was an average of 2.2 injuries per game less than half as many head injuries at the 2002 world cup in japan and korea , elbowing resulted in 25 head injuries , said dvorak .
concerted efforts were made to reduce the number this year . " fifa specifically instructed the referee committee and the referees to penalize incidences of elbowing , " dvorak said . fifa 's chief doctor said he believes the referees ' strict approach contributed to a reduction in head injuries .
only 11 occurred in 2006 , less than half the number of head injuries in 2002 . dvorak attributes the decline in injuries not only to referees but also to more advanced training methods .
the better a team is physically prepared for the championship , the smaller the chances are that the players will sustain injuries . it was for good reason that the fifa insisted on a total of six game-free weeks prior to the world cup . kung fu on the field despite the positive injury statistics , the fifa medical committee has a few recommendations for future soccer events , especially concerning injury simulations that break the flow of play .
team doctors were called to the field 156 times in this world cup , but only 88 of these cases constituted a real injury . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the refs ' dedication to fair play leads to fewer injuries dvorak also said he discovered a new kind of foul this year : " we certainly have to get a handle on the kung fu moves . " the medical committee plans to recommend harsher consequences for players who stick out their leg in the direction of another player 's upper body . in contrast to other sporting events ... the positive - or rather , negative - results of routine doping tests before and during the world cup rounded out the fifa medical report . " about 16 players from each team were tested at a time .
i think we can confidently say that there is no evidence of systematic doping in soccer , " dvorak said . that makes the 2006 world cup the third in a row without a single case of doping . tim brockmeier -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fifa committee responds to referee criticism the referees committee of fifa , world soccer 's governing body , rejected charges of poor officiating during the world cup and added that quality of refereeing has been higher than ever .

the world cup review : success off the field , controversy on it world cup scores goal for german economy the final eleven : the 2006 world cup in numbers world cup 2006 -pipe- 13.07.2006 strict refs and good prep made for fewer world cup injuries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team doctors were called out 156 times in the world cup the fifa medical commission has good news : this year 's world cup saw a dramatic decline in injuries and not a single doping case .
still , sports doctors are looking to curb kung fu moves and fakers . not only was the 2006 world cup healthy for business in germany , it also proved healthy for the participants , reported the official sports doctors .
with 736 professional soccer players fighting tooth and nail through 64 games for the title , somebody is bound to get hurt . jiri dvorak , head of fifa 's medical department , said there was on average only 2.2 injuries per game this year .
that is considerably fewer than in the 2002 world cup , where the average was 2.7 injuries per game .
for dvorak , it 's " an encouraging decline . " everything 's on tape " after every game we count up all the injuries that occurred .
we get it in writing from the doctors and afterward we watch the tape to see everything that led up to the injury .
then we make a scientific assessment of it , " dvorak said . even minor abrasions and bruises were recorded .
in the 2006 world cup , only one fourth of the total injuries were severe enough that the affected player missed one or more games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was an average of 2.2 injuries per game less than half as many head injuries at the 2002 world cup in japan and korea , elbowing resulted in 25 head injuries , said dvorak .
concerted efforts were made to reduce the number this year . " fifa specifically instructed the referee committee and the referees to penalize incidences of elbowing , " dvorak said . fifa 's chief doctor said he believes the referees ' strict approach contributed to a reduction in head injuries .
only 11 occurred in 2006 , less than half the number of head injuries in 2002 . dvorak attributes the decline in injuries not only to referees but also to more advanced training methods .
the better a team is physically prepared for the championship , the smaller the chances are that the players will sustain injuries . it was for good reason that the fifa insisted on a total of six game-free weeks prior to the world cup . kung fu on the field despite the positive injury statistics , the fifa medical committee has a few recommendations for future soccer events , especially concerning injury simulations that break the flow of play .
team doctors were called to the field 156 times in this world cup , but only 88 of these cases constituted a real injury . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the refs ' dedication to fair play leads to fewer injuries dvorak also said he discovered a new kind of foul this year : " we certainly have to get a handle on the kung fu moves . " the medical committee plans to recommend harsher consequences for players who stick out their leg in the direction of another player 's upper body . in contrast to other sporting events ... the positive - or rather , negative - results of routine doping tests before and during the world cup rounded out the fifa medical report . " about 16 players from each team were tested at a time .
i think we can confidently say that there is no evidence of systematic doping in soccer , " dvorak said . that makes the 2006 world cup the third in a row without a single case of doping . tim brockmeier -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fifa committee responds to referee criticism the referees committee of fifa , world soccer 's governing body , rejected charges of poor officiating during the world cup and added that quality of refereeing has been higher than ever .

but a new report says germany is falling behind in recognizing the principle of universal jurisdiction . this is when national courts prosecute grave crimes , even in cases where the victims and the suspected perpetrators are foreign citizens and the crimes took place in a different country .
offenses such as war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity fall into this category . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new study human rights watch 's recent report , " universal jurisdiction in europe : the state of the art , " finds that law-enforcement agencies in many european countries are increasingly willing to investigate and prosecute people suspected of grave international crimes . the report cites the examples of belgium 's national court , which in 2001 and again in 2005 convicted several rwandan citizens for crimes against humanity committed during rwanda 's 1994 civil war . international criminal court prompted the trend jürgen schurr , one of the report 's authors , said the founding of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague in 2002 kick-started the trend to recognize universal jurisdiction . schurr said these changes came about because european countries were legally bound to include in their national criminal code the offenses recognised by the icc . previously in germany , the maximum charge for people suspected of genocide was murder , which severely underestimated the gravity of many crimes , schurr said .

in france , it still is not possible to prosecute war crimes suspects because the offense is not recognized under french national law . both countries also dedicate few resources to investigating crimes of this severity . schurr found this surprising in germany 's case .
from 1993 to 2003 , the center for combating war crimes , based in the federal criminal police office , was actively investigating war crimes from the former yugoslavia .
now there 's only one person responsible for grave crimes , he says . inquiries fail on political grounds the german legal code provides an excellent basis for the prosecution of grave crimes , according to schurr .
but , he says , there is a lack of political will . " the federal prosecutor has been allowed a bigger latitude of judgement , " he said .
in other words , the court " can be , but does n't have to be , active . " schurr pointed to the situation in 2005 when germany 's constitutional court dismissed allegations that us defense secretary donald rumsfeld was responsible for the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal .

" the commission will analyze the ruling very carefully and decide after thorough consideration which consequences to draw , " said spokesman for competition issues jonathan todd . sony and bmg 's parent company , bertelsmann , will now have seven days to formally seek brussels ' permission for the merger , which eu regulators would then have to review again under current market conditions , he said . todd said that if in the hypothetical case that regulators were to rule against the merger , then it " would have to be reversed . " merger created second largest music company bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the merger brought together client lists including stars such as beyonce knowles und christina aguilera in reaction to the court 's decision , bertelsmann said : " today 's judgment does not affect the validity of the sony bmg joint venture , which has been up and running since august 2004 - after having been notified and investigated by the european commission .

" the commission will analyze the ruling very carefully and decide after thorough consideration which consequences to draw , " said spokesman for competition issues jonathan todd . sony and bmg 's parent company , bertelsmann , will now have seven days to formally seek brussels ' permission for the merger , which eu regulators would then have to review again under current market conditions , he said . todd said that if in the hypothetical case that regulators were to rule against the merger , then it " would have to be reversed . " merger created second largest music company bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the merger brought together client lists including stars such as beyonce knowles und christina aguilera in reaction to the court 's decision , bertelsmann said : " today 's judgment does not affect the validity of the sony bmg joint venture , which has been up and running since august 2004 - after having been notified and investigated by the european commission . " " we are studying the judgement carefully and shall discuss the appropriate next steps with the european commission . " the merger of the music business of japanese electronics and entertainment group sony with german media group bertelsmann 's bmg unit created the second-biggest company in the music market after universal . headquartered in new york city and owned equally by sony and bertelsmann , sony bmg has contracts with stars ranging from acdc to zz top , as well as bruce springsteen , oasis and placido domingo . the independent producers ' association impala protested that such a concentration of power would leave the music majors with a stranglehold on cd prices and artists ' contractual terms and asked the court to review the decision . merger approved in 2004 the european commission approved the merger in july 2004 even though it acknowledged that the deal would leave four major players in the market - universal , sony-bmg , warner and emi . the court ruled that the commission 's antitrust busters had carried out an " extremely cursory examination " of the deal . a lawyer for impala voiced satisfaction with the court 's decision , which she said showed that regulators had made " manifest errors . " " for us , the commission committed manifest errors of judgement because it did not do the necessary research to show the absence of a collective dominant position , " the lawyer said . impala has long fought against greater concentration in the music business and recently slammed warner and emi for trying to take each other over . however , the lobbying group 's eagerness for a quick ruling on sony bmg irritated the judges , who ordered it to pay a quarter of the procedure 's costs as a result . the commission and the companies have two months to lodge an appeal against the decision . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : bertelsmann preparing to sell stake in sony bmg german media giant bertelsmann is making preparations to sell its music company holdings including a 50 percent stake in sony bmg , the world 's second-largest music group , a report said monday .

" my biggest concern is whether or not actions taken will weaken the siniora government , " he said , referring to lebanese prime minister fuad siniora .
" democracy in lebanon is an important part of laying a foundation for peace in that region .
we have worked really hard to get syria out of lebanon . " worst violence in a decade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss for angela - bush arrived in stralsund late wednesday the american president was speaking from the eastern german town of stralsund on the baltic coast where he is meeting with german chancellor angela merkel before heading off to the g-8 summit in russia over the weekend . german chancellor angela merkel too called for a " de-escalation " of the conflict in the middle east - the worst cross border violence in a decade - after israeli fighter jets bombed lebanon 's only international airport and killed 28 civilians in a wave of retaliatory strikes over the killing and capture of soldiers by hezbollah guerrillas on wednesday . an israeli woman was also killed when hezbollah fired off a barrage of rockets across the volatile border , sending panicked residents of communities in northern israel into bomb shelters . merkel said the violence had been sparked by the capture of the soldiers , but added : " we can only call on everyone to stop the violence , to release the soldiers and to stop the rocket attacks on israel . " telephone diplomacy bush accused hezbollah and hamas of trying to derail efforts to bring peace to the middle east by creating an independent palestinian state existing side-by-side with israel . " it 's really sad where people are willing to take innocent life to stop that process .
matter of fact , it 's pathetic , " said bush , who has refused to recognize the palestinian government led by hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli warplanes targeted the rafik hariri international airport in beirut " hezbollah does n't want there to be peace , the militant arm of hamas does n't want there to be peace , and those of us who do want peace will continue to work together to encourage peace , " bush said . " there are a group of terrorists who want to stop the advance of peace , and those of us who are peace-loving must work together to help the agents of peace , " he said .
" things looked positive , and terrorists stepped up . " bush said that us secretary of state condoleezza rice had iniatiated telephone diplomacy to try to calm the situation , and added : " i 'll be making calls " as well . the us president said damascus , a patron of hezbollah , must pressure the lebanese militia to free captured israeli soldiers .

" the commission will analyze the ruling very carefully and decide after thorough consideration which consequences to draw , " said spokesman for competition issues jonathan todd . sony and bmg 's parent company , bertelsmann , will now have seven days to formally seek brussels ' permission for the merger , which eu regulators would then have to review again under current market conditions , he said . todd said that if in the hypothetical case that regulators were to rule against the merger , then it " would have to be reversed . " merger created second largest music company bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the merger brought together client lists including stars such as beyonce knowles und christina aguilera in reaction to the court 's decision , bertelsmann said : " today 's judgment does not affect the validity of the sony bmg joint venture , which has been up and running since august 2004 - after having been notified and investigated by the european commission . " " we are studying the judgement carefully and shall discuss the appropriate next steps with the european commission . " the merger of the music business of japanese electronics and entertainment group sony with german media group bertelsmann 's bmg unit created the second-biggest company in the music market after universal . headquartered in new york city and owned equally by sony and bertelsmann , sony bmg has contracts with stars ranging from acdc to zz top , as well as bruce springsteen , oasis and placido domingo . the independent producers ' association impala protested that such a concentration of power would leave the music majors with a stranglehold on cd prices and artists ' contractual terms and asked the court to review the decision . merger approved in 2004 the european commission approved the merger in july 2004 even though it acknowledged that the deal would leave four major players in the market - universal , sony-bmg , warner and emi . the court ruled that the commission 's antitrust busters had carried out an " extremely cursory examination " of the deal . a lawyer for impala voiced satisfaction with the court 's decision , which she said showed that regulators had made " manifest errors . " " for us , the commission committed manifest errors of judgement because it did not do the necessary research to show the absence of a collective dominant position , " the lawyer said . impala has long fought against greater concentration in the music business and recently slammed warner and emi for trying to take each other over . however , the lobbying group 's eagerness for a quick ruling on sony bmg irritated the judges , who ordered it to pay a quarter of the procedure 's costs as a result . the commission and the companies have two months to lodge an appeal against the decision . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : bertelsmann preparing to sell stake in sony bmg german media giant bertelsmann is making preparations to sell its music company holdings including a 50 percent stake in sony bmg , the world 's second-largest music group , a report said monday .

his aim ?
to get to know merkel and other " real germans " better - if only security staff will let him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush pretends to eat an imaginary herring president bush 's stralsund visit got off to a sunny start on thursday when he was formally welcomed in the city square by german chancellor angela merkel .
the president shook hands with the smiling germans in the crowd , then accepted a small ceremonial barrel of herring , miming eating one of the fish in jest . " i bring a message from the american people : we 're honored to call the german people friends and allies , " the us president said .
" america and germany stand side by side . " the president touched down in germany late wednesday in the northern city of rostock en route to the group of eight summit of industrialized nations in st. petersburg , which merkel will also attend . following his welcome in stralsund , bush signed the town 's " golden book " before sitting down with merkel before a fireplace in the town hall for talks .
the two discussed the renewed violence between israel and lebanon , as well as how to respond to iran after it failed to respond to incentives aimed at ending an impassse over its nuclear program . the two-day stop in merkel 's constituency on the baltic sea coast is meant to give the two leaders time to get to know each other better , as well as show bush the " real germany . " during bush 's last visit to germany to the southwestern city of mainz in february 2005 , germans displayed their talent for thoroughness by effectively removing any signs of life from the city 's streets .
bush reportedly said himself that he thought the security precautions were exaggerated .
he is keen for his experience in stralsund to be different . but those in charge of security just ca n't help themselves , it seems .
for days now , helicopters have been circling over the stralsund while security personnel have been busy repeating precautions taken in mainz - welding shut manholes , sealing off letter boxes , and cordoning off the historic town center . will the real germans please stand up ? many locals and tourists in stralsund are less than amused at the way their lives have been turned upside down in order to ensure the safety of merkel 's prominent guest . " look at the shops here in the town center , " one tourist said .
" they 'll all be closed during the president 's stay .
we 're here on holiday and want to have a good time shopping , but they just wo n't let us . " " according to the politicians in berlin , the whole town should be happy to welcome the president , " a resident said .
" but then most of the people here are locked away from the president so as not to present a threat to him .
that does n't make any sense to me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this couple arrived early to meet bush in stralsund 's market square though bush got the desired contact with the locals during thursday 's market square welcome , he met a crowd of handpicked stralsunders who had undergone extensive background checks .
a quarter of the crowd was made up of students from the nearby naval academy .
critics say it was hardly an authentic encounter with the people of stralsund , most of whom - like merkel - experienced life under the communist east german regime and the transition to democracy following reunification .
many say it 's precisely that experience of recent history that makes merkel and her constituency so fascinating to the president . bonding over roast boar the president and the chancellor will have a further chance to bond over a wild game barbecue night in the nearby village of trinwillershagen .
meant to echo the type of informal barbecues the bushes frequently host at their texas ranch , the atmosphere of merkel 's grill party is planned to be " deliberately relaxed " - at least as relaxed as you can be with 12,000 police officers on alert all around you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters are being kept far from the action and , as was the case in mainz last year , bush 's visit to stralsund will also be accompanied by protest rallies .
an estimated 5,000 people intend to demonstrate against the us administration 's foreign policy , and especially , the ongoing conflict in iraq .
but they 'll mainly be protesting for their own satisfaction because just as in mainz , bush is unlikely to see any of the campaigners and protesters , who 've been relegated to the outskirts of the city . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush visit sign of closer us-german relations us president george w. bush heads to german chancellor angela merkel 's constituency in former east germany on thursday for a visit that underlines the improving ties between the two leaders .

it provides europe with an energy alternative to the middle east and russia . on thursday , the three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- baku-tbilisi-ceyhan -lrb- btc -rrb- pipeline project was opened at the turkish mediterranean port .
the event , however , is not only significant for british oil giant bp who is directing the pipeline project . attending the ceremony were leaders from over 20 countries in the region that are expected to profit from oil and gas revenues .
turkey , where the pipeline terminates , has an increasing appetite for energy , but the united states and europe also have a vested interest in the btc project also . " we understand very well the significance of the btc project and we have conducted delicate energy diplomacy for its successful implementation , " said turkish energy minister hilmi guler , adding that the pipeline " will not only bring turkey big economic benefits , but also huge political dividends . " bottlenecks and geopolitical hotspots being avoided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil giants are considering building refineries in ceyhan the 1760-kilometer pipeline , the second-longest in the world , will deliver more than a million barrels of oil per day by 2008 .
the oil comes from the central asian states of kazakhstan and azerbaijan .
the region used to be part of the former soviet union and that is why this pipeline is seen as having not only economic importance but political as well . for the united states , one of the pipeline 's main political backers , it is seen as a crucial step not only to unlocking urgently needed resources but also to giving the energy-rich region greater independence from its former russian master . crucially it avoids the volatile middle east , giving world markets an important alternative supply .
but the pipeline also breaks russia ’ s monopoly on the distribution of energy for former soviet union states . " the pipelines do not only bring energy security they bring hope , " said david gorokva , head of the georgian gas and oil corporation .
" countries like us are not secure despite the fact of the rose revolution , it is all going to die one day if there is no secure energy resources and i think we should take this into consideration . " political implications in caucasus great bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine and russia quarreled over gas prices this winter last winter , russia without warning doubled the prices of energy to both georgia and the ukraine after pro-russian administrations were ousted by mass protests .
russia claimed the price hike simply mirrored market prices , but washington blasted the move accusing moscow of strong-armed tactics .
europe at once felt very dependent on the goodwill of russia . both democratic and republican administrations have strongly backed the new pipeline as a means of breaking moscow 's iron grip on the region .
much to moscow 's irritation , us special forces have been sent to georgia to help protect the pipeline as the region is one of most volatile in the world . russia maintains a strong military presence in the caucasus region , which the pipeline passes through .
the region is strewn with ethnic rivalries and unresolved conflicts .
in georgia , there are two breakaway states , which fought georgian forces to a standstill in the 1990s .
an uneasy ceasefire also exists between neighboring armenia and azerbaijan . bildunterschrift : the pipeline runs through hotspots in the caucasus " this region has always been volatile if you look at the history and it still is and there is big potential for future conflicts , " said tatiana mitrova , an energy security expert and adviser to the russian presidency .
" there are many rivals who want to gain control over the region because it is the heart of eurasia , and it is the future growth road of all energy routes .
but i am afraid that as the whole political tension is getting stronger and stronger , tension in this region will also rise . " the success of the btc pipeline ultimately depends on the stability of one of world 's most volatile regions .
without stability , the long-term dreams of turkey and the us of opening up a secure east-west energy corridor that exports oil and gas and imports independence and security to former soviet states will remain unfulfilled . dorian jones -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe searches for alternatives to russian gas following the gas price row between russia and ukraine , europe is eyeing new pipeline projects and transportation methods to lessen its dependence on deliveries from russia .

" the commission will analyze the ruling very carefully and decide after thorough consideration which consequences to draw , " said spokesman for competition issues jonathan todd . sony and bmg 's parent company , bertelsmann , will now have seven days to formally seek brussels ' permission for the merger , which eu regulators would then have to review again under current market conditions , he said . todd said that if in the hypothetical case that regulators were to rule against the merger , then it " would have to be reversed . " merger created second largest music company bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the merger brought together client lists including stars such as beyonce knowles und christina aguilera in reaction to the court 's decision , bertelsmann said : " today 's judgment does not affect the validity of the sony bmg joint venture , which has been up and running since august 2004 - after having been notified and investigated by the european commission . " " we are studying the judgement carefully and shall discuss the appropriate next steps with the european commission . " the merger of the music business of japanese electronics and entertainment group sony with german media group bertelsmann 's bmg unit created the second-biggest company in the music market after universal . headquartered in new york city and owned equally by sony and bertelsmann , sony bmg has contracts with stars ranging from acdc to zz top , as well as bruce springsteen , oasis and placido domingo . the independent producers ' association impala protested that such a concentration of power would leave the music majors with a stranglehold on cd prices and artists ' contractual terms and asked the court to review the decision . merger approved in 2004 the european commission approved the merger in july 2004 even though it acknowledged that the deal would leave four major players in the market - universal , sony-bmg , warner and emi . the court ruled that the commission 's antitrust busters had carried out an " extremely cursory examination " of the deal . a lawyer for impala voiced satisfaction with the court 's decision , which she said showed that regulators had made " manifest errors . " " for us , the commission committed manifest errors of judgement because it did not do the necessary research to show the absence of a collective dominant position , " the lawyer said . impala has long fought against greater concentration in the music business and recently slammed warner and emi for trying to take each other over . however , the lobbying group 's eagerness for a quick ruling on sony bmg irritated the judges , who ordered it to pay a quarter of the procedure 's costs as a result . the commission and the companies have two months to lodge an appeal against the decision . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : bertelsmann preparing to sell stake in sony bmg german media giant bertelsmann is making preparations to sell its music company holdings including a 50 percent stake in sony bmg , the world 's second-largest music group , a report said monday .

" america and germany stand side by side . " " we share common values and common interests .
we want to work together to keep the peace .
we want to work together to promote freedom .
there 's so much we can do , working together , " he said . the visit was marked by good spirits and humor as bush accepted a small ceremonial barrel of herring and jokingly mimed eating one of the fish . " this is a very good opportunity , indeed , to say a word of thanks , " a beaming merkel said .
" we owe you a big debt of gratitude for being able to finally live within one country in peace and freedom ; one country - germany . " leaders urge restraint in mideast at a joint public appearance later , the two leaders accused the lebanon-based hezbollah movement of sparking some of the worst middle east violence in a decade by abducting israeli soldiers and firing rockets at targets inside israel . bush pointedly defended israel 's " right to defend herself " but urged restraint , saying that " whatever israel does should not weaken " the fragile government of lebanese prime minister fuad siniora . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke rises from an israeli air raid that targeted a bridge in the zahrani region in lebanon " my biggest concern is whether or not actions taken will weaken the siniora government , " he said .
" democracy in lebanon is an important part of laying a foundation for peace in that region . " " the attacks did not start from the israeli side , but from hezbollah 's side , " said merkel .
" we call on the powers in the region to seek to bring about a de-escalation of the situation . " losing patience with iran ? the two leaders jointly warned iran that they were taking the dispute over tehran 's nuclear program to the un security council and urged the islamic republic to freeze sensitive atomic activities as a precondition for talks . " i truly think they 're trying to wait us out .
they think it 's a matter of time before people lose their nerve , " bush said .
" i think they 're going to be disappointed that this coalition is a lot firmer than they think . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad in front of a picture of iran 's ayatollah ali khamenei referring to a decision on wednesday by the five un veto powers and germany to pass the iranian nuclear dossier to the un security council , merkel said time was running out . " we have waited patiently and we have had no workable response from iran .
we have to see what the next steps will be if iran continues to remain silent , " said merkel .
" this may include sanctions . " no lectures for putin the meeting came a day before bush was to head to russia for weekend talks with president vladimir putin and the july 15-17 group of eight summit of industrialized nations . bush said he would not lecture putin publicly when they meet on what washington says is moscow 's backsliding from democracy , but stressed that non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- must be allowed to operate in russia " without intimidation " from the kremlin . " nobody really likes to be lectured a lot .
and , therefore , if you want to be an effective person , what you do n't do is scold the person publicly all the time , " the us president said .
" i 'll be firm in my beliefs in certain democratic institutions , i 'll be firm in my belief about the need for there to be an active civil society , and ngos should be allowed to function in russia without intimidation , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has no plans to lecture putin when he meets him in russia merkel urged russia to ratify the international energy charter giving greater access to pipelines and energy supplies , which she said would provide " greater security " to world energy supplies . " we have different ideas about how a pluralist society , a democratic society ought to work ; that there ought to be a strong opposition is certainly one of the realities of life , " said merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush was looking forward to tucking into this wild boar later in the evening the press conference was not all serious : in response to one reporter 's questions about middle east violence and iran 's nuclear program , bush joked about plans for an evening barbecue with merkel at a neighboring village which was to feature a wild boar caught in the region 's woods .

" my biggest concern is whether or not actions taken will weaken the siniora government , " he said , referring to lebanese prime minister fuad siniora .
" democracy in lebanon is an important part of laying a foundation for peace in that region .
we have worked really hard to get syria out of lebanon . " worst violence in a decade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss for angela - bush arrived in stralsund late wednesday the american president was speaking from the eastern german town of stralsund on the baltic coast where he is meeting with german chancellor angela merkel before heading off to the g-8 summit in russia over the weekend . german chancellor angela merkel too called for a " de-escalation " of the conflict in the middle east - the worst cross border violence in a decade - after israeli fighter jets bombed lebanon 's only international airport and killed 28 civilians in a wave of retaliatory strikes over the killing and capture of soldiers by hezbollah guerrillas on wednesday . an israeli woman was also killed when hezbollah fired off a barrage of rockets across the volatile border , sending panicked residents of communities in northern israel into bomb shelters . merkel said the violence had been sparked by the capture of the soldiers , but added : " we can only call on everyone to stop the violence , to release the soldiers and to stop the rocket attacks on israel . " telephone diplomacy bush accused hezbollah and hamas of trying to derail efforts to bring peace to the middle east by creating an independent palestinian state existing side-by-side with israel . " it 's really sad where people are willing to take innocent life to stop that process .
matter of fact , it 's pathetic , " said bush , who has refused to recognize the palestinian government led by hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli warplanes targeted the rafik hariri international airport in beirut " hezbollah does n't want there to be peace , the militant arm of hamas does n't want there to be peace , and those of us who do want peace will continue to work together to encourage peace , " bush said . " there are a group of terrorists who want to stop the advance of peace , and those of us who are peace-loving must work together to help the agents of peace , " he said .
" things looked positive , and terrorists stepped up . " bush said that us secretary of state condoleezza rice had iniatiated telephone diplomacy to try to calm the situation , and added : " i 'll be making calls " as well . the us president said damascus , a patron of hezbollah , must pressure the lebanese militia to free captured israeli soldiers . " syria needs to be held to account " over a dramatic escalation of violence in the middle east , " bush said .
president assad needs to show some leadership towards peace . " france , russia slam israel 's actions the eu ’ s 25 foreign ministers are meeting next monday to discuss the middle east peace plan which is essentially only a piece of paper at this point .
as part of the so-called middle east peace quartet , the bloc has spent years trying to move the process along but is now unsure how to position itself in the current crisis . one group of eu countries , including the uk , belgium , italy and germany , which had been reluctant to openly criticise israel finally did so on thursday saying it was using excessive force in lebanon .
france is one of the countries which has taken an even sharper tone publicly about the israeli retaliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : douste-blazy has used strong language to condemn israeli bombardment of lebanon french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said on europe 1 radio on thursday that israel 's bombardment of lebanon was " an act of war " .
he added that israel " runs the risk of plunging lebanon back into the worst years of war . " the russian ministry said it supported lebanon 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , but also condemned the abduction of israeli soldiers by hezbollah and palestinian militants .
" acts of terrorism are completely unacceptable , " the statement said . italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema called israel 's actions in the palestinian territories " counterproductive . " un weighs in un secretary-general kofi annan has decided to send a three-person team to the middle east to urge all parties to exercise restraint and help defuse the major crisis in the region . the team will first visit cairo to meet with egyptian officials and consult with arab league foreign ministers meeting there on saturday .

his aim ?
to get to know merkel and other " real germans " better - if only security staff will let him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush pretends to eat an imaginary herring president bush 's stralsund visit got off to a sunny start on thursday when he was formally welcomed in the city square by german chancellor angela merkel .
the president shook hands with the smiling germans in the crowd , then accepted a small ceremonial barrel of herring , miming eating one of the fish in jest . " i bring a message from the american people : we 're honored to call the german people friends and allies , " the us president said .
" america and germany stand side by side . " the president touched down in germany late wednesday in the northern city of rostock en route to the group of eight summit of industrialized nations in st. petersburg , which merkel will also attend . following his welcome in stralsund , bush signed the town 's " golden book " before sitting down with merkel before a fireplace in the town hall for talks .
the two discussed the renewed violence between israel and lebanon , as well as how to respond to iran after it failed to respond to incentives aimed at ending an impassse over its nuclear program . the two-day stop in merkel 's constituency on the baltic sea coast is meant to give the two leaders time to get to know each other better , as well as show bush the " real germany . " during bush 's last visit to germany to the southwestern city of mainz in february 2005 , germans displayed their talent for thoroughness by effectively removing any signs of life from the city 's streets .
bush reportedly said himself that he thought the security precautions were exaggerated .
he is keen for his experience in stralsund to be different . but those in charge of security just ca n't help themselves , it seems .
for days now , helicopters have been circling over the stralsund while security personnel have been busy repeating precautions taken in mainz - welding shut manholes , sealing off letter boxes , and cordoning off the historic town center . will the real germans please stand up ? many locals and tourists in stralsund are less than amused at the way their lives have been turned upside down in order to ensure the safety of merkel 's prominent guest . " look at the shops here in the town center , " one tourist said .
" they 'll all be closed during the president 's stay .
we 're here on holiday and want to have a good time shopping , but they just wo n't let us . " " according to the politicians in berlin , the whole town should be happy to welcome the president , " a resident said .
" but then most of the people here are locked away from the president so as not to present a threat to him .
that does n't make any sense to me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this couple arrived early to meet bush in stralsund 's market square though bush got the desired contact with the locals during thursday 's market square welcome , he met a crowd of handpicked stralsunders who had undergone extensive background checks .
a quarter of the crowd was made up of students from the nearby naval academy .
critics say it was hardly an authentic encounter with the people of stralsund , most of whom - like merkel - experienced life under the communist east german regime and the transition to democracy following reunification .
many say it 's precisely that experience of recent history that makes merkel and her constituency so fascinating to the president . bonding over roast boar the president and the chancellor will have a further chance to bond over a wild game barbecue night in the nearby village of trinwillershagen .
meant to echo the type of informal barbecues the bushes frequently host at their texas ranch , the atmosphere of merkel 's grill party is planned to be " deliberately relaxed " - at least as relaxed as you can be with 12,000 police officers on alert all around you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters are being kept far from the action and , as was the case in mainz last year , bush 's visit to stralsund will also be accompanied by protest rallies .
an estimated 5,000 people intend to demonstrate against the us administration 's foreign policy , and especially , the ongoing conflict in iraq .
but they 'll mainly be protesting for their own satisfaction because just as in mainz , bush is unlikely to see any of the campaigners and protesters , who 've been relegated to the outskirts of the city . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush visit sign of closer us-german relations us president george w. bush heads to german chancellor angela merkel 's constituency in former east germany on thursday for a visit that underlines the improving ties between the two leaders .

to get to know merkel and other " real germans " better - if only security staff will let him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush pretends to eat an imaginary herring president bush 's stralsund visit got off to a sunny start on thursday when he was formally welcomed in the city square by german chancellor angela merkel .
the president shook hands with the smiling germans in the crowd , then accepted a small ceremonial barrel of herring , miming eating one of the fish in jest . " i bring a message from the american people : we 're honored to call the german people friends and allies , " the us president said .
" america and germany stand side by side . " the president touched down in germany late wednesday in the northern city of rostock en route to the group of eight summit of industrialized nations in st. petersburg , which merkel will also attend . following his welcome in stralsund , bush signed the town 's " golden book " before sitting down with merkel before a fireplace in the town hall for talks .
the two discussed the renewed violence between israel and lebanon , as well as how to respond to iran after it failed to respond to incentives aimed at ending an impassse over its nuclear program . the two-day stop in merkel 's constituency on the baltic sea coast is meant to give the two leaders time to get to know each other better , as well as show bush the " real germany . " during bush 's last visit to germany to the southwestern city of mainz in february 2005 , germans displayed their talent for thoroughness by effectively removing any signs of life from the city 's streets .
bush reportedly said himself that he thought the security precautions were exaggerated .
he is keen for his experience in stralsund to be different . but those in charge of security just ca n't help themselves , it seems .
for days now , helicopters have been circling over the stralsund while security personnel have been busy repeating precautions taken in mainz - welding shut manholes , sealing off letter boxes , and cordoning off the historic town center . will the real germans please stand up ? many locals and tourists in stralsund are less than amused at the way their lives have been turned upside down in order to ensure the safety of merkel 's prominent guest . " look at the shops here in the town center , " one tourist said .
" they 'll all be closed during the president 's stay .
we 're here on holiday and want to have a good time shopping , but they just wo n't let us . " " according to the politicians in berlin , the whole town should be happy to welcome the president , " a resident said .
" but then most of the people here are locked away from the president so as not to present a threat to him .
that does n't make any sense to me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this couple arrived early to meet bush in stralsund 's market square though bush got the desired contact with the locals during thursday 's market square welcome , he met a crowd of handpicked stralsunders who had undergone extensive background checks .
a quarter of the crowd was made up of students from the nearby naval academy .
critics say it was hardly an authentic encounter with the people of stralsund , most of whom - like merkel - experienced life under the communist east german regime and the transition to democracy following reunification .
many say it 's precisely that experience of recent history that makes merkel and her constituency so fascinating to the president . bonding over roast boar the president and the chancellor will have a further chance to bond over a wild game barbecue night in the nearby village of trinwillershagen .
meant to echo the type of informal barbecues the bushes frequently host at their texas ranch , the atmosphere of merkel 's grill party is planned to be " deliberately relaxed " - at least as relaxed as you can be with 12,000 police officers on alert all around you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters are being kept far from the action and , as was the case in mainz last year , bush 's visit to stralsund will also be accompanied by protest rallies .
an estimated 5,000 people intend to demonstrate against the us administration 's foreign policy , and especially , the ongoing conflict in iraq .
but they 'll mainly be protesting for their own satisfaction because just as in mainz , bush is unlikely to see any of the campaigners and protesters , who 've been relegated to the outskirts of the city . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush visit sign of closer us-german relations us president george w. bush heads to german chancellor angela merkel 's constituency in former east germany on thursday for a visit that underlines the improving ties between the two leaders .

" my biggest concern is whether or not actions taken will weaken the siniora government , " he said , referring to lebanese prime minister fuad siniora .
" democracy in lebanon is an important part of laying a foundation for peace in that region .
we have worked really hard to get syria out of lebanon . " worst violence in a decade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss for angela - bush arrived in stralsund late wednesday the american president was speaking from the eastern german town of stralsund on the baltic coast where he is meeting with german chancellor angela merkel before heading off to the g-8 summit in russia over the weekend . german chancellor angela merkel too called for a " de-escalation " of the conflict in the middle east - the worst cross border violence in a decade - after israeli fighter jets bombed lebanon 's only international airport and killed 28 civilians in a wave of retaliatory strikes over the killing and capture of soldiers by hezbollah guerrillas on wednesday . an israeli woman was also killed when hezbollah fired off a barrage of rockets across the volatile border , sending panicked residents of communities in northern israel into bomb shelters . merkel said the violence had been sparked by the capture of the soldiers , but added : " we can only call on everyone to stop the violence , to release the soldiers and to stop the rocket attacks on israel . " telephone diplomacy bush accused hezbollah and hamas of trying to derail efforts to bring peace to the middle east by creating an independent palestinian state existing side-by-side with israel . " it 's really sad where people are willing to take innocent life to stop that process .
matter of fact , it 's pathetic , " said bush , who has refused to recognize the palestinian government led by hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli warplanes targeted the rafik hariri international airport in beirut " hezbollah does n't want there to be peace , the militant arm of hamas does n't want there to be peace , and those of us who do want peace will continue to work together to encourage peace , " bush said .

it provides europe with an energy alternative to the middle east and russia . on thursday , the three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- baku-tbilisi-ceyhan -lrb- btc -rrb- pipeline project was opened at the turkish mediterranean port .
the event , however , is not only significant for british oil giant bp who is directing the pipeline project . attending the ceremony were leaders from over 20 countries in the region that are expected to profit from oil and gas revenues .
turkey , where the pipeline terminates , has an increasing appetite for energy , but the united states and europe also have a vested interest in the btc project also . " we understand very well the significance of the btc project and we have conducted delicate energy diplomacy for its successful implementation , " said turkish energy minister hilmi guler , adding that the pipeline " will not only bring turkey big economic benefits , but also huge political dividends . " bottlenecks and geopolitical hotspots being avoided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil giants are considering building refineries in ceyhan the 1760-kilometer pipeline , the second-longest in the world , will deliver more than a million barrels of oil per day by 2008 .
the oil comes from the central asian states of kazakhstan and azerbaijan .
the region used to be part of the former soviet union and that is why this pipeline is seen as having not only economic importance but political as well . for the united states , one of the pipeline 's main political backers , it is seen as a crucial step not only to unlocking urgently needed resources but also to giving the energy-rich region greater independence from its former russian master . crucially it avoids the volatile middle east , giving world markets an important alternative supply .
but the pipeline also breaks russia ’ s monopoly on the distribution of energy for former soviet union states . " the pipelines do not only bring energy security they bring hope , " said david gorokva , head of the georgian gas and oil corporation .

europe at once felt very dependent on the goodwill of russia . both democratic and republican administrations have strongly backed the new pipeline as a means of breaking moscow 's iron grip on the region .
much to moscow 's irritation , us special forces have been sent to georgia to help protect the pipeline as the region is one of most volatile in the world . russia maintains a strong military presence in the caucasus region , which the pipeline passes through .
the region is strewn with ethnic rivalries and unresolved conflicts .

an uneasy ceasefire also exists between neighboring armenia and azerbaijan . bildunterschrift : the pipeline runs through hotspots in the caucasus " this region has always been volatile if you look at the history and it still is and there is big potential for future conflicts , " said tatiana mitrova , an energy security expert and adviser to the russian presidency .
" there are many rivals who want to gain control over the region because it is the heart of eurasia , and it is the future growth road of all energy routes .
but i am afraid that as the whole political tension is getting stronger and stronger , tension in this region will also rise . " the success of the btc pipeline ultimately depends on the stability of one of world 's most volatile regions .

his aim ?
to get to know merkel and other " real germans " better - if only security staff will let him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush pretends to eat an imaginary herring president bush 's stralsund visit got off to a sunny start on thursday when he was formally welcomed in the city square by german chancellor angela merkel .
the president shook hands with the smiling germans in the crowd , then accepted a small ceremonial barrel of herring , miming eating one of the fish in jest . " i bring a message from the american people : we 're honored to call the german people friends and allies , " the us president said .
" america and germany stand side by side . " the president touched down in germany late wednesday in the northern city of rostock en route to the group of eight summit of industrialized nations in st. petersburg , which merkel will also attend . following his welcome in stralsund , bush signed the town 's " golden book " before sitting down with merkel before a fireplace in the town hall for talks .
the two discussed the renewed violence between israel and lebanon , as well as how to respond to iran after it failed to respond to incentives aimed at ending an impassse over its nuclear program . the two-day stop in merkel 's constituency on the baltic sea coast is meant to give the two leaders time to get to know each other better , as well as show bush the " real germany . " during bush 's last visit to germany to the southwestern city of mainz in february 2005 , germans displayed their talent for thoroughness by effectively removing any signs of life from the city 's streets .
bush reportedly said himself that he thought the security precautions were exaggerated .
he is keen for his experience in stralsund to be different . but those in charge of security just ca n't help themselves , it seems .
for days now , helicopters have been circling over the stralsund while security personnel have been busy repeating precautions taken in mainz - welding shut manholes , sealing off letter boxes , and cordoning off the historic town center . will the real germans please stand up ? many locals and tourists in stralsund are less than amused at the way their lives have been turned upside down in order to ensure the safety of merkel 's prominent guest . " look at the shops here in the town center , " one tourist said .
" they 'll all be closed during the president 's stay .
we 're here on holiday and want to have a good time shopping , but they just wo n't let us . " " according to the politicians in berlin , the whole town should be happy to welcome the president , " a resident said .
" but then most of the people here are locked away from the president so as not to present a threat to him .
that does n't make any sense to me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this couple arrived early to meet bush in stralsund 's market square though bush got the desired contact with the locals during thursday 's market square welcome , he met a crowd of handpicked stralsunders who had undergone extensive background checks .
a quarter of the crowd was made up of students from the nearby naval academy .
critics say it was hardly an authentic encounter with the people of stralsund , most of whom - like merkel - experienced life under the communist east german regime and the transition to democracy following reunification .
many say it 's precisely that experience of recent history that makes merkel and her constituency so fascinating to the president . bonding over roast boar the president and the chancellor will have a further chance to bond over a wild game barbecue night in the nearby village of trinwillershagen .
meant to echo the type of informal barbecues the bushes frequently host at their texas ranch , the atmosphere of merkel 's grill party is planned to be " deliberately relaxed " - at least as relaxed as you can be with 12,000 police officers on alert all around you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters are being kept far from the action and , as was the case in mainz last year , bush 's visit to stralsund will also be accompanied by protest rallies .
an estimated 5,000 people intend to demonstrate against the us administration 's foreign policy , and especially , the ongoing conflict in iraq .
but they 'll mainly be protesting for their own satisfaction because just as in mainz , bush is unlikely to see any of the campaigners and protesters , who 've been relegated to the outskirts of the city . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush visit sign of closer us-german relations us president george w. bush heads to german chancellor angela merkel 's constituency in former east germany on thursday for a visit that underlines the improving ties between the two leaders .

that is considerably fewer than in the 2002 world cup , where the average was 2.7 injuries per game .
for dvorak , it 's " an encouraging decline . " everything 's on tape " after every game we count up all the injuries that occurred .
we get it in writing from the doctors and afterward we watch the tape to see everything that led up to the injury .
then we make a scientific assessment of it , " dvorak said . even minor abrasions and bruises were recorded .

only 11 occurred in 2006 , less than half the number of head injuries in 2002 . dvorak attributes the decline in injuries not only to referees but also to more advanced training methods .

but a new report says germany is falling behind in recognizing the principle of universal jurisdiction . this is when national courts prosecute grave crimes , even in cases where the victims and the suspected perpetrators are foreign citizens and the crimes took place in a different country .
offenses such as war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity fall into this category . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new study human rights watch 's recent report , " universal jurisdiction in europe : the state of the art , " finds that law-enforcement agencies in many european countries are increasingly willing to investigate and prosecute people suspected of grave international crimes . the report cites the examples of belgium 's national court , which in 2001 and again in 2005 convicted several rwandan citizens for crimes against humanity committed during rwanda 's 1994 civil war . international criminal court prompted the trend jürgen schurr , one of the report 's authors , said the founding of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague in 2002 kick-started the trend to recognize universal jurisdiction . schurr said these changes came about because european countries were legally bound to include in their national criminal code the offenses recognised by the icc . previously in germany , the maximum charge for people suspected of genocide was murder , which severely underestimated the gravity of many crimes , schurr said .
that situation changed with the introduction of germany 's code of crimes against international law in 2002 . the hrw report takes a close took at eight countries – belgium , denmark , germany , france , great britain , the netherlands , norway and spain . netherlands comes up trumps in hrw report netherlands and great britain receive the most glowing reports .
the dutch law enforcement agency has some 30 employees who work exclusively on international crimes cases . " there is a real political will to dedicate resources to allow for the prosecution of these crimes , " schurr said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internationale criminal court although great britain employs only two people to investigate international crimes , they are both placed in the anti-terror department of london 's metropolitan police .
the investigators have access to the department 's extensive resources and 300 staff members . germany , france lagging behind germany and france receive bad marks in the hrw report .
in france , it still is not possible to prosecute war crimes suspects because the offense is not recognized under french national law . both countries also dedicate few resources to investigating crimes of this severity . schurr found this surprising in germany 's case .
from 1993 to 2003 , the center for combating war crimes , based in the federal criminal police office , was actively investigating war crimes from the former yugoslavia .
now there 's only one person responsible for grave crimes , he says . inquiries fail on political grounds the german legal code provides an excellent basis for the prosecution of grave crimes , according to schurr .
but , he says , there is a lack of political will . " the federal prosecutor has been allowed a bigger latitude of judgement , " he said .
in other words , the court " can be , but does n't have to be , active . " schurr pointed to the situation in 2005 when germany 's constitutional court dismissed allegations that us defense secretary donald rumsfeld was responsible for the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal .
federal prosecutor kay nehm said german authorities could only pursue the case if us authorities refused to do so . new imperialism ? not everyone believes that the principle of universal jurisdiction is progressive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian tomuschat christian tomuschat , emeritus professor for human rights at berlin 's humboldt university , agreed that some countries have made " in-roads " and have even tried and sentenced war crime perpetrators .
but in reality , the concept is controversial , he said . tomuschat used the example of belgium , which he said seems to have laid claimed to the right to try international crimes at a national level . " that is presumptuous , and could be viewed by other countries as a new type of imperialism , " he said . tomuschat said the national prosecution of crimes against humanity or genocide should only be used as " a last resort .

the world cup review : success off the field , controversy on it world cup scores goal for german economy the final eleven : the 2006 world cup in numbers world cup 2006 -pipe- 13.07.2006 strict refs and good prep made for fewer world cup injuries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team doctors were called out 156 times in the world cup the fifa medical commission has good news : this year 's world cup saw a dramatic decline in injuries and not a single doping case .
still , sports doctors are looking to curb kung fu moves and fakers . not only was the 2006 world cup healthy for business in germany , it also proved healthy for the participants , reported the official sports doctors .
with 736 professional soccer players fighting tooth and nail through 64 games for the title , somebody is bound to get hurt . jiri dvorak , head of fifa 's medical department , said there was on average only 2.2 injuries per game this year .
that is considerably fewer than in the 2002 world cup , where the average was 2.7 injuries per game .
for dvorak , it 's " an encouraging decline . " everything 's on tape " after every game we count up all the injuries that occurred .
we get it in writing from the doctors and afterward we watch the tape to see everything that led up to the injury .
then we make a scientific assessment of it , " dvorak said . even minor abrasions and bruises were recorded .
in the 2006 world cup , only one fourth of the total injuries were severe enough that the affected player missed one or more games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was an average of 2.2 injuries per game less than half as many head injuries at the 2002 world cup in japan and korea , elbowing resulted in 25 head injuries , said dvorak .
concerted efforts were made to reduce the number this year . " fifa specifically instructed the referee committee and the referees to penalize incidences of elbowing , " dvorak said . fifa 's chief doctor said he believes the referees ' strict approach contributed to a reduction in head injuries .
only 11 occurred in 2006 , less than half the number of head injuries in 2002 . dvorak attributes the decline in injuries not only to referees but also to more advanced training methods .
the better a team is physically prepared for the championship , the smaller the chances are that the players will sustain injuries . it was for good reason that the fifa insisted on a total of six game-free weeks prior to the world cup . kung fu on the field despite the positive injury statistics , the fifa medical committee has a few recommendations for future soccer events , especially concerning injury simulations that break the flow of play .
team doctors were called to the field 156 times in this world cup , but only 88 of these cases constituted a real injury . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the refs ' dedication to fair play leads to fewer injuries dvorak also said he discovered a new kind of foul this year : " we certainly have to get a handle on the kung fu moves . " the medical committee plans to recommend harsher consequences for players who stick out their leg in the direction of another player 's upper body . in contrast to other sporting events ... the positive - or rather , negative - results of routine doping tests before and during the world cup rounded out the fifa medical report . " about 16 players from each team were tested at a time .
i think we can confidently say that there is no evidence of systematic doping in soccer , " dvorak said . that makes the 2006 world cup the third in a row without a single case of doping . tim brockmeier -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fifa committee responds to referee criticism the referees committee of fifa , world soccer 's governing body , rejected charges of poor officiating during the world cup and added that quality of refereeing has been higher than ever .

the investigators have access to the department 's extensive resources and 300 staff members . germany , france lagging behind germany and france receive bad marks in the hrw report .
in france , it still is not possible to prosecute war crimes suspects because the offense is not recognized under french national law . both countries also dedicate few resources to investigating crimes of this severity . schurr found this surprising in germany 's case .
from 1993 to 2003 , the center for combating war crimes , based in the federal criminal police office , was actively investigating war crimes from the former yugoslavia .
now there 's only one person responsible for grave crimes , he says . inquiries fail on political grounds the german legal code provides an excellent basis for the prosecution of grave crimes , according to schurr .
but , he says , there is a lack of political will . " the federal prosecutor has been allowed a bigger latitude of judgement , " he said .
in other words , the court " can be , but does n't have to be , active . " schurr pointed to the situation in 2005 when germany 's constitutional court dismissed allegations that us defense secretary donald rumsfeld was responsible for the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal .
federal prosecutor kay nehm said german authorities could only pursue the case if us authorities refused to do so . new imperialism ? not everyone believes that the principle of universal jurisdiction is progressive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian tomuschat christian tomuschat , emeritus professor for human rights at berlin 's humboldt university , agreed that some countries have made " in-roads " and have even tried and sentenced war crime perpetrators .
but in reality , the concept is controversial , he said . tomuschat used the example of belgium , which he said seems to have laid claimed to the right to try international crimes at a national level . " that is presumptuous , and could be viewed by other countries as a new type of imperialism , " he said . tomuschat said the national prosecution of crimes against humanity or genocide should only be used as " a last resort .

still , sports doctors are looking to curb kung fu moves and fakers . not only was the 2006 world cup healthy for business in germany , it also proved healthy for the participants , reported the official sports doctors .
with 736 professional soccer players fighting tooth and nail through 64 games for the title , somebody is bound to get hurt . jiri dvorak , head of fifa 's medical department , said there was on average only 2.2 injuries per game this year .
that is considerably fewer than in the 2002 world cup , where the average was 2.7 injuries per game .
for dvorak , it 's " an encouraging decline . " everything 's on tape " after every game we count up all the injuries that occurred .
we get it in writing from the doctors and afterward we watch the tape to see everything that led up to the injury .
then we make a scientific assessment of it , " dvorak said . even minor abrasions and bruises were recorded .
in the 2006 world cup , only one fourth of the total injuries were severe enough that the affected player missed one or more games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was an average of 2.2 injuries per game less than half as many head injuries at the 2002 world cup in japan and korea , elbowing resulted in 25 head injuries , said dvorak .
concerted efforts were made to reduce the number this year . " fifa specifically instructed the referee committee and the referees to penalize incidences of elbowing , " dvorak said . fifa 's chief doctor said he believes the referees ' strict approach contributed to a reduction in head injuries .
only 11 occurred in 2006 , less than half the number of head injuries in 2002 . dvorak attributes the decline in injuries not only to referees but also to more advanced training methods .
the better a team is physically prepared for the championship , the smaller the chances are that the players will sustain injuries . it was for good reason that the fifa insisted on a total of six game-free weeks prior to the world cup . kung fu on the field despite the positive injury statistics , the fifa medical committee has a few recommendations for future soccer events , especially concerning injury simulations that break the flow of play .
team doctors were called to the field 156 times in this world cup , but only 88 of these cases constituted a real injury . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the refs ' dedication to fair play leads to fewer injuries dvorak also said he discovered a new kind of foul this year : " we certainly have to get a handle on the kung fu moves . " the medical committee plans to recommend harsher consequences for players who stick out their leg in the direction of another player 's upper body . in contrast to other sporting events ... the positive - or rather , negative - results of routine doping tests before and during the world cup rounded out the fifa medical report . " about 16 players from each team were tested at a time .

and no , klinsi did n't perform a miracle by getting germany 's soccer team into third place at the world cup . the connection between the two is more mundane than that - it 's their cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-born pope 's former car last year , the golf that the german-born pope used to drive when he held the lesser position of cardinal ratzinger , sold on online bidding site ebay for the princely sum of nearly 190,000 euros . but although klinsi might be up there with god for some germans at the moment , it does n't mean besotted fans are ready to fork out quite so much for his vw beetle convertible .
after 68 bids on ebay , the car was passed in on tuesday night after the highest offer of 24,850 euros -lrb- $ 31,600 -rrb- lay underneath the undisclosed minimum price weekend bidding frenzy " not serious " at one stage over the weekend , it appeared that klinsmann devotees had gone completely nuts as the price spiralled to over 300,000 euros for a car that klinsmann himself said was a rust bucket .
but then ebay shut down the site because of what they said was " unserious bidding " and forced people to specially register for the auction . it 's uncertain if the current owner , who brought klinsmann 's beetle ten years ago from a dealer , is going to put the 39-year-old car back up for sale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann broke more than a few hearts when he stepped down as national coach this week but german soccer fans who are crying in their beer because they missed out on klinsi 's car , need n't worry .

it provides europe with an energy alternative to the middle east and russia . on thursday , the three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- baku-tbilisi-ceyhan -lrb- btc -rrb- pipeline project was opened at the turkish mediterranean port .
the event , however , is not only significant for british oil giant bp who is directing the pipeline project . attending the ceremony were leaders from over 20 countries in the region that are expected to profit from oil and gas revenues .
turkey , where the pipeline terminates , has an increasing appetite for energy , but the united states and europe also have a vested interest in the btc project also . " we understand very well the significance of the btc project and we have conducted delicate energy diplomacy for its successful implementation , " said turkish energy minister hilmi guler , adding that the pipeline " will not only bring turkey big economic benefits , but also huge political dividends .

the oil comes from the central asian states of kazakhstan and azerbaijan .
the region used to be part of the former soviet union and that is why this pipeline is seen as having not only economic importance but political as well . for the united states , one of the pipeline 's main political backers , it is seen as a crucial step not only to unlocking urgently needed resources but also to giving the energy-rich region greater independence from its former russian master . crucially it avoids the volatile middle east , giving world markets an important alternative supply .
but the pipeline also breaks russia ’ s monopoly on the distribution of energy for former soviet union states . " the pipelines do not only bring energy security they bring hope , " said david gorokva , head of the georgian gas and oil corporation .

europe at once felt very dependent on the goodwill of russia . both democratic and republican administrations have strongly backed the new pipeline as a means of breaking moscow 's iron grip on the region .
much to moscow 's irritation , us special forces have been sent to georgia to help protect the pipeline as the region is one of most volatile in the world . russia maintains a strong military presence in the caucasus region , which the pipeline passes through .
the region is strewn with ethnic rivalries and unresolved conflicts .
in georgia , there are two breakaway states , which fought georgian forces to a standstill in the 1990s .
an uneasy ceasefire also exists between neighboring armenia and azerbaijan . bildunterschrift : the pipeline runs through hotspots in the caucasus " this region has always been volatile if you look at the history and it still is and there is big potential for future conflicts , " said tatiana mitrova , an energy security expert and adviser to the russian presidency .
" there are many rivals who want to gain control over the region because it is the heart of eurasia , and it is the future growth road of all energy routes .
but i am afraid that as the whole political tension is getting stronger and stronger , tension in this region will also rise . " the success of the btc pipeline ultimately depends on the stability of one of world 's most volatile regions .

us companies are bringing funds and much needed jobs to the former communist region . president george bush on thursday is visiting angela merkel in stralsund on the baltic sea .
the german chancellor invited her american counterpart to her own electoral district in eastern germany , in part so he could form his own impressions of the " new " states nearly 16 years after german reunification . though unemployment is still uncomfortably high in the east - between 20 and 30 percent in stralsund - bush 's countrymen and women have been playing a significant role in the recovery of the eastern german economy .
american investors are attracted to the central european region , primarily because of its opportune geographical location , and numerous american companies have written their success stories there . billions from the us since reunification " the us is the most important investor in the east german states , " said the american ambassador to germany , william r. timken .
" american companies employ nearly 40,000 people there and we americans are an important part of the eastern german economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet auction site e-bay is a california based company that has put down roots in east germany after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 and german reunification in 1990 , around 400 american companies set up shop in former east germany - from dow chemical , e-bay and general motors to coca-cola , goodyear and smaller businesses , too . american companies have since invested a total of 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.7 billion -rrb- in the east german economy . gateway to the east its proximity to new eastern european , southeastern european and asian markets makes former east germany particularly attractive to american investors , said wolfgang tiefensee , federal minister for the new german states . " the new german states serve as a gateway to these new markets for the investors , " he said . however , geography is not the only plus to investing in former east germany . " germany offers security : legal security and financial security for the investment , " tiefensee said .
" and that gives it an advantage over other countries . " us chip maker in saxony 's micro-electronic cluster amd , the world 's leading producer of computer chips next to intel , is one of the american companies that have invested in eastern germany .
they came to saxony , which even during communist times had been a hub for the micro-electronic industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amd opened its largest semi-conductor plant outside the us in dresden in 1999 wages are lower in saxony than in western germany , as is the case in all five new states .
the labor market is also more flexible and cities with major universities , like dresden in saxony , have highly qualified specialists . amd manager hans deppe has n't regretted the move to saxony and has a positive outlook on the future , in spite of challenging market conditions . competition on the global market " we face global competition in the semi-conductor industry , which is not limited to just the european union , " deppe said .
" what has been built up in the micro-electronic cluster in saxony has so much potential that we are going to see growth in the future .
i 'm certain of that . " at amd , growth is well underway : the chip producer recently announced plans to invest an additional $ 2.5 billion in its dresden plant .
twenty percent of that will come from the german taxpayers in the form of investment bonuses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxony is one of germany 's 16 federal states state subsidies are yet another alluring aspect of investing in former east germany .
the european union , the federal government and the new german states all seek to attract potential investors by offering investment bonuses and tax breaks . federal government seeks to cut red tape even if the advantages of investment in eastern germany seem to outweigh the disadvantages , there are a few drawbacks the new states will have to resolve if they want to enhance their global competitiveness . issues like recognizing american drivers ' licenses in germany or providing language training for employees are among the less formidable hurdles , but excessive bureaucracy is more critical . " germany still has the reputation of being overly bureaucratic , having too many rules and too much red tape , " tiefensee said .
" that 's something we have to deal with and the federal government is doing that through de-bureaucratizing and by accelerating planning processes .

it provides europe with an energy alternative to the middle east and russia . on thursday , the three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- baku-tbilisi-ceyhan -lrb- btc -rrb- pipeline project was opened at the turkish mediterranean port .
the event , however , is not only significant for british oil giant bp who is directing the pipeline project . attending the ceremony were leaders from over 20 countries in the region that are expected to profit from oil and gas revenues .
turkey , where the pipeline terminates , has an increasing appetite for energy , but the united states and europe also have a vested interest in the btc project also . " we understand very well the significance of the btc project and we have conducted delicate energy diplomacy for its successful implementation , " said turkish energy minister hilmi guler , adding that the pipeline " will not only bring turkey big economic benefits , but also huge political dividends . " bottlenecks and geopolitical hotspots being avoided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil giants are considering building refineries in ceyhan the 1760-kilometer pipeline , the second-longest in the world , will deliver more than a million barrels of oil per day by 2008 .
the oil comes from the central asian states of kazakhstan and azerbaijan .
the region used to be part of the former soviet union and that is why this pipeline is seen as having not only economic importance but political as well . for the united states , one of the pipeline 's main political backers , it is seen as a crucial step not only to unlocking urgently needed resources but also to giving the energy-rich region greater independence from its former russian master . crucially it avoids the volatile middle east , giving world markets an important alternative supply .
but the pipeline also breaks russia ’ s monopoly on the distribution of energy for former soviet union states . " the pipelines do not only bring energy security they bring hope , " said david gorokva , head of the georgian gas and oil corporation .
" countries like us are not secure despite the fact of the rose revolution , it is all going to die one day if there is no secure energy resources and i think we should take this into consideration . " political implications in caucasus great bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine and russia quarreled over gas prices this winter last winter , russia without warning doubled the prices of energy to both georgia and the ukraine after pro-russian administrations were ousted by mass protests .
russia claimed the price hike simply mirrored market prices , but washington blasted the move accusing moscow of strong-armed tactics .
europe at once felt very dependent on the goodwill of russia . both democratic and republican administrations have strongly backed the new pipeline as a means of breaking moscow 's iron grip on the region .
much to moscow 's irritation , us special forces have been sent to georgia to help protect the pipeline as the region is one of most volatile in the world . russia maintains a strong military presence in the caucasus region , which the pipeline passes through .
the region is strewn with ethnic rivalries and unresolved conflicts .
in georgia , there are two breakaway states , which fought georgian forces to a standstill in the 1990s .
an uneasy ceasefire also exists between neighboring armenia and azerbaijan . bildunterschrift : the pipeline runs through hotspots in the caucasus " this region has always been volatile if you look at the history and it still is and there is big potential for future conflicts , " said tatiana mitrova , an energy security expert and adviser to the russian presidency .
" there are many rivals who want to gain control over the region because it is the heart of eurasia , and it is the future growth road of all energy routes .
but i am afraid that as the whole political tension is getting stronger and stronger , tension in this region will also rise . " the success of the btc pipeline ultimately depends on the stability of one of world 's most volatile regions .
without stability , the long-term dreams of turkey and the us of opening up a secure east-west energy corridor that exports oil and gas and imports independence and security to former soviet states will remain unfulfilled . dorian jones -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe searches for alternatives to russian gas following the gas price row between russia and ukraine , europe is eyeing new pipeline projects and transportation methods to lessen its dependence on deliveries from russia .

it provides europe with an energy alternative to the middle east and russia . on thursday , the three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- baku-tbilisi-ceyhan -lrb- btc -rrb- pipeline project was opened at the turkish mediterranean port .
the event , however , is not only significant for british oil giant bp who is directing the pipeline project . attending the ceremony were leaders from over 20 countries in the region that are expected to profit from oil and gas revenues .
turkey , where the pipeline terminates , has an increasing appetite for energy , but the united states and europe also have a vested interest in the btc project also . " we understand very well the significance of the btc project and we have conducted delicate energy diplomacy for its successful implementation , " said turkish energy minister hilmi guler , adding that the pipeline " will not only bring turkey big economic benefits , but also huge political dividends . " bottlenecks and geopolitical hotspots being avoided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil giants are considering building refineries in ceyhan the 1760-kilometer pipeline , the second-longest in the world , will deliver more than a million barrels of oil per day by 2008 .
the oil comes from the central asian states of kazakhstan and azerbaijan .
the region used to be part of the former soviet union and that is why this pipeline is seen as having not only economic importance but political as well . for the united states , one of the pipeline 's main political backers , it is seen as a crucial step not only to unlocking urgently needed resources but also to giving the energy-rich region greater independence from its former russian master . crucially it avoids the volatile middle east , giving world markets an important alternative supply .
but the pipeline also breaks russia ’ s monopoly on the distribution of energy for former soviet union states . " the pipelines do not only bring energy security they bring hope , " said david gorokva , head of the georgian gas and oil corporation .
" countries like us are not secure despite the fact of the rose revolution , it is all going to die one day if there is no secure energy resources and i think we should take this into consideration . " political implications in caucasus great bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine and russia quarreled over gas prices this winter last winter , russia without warning doubled the prices of energy to both georgia and the ukraine after pro-russian administrations were ousted by mass protests .
russia claimed the price hike simply mirrored market prices , but washington blasted the move accusing moscow of strong-armed tactics .
europe at once felt very dependent on the goodwill of russia . both democratic and republican administrations have strongly backed the new pipeline as a means of breaking moscow 's iron grip on the region .
much to moscow 's irritation , us special forces have been sent to georgia to help protect the pipeline as the region is one of most volatile in the world . russia maintains a strong military presence in the caucasus region , which the pipeline passes through .
the region is strewn with ethnic rivalries and unresolved conflicts .
in georgia , there are two breakaway states , which fought georgian forces to a standstill in the 1990s .
an uneasy ceasefire also exists between neighboring armenia and azerbaijan . bildunterschrift : the pipeline runs through hotspots in the caucasus " this region has always been volatile if you look at the history and it still is and there is big potential for future conflicts , " said tatiana mitrova , an energy security expert and adviser to the russian presidency .
" there are many rivals who want to gain control over the region because it is the heart of eurasia , and it is the future growth road of all energy routes .
but i am afraid that as the whole political tension is getting stronger and stronger , tension in this region will also rise . " the success of the btc pipeline ultimately depends on the stability of one of world 's most volatile regions .
without stability , the long-term dreams of turkey and the us of opening up a secure east-west energy corridor that exports oil and gas and imports independence and security to former soviet states will remain unfulfilled . dorian jones -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe searches for alternatives to russian gas following the gas price row between russia and ukraine , europe is eyeing new pipeline projects and transportation methods to lessen its dependence on deliveries from russia .

" my biggest concern is whether or not actions taken will weaken the siniora government , " he said , referring to lebanese prime minister fuad siniora .
" democracy in lebanon is an important part of laying a foundation for peace in that region .
we have worked really hard to get syria out of lebanon . " worst violence in a decade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss for angela - bush arrived in stralsund late wednesday the american president was speaking from the eastern german town of stralsund on the baltic coast where he is meeting with german chancellor angela merkel before heading off to the g-8 summit in russia over the weekend . german chancellor angela merkel too called for a " de-escalation " of the conflict in the middle east - the worst cross border violence in a decade - after israeli fighter jets bombed lebanon 's only international airport and killed 28 civilians in a wave of retaliatory strikes over the killing and capture of soldiers by hezbollah guerrillas on wednesday . an israeli woman was also killed when hezbollah fired off a barrage of rockets across the volatile border , sending panicked residents of communities in northern israel into bomb shelters . merkel said the violence had been sparked by the capture of the soldiers , but added : " we can only call on everyone to stop the violence , to release the soldiers and to stop the rocket attacks on israel . " telephone diplomacy bush accused hezbollah and hamas of trying to derail efforts to bring peace to the middle east by creating an independent palestinian state existing side-by-side with israel . " it 's really sad where people are willing to take innocent life to stop that process .
matter of fact , it 's pathetic , " said bush , who has refused to recognize the palestinian government led by hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli warplanes targeted the rafik hariri international airport in beirut " hezbollah does n't want there to be peace , the militant arm of hamas does n't want there to be peace , and those of us who do want peace will continue to work together to encourage peace , " bush said . " there are a group of terrorists who want to stop the advance of peace , and those of us who are peace-loving must work together to help the agents of peace , " he said .
" things looked positive , and terrorists stepped up . " bush said that us secretary of state condoleezza rice had iniatiated telephone diplomacy to try to calm the situation , and added : " i 'll be making calls " as well . the us president said damascus , a patron of hezbollah , must pressure the lebanese militia to free captured israeli soldiers . " syria needs to be held to account " over a dramatic escalation of violence in the middle east , " bush said .
president assad needs to show some leadership towards peace . " france , russia slam israel 's actions the eu ’ s 25 foreign ministers are meeting next monday to discuss the middle east peace plan which is essentially only a piece of paper at this point .
as part of the so-called middle east peace quartet , the bloc has spent years trying to move the process along but is now unsure how to position itself in the current crisis . one group of eu countries , including the uk , belgium , italy and germany , which had been reluctant to openly criticise israel finally did so on thursday saying it was using excessive force in lebanon .
france is one of the countries which has taken an even sharper tone publicly about the israeli retaliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : douste-blazy has used strong language to condemn israeli bombardment of lebanon french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said on europe 1 radio on thursday that israel 's bombardment of lebanon was " an act of war " .
he added that israel " runs the risk of plunging lebanon back into the worst years of war . " the russian ministry said it supported lebanon 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , but also condemned the abduction of israeli soldiers by hezbollah and palestinian militants .
" acts of terrorism are completely unacceptable , " the statement said . italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema called israel 's actions in the palestinian territories " counterproductive . " un weighs in un secretary-general kofi annan has decided to send a three-person team to the middle east to urge all parties to exercise restraint and help defuse the major crisis in the region . the team will first visit cairo to meet with egyptian officials and consult with arab league foreign ministers meeting there on saturday .

his aim ?
to get to know merkel and other " real germans " better - if only security staff will let him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush pretends to eat an imaginary herring president bush 's stralsund visit got off to a sunny start on thursday when he was formally welcomed in the city square by german chancellor angela merkel .
the president shook hands with the smiling germans in the crowd , then accepted a small ceremonial barrel of herring , miming eating one of the fish in jest . " i bring a message from the american people : we 're honored to call the german people friends and allies , " the us president said .
" america and germany stand side by side . " the president touched down in germany late wednesday in the northern city of rostock en route to the group of eight summit of industrialized nations in st. petersburg , which merkel will also attend . following his welcome in stralsund , bush signed the town 's " golden book " before sitting down with merkel before a fireplace in the town hall for talks .
the two discussed the renewed violence between israel and lebanon , as well as how to respond to iran after it failed to respond to incentives aimed at ending an impassse over its nuclear program . the two-day stop in merkel 's constituency on the baltic sea coast is meant to give the two leaders time to get to know each other better , as well as show bush the " real germany . " during bush 's last visit to germany to the southwestern city of mainz in february 2005 , germans displayed their talent for thoroughness by effectively removing any signs of life from the city 's streets .
bush reportedly said himself that he thought the security precautions were exaggerated .
he is keen for his experience in stralsund to be different . but those in charge of security just ca n't help themselves , it seems .
for days now , helicopters have been circling over the stralsund while security personnel have been busy repeating precautions taken in mainz - welding shut manholes , sealing off letter boxes , and cordoning off the historic town center . will the real germans please stand up ? many locals and tourists in stralsund are less than amused at the way their lives have been turned upside down in order to ensure the safety of merkel 's prominent guest . " look at the shops here in the town center , " one tourist said .
" they 'll all be closed during the president 's stay .
we 're here on holiday and want to have a good time shopping , but they just wo n't let us . " " according to the politicians in berlin , the whole town should be happy to welcome the president , " a resident said .
" but then most of the people here are locked away from the president so as not to present a threat to him .

a quarter of the crowd was made up of students from the nearby naval academy .
critics say it was hardly an authentic encounter with the people of stralsund , most of whom - like merkel - experienced life under the communist east german regime and the transition to democracy following reunification .
many say it 's precisely that experience of recent history that makes merkel and her constituency so fascinating to the president . bonding over roast boar the president and the chancellor will have a further chance to bond over a wild game barbecue night in the nearby village of trinwillershagen .
meant to echo the type of informal barbecues the bushes frequently host at their texas ranch , the atmosphere of merkel 's grill party is planned to be " deliberately relaxed " - at least as relaxed as you can be with 12,000 police officers on alert all around you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters are being kept far from the action and , as was the case in mainz last year , bush 's visit to stralsund will also be accompanied by protest rallies .
an estimated 5,000 people intend to demonstrate against the us administration 's foreign policy , and especially , the ongoing conflict in iraq .

" the commission will analyze the ruling very carefully and decide after thorough consideration which consequences to draw , " said spokesman for competition issues jonathan todd . sony and bmg 's parent company , bertelsmann , will now have seven days to formally seek brussels ' permission for the merger , which eu regulators would then have to review again under current market conditions , he said . todd said that if in the hypothetical case that regulators were to rule against the merger , then it " would have to be reversed .

" " for us , the commission committed manifest errors of judgement because it did not do the necessary research to show the absence of a collective dominant position , " the lawyer said . impala has long fought against greater concentration in the music business and recently slammed warner and emi for trying to take each other over . however , the lobbying group 's eagerness for a quick ruling on sony bmg irritated the judges , who ordered it to pay a quarter of the procedure 's costs as a result . the commission and the companies have two months to lodge an appeal against the decision . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : bertelsmann preparing to sell stake in sony bmg german media giant bertelsmann is making preparations to sell its music company holdings including a 50 percent stake in sony bmg , the world 's second-largest music group , a report said monday .

and no , klinsi did n't perform a miracle by getting germany 's soccer team into third place at the world cup . the connection between the two is more mundane than that - it 's their cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-born pope 's former car last year , the golf that the german-born pope used to drive when he held the lesser position of cardinal ratzinger , sold on online bidding site ebay for the princely sum of nearly 190,000 euros . but although klinsi might be up there with god for some germans at the moment , it does n't mean besotted fans are ready to fork out quite so much for his vw beetle convertible .
after 68 bids on ebay , the car was passed in on tuesday night after the highest offer of 24,850 euros -lrb- $ 31,600 -rrb- lay underneath the undisclosed minimum price weekend bidding frenzy " not serious " at one stage over the weekend , it appeared that klinsmann devotees had gone completely nuts as the price spiralled to over 300,000 euros for a car that klinsmann himself said was a rust bucket .
but then ebay shut down the site because of what they said was " unserious bidding " and forced people to specially register for the auction . it 's uncertain if the current owner , who brought klinsmann 's beetle ten years ago from a dealer , is going to put the 39-year-old car back up for sale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann broke more than a few hearts when he stepped down as national coach this week but german soccer fans who are crying in their beer because they missed out on klinsi 's car , need n't worry .

" the commission will analyze the ruling very carefully and decide after thorough consideration which consequences to draw , " said spokesman for competition issues jonathan todd . sony and bmg 's parent company , bertelsmann , will now have seven days to formally seek brussels ' permission for the merger , which eu regulators would then have to review again under current market conditions , he said . todd said that if in the hypothetical case that regulators were to rule against the merger , then it " would have to be reversed . " merger created second largest music company bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the merger brought together client lists including stars such as beyonce knowles und christina aguilera in reaction to the court 's decision , bertelsmann said : " today 's judgment does not affect the validity of the sony bmg joint venture , which has been up and running since august 2004 - after having been notified and investigated by the european commission . " " we are studying the judgement carefully and shall discuss the appropriate next steps with the european commission . " the merger of the music business of japanese electronics and entertainment group sony with german media group bertelsmann 's bmg unit created the second-biggest company in the music market after universal . headquartered in new york city and owned equally by sony and bertelsmann , sony bmg has contracts with stars ranging from acdc to zz top , as well as bruce springsteen , oasis and placido domingo . the independent producers ' association impala protested that such a concentration of power would leave the music majors with a stranglehold on cd prices and artists ' contractual terms and asked the court to review the decision . merger approved in 2004 the european commission approved the merger in july 2004 even though it acknowledged that the deal would leave four major players in the market - universal , sony-bmg , warner and emi . the court ruled that the commission 's antitrust busters had carried out an " extremely cursory examination " of the deal . a lawyer for impala voiced satisfaction with the court 's decision , which she said showed that regulators had made " manifest errors . " " for us , the commission committed manifest errors of judgement because it did not do the necessary research to show the absence of a collective dominant position , " the lawyer said . impala has long fought against greater concentration in the music business and recently slammed warner and emi for trying to take each other over . however , the lobbying group 's eagerness for a quick ruling on sony bmg irritated the judges , who ordered it to pay a quarter of the procedure 's costs as a result . the commission and the companies have two months to lodge an appeal against the decision . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : bertelsmann preparing to sell stake in sony bmg german media giant bertelsmann is making preparations to sell its music company holdings including a 50 percent stake in sony bmg , the world 's second-largest music group , a report said monday .

" the medical committee plans to recommend harsher consequences for players who stick out their leg in the direction of another player 's upper body . in contrast to other sporting events ... the positive - or rather , negative - results of routine doping tests before and during the world cup rounded out the fifa medical report . " about 16 players from each team were tested at a time .

" my biggest concern is whether or not actions taken will weaken the siniora government , " he said , referring to lebanese prime minister fuad siniora .
" democracy in lebanon is an important part of laying a foundation for peace in that region .
we have worked really hard to get syria out of lebanon . " worst violence in a decade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss for angela - bush arrived in stralsund late wednesday the american president was speaking from the eastern german town of stralsund on the baltic coast where he is meeting with german chancellor angela merkel before heading off to the g-8 summit in russia over the weekend . german chancellor angela merkel too called for a " de-escalation " of the conflict in the middle east - the worst cross border violence in a decade - after israeli fighter jets bombed lebanon 's only international airport and killed 28 civilians in a wave of retaliatory strikes over the killing and capture of soldiers by hezbollah guerrillas on wednesday . an israeli woman was also killed when hezbollah fired off a barrage of rockets across the volatile border , sending panicked residents of communities in northern israel into bomb shelters . merkel said the violence had been sparked by the capture of the soldiers , but added : " we can only call on everyone to stop the violence , to release the soldiers and to stop the rocket attacks on israel . " telephone diplomacy bush accused hezbollah and hamas of trying to derail efforts to bring peace to the middle east by creating an independent palestinian state existing side-by-side with israel . " it 's really sad where people are willing to take innocent life to stop that process .
matter of fact , it 's pathetic , " said bush , who has refused to recognize the palestinian government led by hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli warplanes targeted the rafik hariri international airport in beirut " hezbollah does n't want there to be peace , the militant arm of hamas does n't want there to be peace , and those of us who do want peace will continue to work together to encourage peace , " bush said . " there are a group of terrorists who want to stop the advance of peace , and those of us who are peace-loving must work together to help the agents of peace , " he said .

that is considerably fewer than in the 2002 world cup , where the average was 2.7 injuries per game .

the world cup review : success off the field , controversy on it world cup scores goal for german economy the final eleven : the 2006 world cup in numbers world cup 2006 -pipe- 13.07.2006 strict refs and good prep made for fewer world cup injuries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team doctors were called out 156 times in the world cup the fifa medical commission has good news : this year 's world cup saw a dramatic decline in injuries and not a single doping case .
still , sports doctors are looking to curb kung fu moves and fakers . not only was the 2006 world cup healthy for business in germany , it also proved healthy for the participants , reported the official sports doctors .
with 736 professional soccer players fighting tooth and nail through 64 games for the title , somebody is bound to get hurt . jiri dvorak , head of fifa 's medical department , said there was on average only 2.2 injuries per game this year .
that is considerably fewer than in the 2002 world cup , where the average was 2.7 injuries per game .
for dvorak , it 's " an encouraging decline . " everything 's on tape " after every game we count up all the injuries that occurred .
we get it in writing from the doctors and afterward we watch the tape to see everything that led up to the injury .
then we make a scientific assessment of it , " dvorak said . even minor abrasions and bruises were recorded .
in the 2006 world cup , only one fourth of the total injuries were severe enough that the affected player missed one or more games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was an average of 2.2 injuries per game less than half as many head injuries at the 2002 world cup in japan and korea , elbowing resulted in 25 head injuries , said dvorak .
concerted efforts were made to reduce the number this year . " fifa specifically instructed the referee committee and the referees to penalize incidences of elbowing , " dvorak said . fifa 's chief doctor said he believes the referees ' strict approach contributed to a reduction in head injuries .
only 11 occurred in 2006 , less than half the number of head injuries in 2002 . dvorak attributes the decline in injuries not only to referees but also to more advanced training methods .
the better a team is physically prepared for the championship , the smaller the chances are that the players will sustain injuries . it was for good reason that the fifa insisted on a total of six game-free weeks prior to the world cup . kung fu on the field despite the positive injury statistics , the fifa medical committee has a few recommendations for future soccer events , especially concerning injury simulations that break the flow of play .
team doctors were called to the field 156 times in this world cup , but only 88 of these cases constituted a real injury . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the refs ' dedication to fair play leads to fewer injuries dvorak also said he discovered a new kind of foul this year : " we certainly have to get a handle on the kung fu moves . " the medical committee plans to recommend harsher consequences for players who stick out their leg in the direction of another player 's upper body . in contrast to other sporting events ... the positive - or rather , negative - results of routine doping tests before and during the world cup rounded out the fifa medical report . " about 16 players from each team were tested at a time .
i think we can confidently say that there is no evidence of systematic doping in soccer , " dvorak said . that makes the 2006 world cup the third in a row without a single case of doping . tim brockmeier -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fifa committee responds to referee criticism the referees committee of fifa , world soccer 's governing body , rejected charges of poor officiating during the world cup and added that quality of refereeing has been higher than ever .

" america and germany stand side by side . " " we share common values and common interests .
we want to work together to keep the peace .
we want to work together to promote freedom .
there 's so much we can do , working together , " he said . the visit was marked by good spirits and humor as bush accepted a small ceremonial barrel of herring and jokingly mimed eating one of the fish . " this is a very good opportunity , indeed , to say a word of thanks , " a beaming merkel said .
" we owe you a big debt of gratitude for being able to finally live within one country in peace and freedom ; one country - germany . " leaders urge restraint in mideast at a joint public appearance later , the two leaders accused the lebanon-based hezbollah movement of sparking some of the worst middle east violence in a decade by abducting israeli soldiers and firing rockets at targets inside israel . bush pointedly defended israel 's " right to defend herself " but urged restraint , saying that " whatever israel does should not weaken " the fragile government of lebanese prime minister fuad siniora . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke rises from an israeli air raid that targeted a bridge in the zahrani region in lebanon " my biggest concern is whether or not actions taken will weaken the siniora government , " he said .
" democracy in lebanon is an important part of laying a foundation for peace in that region . " " the attacks did not start from the israeli side , but from hezbollah 's side , " said merkel .
" we call on the powers in the region to seek to bring about a de-escalation of the situation . " losing patience with iran ? the two leaders jointly warned iran that they were taking the dispute over tehran 's nuclear program to the un security council and urged the islamic republic to freeze sensitive atomic activities as a precondition for talks . " i truly think they 're trying to wait us out .
they think it 's a matter of time before people lose their nerve , " bush said .
" i think they 're going to be disappointed that this coalition is a lot firmer than they think . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad in front of a picture of iran 's ayatollah ali khamenei referring to a decision on wednesday by the five un veto powers and germany to pass the iranian nuclear dossier to the un security council , merkel said time was running out . " we have waited patiently and we have had no workable response from iran .
we have to see what the next steps will be if iran continues to remain silent , " said merkel .
" this may include sanctions . " no lectures for putin the meeting came a day before bush was to head to russia for weekend talks with president vladimir putin and the july 15-17 group of eight summit of industrialized nations . bush said he would not lecture putin publicly when they meet on what washington says is moscow 's backsliding from democracy , but stressed that non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- must be allowed to operate in russia " without intimidation " from the kremlin . " nobody really likes to be lectured a lot .
and , therefore , if you want to be an effective person , what you do n't do is scold the person publicly all the time , " the us president said .
" i 'll be firm in my beliefs in certain democratic institutions , i 'll be firm in my belief about the need for there to be an active civil society , and ngos should be allowed to function in russia without intimidation , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has no plans to lecture putin when he meets him in russia merkel urged russia to ratify the international energy charter giving greater access to pipelines and energy supplies , which she said would provide " greater security " to world energy supplies . " we have different ideas about how a pluralist society , a democratic society ought to work ; that there ought to be a strong opposition is certainly one of the realities of life , " said merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush was looking forward to tucking into this wild boar later in the evening the press conference was not all serious : in response to one reporter 's questions about middle east violence and iran 's nuclear program , bush joked about plans for an evening barbecue with merkel at a neighboring village which was to feature a wild boar caught in the region 's woods .

" my biggest concern is whether or not actions taken will weaken the siniora government , " he said , referring to lebanese prime minister fuad siniora .
" democracy in lebanon is an important part of laying a foundation for peace in that region .
we have worked really hard to get syria out of lebanon . " worst violence in a decade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss for angela - bush arrived in stralsund late wednesday the american president was speaking from the eastern german town of stralsund on the baltic coast where he is meeting with german chancellor angela merkel before heading off to the g-8 summit in russia over the weekend . german chancellor angela merkel too called for a " de-escalation " of the conflict in the middle east - the worst cross border violence in a decade - after israeli fighter jets bombed lebanon 's only international airport and killed 28 civilians in a wave of retaliatory strikes over the killing and capture of soldiers by hezbollah guerrillas on wednesday . an israeli woman was also killed when hezbollah fired off a barrage of rockets across the volatile border , sending panicked residents of communities in northern israel into bomb shelters . merkel said the violence had been sparked by the capture of the soldiers , but added : " we can only call on everyone to stop the violence , to release the soldiers and to stop the rocket attacks on israel . " telephone diplomacy bush accused hezbollah and hamas of trying to derail efforts to bring peace to the middle east by creating an independent palestinian state existing side-by-side with israel . " it 's really sad where people are willing to take innocent life to stop that process .
matter of fact , it 's pathetic , " said bush , who has refused to recognize the palestinian government led by hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli warplanes targeted the rafik hariri international airport in beirut " hezbollah does n't want there to be peace , the militant arm of hamas does n't want there to be peace , and those of us who do want peace will continue to work together to encourage peace , " bush said . " there are a group of terrorists who want to stop the advance of peace , and those of us who are peace-loving must work together to help the agents of peace , " he said .
" things looked positive , and terrorists stepped up . " bush said that us secretary of state condoleezza rice had iniatiated telephone diplomacy to try to calm the situation , and added : " i 'll be making calls " as well . the us president said damascus , a patron of hezbollah , must pressure the lebanese militia to free captured israeli soldiers .

france is one of the countries which has taken an even sharper tone publicly about the israeli retaliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : douste-blazy has used strong language to condemn israeli bombardment of lebanon french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said on europe 1 radio on thursday that israel 's bombardment of lebanon was " an act of war " .
he added that israel " runs the risk of plunging lebanon back into the worst years of war . " the russian ministry said it supported lebanon 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , but also condemned the abduction of israeli soldiers by hezbollah and palestinian militants .
" acts of terrorism are completely unacceptable , " the statement said . italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema called israel 's actions in the palestinian territories " counterproductive . " un weighs in un secretary-general kofi annan has decided to send a three-person team to the middle east to urge all parties to exercise restraint and help defuse the major crisis in the region . the team will first visit cairo to meet with egyptian officials and consult with arab league foreign ministers meeting there on saturday .

it provides europe with an energy alternative to the middle east and russia . on thursday , the three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- baku-tbilisi-ceyhan -lrb- btc -rrb- pipeline project was opened at the turkish mediterranean port .
the event , however , is not only significant for british oil giant bp who is directing the pipeline project . attending the ceremony were leaders from over 20 countries in the region that are expected to profit from oil and gas revenues .
turkey , where the pipeline terminates , has an increasing appetite for energy , but the united states and europe also have a vested interest in the btc project also . " we understand very well the significance of the btc project and we have conducted delicate energy diplomacy for its successful implementation , " said turkish energy minister hilmi guler , adding that the pipeline " will not only bring turkey big economic benefits , but also huge political dividends . " bottlenecks and geopolitical hotspots being avoided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil giants are considering building refineries in ceyhan the 1760-kilometer pipeline , the second-longest in the world , will deliver more than a million barrels of oil per day by 2008 .
the oil comes from the central asian states of kazakhstan and azerbaijan .
the region used to be part of the former soviet union and that is why this pipeline is seen as having not only economic importance but political as well . for the united states , one of the pipeline 's main political backers , it is seen as a crucial step not only to unlocking urgently needed resources but also to giving the energy-rich region greater independence from its former russian master . crucially it avoids the volatile middle east , giving world markets an important alternative supply .
but the pipeline also breaks russia ’ s monopoly on the distribution of energy for former soviet union states . " the pipelines do not only bring energy security they bring hope , " said david gorokva , head of the georgian gas and oil corporation .
" countries like us are not secure despite the fact of the rose revolution , it is all going to die one day if there is no secure energy resources and i think we should take this into consideration . " political implications in caucasus great bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine and russia quarreled over gas prices this winter last winter , russia without warning doubled the prices of energy to both georgia and the ukraine after pro-russian administrations were ousted by mass protests .
russia claimed the price hike simply mirrored market prices , but washington blasted the move accusing moscow of strong-armed tactics .
europe at once felt very dependent on the goodwill of russia . both democratic and republican administrations have strongly backed the new pipeline as a means of breaking moscow 's iron grip on the region .
much to moscow 's irritation , us special forces have been sent to georgia to help protect the pipeline as the region is one of most volatile in the world . russia maintains a strong military presence in the caucasus region , which the pipeline passes through .
the region is strewn with ethnic rivalries and unresolved conflicts .
in georgia , there are two breakaway states , which fought georgian forces to a standstill in the 1990s .
an uneasy ceasefire also exists between neighboring armenia and azerbaijan . bildunterschrift : the pipeline runs through hotspots in the caucasus " this region has always been volatile if you look at the history and it still is and there is big potential for future conflicts , " said tatiana mitrova , an energy security expert and adviser to the russian presidency .
" there are many rivals who want to gain control over the region because it is the heart of eurasia , and it is the future growth road of all energy routes .
but i am afraid that as the whole political tension is getting stronger and stronger , tension in this region will also rise . " the success of the btc pipeline ultimately depends on the stability of one of world 's most volatile regions .
without stability , the long-term dreams of turkey and the us of opening up a secure east-west energy corridor that exports oil and gas and imports independence and security to former soviet states will remain unfulfilled . dorian jones -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe searches for alternatives to russian gas following the gas price row between russia and ukraine , europe is eyeing new pipeline projects and transportation methods to lessen its dependence on deliveries from russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.07.2006 bush visit : bonding over barbecue on the baltic sea großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush go on walkabout to meet " real germans " in stralsund us president george w. bush has arrived for his two-day visit with chancellor merkel in her parliamentary district .
his aim ?
to get to know merkel and other " real germans " better - if only security staff will let him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush pretends to eat an imaginary herring president bush 's stralsund visit got off to a sunny start on thursday when he was formally welcomed in the city square by german chancellor angela merkel .
the president shook hands with the smiling germans in the crowd , then accepted a small ceremonial barrel of herring , miming eating one of the fish in jest . " i bring a message from the american people : we 're honored to call the german people friends and allies , " the us president said .
" america and germany stand side by side . " the president touched down in germany late wednesday in the northern city of rostock en route to the group of eight summit of industrialized nations in st. petersburg , which merkel will also attend . following his welcome in stralsund , bush signed the town 's " golden book " before sitting down with merkel before a fireplace in the town hall for talks .
the two discussed the renewed violence between israel and lebanon , as well as how to respond to iran after it failed to respond to incentives aimed at ending an impassse over its nuclear program . the two-day stop in merkel 's constituency on the baltic sea coast is meant to give the two leaders time to get to know each other better , as well as show bush the " real germany . " during bush 's last visit to germany to the southwestern city of mainz in february 2005 , germans displayed their talent for thoroughness by effectively removing any signs of life from the city 's streets .
bush reportedly said himself that he thought the security precautions were exaggerated .
he is keen for his experience in stralsund to be different . but those in charge of security just ca n't help themselves , it seems .
for days now , helicopters have been circling over the stralsund while security personnel have been busy repeating precautions taken in mainz - welding shut manholes , sealing off letter boxes , and cordoning off the historic town center . will the real germans please stand up ? many locals and tourists in stralsund are less than amused at the way their lives have been turned upside down in order to ensure the safety of merkel 's prominent guest .

" my biggest concern is whether or not actions taken will weaken the siniora government , " he said , referring to lebanese prime minister fuad siniora .
" democracy in lebanon is an important part of laying a foundation for peace in that region .
we have worked really hard to get syria out of lebanon . " worst violence in a decade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss for angela - bush arrived in stralsund late wednesday the american president was speaking from the eastern german town of stralsund on the baltic coast where he is meeting with german chancellor angela merkel before heading off to the g-8 summit in russia over the weekend . german chancellor angela merkel too called for a " de-escalation " of the conflict in the middle east - the worst cross border violence in a decade - after israeli fighter jets bombed lebanon 's only international airport and killed 28 civilians in a wave of retaliatory strikes over the killing and capture of soldiers by hezbollah guerrillas on wednesday . an israeli woman was also killed when hezbollah fired off a barrage of rockets across the volatile border , sending panicked residents of communities in northern israel into bomb shelters . merkel said the violence had been sparked by the capture of the soldiers , but added : " we can only call on everyone to stop the violence , to release the soldiers and to stop the rocket attacks on israel . " telephone diplomacy bush accused hezbollah and hamas of trying to derail efforts to bring peace to the middle east by creating an independent palestinian state existing side-by-side with israel . " it 's really sad where people are willing to take innocent life to stop that process .
matter of fact , it 's pathetic , " said bush , who has refused to recognize the palestinian government led by hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli warplanes targeted the rafik hariri international airport in beirut " hezbollah does n't want there to be peace , the militant arm of hamas does n't want there to be peace , and those of us who do want peace will continue to work together to encourage peace , " bush said . " there are a group of terrorists who want to stop the advance of peace , and those of us who are peace-loving must work together to help the agents of peace , " he said .
" things looked positive , and terrorists stepped up . " bush said that us secretary of state condoleezza rice had iniatiated telephone diplomacy to try to calm the situation , and added : " i 'll be making calls " as well . the us president said damascus , a patron of hezbollah , must pressure the lebanese militia to free captured israeli soldiers .

president assad needs to show some leadership towards peace . " france , russia slam israel 's actions the eu ’ s 25 foreign ministers are meeting next monday to discuss the middle east peace plan which is essentially only a piece of paper at this point .

france is one of the countries which has taken an even sharper tone publicly about the israeli retaliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : douste-blazy has used strong language to condemn israeli bombardment of lebanon french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said on europe 1 radio on thursday that israel 's bombardment of lebanon was " an act of war " .
he added that israel " runs the risk of plunging lebanon back into the worst years of war . " the russian ministry said it supported lebanon 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , but also condemned the abduction of israeli soldiers by hezbollah and palestinian militants .
" acts of terrorism are completely unacceptable , " the statement said . italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema called israel 's actions in the palestinian territories " counterproductive . " un weighs in un secretary-general kofi annan has decided to send a three-person team to the middle east to urge all parties to exercise restraint and help defuse the major crisis in the region . the team will first visit cairo to meet with egyptian officials and consult with arab league foreign ministers meeting there on saturday .

his aim ?
to get to know merkel and other " real germans " better - if only security staff will let him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush pretends to eat an imaginary herring president bush 's stralsund visit got off to a sunny start on thursday when he was formally welcomed in the city square by german chancellor angela merkel .
the president shook hands with the smiling germans in the crowd , then accepted a small ceremonial barrel of herring , miming eating one of the fish in jest . " i bring a message from the american people : we 're honored to call the german people friends and allies , " the us president said .
" america and germany stand side by side . " the president touched down in germany late wednesday in the northern city of rostock en route to the group of eight summit of industrialized nations in st. petersburg , which merkel will also attend . following his welcome in stralsund , bush signed the town 's " golden book " before sitting down with merkel before a fireplace in the town hall for talks .
the two discussed the renewed violence between israel and lebanon , as well as how to respond to iran after it failed to respond to incentives aimed at ending an impassse over its nuclear program . the two-day stop in merkel 's constituency on the baltic sea coast is meant to give the two leaders time to get to know each other better , as well as show bush the " real germany . " during bush 's last visit to germany to the southwestern city of mainz in february 2005 , germans displayed their talent for thoroughness by effectively removing any signs of life from the city 's streets .
bush reportedly said himself that he thought the security precautions were exaggerated .
he is keen for his experience in stralsund to be different . but those in charge of security just ca n't help themselves , it seems .
for days now , helicopters have been circling over the stralsund while security personnel have been busy repeating precautions taken in mainz - welding shut manholes , sealing off letter boxes , and cordoning off the historic town center . will the real germans please stand up ? many locals and tourists in stralsund are less than amused at the way their lives have been turned upside down in order to ensure the safety of merkel 's prominent guest . " look at the shops here in the town center , " one tourist said .
" they 'll all be closed during the president 's stay .
we 're here on holiday and want to have a good time shopping , but they just wo n't let us . " " according to the politicians in berlin , the whole town should be happy to welcome the president , " a resident said .
" but then most of the people here are locked away from the president so as not to present a threat to him .
that does n't make any sense to me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this couple arrived early to meet bush in stralsund 's market square though bush got the desired contact with the locals during thursday 's market square welcome , he met a crowd of handpicked stralsunders who had undergone extensive background checks .

many say it 's precisely that experience of recent history that makes merkel and her constituency so fascinating to the president . bonding over roast boar the president and the chancellor will have a further chance to bond over a wild game barbecue night in the nearby village of trinwillershagen .

it provides europe with an energy alternative to the middle east and russia . on thursday , the three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- baku-tbilisi-ceyhan -lrb- btc -rrb- pipeline project was opened at the turkish mediterranean port .
the event , however , is not only significant for british oil giant bp who is directing the pipeline project . attending the ceremony were leaders from over 20 countries in the region that are expected to profit from oil and gas revenues .
turkey , where the pipeline terminates , has an increasing appetite for energy , but the united states and europe also have a vested interest in the btc project also . " we understand very well the significance of the btc project and we have conducted delicate energy diplomacy for its successful implementation , " said turkish energy minister hilmi guler , adding that the pipeline " will not only bring turkey big economic benefits , but also huge political dividends . " bottlenecks and geopolitical hotspots being avoided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil giants are considering building refineries in ceyhan the 1760-kilometer pipeline , the second-longest in the world , will deliver more than a million barrels of oil per day by 2008 .
the oil comes from the central asian states of kazakhstan and azerbaijan .
the region used to be part of the former soviet union and that is why this pipeline is seen as having not only economic importance but political as well . for the united states , one of the pipeline 's main political backers , it is seen as a crucial step not only to unlocking urgently needed resources but also to giving the energy-rich region greater independence from its former russian master . crucially it avoids the volatile middle east , giving world markets an important alternative supply .
but the pipeline also breaks russia ’ s monopoly on the distribution of energy for former soviet union states . " the pipelines do not only bring energy security they bring hope , " said david gorokva , head of the georgian gas and oil corporation .

europe at once felt very dependent on the goodwill of russia . both democratic and republican administrations have strongly backed the new pipeline as a means of breaking moscow 's iron grip on the region .
much to moscow 's irritation , us special forces have been sent to georgia to help protect the pipeline as the region is one of most volatile in the world . russia maintains a strong military presence in the caucasus region , which the pipeline passes through .
the region is strewn with ethnic rivalries and unresolved conflicts .
in georgia , there are two breakaway states , which fought georgian forces to a standstill in the 1990s .
an uneasy ceasefire also exists between neighboring armenia and azerbaijan . bildunterschrift : the pipeline runs through hotspots in the caucasus " this region has always been volatile if you look at the history and it still is and there is big potential for future conflicts , " said tatiana mitrova , an energy security expert and adviser to the russian presidency .
" there are many rivals who want to gain control over the region because it is the heart of eurasia , and it is the future growth road of all energy routes .
but i am afraid that as the whole political tension is getting stronger and stronger , tension in this region will also rise . " the success of the btc pipeline ultimately depends on the stability of one of world 's most volatile regions .

it provides europe with an energy alternative to the middle east and russia . on thursday , the three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- baku-tbilisi-ceyhan -lrb- btc -rrb- pipeline project was opened at the turkish mediterranean port .
the event , however , is not only significant for british oil giant bp who is directing the pipeline project . attending the ceremony were leaders from over 20 countries in the region that are expected to profit from oil and gas revenues .
turkey , where the pipeline terminates , has an increasing appetite for energy , but the united states and europe also have a vested interest in the btc project also . " we understand very well the significance of the btc project and we have conducted delicate energy diplomacy for its successful implementation , " said turkish energy minister hilmi guler , adding that the pipeline " will not only bring turkey big economic benefits , but also huge political dividends . " bottlenecks and geopolitical hotspots being avoided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil giants are considering building refineries in ceyhan the 1760-kilometer pipeline , the second-longest in the world , will deliver more than a million barrels of oil per day by 2008 .
the oil comes from the central asian states of kazakhstan and azerbaijan .
the region used to be part of the former soviet union and that is why this pipeline is seen as having not only economic importance but political as well . for the united states , one of the pipeline 's main political backers , it is seen as a crucial step not only to unlocking urgently needed resources but also to giving the energy-rich region greater independence from its former russian master . crucially it avoids the volatile middle east , giving world markets an important alternative supply .
but the pipeline also breaks russia ’ s monopoly on the distribution of energy for former soviet union states . " the pipelines do not only bring energy security they bring hope , " said david gorokva , head of the georgian gas and oil corporation .
" countries like us are not secure despite the fact of the rose revolution , it is all going to die one day if there is no secure energy resources and i think we should take this into consideration . " political implications in caucasus great bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine and russia quarreled over gas prices this winter last winter , russia without warning doubled the prices of energy to both georgia and the ukraine after pro-russian administrations were ousted by mass protests .
russia claimed the price hike simply mirrored market prices , but washington blasted the move accusing moscow of strong-armed tactics .
europe at once felt very dependent on the goodwill of russia . both democratic and republican administrations have strongly backed the new pipeline as a means of breaking moscow 's iron grip on the region .
much to moscow 's irritation , us special forces have been sent to georgia to help protect the pipeline as the region is one of most volatile in the world . russia maintains a strong military presence in the caucasus region , which the pipeline passes through .
the region is strewn with ethnic rivalries and unresolved conflicts .
in georgia , there are two breakaway states , which fought georgian forces to a standstill in the 1990s .
an uneasy ceasefire also exists between neighboring armenia and azerbaijan . bildunterschrift : the pipeline runs through hotspots in the caucasus " this region has always been volatile if you look at the history and it still is and there is big potential for future conflicts , " said tatiana mitrova , an energy security expert and adviser to the russian presidency .
" there are many rivals who want to gain control over the region because it is the heart of eurasia , and it is the future growth road of all energy routes .
but i am afraid that as the whole political tension is getting stronger and stronger , tension in this region will also rise . " the success of the btc pipeline ultimately depends on the stability of one of world 's most volatile regions .
without stability , the long-term dreams of turkey and the us of opening up a secure east-west energy corridor that exports oil and gas and imports independence and security to former soviet states will remain unfulfilled . dorian jones -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe searches for alternatives to russian gas following the gas price row between russia and ukraine , europe is eyeing new pipeline projects and transportation methods to lessen its dependence on deliveries from russia .

it provides europe with an energy alternative to the middle east and russia . on thursday , the three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- baku-tbilisi-ceyhan -lrb- btc -rrb- pipeline project was opened at the turkish mediterranean port .
the event , however , is not only significant for british oil giant bp who is directing the pipeline project . attending the ceremony were leaders from over 20 countries in the region that are expected to profit from oil and gas revenues .
turkey , where the pipeline terminates , has an increasing appetite for energy , but the united states and europe also have a vested interest in the btc project also . " we understand very well the significance of the btc project and we have conducted delicate energy diplomacy for its successful implementation , " said turkish energy minister hilmi guler , adding that the pipeline " will not only bring turkey big economic benefits , but also huge political dividends . " bottlenecks and geopolitical hotspots being avoided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil giants are considering building refineries in ceyhan the 1760-kilometer pipeline , the second-longest in the world , will deliver more than a million barrels of oil per day by 2008 .
the oil comes from the central asian states of kazakhstan and azerbaijan .
the region used to be part of the former soviet union and that is why this pipeline is seen as having not only economic importance but political as well . for the united states , one of the pipeline 's main political backers , it is seen as a crucial step not only to unlocking urgently needed resources but also to giving the energy-rich region greater independence from its former russian master . crucially it avoids the volatile middle east , giving world markets an important alternative supply .
but the pipeline also breaks russia ’ s monopoly on the distribution of energy for former soviet union states . " the pipelines do not only bring energy security they bring hope , " said david gorokva , head of the georgian gas and oil corporation .
" countries like us are not secure despite the fact of the rose revolution , it is all going to die one day if there is no secure energy resources and i think we should take this into consideration . " political implications in caucasus great bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine and russia quarreled over gas prices this winter last winter , russia without warning doubled the prices of energy to both georgia and the ukraine after pro-russian administrations were ousted by mass protests .
russia claimed the price hike simply mirrored market prices , but washington blasted the move accusing moscow of strong-armed tactics .
europe at once felt very dependent on the goodwill of russia . both democratic and republican administrations have strongly backed the new pipeline as a means of breaking moscow 's iron grip on the region .
much to moscow 's irritation , us special forces have been sent to georgia to help protect the pipeline as the region is one of most volatile in the world . russia maintains a strong military presence in the caucasus region , which the pipeline passes through .
the region is strewn with ethnic rivalries and unresolved conflicts .
in georgia , there are two breakaway states , which fought georgian forces to a standstill in the 1990s .
an uneasy ceasefire also exists between neighboring armenia and azerbaijan . bildunterschrift : the pipeline runs through hotspots in the caucasus " this region has always been volatile if you look at the history and it still is and there is big potential for future conflicts , " said tatiana mitrova , an energy security expert and adviser to the russian presidency .
" there are many rivals who want to gain control over the region because it is the heart of eurasia , and it is the future growth road of all energy routes .
but i am afraid that as the whole political tension is getting stronger and stronger , tension in this region will also rise . " the success of the btc pipeline ultimately depends on the stability of one of world 's most volatile regions .
without stability , the long-term dreams of turkey and the us of opening up a secure east-west energy corridor that exports oil and gas and imports independence and security to former soviet states will remain unfulfilled . dorian jones -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe searches for alternatives to russian gas following the gas price row between russia and ukraine , europe is eyeing new pipeline projects and transportation methods to lessen its dependence on deliveries from russia .

they came to saxony , which even during communist times had been a hub for the micro-electronic industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amd opened its largest semi-conductor plant outside the us in dresden in 1999 wages are lower in saxony than in western germany , as is the case in all five new states .
the labor market is also more flexible and cities with major universities , like dresden in saxony , have highly qualified specialists . amd manager hans deppe has n't regretted the move to saxony and has a positive outlook on the future , in spite of challenging market conditions . competition on the global market " we face global competition in the semi-conductor industry , which is not limited to just the european union , " deppe said .
" what has been built up in the micro-electronic cluster in saxony has so much potential that we are going to see growth in the future .
i 'm certain of that . " at amd , growth is well underway : the chip producer recently announced plans to invest an additional $ 2.5 billion in its dresden plant .
twenty percent of that will come from the german taxpayers in the form of investment bonuses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxony is one of germany 's 16 federal states state subsidies are yet another alluring aspect of investing in former east germany .
the european union , the federal government and the new german states all seek to attract potential investors by offering investment bonuses and tax breaks . federal government seeks to cut red tape even if the advantages of investment in eastern germany seem to outweigh the disadvantages , there are a few drawbacks the new states will have to resolve if they want to enhance their global competitiveness . issues like recognizing american drivers ' licenses in germany or providing language training for employees are among the less formidable hurdles , but excessive bureaucracy is more critical . " germany still has the reputation of being overly bureaucratic , having too many rules and too much red tape , " tiefensee said .
" that 's something we have to deal with and the federal government is doing that through de-bureaucratizing and by accelerating planning processes .

but a new report says germany is falling behind in recognizing the principle of universal jurisdiction . this is when national courts prosecute grave crimes , even in cases where the victims and the suspected perpetrators are foreign citizens and the crimes took place in a different country .
offenses such as war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity fall into this category . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new study human rights watch 's recent report , " universal jurisdiction in europe : the state of the art , " finds that law-enforcement agencies in many european countries are increasingly willing to investigate and prosecute people suspected of grave international crimes . the report cites the examples of belgium 's national court , which in 2001 and again in 2005 convicted several rwandan citizens for crimes against humanity committed during rwanda 's 1994 civil war . international criminal court prompted the trend jürgen schurr , one of the report 's authors , said the founding of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague in 2002 kick-started the trend to recognize universal jurisdiction . schurr said these changes came about because european countries were legally bound to include in their national criminal code the offenses recognised by the icc . previously in germany , the maximum charge for people suspected of genocide was murder , which severely underestimated the gravity of many crimes , schurr said .
that situation changed with the introduction of germany 's code of crimes against international law in 2002 . the hrw report takes a close took at eight countries – belgium , denmark , germany , france , great britain , the netherlands , norway and spain . netherlands comes up trumps in hrw report netherlands and great britain receive the most glowing reports .
the dutch law enforcement agency has some 30 employees who work exclusively on international crimes cases . " there is a real political will to dedicate resources to allow for the prosecution of these crimes , " schurr said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internationale criminal court although great britain employs only two people to investigate international crimes , they are both placed in the anti-terror department of london 's metropolitan police .
the investigators have access to the department 's extensive resources and 300 staff members . germany , france lagging behind germany and france receive bad marks in the hrw report .
in france , it still is not possible to prosecute war crimes suspects because the offense is not recognized under french national law . both countries also dedicate few resources to investigating crimes of this severity . schurr found this surprising in germany 's case .
from 1993 to 2003 , the center for combating war crimes , based in the federal criminal police office , was actively investigating war crimes from the former yugoslavia .
now there 's only one person responsible for grave crimes , he says . inquiries fail on political grounds the german legal code provides an excellent basis for the prosecution of grave crimes , according to schurr .
but , he says , there is a lack of political will . " the federal prosecutor has been allowed a bigger latitude of judgement , " he said .
in other words , the court " can be , but does n't have to be , active . " schurr pointed to the situation in 2005 when germany 's constitutional court dismissed allegations that us defense secretary donald rumsfeld was responsible for the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal .

" my biggest concern is whether or not actions taken will weaken the siniora government , " he said , referring to lebanese prime minister fuad siniora .
" democracy in lebanon is an important part of laying a foundation for peace in that region .
we have worked really hard to get syria out of lebanon . " worst violence in a decade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss for angela - bush arrived in stralsund late wednesday the american president was speaking from the eastern german town of stralsund on the baltic coast where he is meeting with german chancellor angela merkel before heading off to the g-8 summit in russia over the weekend . german chancellor angela merkel too called for a " de-escalation " of the conflict in the middle east - the worst cross border violence in a decade - after israeli fighter jets bombed lebanon 's only international airport and killed 28 civilians in a wave of retaliatory strikes over the killing and capture of soldiers by hezbollah guerrillas on wednesday . an israeli woman was also killed when hezbollah fired off a barrage of rockets across the volatile border , sending panicked residents of communities in northern israel into bomb shelters . merkel said the violence had been sparked by the capture of the soldiers , but added : " we can only call on everyone to stop the violence , to release the soldiers and to stop the rocket attacks on israel . " telephone diplomacy bush accused hezbollah and hamas of trying to derail efforts to bring peace to the middle east by creating an independent palestinian state existing side-by-side with israel . " it 's really sad where people are willing to take innocent life to stop that process .
matter of fact , it 's pathetic , " said bush , who has refused to recognize the palestinian government led by hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli warplanes targeted the rafik hariri international airport in beirut " hezbollah does n't want there to be peace , the militant arm of hamas does n't want there to be peace , and those of us who do want peace will continue to work together to encourage peace , " bush said . " there are a group of terrorists who want to stop the advance of peace , and those of us who are peace-loving must work together to help the agents of peace , " he said .
" things looked positive , and terrorists stepped up . " bush said that us secretary of state condoleezza rice had iniatiated telephone diplomacy to try to calm the situation , and added : " i 'll be making calls " as well . the us president said damascus , a patron of hezbollah , must pressure the lebanese militia to free captured israeli soldiers . " syria needs to be held to account " over a dramatic escalation of violence in the middle east , " bush said .
president assad needs to show some leadership towards peace . " france , russia slam israel 's actions the eu ’ s 25 foreign ministers are meeting next monday to discuss the middle east peace plan which is essentially only a piece of paper at this point .
as part of the so-called middle east peace quartet , the bloc has spent years trying to move the process along but is now unsure how to position itself in the current crisis . one group of eu countries , including the uk , belgium , italy and germany , which had been reluctant to openly criticise israel finally did so on thursday saying it was using excessive force in lebanon .
france is one of the countries which has taken an even sharper tone publicly about the israeli retaliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : douste-blazy has used strong language to condemn israeli bombardment of lebanon french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said on europe 1 radio on thursday that israel 's bombardment of lebanon was " an act of war " .
he added that israel " runs the risk of plunging lebanon back into the worst years of war . " the russian ministry said it supported lebanon 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , but also condemned the abduction of israeli soldiers by hezbollah and palestinian militants .
" acts of terrorism are completely unacceptable , " the statement said . italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema called israel 's actions in the palestinian territories " counterproductive . " un weighs in un secretary-general kofi annan has decided to send a three-person team to the middle east to urge all parties to exercise restraint and help defuse the major crisis in the region . the team will first visit cairo to meet with egyptian officials and consult with arab league foreign ministers meeting there on saturday .
the un team is then expected to head to israel , the palestinian territories , lebanon , syria and possibly other destinations . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : israel 's right to exist " must never be questioned " speaking at the american jewish committee -lrb- ajc -rrb- annual meeting in washington , german chancellor angela merkel denounced iran and the palestinian militant group hamas for questioning israel 's right to exist .
-lrb- may 5 , 2006 -rrb- europe 's role in middle east waning as part of the middle east quartet , germany and the eu have a vested interest in the israeli elections .
german middle east expert günter meyer , however , says that the influence on israel 's policies is waning .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.07.2006 bush visit : bonding over barbecue on the baltic sea großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush go on walkabout to meet " real germans " in stralsund us president george w. bush has arrived for his two-day visit with chancellor merkel in her parliamentary district .
his aim ?
to get to know merkel and other " real germans " better - if only security staff will let him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush pretends to eat an imaginary herring president bush 's stralsund visit got off to a sunny start on thursday when he was formally welcomed in the city square by german chancellor angela merkel .
the president shook hands with the smiling germans in the crowd , then accepted a small ceremonial barrel of herring , miming eating one of the fish in jest . " i bring a message from the american people : we 're honored to call the german people friends and allies , " the us president said .
" america and germany stand side by side . " the president touched down in germany late wednesday in the northern city of rostock en route to the group of eight summit of industrialized nations in st. petersburg , which merkel will also attend . following his welcome in stralsund , bush signed the town 's " golden book " before sitting down with merkel before a fireplace in the town hall for talks .
the two discussed the renewed violence between israel and lebanon , as well as how to respond to iran after it failed to respond to incentives aimed at ending an impassse over its nuclear program . the two-day stop in merkel 's constituency on the baltic sea coast is meant to give the two leaders time to get to know each other better , as well as show bush the " real germany . " during bush 's last visit to germany to the southwestern city of mainz in february 2005 , germans displayed their talent for thoroughness by effectively removing any signs of life from the city 's streets .
bush reportedly said himself that he thought the security precautions were exaggerated .
he is keen for his experience in stralsund to be different . but those in charge of security just ca n't help themselves , it seems .
for days now , helicopters have been circling over the stralsund while security personnel have been busy repeating precautions taken in mainz - welding shut manholes , sealing off letter boxes , and cordoning off the historic town center . will the real germans please stand up ? many locals and tourists in stralsund are less than amused at the way their lives have been turned upside down in order to ensure the safety of merkel 's prominent guest . " look at the shops here in the town center , " one tourist said .
" they 'll all be closed during the president 's stay .
we 're here on holiday and want to have a good time shopping , but they just wo n't let us . " " according to the politicians in berlin , the whole town should be happy to welcome the president , " a resident said .
" but then most of the people here are locked away from the president so as not to present a threat to him .
that does n't make any sense to me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this couple arrived early to meet bush in stralsund 's market square though bush got the desired contact with the locals during thursday 's market square welcome , he met a crowd of handpicked stralsunders who had undergone extensive background checks .
a quarter of the crowd was made up of students from the nearby naval academy .
critics say it was hardly an authentic encounter with the people of stralsund , most of whom - like merkel - experienced life under the communist east german regime and the transition to democracy following reunification .
many say it 's precisely that experience of recent history that makes merkel and her constituency so fascinating to the president . bonding over roast boar the president and the chancellor will have a further chance to bond over a wild game barbecue night in the nearby village of trinwillershagen .
meant to echo the type of informal barbecues the bushes frequently host at their texas ranch , the atmosphere of merkel 's grill party is planned to be " deliberately relaxed " - at least as relaxed as you can be with 12,000 police officers on alert all around you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters are being kept far from the action and , as was the case in mainz last year , bush 's visit to stralsund will also be accompanied by protest rallies .
an estimated 5,000 people intend to demonstrate against the us administration 's foreign policy , and especially , the ongoing conflict in iraq .
but they 'll mainly be protesting for their own satisfaction because just as in mainz , bush is unlikely to see any of the campaigners and protesters , who 've been relegated to the outskirts of the city . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush visit sign of closer us-german relations us president george w. bush heads to german chancellor angela merkel 's constituency in former east germany on thursday for a visit that underlines the improving ties between the two leaders .

the world cup review : success off the field , controversy on it world cup scores goal for german economy the final eleven : the 2006 world cup in numbers world cup 2006 -pipe- 13.07.2006 strict refs and good prep made for fewer world cup injuries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team doctors were called out 156 times in the world cup the fifa medical commission has good news : this year 's world cup saw a dramatic decline in injuries and not a single doping case .
still , sports doctors are looking to curb kung fu moves and fakers . not only was the 2006 world cup healthy for business in germany , it also proved healthy for the participants , reported the official sports doctors .
with 736 professional soccer players fighting tooth and nail through 64 games for the title , somebody is bound to get hurt . jiri dvorak , head of fifa 's medical department , said there was on average only 2.2 injuries per game this year .
that is considerably fewer than in the 2002 world cup , where the average was 2.7 injuries per game .
for dvorak , it 's " an encouraging decline . " everything 's on tape " after every game we count up all the injuries that occurred .
we get it in writing from the doctors and afterward we watch the tape to see everything that led up to the injury .
then we make a scientific assessment of it , " dvorak said . even minor abrasions and bruises were recorded .
in the 2006 world cup , only one fourth of the total injuries were severe enough that the affected player missed one or more games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was an average of 2.2 injuries per game less than half as many head injuries at the 2002 world cup in japan and korea , elbowing resulted in 25 head injuries , said dvorak .
concerted efforts were made to reduce the number this year . " fifa specifically instructed the referee committee and the referees to penalize incidences of elbowing , " dvorak said . fifa 's chief doctor said he believes the referees ' strict approach contributed to a reduction in head injuries .
only 11 occurred in 2006 , less than half the number of head injuries in 2002 . dvorak attributes the decline in injuries not only to referees but also to more advanced training methods .
the better a team is physically prepared for the championship , the smaller the chances are that the players will sustain injuries . it was for good reason that the fifa insisted on a total of six game-free weeks prior to the world cup . kung fu on the field despite the positive injury statistics , the fifa medical committee has a few recommendations for future soccer events , especially concerning injury simulations that break the flow of play .
team doctors were called to the field 156 times in this world cup , but only 88 of these cases constituted a real injury . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the refs ' dedication to fair play leads to fewer injuries dvorak also said he discovered a new kind of foul this year : " we certainly have to get a handle on the kung fu moves . " the medical committee plans to recommend harsher consequences for players who stick out their leg in the direction of another player 's upper body . in contrast to other sporting events ... the positive - or rather , negative - results of routine doping tests before and during the world cup rounded out the fifa medical report . " about 16 players from each team were tested at a time .

his aim ?
to get to know merkel and other " real germans " better - if only security staff will let him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush pretends to eat an imaginary herring president bush 's stralsund visit got off to a sunny start on thursday when he was formally welcomed in the city square by german chancellor angela merkel .
the president shook hands with the smiling germans in the crowd , then accepted a small ceremonial barrel of herring , miming eating one of the fish in jest . " i bring a message from the american people : we 're honored to call the german people friends and allies , " the us president said .
" america and germany stand side by side . " the president touched down in germany late wednesday in the northern city of rostock en route to the group of eight summit of industrialized nations in st. petersburg , which merkel will also attend . following his welcome in stralsund , bush signed the town 's " golden book " before sitting down with merkel before a fireplace in the town hall for talks .
the two discussed the renewed violence between israel and lebanon , as well as how to respond to iran after it failed to respond to incentives aimed at ending an impassse over its nuclear program . the two-day stop in merkel 's constituency on the baltic sea coast is meant to give the two leaders time to get to know each other better , as well as show bush the " real germany . " during bush 's last visit to germany to the southwestern city of mainz in february 2005 , germans displayed their talent for thoroughness by effectively removing any signs of life from the city 's streets .
bush reportedly said himself that he thought the security precautions were exaggerated .
he is keen for his experience in stralsund to be different . but those in charge of security just ca n't help themselves , it seems .
for days now , helicopters have been circling over the stralsund while security personnel have been busy repeating precautions taken in mainz - welding shut manholes , sealing off letter boxes , and cordoning off the historic town center . will the real germans please stand up ? many locals and tourists in stralsund are less than amused at the way their lives have been turned upside down in order to ensure the safety of merkel 's prominent guest . " look at the shops here in the town center , " one tourist said .
" they 'll all be closed during the president 's stay .
we 're here on holiday and want to have a good time shopping , but they just wo n't let us . " " according to the politicians in berlin , the whole town should be happy to welcome the president , " a resident said .
" but then most of the people here are locked away from the president so as not to present a threat to him .
that does n't make any sense to me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this couple arrived early to meet bush in stralsund 's market square though bush got the desired contact with the locals during thursday 's market square welcome , he met a crowd of handpicked stralsunders who had undergone extensive background checks .
a quarter of the crowd was made up of students from the nearby naval academy .
critics say it was hardly an authentic encounter with the people of stralsund , most of whom - like merkel - experienced life under the communist east german regime and the transition to democracy following reunification .
many say it 's precisely that experience of recent history that makes merkel and her constituency so fascinating to the president . bonding over roast boar the president and the chancellor will have a further chance to bond over a wild game barbecue night in the nearby village of trinwillershagen .
meant to echo the type of informal barbecues the bushes frequently host at their texas ranch , the atmosphere of merkel 's grill party is planned to be " deliberately relaxed " - at least as relaxed as you can be with 12,000 police officers on alert all around you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters are being kept far from the action and , as was the case in mainz last year , bush 's visit to stralsund will also be accompanied by protest rallies .
an estimated 5,000 people intend to demonstrate against the us administration 's foreign policy , and especially , the ongoing conflict in iraq .
but they 'll mainly be protesting for their own satisfaction because just as in mainz , bush is unlikely to see any of the campaigners and protesters , who 've been relegated to the outskirts of the city . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush visit sign of closer us-german relations us president george w. bush heads to german chancellor angela merkel 's constituency in former east germany on thursday for a visit that underlines the improving ties between the two leaders .

his aim ?
to get to know merkel and other " real germans " better - if only security staff will let him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush pretends to eat an imaginary herring president bush 's stralsund visit got off to a sunny start on thursday when he was formally welcomed in the city square by german chancellor angela merkel .
the president shook hands with the smiling germans in the crowd , then accepted a small ceremonial barrel of herring , miming eating one of the fish in jest . " i bring a message from the american people : we 're honored to call the german people friends and allies , " the us president said .
" america and germany stand side by side . " the president touched down in germany late wednesday in the northern city of rostock en route to the group of eight summit of industrialized nations in st. petersburg , which merkel will also attend . following his welcome in stralsund , bush signed the town 's " golden book " before sitting down with merkel before a fireplace in the town hall for talks .
the two discussed the renewed violence between israel and lebanon , as well as how to respond to iran after it failed to respond to incentives aimed at ending an impassse over its nuclear program . the two-day stop in merkel 's constituency on the baltic sea coast is meant to give the two leaders time to get to know each other better , as well as show bush the " real germany . " during bush 's last visit to germany to the southwestern city of mainz in february 2005 , germans displayed their talent for thoroughness by effectively removing any signs of life from the city 's streets .
bush reportedly said himself that he thought the security precautions were exaggerated .
he is keen for his experience in stralsund to be different . but those in charge of security just ca n't help themselves , it seems .
for days now , helicopters have been circling over the stralsund while security personnel have been busy repeating precautions taken in mainz - welding shut manholes , sealing off letter boxes , and cordoning off the historic town center . will the real germans please stand up ? many locals and tourists in stralsund are less than amused at the way their lives have been turned upside down in order to ensure the safety of merkel 's prominent guest . " look at the shops here in the town center , " one tourist said .
" they 'll all be closed during the president 's stay .
we 're here on holiday and want to have a good time shopping , but they just wo n't let us . " " according to the politicians in berlin , the whole town should be happy to welcome the president , " a resident said .
" but then most of the people here are locked away from the president so as not to present a threat to him .
that does n't make any sense to me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this couple arrived early to meet bush in stralsund 's market square though bush got the desired contact with the locals during thursday 's market square welcome , he met a crowd of handpicked stralsunders who had undergone extensive background checks .
a quarter of the crowd was made up of students from the nearby naval academy .
critics say it was hardly an authentic encounter with the people of stralsund , most of whom - like merkel - experienced life under the communist east german regime and the transition to democracy following reunification .
many say it 's precisely that experience of recent history that makes merkel and her constituency so fascinating to the president . bonding over roast boar the president and the chancellor will have a further chance to bond over a wild game barbecue night in the nearby village of trinwillershagen .
meant to echo the type of informal barbecues the bushes frequently host at their texas ranch , the atmosphere of merkel 's grill party is planned to be " deliberately relaxed " - at least as relaxed as you can be with 12,000 police officers on alert all around you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters are being kept far from the action and , as was the case in mainz last year , bush 's visit to stralsund will also be accompanied by protest rallies .
an estimated 5,000 people intend to demonstrate against the us administration 's foreign policy , and especially , the ongoing conflict in iraq .
but they 'll mainly be protesting for their own satisfaction because just as in mainz , bush is unlikely to see any of the campaigners and protesters , who 've been relegated to the outskirts of the city . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush visit sign of closer us-german relations us president george w. bush heads to german chancellor angela merkel 's constituency in former east germany on thursday for a visit that underlines the improving ties between the two leaders .

it provides europe with an energy alternative to the middle east and russia . on thursday , the three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- baku-tbilisi-ceyhan -lrb- btc -rrb- pipeline project was opened at the turkish mediterranean port .
the event , however , is not only significant for british oil giant bp who is directing the pipeline project . attending the ceremony were leaders from over 20 countries in the region that are expected to profit from oil and gas revenues .
turkey , where the pipeline terminates , has an increasing appetite for energy , but the united states and europe also have a vested interest in the btc project also . " we understand very well the significance of the btc project and we have conducted delicate energy diplomacy for its successful implementation , " said turkish energy minister hilmi guler , adding that the pipeline " will not only bring turkey big economic benefits , but also huge political dividends . " bottlenecks and geopolitical hotspots being avoided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil giants are considering building refineries in ceyhan the 1760-kilometer pipeline , the second-longest in the world , will deliver more than a million barrels of oil per day by 2008 .
the oil comes from the central asian states of kazakhstan and azerbaijan .
the region used to be part of the former soviet union and that is why this pipeline is seen as having not only economic importance but political as well . for the united states , one of the pipeline 's main political backers , it is seen as a crucial step not only to unlocking urgently needed resources but also to giving the energy-rich region greater independence from its former russian master . crucially it avoids the volatile middle east , giving world markets an important alternative supply .
but the pipeline also breaks russia ’ s monopoly on the distribution of energy for former soviet union states . " the pipelines do not only bring energy security they bring hope , " said david gorokva , head of the georgian gas and oil corporation .
" countries like us are not secure despite the fact of the rose revolution , it is all going to die one day if there is no secure energy resources and i think we should take this into consideration . " political implications in caucasus great bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine and russia quarreled over gas prices this winter last winter , russia without warning doubled the prices of energy to both georgia and the ukraine after pro-russian administrations were ousted by mass protests .
russia claimed the price hike simply mirrored market prices , but washington blasted the move accusing moscow of strong-armed tactics .
europe at once felt very dependent on the goodwill of russia . both democratic and republican administrations have strongly backed the new pipeline as a means of breaking moscow 's iron grip on the region .
much to moscow 's irritation , us special forces have been sent to georgia to help protect the pipeline as the region is one of most volatile in the world . russia maintains a strong military presence in the caucasus region , which the pipeline passes through .
the region is strewn with ethnic rivalries and unresolved conflicts .
in georgia , there are two breakaway states , which fought georgian forces to a standstill in the 1990s .
an uneasy ceasefire also exists between neighboring armenia and azerbaijan . bildunterschrift : the pipeline runs through hotspots in the caucasus " this region has always been volatile if you look at the history and it still is and there is big potential for future conflicts , " said tatiana mitrova , an energy security expert and adviser to the russian presidency .
" there are many rivals who want to gain control over the region because it is the heart of eurasia , and it is the future growth road of all energy routes .
but i am afraid that as the whole political tension is getting stronger and stronger , tension in this region will also rise . " the success of the btc pipeline ultimately depends on the stability of one of world 's most volatile regions .
without stability , the long-term dreams of turkey and the us of opening up a secure east-west energy corridor that exports oil and gas and imports independence and security to former soviet states will remain unfulfilled . dorian jones -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe searches for alternatives to russian gas following the gas price row between russia and ukraine , europe is eyeing new pipeline projects and transportation methods to lessen its dependence on deliveries from russia .

it provides europe with an energy alternative to the middle east and russia . on thursday , the three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- baku-tbilisi-ceyhan -lrb- btc -rrb- pipeline project was opened at the turkish mediterranean port .
the event , however , is not only significant for british oil giant bp who is directing the pipeline project . attending the ceremony were leaders from over 20 countries in the region that are expected to profit from oil and gas revenues .
turkey , where the pipeline terminates , has an increasing appetite for energy , but the united states and europe also have a vested interest in the btc project also . " we understand very well the significance of the btc project and we have conducted delicate energy diplomacy for its successful implementation , " said turkish energy minister hilmi guler , adding that the pipeline " will not only bring turkey big economic benefits , but also huge political dividends . " bottlenecks and geopolitical hotspots being avoided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil giants are considering building refineries in ceyhan the 1760-kilometer pipeline , the second-longest in the world , will deliver more than a million barrels of oil per day by 2008 .
the oil comes from the central asian states of kazakhstan and azerbaijan .
the region used to be part of the former soviet union and that is why this pipeline is seen as having not only economic importance but political as well . for the united states , one of the pipeline 's main political backers , it is seen as a crucial step not only to unlocking urgently needed resources but also to giving the energy-rich region greater independence from its former russian master . crucially it avoids the volatile middle east , giving world markets an important alternative supply .
but the pipeline also breaks russia ’ s monopoly on the distribution of energy for former soviet union states . " the pipelines do not only bring energy security they bring hope , " said david gorokva , head of the georgian gas and oil corporation .
" countries like us are not secure despite the fact of the rose revolution , it is all going to die one day if there is no secure energy resources and i think we should take this into consideration . " political implications in caucasus great bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine and russia quarreled over gas prices this winter last winter , russia without warning doubled the prices of energy to both georgia and the ukraine after pro-russian administrations were ousted by mass protests .
russia claimed the price hike simply mirrored market prices , but washington blasted the move accusing moscow of strong-armed tactics .
europe at once felt very dependent on the goodwill of russia . both democratic and republican administrations have strongly backed the new pipeline as a means of breaking moscow 's iron grip on the region .
much to moscow 's irritation , us special forces have been sent to georgia to help protect the pipeline as the region is one of most volatile in the world . russia maintains a strong military presence in the caucasus region , which the pipeline passes through .
the region is strewn with ethnic rivalries and unresolved conflicts .
in georgia , there are two breakaway states , which fought georgian forces to a standstill in the 1990s .
an uneasy ceasefire also exists between neighboring armenia and azerbaijan . bildunterschrift : the pipeline runs through hotspots in the caucasus " this region has always been volatile if you look at the history and it still is and there is big potential for future conflicts , " said tatiana mitrova , an energy security expert and adviser to the russian presidency .
" there are many rivals who want to gain control over the region because it is the heart of eurasia , and it is the future growth road of all energy routes .
but i am afraid that as the whole political tension is getting stronger and stronger , tension in this region will also rise . " the success of the btc pipeline ultimately depends on the stability of one of world 's most volatile regions .
without stability , the long-term dreams of turkey and the us of opening up a secure east-west energy corridor that exports oil and gas and imports independence and security to former soviet states will remain unfulfilled . dorian jones -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe searches for alternatives to russian gas following the gas price row between russia and ukraine , europe is eyeing new pipeline projects and transportation methods to lessen its dependence on deliveries from russia .

and no , klinsi did n't perform a miracle by getting germany 's soccer team into third place at the world cup . the connection between the two is more mundane than that - it 's their cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-born pope 's former car last year , the golf that the german-born pope used to drive when he held the lesser position of cardinal ratzinger , sold on online bidding site ebay for the princely sum of nearly 190,000 euros . but although klinsi might be up there with god for some germans at the moment , it does n't mean besotted fans are ready to fork out quite so much for his vw beetle convertible .
after 68 bids on ebay , the car was passed in on tuesday night after the highest offer of 24,850 euros -lrb- $ 31,600 -rrb- lay underneath the undisclosed minimum price weekend bidding frenzy " not serious " at one stage over the weekend , it appeared that klinsmann devotees had gone completely nuts as the price spiralled to over 300,000 euros for a car that klinsmann himself said was a rust bucket .
but then ebay shut down the site because of what they said was " unserious bidding " and forced people to specially register for the auction . it 's uncertain if the current owner , who brought klinsmann 's beetle ten years ago from a dealer , is going to put the 39-year-old car back up for sale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann broke more than a few hearts when he stepped down as national coach this week but german soccer fans who are crying in their beer because they missed out on klinsi 's car , need n't worry .
german goal keeper jens lehman 's mercedes and the golf convertible once owned by german team manager oliver bierhoff are still up for grabs on ebay . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cashing in on klinsi what should germany 's new darling jürgen klinsmann do once the world cup is over ?
hold a garage sale as soon as possible .
it could make him millions , it seems .

his aim ?
to get to know merkel and other " real germans " better - if only security staff will let him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush pretends to eat an imaginary herring president bush 's stralsund visit got off to a sunny start on thursday when he was formally welcomed in the city square by german chancellor angela merkel .
the president shook hands with the smiling germans in the crowd , then accepted a small ceremonial barrel of herring , miming eating one of the fish in jest . " i bring a message from the american people : we 're honored to call the german people friends and allies , " the us president said .
" america and germany stand side by side . " the president touched down in germany late wednesday in the northern city of rostock en route to the group of eight summit of industrialized nations in st. petersburg , which merkel will also attend . following his welcome in stralsund , bush signed the town 's " golden book " before sitting down with merkel before a fireplace in the town hall for talks .
the two discussed the renewed violence between israel and lebanon , as well as how to respond to iran after it failed to respond to incentives aimed at ending an impassse over its nuclear program . the two-day stop in merkel 's constituency on the baltic sea coast is meant to give the two leaders time to get to know each other better , as well as show bush the " real germany . " during bush 's last visit to germany to the southwestern city of mainz in february 2005 , germans displayed their talent for thoroughness by effectively removing any signs of life from the city 's streets .
bush reportedly said himself that he thought the security precautions were exaggerated .
he is keen for his experience in stralsund to be different . but those in charge of security just ca n't help themselves , it seems .
for days now , helicopters have been circling over the stralsund while security personnel have been busy repeating precautions taken in mainz - welding shut manholes , sealing off letter boxes , and cordoning off the historic town center . will the real germans please stand up ? many locals and tourists in stralsund are less than amused at the way their lives have been turned upside down in order to ensure the safety of merkel 's prominent guest . " look at the shops here in the town center , " one tourist said .
" they 'll all be closed during the president 's stay .
we 're here on holiday and want to have a good time shopping , but they just wo n't let us . " " according to the politicians in berlin , the whole town should be happy to welcome the president , " a resident said .
" but then most of the people here are locked away from the president so as not to present a threat to him .
that does n't make any sense to me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this couple arrived early to meet bush in stralsund 's market square though bush got the desired contact with the locals during thursday 's market square welcome , he met a crowd of handpicked stralsunders who had undergone extensive background checks .
a quarter of the crowd was made up of students from the nearby naval academy .
critics say it was hardly an authentic encounter with the people of stralsund , most of whom - like merkel - experienced life under the communist east german regime and the transition to democracy following reunification .
many say it 's precisely that experience of recent history that makes merkel and her constituency so fascinating to the president . bonding over roast boar the president and the chancellor will have a further chance to bond over a wild game barbecue night in the nearby village of trinwillershagen .
meant to echo the type of informal barbecues the bushes frequently host at their texas ranch , the atmosphere of merkel 's grill party is planned to be " deliberately relaxed " - at least as relaxed as you can be with 12,000 police officers on alert all around you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters are being kept far from the action and , as was the case in mainz last year , bush 's visit to stralsund will also be accompanied by protest rallies .
an estimated 5,000 people intend to demonstrate against the us administration 's foreign policy , and especially , the ongoing conflict in iraq .
but they 'll mainly be protesting for their own satisfaction because just as in mainz , bush is unlikely to see any of the campaigners and protesters , who 've been relegated to the outskirts of the city . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush visit sign of closer us-german relations us president george w. bush heads to german chancellor angela merkel 's constituency in former east germany on thursday for a visit that underlines the improving ties between the two leaders .

but a new report says germany is falling behind in recognizing the principle of universal jurisdiction . this is when national courts prosecute grave crimes , even in cases where the victims and the suspected perpetrators are foreign citizens and the crimes took place in a different country .
offenses such as war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity fall into this category . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new study human rights watch 's recent report , " universal jurisdiction in europe : the state of the art , " finds that law-enforcement agencies in many european countries are increasingly willing to investigate and prosecute people suspected of grave international crimes . the report cites the examples of belgium 's national court , which in 2001 and again in 2005 convicted several rwandan citizens for crimes against humanity committed during rwanda 's 1994 civil war . international criminal court prompted the trend jürgen schurr , one of the report 's authors , said the founding of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague in 2002 kick-started the trend to recognize universal jurisdiction . schurr said these changes came about because european countries were legally bound to include in their national criminal code the offenses recognised by the icc . previously in germany , the maximum charge for people suspected of genocide was murder , which severely underestimated the gravity of many crimes , schurr said .
that situation changed with the introduction of germany 's code of crimes against international law in 2002 . the hrw report takes a close took at eight countries – belgium , denmark , germany , france , great britain , the netherlands , norway and spain . netherlands comes up trumps in hrw report netherlands and great britain receive the most glowing reports .
the dutch law enforcement agency has some 30 employees who work exclusively on international crimes cases . " there is a real political will to dedicate resources to allow for the prosecution of these crimes , " schurr said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internationale criminal court although great britain employs only two people to investigate international crimes , they are both placed in the anti-terror department of london 's metropolitan police .
the investigators have access to the department 's extensive resources and 300 staff members . germany , france lagging behind germany and france receive bad marks in the hrw report .
in france , it still is not possible to prosecute war crimes suspects because the offense is not recognized under french national law . both countries also dedicate few resources to investigating crimes of this severity . schurr found this surprising in germany 's case .
from 1993 to 2003 , the center for combating war crimes , based in the federal criminal police office , was actively investigating war crimes from the former yugoslavia .
now there 's only one person responsible for grave crimes , he says . inquiries fail on political grounds the german legal code provides an excellent basis for the prosecution of grave crimes , according to schurr .
but , he says , there is a lack of political will . " the federal prosecutor has been allowed a bigger latitude of judgement , " he said .
in other words , the court " can be , but does n't have to be , active . " schurr pointed to the situation in 2005 when germany 's constitutional court dismissed allegations that us defense secretary donald rumsfeld was responsible for the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal .
federal prosecutor kay nehm said german authorities could only pursue the case if us authorities refused to do so . new imperialism ? not everyone believes that the principle of universal jurisdiction is progressive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian tomuschat christian tomuschat , emeritus professor for human rights at berlin 's humboldt university , agreed that some countries have made " in-roads " and have even tried and sentenced war crime perpetrators .
but in reality , the concept is controversial , he said . tomuschat used the example of belgium , which he said seems to have laid claimed to the right to try international crimes at a national level . " that is presumptuous , and could be viewed by other countries as a new type of imperialism , " he said . tomuschat said the national prosecution of crimes against humanity or genocide should only be used as " a last resort .

but a new report says germany is falling behind in recognizing the principle of universal jurisdiction . this is when national courts prosecute grave crimes , even in cases where the victims and the suspected perpetrators are foreign citizens and the crimes took place in a different country .
offenses such as war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity fall into this category . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new study human rights watch 's recent report , " universal jurisdiction in europe : the state of the art , " finds that law-enforcement agencies in many european countries are increasingly willing to investigate and prosecute people suspected of grave international crimes . the report cites the examples of belgium 's national court , which in 2001 and again in 2005 convicted several rwandan citizens for crimes against humanity committed during rwanda 's 1994 civil war . international criminal court prompted the trend jürgen schurr , one of the report 's authors , said the founding of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague in 2002 kick-started the trend to recognize universal jurisdiction . schurr said these changes came about because european countries were legally bound to include in their national criminal code the offenses recognised by the icc . previously in germany , the maximum charge for people suspected of genocide was murder , which severely underestimated the gravity of many crimes , schurr said .
that situation changed with the introduction of germany 's code of crimes against international law in 2002 . the hrw report takes a close took at eight countries – belgium , denmark , germany , france , great britain , the netherlands , norway and spain . netherlands comes up trumps in hrw report netherlands and great britain receive the most glowing reports .

the investigators have access to the department 's extensive resources and 300 staff members . germany , france lagging behind germany and france receive bad marks in the hrw report .
in france , it still is not possible to prosecute war crimes suspects because the offense is not recognized under french national law . both countries also dedicate few resources to investigating crimes of this severity . schurr found this surprising in germany 's case .
from 1993 to 2003 , the center for combating war crimes , based in the federal criminal police office , was actively investigating war crimes from the former yugoslavia .
now there 's only one person responsible for grave crimes , he says . inquiries fail on political grounds the german legal code provides an excellent basis for the prosecution of grave crimes , according to schurr .
but , he says , there is a lack of political will . " the federal prosecutor has been allowed a bigger latitude of judgement , " he said .
in other words , the court " can be , but does n't have to be , active . " schurr pointed to the situation in 2005 when germany 's constitutional court dismissed allegations that us defense secretary donald rumsfeld was responsible for the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal .

" my biggest concern is whether or not actions taken will weaken the siniora government , " he said , referring to lebanese prime minister fuad siniora .
" democracy in lebanon is an important part of laying a foundation for peace in that region .
we have worked really hard to get syria out of lebanon . " worst violence in a decade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kiss for angela - bush arrived in stralsund late wednesday the american president was speaking from the eastern german town of stralsund on the baltic coast where he is meeting with german chancellor angela merkel before heading off to the g-8 summit in russia over the weekend . german chancellor angela merkel too called for a " de-escalation " of the conflict in the middle east - the worst cross border violence in a decade - after israeli fighter jets bombed lebanon 's only international airport and killed 28 civilians in a wave of retaliatory strikes over the killing and capture of soldiers by hezbollah guerrillas on wednesday . an israeli woman was also killed when hezbollah fired off a barrage of rockets across the volatile border , sending panicked residents of communities in northern israel into bomb shelters . merkel said the violence had been sparked by the capture of the soldiers , but added : " we can only call on everyone to stop the violence , to release the soldiers and to stop the rocket attacks on israel .

us companies are bringing funds and much needed jobs to the former communist region . president george bush on thursday is visiting angela merkel in stralsund on the baltic sea .
the german chancellor invited her american counterpart to her own electoral district in eastern germany , in part so he could form his own impressions of the " new " states nearly 16 years after german reunification . though unemployment is still uncomfortably high in the east - between 20 and 30 percent in stralsund - bush 's countrymen and women have been playing a significant role in the recovery of the eastern german economy .

still , sports doctors are looking to curb kung fu moves and fakers . not only was the 2006 world cup healthy for business in germany , it also proved healthy for the participants , reported the official sports doctors .

that is considerably fewer than in the 2002 world cup , where the average was 2.7 injuries per game .
for dvorak , it 's " an encouraging decline . " everything 's on tape " after every game we count up all the injuries that occurred .
we get it in writing from the doctors and afterward we watch the tape to see everything that led up to the injury .

only 11 occurred in 2006 , less than half the number of head injuries in 2002 . dvorak attributes the decline in injuries not only to referees but also to more advanced training methods .

team doctors were called to the field 156 times in this world cup , but only 88 of these cases constituted a real injury . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the refs ' dedication to fair play leads to fewer injuries dvorak also said he discovered a new kind of foul this year : " we certainly have to get a handle on the kung fu moves . " the medical committee plans to recommend harsher consequences for players who stick out their leg in the direction of another player 's upper body . in contrast to other sporting events ... the positive - or rather , negative - results of routine doping tests before and during the world cup rounded out the fifa medical report . " about 16 players from each team were tested at a time .

we get it in writing from the doctors and afterward we watch the tape to see everything that led up to the injury .
then we make a scientific assessment of it , " dvorak said . even minor abrasions and bruises were recorded .
in the 2006 world cup , only one fourth of the total injuries were severe enough that the affected player missed one or more games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was an average of 2.2 injuries per game less than half as many head injuries at the 2002 world cup in japan and korea , elbowing resulted in 25 head injuries , said dvorak .
concerted efforts were made to reduce the number this year . " fifa specifically instructed the referee committee and the referees to penalize incidences of elbowing , " dvorak said . fifa 's chief doctor said he believes the referees ' strict approach contributed to a reduction in head injuries .
only 11 occurred in 2006 , less than half the number of head injuries in 2002 . dvorak attributes the decline in injuries not only to referees but also to more advanced training methods .
the better a team is physically prepared for the championship , the smaller the chances are that the players will sustain injuries . it was for good reason that the fifa insisted on a total of six game-free weeks prior to the world cup . kung fu on the field despite the positive injury statistics , the fifa medical committee has a few recommendations for future soccer events , especially concerning injury simulations that break the flow of play .
team doctors were called to the field 156 times in this world cup , but only 88 of these cases constituted a real injury . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the refs ' dedication to fair play leads to fewer injuries dvorak also said he discovered a new kind of foul this year : " we certainly have to get a handle on the kung fu moves . " the medical committee plans to recommend harsher consequences for players who stick out their leg in the direction of another player 's upper body . in contrast to other sporting events ... the positive - or rather , negative - results of routine doping tests before and during the world cup rounded out the fifa medical report . " about 16 players from each team were tested at a time .
i think we can confidently say that there is no evidence of systematic doping in soccer , " dvorak said . that makes the 2006 world cup the third in a row without a single case of doping . tim brockmeier -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fifa committee responds to referee criticism the referees committee of fifa , world soccer 's governing body , rejected charges of poor officiating during the world cup and added that quality of refereeing has been higher than ever .

the two discussed the renewed violence between israel and lebanon , as well as how to respond to iran after it failed to respond to incentives aimed at ending an impassse over its nuclear program . the two-day stop in merkel 's constituency on the baltic sea coast is meant to give the two leaders time to get to know each other better , as well as show bush the " real germany .

but a new report says germany is falling behind in recognizing the principle of universal jurisdiction . this is when national courts prosecute grave crimes , even in cases where the victims and the suspected perpetrators are foreign citizens and the crimes took place in a different country .
offenses such as war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity fall into this category . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new study human rights watch 's recent report , " universal jurisdiction in europe : the state of the art , " finds that law-enforcement agencies in many european countries are increasingly willing to investigate and prosecute people suspected of grave international crimes . the report cites the examples of belgium 's national court , which in 2001 and again in 2005 convicted several rwandan citizens for crimes against humanity committed during rwanda 's 1994 civil war . international criminal court prompted the trend jürgen schurr , one of the report 's authors , said the founding of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague in 2002 kick-started the trend to recognize universal jurisdiction . schurr said these changes came about because european countries were legally bound to include in their national criminal code the offenses recognised by the icc . previously in germany , the maximum charge for people suspected of genocide was murder , which severely underestimated the gravity of many crimes , schurr said .
that situation changed with the introduction of germany 's code of crimes against international law in 2002 . the hrw report takes a close took at eight countries – belgium , denmark , germany , france , great britain , the netherlands , norway and spain . netherlands comes up trumps in hrw report netherlands and great britain receive the most glowing reports .
the dutch law enforcement agency has some 30 employees who work exclusively on international crimes cases . " there is a real political will to dedicate resources to allow for the prosecution of these crimes , " schurr said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internationale criminal court although great britain employs only two people to investigate international crimes , they are both placed in the anti-terror department of london 's metropolitan police .
the investigators have access to the department 's extensive resources and 300 staff members . germany , france lagging behind germany and france receive bad marks in the hrw report .
in france , it still is not possible to prosecute war crimes suspects because the offense is not recognized under french national law . both countries also dedicate few resources to investigating crimes of this severity . schurr found this surprising in germany 's case .
from 1993 to 2003 , the center for combating war crimes , based in the federal criminal police office , was actively investigating war crimes from the former yugoslavia .
now there 's only one person responsible for grave crimes , he says . inquiries fail on political grounds the german legal code provides an excellent basis for the prosecution of grave crimes , according to schurr .
but , he says , there is a lack of political will . " the federal prosecutor has been allowed a bigger latitude of judgement , " he said .
in other words , the court " can be , but does n't have to be , active . " schurr pointed to the situation in 2005 when germany 's constitutional court dismissed allegations that us defense secretary donald rumsfeld was responsible for the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal .
federal prosecutor kay nehm said german authorities could only pursue the case if us authorities refused to do so . new imperialism ? not everyone believes that the principle of universal jurisdiction is progressive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian tomuschat christian tomuschat , emeritus professor for human rights at berlin 's humboldt university , agreed that some countries have made " in-roads " and have even tried and sentenced war crime perpetrators .
but in reality , the concept is controversial , he said . tomuschat used the example of belgium , which he said seems to have laid claimed to the right to try international crimes at a national level . " that is presumptuous , and could be viewed by other countries as a new type of imperialism , " he said . tomuschat said the national prosecution of crimes against humanity or genocide should only be used as " a last resort .

" america and germany stand side by side . " " we share common values and common interests .
we want to work together to keep the peace .
we want to work together to promote freedom .
there 's so much we can do , working together , " he said . the visit was marked by good spirits and humor as bush accepted a small ceremonial barrel of herring and jokingly mimed eating one of the fish . " this is a very good opportunity , indeed , to say a word of thanks , " a beaming merkel said .
" we owe you a big debt of gratitude for being able to finally live within one country in peace and freedom ; one country - germany . " leaders urge restraint in mideast at a joint public appearance later , the two leaders accused the lebanon-based hezbollah movement of sparking some of the worst middle east violence in a decade by abducting israeli soldiers and firing rockets at targets inside israel . bush pointedly defended israel 's " right to defend herself " but urged restraint , saying that " whatever israel does should not weaken " the fragile government of lebanese prime minister fuad siniora . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke rises from an israeli air raid that targeted a bridge in the zahrani region in lebanon " my biggest concern is whether or not actions taken will weaken the siniora government , " he said .
" democracy in lebanon is an important part of laying a foundation for peace in that region . " " the attacks did not start from the israeli side , but from hezbollah 's side , " said merkel .
" we call on the powers in the region to seek to bring about a de-escalation of the situation . " losing patience with iran ? the two leaders jointly warned iran that they were taking the dispute over tehran 's nuclear program to the un security council and urged the islamic republic to freeze sensitive atomic activities as a precondition for talks . " i truly think they 're trying to wait us out .
they think it 's a matter of time before people lose their nerve , " bush said .
" i think they 're going to be disappointed that this coalition is a lot firmer than they think . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad in front of a picture of iran 's ayatollah ali khamenei referring to a decision on wednesday by the five un veto powers and germany to pass the iranian nuclear dossier to the un security council , merkel said time was running out . " we have waited patiently and we have had no workable response from iran .
we have to see what the next steps will be if iran continues to remain silent , " said merkel .
" this may include sanctions . " no lectures for putin the meeting came a day before bush was to head to russia for weekend talks with president vladimir putin and the july 15-17 group of eight summit of industrialized nations . bush said he would not lecture putin publicly when they meet on what washington says is moscow 's backsliding from democracy , but stressed that non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- must be allowed to operate in russia " without intimidation " from the kremlin .

" america and germany stand side by side . " " we share common values and common interests .
we want to work together to keep the peace .
we want to work together to promote freedom .
there 's so much we can do , working together , " he said . the visit was marked by good spirits and humor as bush accepted a small ceremonial barrel of herring and jokingly mimed eating one of the fish . " this is a very good opportunity , indeed , to say a word of thanks , " a beaming merkel said .
" we owe you a big debt of gratitude for being able to finally live within one country in peace and freedom ; one country - germany . " leaders urge restraint in mideast at a joint public appearance later , the two leaders accused the lebanon-based hezbollah movement of sparking some of the worst middle east violence in a decade by abducting israeli soldiers and firing rockets at targets inside israel . bush pointedly defended israel 's " right to defend herself " but urged restraint , saying that " whatever israel does should not weaken " the fragile government of lebanese prime minister fuad siniora . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke rises from an israeli air raid that targeted a bridge in the zahrani region in lebanon " my biggest concern is whether or not actions taken will weaken the siniora government , " he said .
" democracy in lebanon is an important part of laying a foundation for peace in that region . " " the attacks did not start from the israeli side , but from hezbollah 's side , " said merkel .
" we call on the powers in the region to seek to bring about a de-escalation of the situation . " losing patience with iran ? the two leaders jointly warned iran that they were taking the dispute over tehran 's nuclear program to the un security council and urged the islamic republic to freeze sensitive atomic activities as a precondition for talks . " i truly think they 're trying to wait us out .
they think it 's a matter of time before people lose their nerve , " bush said .
" i think they 're going to be disappointed that this coalition is a lot firmer than they think . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad in front of a picture of iran 's ayatollah ali khamenei referring to a decision on wednesday by the five un veto powers and germany to pass the iranian nuclear dossier to the un security council , merkel said time was running out . " we have waited patiently and we have had no workable response from iran .
we have to see what the next steps will be if iran continues to remain silent , " said merkel .
" this may include sanctions . " no lectures for putin the meeting came a day before bush was to head to russia for weekend talks with president vladimir putin and the july 15-17 group of eight summit of industrialized nations . bush said he would not lecture putin publicly when they meet on what washington says is moscow 's backsliding from democracy , but stressed that non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- must be allowed to operate in russia " without intimidation " from the kremlin .

and no , klinsi did n't perform a miracle by getting germany 's soccer team into third place at the world cup . the connection between the two is more mundane than that - it 's their cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-born pope 's former car last year , the golf that the german-born pope used to drive when he held the lesser position of cardinal ratzinger , sold on online bidding site ebay for the princely sum of nearly 190,000 euros . but although klinsi might be up there with god for some germans at the moment , it does n't mean besotted fans are ready to fork out quite so much for his vw beetle convertible .
after 68 bids on ebay , the car was passed in on tuesday night after the highest offer of 24,850 euros -lrb- $ 31,600 -rrb- lay underneath the undisclosed minimum price weekend bidding frenzy " not serious " at one stage over the weekend , it appeared that klinsmann devotees had gone completely nuts as the price spiralled to over 300,000 euros for a car that klinsmann himself said was a rust bucket .
but then ebay shut down the site because of what they said was " unserious bidding " and forced people to specially register for the auction . it 's uncertain if the current owner , who brought klinsmann 's beetle ten years ago from a dealer , is going to put the 39-year-old car back up for sale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann broke more than a few hearts when he stepped down as national coach this week but german soccer fans who are crying in their beer because they missed out on klinsi 's car , need n't worry .

" the commission will analyze the ruling very carefully and decide after thorough consideration which consequences to draw , " said spokesman for competition issues jonathan todd . sony and bmg 's parent company , bertelsmann , will now have seven days to formally seek brussels ' permission for the merger , which eu regulators would then have to review again under current market conditions , he said . todd said that if in the hypothetical case that regulators were to rule against the merger , then it " would have to be reversed . " merger created second largest music company bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the merger brought together client lists including stars such as beyonce knowles und christina aguilera in reaction to the court 's decision , bertelsmann said : " today 's judgment does not affect the validity of the sony bmg joint venture , which has been up and running since august 2004 - after having been notified and investigated by the european commission . " " we are studying the judgement carefully and shall discuss the appropriate next steps with the european commission . " the merger of the music business of japanese electronics and entertainment group sony with german media group bertelsmann 's bmg unit created the second-biggest company in the music market after universal . headquartered in new york city and owned equally by sony and bertelsmann , sony bmg has contracts with stars ranging from acdc to zz top , as well as bruce springsteen , oasis and placido domingo . the independent producers ' association impala protested that such a concentration of power would leave the music majors with a stranglehold on cd prices and artists ' contractual terms and asked the court to review the decision . merger approved in 2004 the european commission approved the merger in july 2004 even though it acknowledged that the deal would leave four major players in the market - universal , sony-bmg , warner and emi . the court ruled that the commission 's antitrust busters had carried out an " extremely cursory examination " of the deal . a lawyer for impala voiced satisfaction with the court 's decision , which she said showed that regulators had made " manifest errors . " " for us , the commission committed manifest errors of judgement because it did not do the necessary research to show the absence of a collective dominant position , " the lawyer said . impala has long fought against greater concentration in the music business and recently slammed warner and emi for trying to take each other over . however , the lobbying group 's eagerness for a quick ruling on sony bmg irritated the judges , who ordered it to pay a quarter of the procedure 's costs as a result . the commission and the companies have two months to lodge an appeal against the decision . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : bertelsmann preparing to sell stake in sony bmg german media giant bertelsmann is making preparations to sell its music company holdings including a 50 percent stake in sony bmg , the world 's second-largest music group , a report said monday .

" america and germany stand side by side . " " we share common values and common interests .
we want to work together to keep the peace .
we want to work together to promote freedom .
there 's so much we can do , working together , " he said . the visit was marked by good spirits and humor as bush accepted a small ceremonial barrel of herring and jokingly mimed eating one of the fish . " this is a very good opportunity , indeed , to say a word of thanks , " a beaming merkel said .
" we owe you a big debt of gratitude for being able to finally live within one country in peace and freedom ; one country - germany . " leaders urge restraint in mideast at a joint public appearance later , the two leaders accused the lebanon-based hezbollah movement of sparking some of the worst middle east violence in a decade by abducting israeli soldiers and firing rockets at targets inside israel . bush pointedly defended israel 's " right to defend herself " but urged restraint , saying that " whatever israel does should not weaken " the fragile government of lebanese prime minister fuad siniora . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke rises from an israeli air raid that targeted a bridge in the zahrani region in lebanon " my biggest concern is whether or not actions taken will weaken the siniora government , " he said .
" democracy in lebanon is an important part of laying a foundation for peace in that region . " " the attacks did not start from the israeli side , but from hezbollah 's side , " said merkel .
" we call on the powers in the region to seek to bring about a de-escalation of the situation . " losing patience with iran ? the two leaders jointly warned iran that they were taking the dispute over tehran 's nuclear program to the un security council and urged the islamic republic to freeze sensitive atomic activities as a precondition for talks . " i truly think they 're trying to wait us out .
they think it 's a matter of time before people lose their nerve , " bush said .
" i think they 're going to be disappointed that this coalition is a lot firmer than they think . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad in front of a picture of iran 's ayatollah ali khamenei referring to a decision on wednesday by the five un veto powers and germany to pass the iranian nuclear dossier to the un security council , merkel said time was running out . " we have waited patiently and we have had no workable response from iran .
we have to see what the next steps will be if iran continues to remain silent , " said merkel .
" this may include sanctions . " no lectures for putin the meeting came a day before bush was to head to russia for weekend talks with president vladimir putin and the july 15-17 group of eight summit of industrialized nations . bush said he would not lecture putin publicly when they meet on what washington says is moscow 's backsliding from democracy , but stressed that non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- must be allowed to operate in russia " without intimidation " from the kremlin . " nobody really likes to be lectured a lot .
and , therefore , if you want to be an effective person , what you do n't do is scold the person publicly all the time , " the us president said .
" i 'll be firm in my beliefs in certain democratic institutions , i 'll be firm in my belief about the need for there to be an active civil society , and ngos should be allowed to function in russia without intimidation , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has no plans to lecture putin when he meets him in russia merkel urged russia to ratify the international energy charter giving greater access to pipelines and energy supplies , which she said would provide " greater security " to world energy supplies . " we have different ideas about how a pluralist society , a democratic society ought to work ; that there ought to be a strong opposition is certainly one of the realities of life , " said merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush was looking forward to tucking into this wild boar later in the evening the press conference was not all serious : in response to one reporter 's questions about middle east violence and iran 's nuclear program , bush joked about plans for an evening barbecue with merkel at a neighboring village which was to feature a wild boar caught in the region 's woods .

us companies are bringing funds and much needed jobs to the former communist region . president george bush on thursday is visiting angela merkel in stralsund on the baltic sea .
the german chancellor invited her american counterpart to her own electoral district in eastern germany , in part so he could form his own impressions of the " new " states nearly 16 years after german reunification . though unemployment is still uncomfortably high in the east - between 20 and 30 percent in stralsund - bush 's countrymen and women have been playing a significant role in the recovery of the eastern german economy .
american investors are attracted to the central european region , primarily because of its opportune geographical location , and numerous american companies have written their success stories there . billions from the us since reunification " the us is the most important investor in the east german states , " said the american ambassador to germany , william r. timken .
" american companies employ nearly 40,000 people there and we americans are an important part of the eastern german economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet auction site e-bay is a california based company that has put down roots in east germany after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 and german reunification in 1990 , around 400 american companies set up shop in former east germany - from dow chemical , e-bay and general motors to coca-cola , goodyear and smaller businesses , too . american companies have since invested a total of 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.7 billion -rrb- in the east german economy . gateway to the east its proximity to new eastern european , southeastern european and asian markets makes former east germany particularly attractive to american investors , said wolfgang tiefensee , federal minister for the new german states . " the new german states serve as a gateway to these new markets for the investors , " he said . however , geography is not the only plus to investing in former east germany . " germany offers security : legal security and financial security for the investment , " tiefensee said .
" and that gives it an advantage over other countries . " us chip maker in saxony 's micro-electronic cluster amd , the world 's leading producer of computer chips next to intel , is one of the american companies that have invested in eastern germany .
they came to saxony , which even during communist times had been a hub for the micro-electronic industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amd opened its largest semi-conductor plant outside the us in dresden in 1999 wages are lower in saxony than in western germany , as is the case in all five new states .
the labor market is also more flexible and cities with major universities , like dresden in saxony , have highly qualified specialists . amd manager hans deppe has n't regretted the move to saxony and has a positive outlook on the future , in spite of challenging market conditions . competition on the global market " we face global competition in the semi-conductor industry , which is not limited to just the european union , " deppe said .
" what has been built up in the micro-electronic cluster in saxony has so much potential that we are going to see growth in the future .
i 'm certain of that . " at amd , growth is well underway : the chip producer recently announced plans to invest an additional $ 2.5 billion in its dresden plant .
twenty percent of that will come from the german taxpayers in the form of investment bonuses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxony is one of germany 's 16 federal states state subsidies are yet another alluring aspect of investing in former east germany .
the european union , the federal government and the new german states all seek to attract potential investors by offering investment bonuses and tax breaks . federal government seeks to cut red tape even if the advantages of investment in eastern germany seem to outweigh the disadvantages , there are a few drawbacks the new states will have to resolve if they want to enhance their global competitiveness . issues like recognizing american drivers ' licenses in germany or providing language training for employees are among the less formidable hurdles , but excessive bureaucracy is more critical . " germany still has the reputation of being overly bureaucratic , having too many rules and too much red tape , " tiefensee said .
" that 's something we have to deal with and the federal government is doing that through de-bureaucratizing and by accelerating planning processes .

wiltshire county council has agreed plans for 50,000 tonnes per year of household waste to be sent to a new energy-from-waste plant near slough .
the 25-year contract is part of the council 's long term waste strategy to divert waste from landfill sites .
wiltshire currently recycles 39 % of its waste - the rest is buried in landfill at compton bassett near calne .
the contract , due to start in 2008 , will see eight lorry-loads of waste travelling to colnbrook for incineration a day .
a council spokesman said plans for a mechanical and biological treatment plant near westbury are still to be finalised .

bbc news ' christopher sleight went to see the " blast " truck in cardiff .
hannah ebdon is standing with a microphone in one hand and a clipboard in the other , rapping about a girl who has a crush on a boy .
it 's the first time the 17-year-old from bridgend has written or performed a rap - let alone in front of a group .
she 's nervous , but gains confidence as the audience shows its appreciation .
hannah has spent the morning in the beat box workshop at the bbc 's mobile " blast " studio at britannia quay in cardiff bay .
under the tutelage of daniel johnson and neeco katis - both 17 and students at cardiff 's immtech college - she has written and performed her first rap .
" when they said you have got to do 16 bars , i thought no , i wo n't do that , but i did , " says hannah , an a-level student at brynteg school in bridgend .
" i had to think of a word describing how i was feeling and then write it at the end of the sentence . "
fellow pupil sian rowlands , 17 , was also pleased with her progress during the workshop .
" i 'm quite surprised i wrote so much in the time we had - i did n't think i would be able to write so much , " she says .
but multimedia students daniel and neeco are n't so surprised - they reckon they can teach anyone to rap .
" just keep it simple , " says daniel .
" start with the basics .
start with a word , think of a subject and put it into a rhyming sentence . "
the beat box workshop is just one of many available in the bbc 's 40-ft blast truck , now on its sixth stop of a tour of venues across the uk .
youngsters can also try their hand at animation , sports commentary or mixing their own cd - or take part in a drama workshop .
blast co-ordinator for bbc wales , susan wood , says it is an effective way to connect with younger audiences - and can give young talent access to bbc expertise and technology .
" it 's to give them an insight into what we do - and give them the opportunity to work alongside bbc staff and mentors , " she said .
budding journalists , poets , rappers , film makers or animators are all welcome at the truck .
many of the performances are filmed or recorded and then placed on the bbc blast website .
and on thursday , pupils will film an item which will then be broadcast on the bbc 's welsh language news programme ffeil , shown on s4c .
meanwhile , in the sports box , two willows high school pupils are preparing to commentate on a graham kavanagh free kick for cardiff city against leeds .
peter hewett goes first - after stipulating he will try commentating on football as long as it 's " nothing to do with swansea " .
it 's another nervous start , but he 's soon into the swing of it : " kavanagh runs up , swings it into the box ...
one-nil to cardiff , and it 's a quality goal ! "

the newtown race , which has seen hundreds of santas run around the streets of newtown every december since 2001 , has been cancelled for a year .
but supporters of hope house , which has hospices in conwy and shropshire , has decided to set up its own run .
the hope house run will take place on 3 december in oswestry , shropshire .
the 4.5 mile -lrb- 7.2km -rrb- run in newtown set a world record in 2004 when 4,260 racers dressed as santa claus competed , but a new record was set in liverpool last year .
last month dial-a-ride , the charity behind the event , said it wanted to focus on its transport service this year instead of the run .
it intends to bring the race back to the town in december 2007 .
fight flared the event has benefited 900 different charities and raised £ 350,000 , but attracted unwelcome headlines in 2004 when a fight flared eight hours after the event and five men were fined .
hope house , whose supporters have competed in the newtown run in the past , said it wanted to break the world record for the most runners dressed as santa .
charity appeals director nuala o 'kane said : " we were due to be one of the newtown santa run 's nominated charities for this year and many of our supporters were really looking forward to taking part , so when we heard it was cancelled we decided to come to the rescue and hold our own event .
" every entrant will be given a santa suit to run in and we are planning a number of added attractions to the day to make it a really special event . "

it would also mark a shift in monetary policy , away from tackling deflation .

but is superman 's comeback worth the wait ?
crushing disappointment .
mind-numbing tedium .
a sense of outrage at having cherished childhood memories trampled and corrupted .
but that 's enough about star wars : episode i - the phantom menace .
what about superman returns ?
director bryan singer knew he had a challenge on his hands reviving a character indelibly associated with the late christopher reeve , who so memorably donned the iconic cape and tights between 1978 and 1987 .
in truth , however , the man of steel has been pretty much moribund since reeve 's abortive last outing in superman iv : the quest for peace .
yes , he has enjoyed small-screen success in the new adventures of superman and cape-less tv prequel smallville .
but the tortuous process of bringing him back to the big screen - with everyone from nicolas cage to jude law linked to the role at one stage or another - only showed how tough it was to escape reeve 's looming shadow .
obsolescent singer 's solution is not to dodge that association , but to embrace it .
picking up where reeve 's first two superman movies left off , the x-men director presents an irony-free action adventure that merges state-of-the-art technology with dewy-eyed nostalgia .
from john williams ' theme tune to marlon brando 's posthumous cameo , we are never far from the comfort of the familiar .
and like director richard donner before him , singer casts an unknown actor in the lead - the personable , if conspicuously reeve-like , brandon routh .
as the title suggests , superman returns has the invincible icon arrive back on earth after five years in space searching for the remains of his home planet krypton .
in his absence , however , metropolis has learned to live without his heroics , with even ex-girlfriend lois lane -lrb- kate bosworth -rrb- declaring him obsolescent .
the daily planet 's ace newshound is forced to eat her words when a space shuttle launch goes explosively awry , with only superman 's 11th-hour intervention saving her from a fiery demise .
but even he finds his powers wanting when confronted with lex luthor 's latest scheme to create real estate from nothing using stolen krypton crystals .
angst-ridden internet scuttlebutt that singer 's film would have a gay subtext similar to that of his x-men films proves to be way off the mark .
more apparent , however , is the religious undercurrent , with superman painted as a troubled messiah here to redeem and , if necessary , die for mankind .
whether yearning for his home world or pining for the newly engaged lois , this is a much more angst-ridden portrayal than we are used to seeing .
thank goodness , then , for kevin spacey , who brings a glee and relish to luthor 's larger-than-life villainy that compensates for the slightly sombre whole .
in terms of effects and spectacle , superman returns tops all of its predecessors with extravagant set-pieces featuring the latest digital trickery .
it also boasts a strong cast , with routh and bosworth 's relative inexperience balanced by the seasoned likes of frank langella and eva marie saint .
parker posey also has some hilarious moments and all of the best lines as luthor 's ditzy partner-in-crime , kitty kowalski .
the result , then , is the kind of spirited , satisfying follow-up that the phantom menace should have been but was n't .
it remains to be seen , though , whether the people who thrilled to reeve 's exploits three decades ago will come out in sufficient numbers to reward singer 's retro gambit - especially one that clocks in at a somewhat extravagant two-and-a-half hours .
superman returns opens in the uk on 14 july .

in papers filed at los angeles superior court on 3 july and seen by the ap news agency , debbie rowe seeks an immediate payment of $ 195,000 -lrb- £ 106,000 -rrb- .
she also requests $ 50,000 -lrb- £ 27,250 -rrb- in living expenses so she can pursue a child custody case against jackson .
rowe is the mother of his two children , now aged eight and nine .
in a 2001 agreement , she waived all access rights to the children , prince michael and paris .
debbie rowe testified at jackson 's child abuse trial last year but she went to court in 2004 to have that decision reversed and is now fighting for custody of the pair .
last year , rowe , who divorced jackson in 1999 , testified at the singer 's child abuse trial , praising him as a " great father " .
but in her new legal action , she claims he stopped making the promised payments in october 2003 .
' easily influenced ' jackson , 47 , is also being sued by a former business associate , marc schaffel , who claims he is owed $ 3.8m -lrb- £ 2.1m -rrb- .
the jury in that case in santa monica , california , heard closing arguments on wednesday and is expected to retire on thursday .
mr schaffel 's attorney howard king called jackson a " cagey , calculating witness " who feigned forgetfulness in videotaped depositions shown to the jury .
the pop star 's own legal representative has painted a different portrait of the troubled singer .

the deals mean that visitors will be able to watch wimbledon matches , documentaries and sitcoms via the google video site .
the partners have been signed up as google launches eight new versions of the clip-sharing site .
france , germany , italy , poland , the netherlands , spain , the uk and canada now have national versions .
clip shop although google video launched in april 2005 the service has been eclipsed by the success of rivals such as youtube which let people post and share clips .
before now , all of google 's video offerings , which include clips made by amateurs as well as content from broadcasters and movie makers , have run off the us site .
google hopes that the eight national editions will grow to reflect the likes of the countries each site serves - visitors can rate videos to help sort which ones are the most popular .
included in the list of partners are itn , wimbledon video rights holder img media , the cousteau society , talkback thames , buena vista international , fc barcelona and france 's national audiovisual archive .
the deals with the series of partners are intended to tempt people to visit the google site and get them watching .
those posting video to the site , whether they are movie makers or amateurs , can decide whether to charge for the clips .
to help pay for the site google runs adverts alongside videos that are posted .

the deals mean that visitors will be able to watch wimbledon matches , documentaries and sitcoms via the google video site .
the partners have been signed up as google launches eight new versions of the clip-sharing site .
france , germany , italy , poland , the netherlands , spain , the uk and canada now have national versions .
clip shop although google video launched in april 2005 the service has been eclipsed by the success of rivals such as youtube which let people post and share clips .
before now , all of google 's video offerings , which include clips made by amateurs as well as content from broadcasters and movie makers , have run off the us site .
google hopes that the eight national editions will grow to reflect the likes of the countries each site serves - visitors can rate videos to help sort which ones are the most popular .
included in the list of partners are itn , wimbledon video rights holder img media , the cousteau society , talkback thames , buena vista international , fc barcelona and france 's national audiovisual archive .
the deals with the series of partners are intended to tempt people to visit the google site and get them watching .
those posting video to the site , whether they are movie makers or amateurs , can decide whether to charge for the clips .
to help pay for the site google runs adverts alongside videos that are posted .

this is a practice whereby builders can exploit planning loopholes to pull down family homes , so that they can replace them with flats , and it 's rife in the south east .
it would appear to be a win-win situation , the builders make money on multiple occupancy housing , the council keep up the numbers of new build properties without encroaching on the green belt and the home owner pockets a tidy sum for the sale of the land .
homes built on site of existing houses , 2004 tandridge 68 % tunbridge wells 47 % wealden 44 % rother 39 % crawley 48 % local opposition in 2004 -lrb- the most recent available figures -rrb- the national average of new homes built on the site of old ones was 15 % but in our region the figures are much higher , ranging from 40 % to nearly 70 % .
some figures suggest that one in four new houses in the south east is on a ' garden grab ' development .
in brighton , chris eubank 's former homes are in the process of being demolished to make way for flats and , not surprisingly , not everyone is happy about it .
why has this suddenly become an issue ?
well , apart from the pressure for new homes in the south east ; the practice exploits a legal loophole defining gardens as brownfield sites which means that they are classified -lrb- in planning terms -rrb- in the same category as disused gas works and industrial sites .
developers are offering home owners - especially those with large gardens - inflated prices for their properties with the intention of building flats on the land and turning a large profit .
neighbours usually object but the local authorities are reluctant to turn down planning applications partly because they regularly lose on appeal and partly because there is a presumption that the government prioritises brownfield development .
private members bill enter greg clarke , mp for tunbridge wells and his private members bill - the protection of private gardens .
essentially mr clarke wants gardens removed from the definition of brownfield sites and the power of decision making returned to the local authority .
with the support of david cameron and at least 40 labour mps , the bill has its second reading in the house .
the programme comes live from the back garden of a house whose owners say they are affected by garden grabbing .
greg clarke and a number of interested parties will be joining us to discuss how the second reading went and whether it is a serious issue or just another case of nimbyism .
profit or preservation ?
should homeowners be allowed to turn their plots into flats ?

their task was to recreate the parliamentary chamber , take on the roles of government , opposition and backbench mps and make a 20 minute video of their debate of a mock bill .
this week the winners attended the real house to collect their prize and meet the politicians and peers followed by tea at number 10 .
sam dobin is checking out the accommodation as he also won best prime minister .
however , he says that he will cast his first vote not for tony blair but for the conservatives just as long as " david cameron does n't get any fluffier . "

this is a practice whereby builders can exploit planning loopholes to pull down family homes , so that they can replace them with flats , and it 's rife in the south east .
it would appear to be a win-win situation , the builders make money on multiple occupancy housing , the council keep up the numbers of new build properties without encroaching on the green belt and the home owner pockets a tidy sum for the sale of the land .
homes built on site of existing houses , 2004 tandridge 68 % tunbridge wells 47 % wealden 44 % rother 39 % crawley 48 % local opposition in 2004 -lrb- the most recent available figures -rrb- the national average of new homes built on the site of old ones was 15 % but in our region the figures are much higher , ranging from 40 % to nearly 70 % .
some figures suggest that one in four new houses in the south east is on a ' garden grab ' development .
in brighton , chris eubank 's former homes are in the process of being demolished to make way for flats and , not surprisingly , not everyone is happy about it .
why has this suddenly become an issue ?
well , apart from the pressure for new homes in the south east ; the practice exploits a legal loophole defining gardens as brownfield sites which means that they are classified -lrb- in planning terms -rrb- in the same category as disused gas works and industrial sites .
developers are offering home owners - especially those with large gardens - inflated prices for their properties with the intention of building flats on the land and turning a large profit .
neighbours usually object but the local authorities are reluctant to turn down planning applications partly because they regularly lose on appeal and partly because there is a presumption that the government prioritises brownfield development .
private members bill enter greg clarke , mp for tunbridge wells and his private members bill - the protection of private gardens .
essentially mr clarke wants gardens removed from the definition of brownfield sites and the power of decision making returned to the local authority .
with the support of david cameron and at least 40 labour mps , the bill has its second reading in the house .
the programme comes live from the back garden of a house whose owners say they are affected by garden grabbing .
greg clarke and a number of interested parties will be joining us to discuss how the second reading went and whether it is a serious issue or just another case of nimbyism .
profit or preservation ?
should homeowners be allowed to turn their plots into flats ?

looking to the future the simon langton school in canterbury has won the national youth parliament competition organised by the citizenship foundation .
their task was to recreate the parliamentary chamber , take on the roles of government , opposition and backbench mps and make a 20 minute video of their debate of a mock bill .
this week the winners attended the real house to collect their prize and meet the politicians and peers followed by tea at number 10 .
sam dobin is checking out the accommodation as he also won best prime minister .
however , he says that he will cast his first vote not for tony blair but for the conservatives just as long as " david cameron does n't get any fluffier . "
meanwhile , in michael howard 's constituency , they are in the process of selecting a new candidate .
we ask the winner onto the programme and ask sam what he makes of the new folkestone candidate and what he thinks the tories need to do to return the south east to its true blue origins .

tessa jowell is talking up british tax breaks , talent and locations ms jowell has been in los angeles this week , talking up the uk 's latest tax incentives for film-makers .
" i am unashamedly here to argue for the uk and the new tax regime , " she tells the bbc news website .
accompanied by british film commissioner steve norris , the culture secretary has been meeting almost all of the major movie studios - including warner bros , disney and universal .
the uk is offering a tax break to production companies that choose to film in britain .
" it encourages uk films to be made in the uk , and those films can of course be made by american production companies , " ms jowell explains .
mr norris adds : " if you make a tax-qualifying film in the uk , it 's worth about 15 % of the budget .
a lot of other countries compete for these very large films and that can often make the difference . "
competition between countries vying for hollywood business has never been more intense .
' fantastic scenery ' offers of tax relief are common , but the uk is also emphasising an all-round package of incentives to woo film-makers .
the new harry potter film will be filmed in the uk this year " this is one of the most tax-sympathetic places to make films , " says ms jowell .
" the technical support is better than any other and we have fantastic locations .
" london is perhaps the film centre , but if you look beyond hollywood to bollywood movies , leicester , the east midlands are all trying to develop a base for the production and post-production of those bollywood films .
" take the west country , take yorkshire , take the diversity of birmingham , take liverpool .
quite honestly , you 're spoilt for choice . "
hollywood developed as the movie-making capital of the world largely because of its picture-perfect climate .
the same is unlikely to be said of britain .
but tessa jowell argues that " most stories are not written against a background of continuous sunshine " .
" what we can offer is a range of climates and a fantastic range of scenery , " she says .
the uk has become a player again in terms of the international marketplace for film production paul steinke walt disney pictures mr norris adds : " the package is the actors in front of the camera , our technicians , our visual effects , our designers .
it 's all those things together in a package that is cost-effective . "
according to paul steinke , senior vice president of production finance at walt disney pictures , the uk has " always been a premiere location " .
in recent years , though , " it has become a player again in terms of the international marketplace for film production " .
' level playing field ' ms jowell is also focusing on the video game and music businesses during her trip to california .
the culture secretary says she is concerned that the british video games industry is losing post-production work to the us and plans to travel to san francisco to speak to gaming executives .
dido is one of the few british artists to achieve success in the us ms jowell says she also wants to get to the bottom of why british musicians so rarely achieve success in the us charts .
" it 's not through lack of talent , " she says .
" after all , we are the country of dido and coldplay .
" what we want to understand is more about the practical obstacles for artists coming to perform here , and one seems to be the restrictions on visas and the length of time it takes to get them .
" it 's much easier for sportsmen and women to get visas than it is musicians .
it 's not exactly a level playing field .
" we need to be able to remove those obstacles in order that our artists can come here and thrill american audiences as they do audiences at home . "
