program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.01.2006 trade-fair know-how is hot german export großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the world leader in trade fairs german manufacturers are n't the only ones fighting to boost exports .
trade fairs are increasingly moving overseas , and insiders say it 's a win-win situation . germany has long been known as a country of trade fairs .
two thirds of the world 's leading trade fairs are held in the country , including big-name events like the cebit digital solutions fair in hanover , the international motor show in frankfurt , and the anuga food fair in cologne .
but the number of fairs held in germany has hovered steadily around 150 over the past five years , and overall visitor counts have dropped off slightly , along with revenues .
yet if the homegrown market is stagnant , asia , eastern europe and certain parts of the middle east are exploding , offering new growth opportunities to well-established german companies .
" ten to 20 new trade fairs overseas are added each year , with no sign of slowing down " over the past five years or so , said marco spinger , head of global marketing at the association of the german trade fair industry , or auma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photokina , in cologne , draws the photography world exporting a trade fair " is n't as simple as just picking up an entire fair , booths and all , and moving it to another country , " spinger said .
rather , the idea is to capitalize on the brand names and know-how german trade fair companies have developed over the years and mold it to fit local needs .
düsseldorf fashion , munich high tech most of the exports are done via subsidiaries or joint ventures in other countries .
thus , electronics junkies who may have missed cebit in germany - or could n't afford the passage to hanover - can find one in australia or turkey .
the messe düsseldorf trade fair boasts 12 subsidiaries and 65 representatives across the globe ; its longstanding presence in the russian market has given it a strong foothold there and made it one of the most successful foreign companies in that country .
the frankfurt fair has built up strong ties with china , holding automotive and textile fairs there . auma designates these exported german events as " gqt " , or " german quality trade " fairs .
the exports tend to represent the strengths of what the companies do at home , spinger said .
so düsseldorf will export its know-how and contacts in medicine and fashion , while cologne may push the food industry -lrb- in thailand , for instance , -rrb- and munich brings high-tech to shanghai . the hottest expansion spots appear to be dubai , china , and russia , but any place where there is a need , and funding , to tap 50 years of german experience will do .
even the us is a prime ground for exports - 11 german trade fairs are slated to cross the atlantic in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's international auto show iaa the export growth took off around 2000 , when europe 's economy ground into decline , according to auma 's spinger .
in 2005 germans organized 172 fairs abroad , which accounted for 1.1 million square meters -lrb- 3.6 million square feet -rrb- of a total worldwide 9.2 million - a full 12 percent of all german exhibition space .
good for smaller businesses while there are winners all around in the booming trade fair market , the biggest gainers in germany appear to be the midsize companies that form the backbone of the economy . " having german fairs abroad give smaller firms the chance to go directly to their clients overseas , " spinger explained .
" they do n't have to go through some other american or arab exhibitor .
they can join up with a group project here or be part of a german pavilion .
they do n't have to do all the work themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artforum berlin despite the rosy numbers , observers have expressed concern about the effect overseas growth could have on german trade fairs .
after all , more than half of the people who come to germany to meet , greet and trade orders come from abroad .
wo n't the fairs taking place in their own backyards cut into the number of visitors who would want to make the trek to leipzig or nuremberg to do the same thing ?
numbers still high on the contrary , exhibit organizers say .
" we are n't cannibalizing ourselves by doing business this way , " said stephan kurzawski , vice president for business development at the messe frankfurt trade fair .
" our foreign trade fairs actually end up being marketing campaigns for frankfurt .
if we do an auto mechanics fair in argentina , for example , we notice a definite rise in argentine attendance at our fairs - both as exhibitors and as visitors . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms seem to have figured out what visitors want thomas kötter , a pr representative for the messe düsseldorf , agreed .
" the overseas trade fairs tend to be much smaller .
so after our exhibitors at the medica in china have had success and filled their order books at a smaller fair , we tell them , ' you 've experienced this version , but if you really want to be at the center of the entire medical world , it is in düsseldorf . '
they come ; the numbers bear that out . " kötter said he ca n't imagine that germany will be rendered obsolete by competition from overseas in the near or distant future .
" we have over 50 years of experience in building trade shows … we know how to set up the stands , how to do it so people are happy , so their information gets distributed , so they make sales . … we 've studied this , worked on it .
they do n't have that experience .

trade fairs are increasingly moving overseas , and insiders say it 's a win-win situation . germany has long been known as a country of trade fairs .
two thirds of the world 's leading trade fairs are held in the country , including big-name events like the cebit digital solutions fair in hanover , the international motor show in frankfurt , and the anuga food fair in cologne .
but the number of fairs held in germany has hovered steadily around 150 over the past five years , and overall visitor counts have dropped off slightly , along with revenues .
yet if the homegrown market is stagnant , asia , eastern europe and certain parts of the middle east are exploding , offering new growth opportunities to well-established german companies .

most have also taken stock of merkel 's visits to both washington and moscow , which took place within a span of five days . the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g said merkel had " emancipated herself " from her predecessor 's policies .
" under the east german chancellor , the pendulum of berlin 's foreign policy is swinging back to the center position , from which america is no greater cause for concern than russia , " the paper noted .
it added that merkel had not given up germany 's claim to an independent role in global politics .
" this intermediate power in the heart of europe can not shirk the responsibility and the influence which it has come to acquire since reunification , " the paper said . the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d said merkel had used her visits to washington and moscow for an " important realignment " but without completely shaking up relations .
" merkel has simply taken out the overriding and damaging emotions from ties : the icy hostility towards the bush administration and the cozy proximity to vladimir putin , " the paper wrote .
" the german thermostat has been set to the right rational temperatures towards east and west and thus relations with both partners is now more sober and better , " it noted , adding that it still remains unclear after merkel 's visits to washington and moscow , what the normalization means for practical politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has earned praise for being frank in talks with putin the ha n n oversche allegemei n e zeitu n g said it remained to be seen whether merkel 's criticism of " the increasing authoritarian features of the russian state " would have an effect on putin .
" but merkel 's words have fallen on fertile ground outside the moscow center , " the paper wrote .
" it 's about a long-term effect : the groups , who do n't accept their civil rights being restricted , are strengthened .
and berlin has a duty towards them . " other european newspapers commented on the personal chemistry between merkel and putin , wondering whether she would keep up the cozy ties cultivated by schröder . french daily le mo n de wrote that merkel is unlikely to get on as well with putin as her predecessor schröder .
" with time the two men developed such a great friendship that it provoked criticism in germany , " it said .
that closeness " annoyed germany 's eastern neighbors which retained a very bad memory of the alliances between berlin and moscow , " it added .
but , since she came to power , " merkel has been saying that she is working towards readjusting the right balance , " the paper said . britain 's the guardia n wrote that it was clear that merkel 's visit to moscow was going to be more difficult than her trip to washington .
" her brief businesslike trip was in striking contrast with the male bonding sessions mr. schröder , george bush and tony blair have all held over a few beers with vladimir putin .
none of them have been as forthright as they should have been on issues as important as human rights , the chechnya war , media freedoms and the yukos affair , " the paper pointed out .
" so it was impressive to see the german christian democratic chancellor talking of a " strategic partnership " but still doing publicly what the social democratic schröder -lrb- who called mr. putin a " flawless democrat " -rrb- never did privately - meeting russian ngos to register objections to laws restricting their activities .
encouraging democracy , civil society and stability is in the interest of russia 's neighbors , " the paper wrote . in russia , the trud daily said that although the " iron frau " will not be " the same kind of friend that gerhard schröder was to vladimir putin , " this should have little effect on general relations between germany and russia .
these relations , the paper argued , " are based on firm economic foundations . " another russian paper , kommersa n t ran an article headlined " friend angela : new german chancellor turns out to be no worse than the old one . "
the paper wrote : " mrs. merkel was doing her best to stress the continuity of gerhard schröder 's policies .
angela merkel seems to be running ahead of her own locomotive .
she even declared that the partnership between russia and germany must be far more intensive than before .

most have also taken stock of merkel 's visits to both washington and moscow , which took place within a span of five days . the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g said merkel had " emancipated herself " from her predecessor 's policies .
" under the east german chancellor , the pendulum of berlin 's foreign policy is swinging back to the center position , from which america is no greater cause for concern than russia , " the paper noted .
it added that merkel had not given up germany 's claim to an independent role in global politics .
" this intermediate power in the heart of europe can not shirk the responsibility and the influence which it has come to acquire since reunification , " the paper said . the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d said merkel had used her visits to washington and moscow for an " important realignment " but without completely shaking up relations .
" merkel has simply taken out the overriding and damaging emotions from ties : the icy hostility towards the bush administration and the cozy proximity to vladimir putin , " the paper wrote .
" the german thermostat has been set to the right rational temperatures towards east and west and thus relations with both partners is now more sober and better , " it noted , adding that it still remains unclear after merkel 's visits to washington and moscow , what the normalization means for practical politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has earned praise for being frank in talks with putin the ha n n oversche allegemei n e zeitu n g said it remained to be seen whether merkel 's criticism of " the increasing authoritarian features of the russian state " would have an effect on putin .
" but merkel 's words have fallen on fertile ground outside the moscow center , " the paper wrote .
" it 's about a long-term effect : the groups , who do n't accept their civil rights being restricted , are strengthened .
and berlin has a duty towards them . " other european newspapers commented on the personal chemistry between merkel and putin , wondering whether she would keep up the cozy ties cultivated by schröder . french daily le mo n de wrote that merkel is unlikely to get on as well with putin as her predecessor schröder .
" with time the two men developed such a great friendship that it provoked criticism in germany , " it said .
that closeness " annoyed germany 's eastern neighbors which retained a very bad memory of the alliances between berlin and moscow , " it added .
but , since she came to power , " merkel has been saying that she is working towards readjusting the right balance , " the paper said . britain 's the guardia n wrote that it was clear that merkel 's visit to moscow was going to be more difficult than her trip to washington .
" her brief businesslike trip was in striking contrast with the male bonding sessions mr. schröder , george bush and tony blair have all held over a few beers with vladimir putin .
none of them have been as forthright as they should have been on issues as important as human rights , the chechnya war , media freedoms and the yukos affair , " the paper pointed out .
" so it was impressive to see the german christian democratic chancellor talking of a " strategic partnership " but still doing publicly what the social democratic schröder -lrb- who called mr. putin a " flawless democrat " -rrb- never did privately - meeting russian ngos to register objections to laws restricting their activities .
encouraging democracy , civil society and stability is in the interest of russia 's neighbors , " the paper wrote . in russia , the trud daily said that although the " iron frau " will not be " the same kind of friend that gerhard schröder was to vladimir putin , " this should have little effect on general relations between germany and russia .

trade fairs are increasingly moving overseas , and insiders say it 's a win-win situation . germany has long been known as a country of trade fairs .
two thirds of the world 's leading trade fairs are held in the country , including big-name events like the cebit digital solutions fair in hanover , the international motor show in frankfurt , and the anuga food fair in cologne .
but the number of fairs held in germany has hovered steadily around 150 over the past five years , and overall visitor counts have dropped off slightly , along with revenues .
yet if the homegrown market is stagnant , asia , eastern europe and certain parts of the middle east are exploding , offering new growth opportunities to well-established german companies .
" ten to 20 new trade fairs overseas are added each year , with no sign of slowing down " over the past five years or so , said marco spinger , head of global marketing at the association of the german trade fair industry , or auma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photokina , in cologne , draws the photography world exporting a trade fair " is n't as simple as just picking up an entire fair , booths and all , and moving it to another country , " spinger said .
rather , the idea is to capitalize on the brand names and know-how german trade fair companies have developed over the years and mold it to fit local needs .
düsseldorf fashion , munich high tech most of the exports are done via subsidiaries or joint ventures in other countries .
thus , electronics junkies who may have missed cebit in germany - or could n't afford the passage to hanover - can find one in australia or turkey .
the messe düsseldorf trade fair boasts 12 subsidiaries and 65 representatives across the globe ; its longstanding presence in the russian market has given it a strong foothold there and made it one of the most successful foreign companies in that country .
the frankfurt fair has built up strong ties with china , holding automotive and textile fairs there . auma designates these exported german events as " gqt " , or " german quality trade " fairs .
the exports tend to represent the strengths of what the companies do at home , spinger said .
so düsseldorf will export its know-how and contacts in medicine and fashion , while cologne may push the food industry -lrb- in thailand , for instance , -rrb- and munich brings high-tech to shanghai . the hottest expansion spots appear to be dubai , china , and russia , but any place where there is a need , and funding , to tap 50 years of german experience will do .
even the us is a prime ground for exports - 11 german trade fairs are slated to cross the atlantic in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's international auto show iaa the export growth took off around 2000 , when europe 's economy ground into decline , according to auma 's spinger .
in 2005 germans organized 172 fairs abroad , which accounted for 1.1 million square meters -lrb- 3.6 million square feet -rrb- of a total worldwide 9.2 million - a full 12 percent of all german exhibition space .
good for smaller businesses while there are winners all around in the booming trade fair market , the biggest gainers in germany appear to be the midsize companies that form the backbone of the economy . " having german fairs abroad give smaller firms the chance to go directly to their clients overseas , " spinger explained .
" they do n't have to go through some other american or arab exhibitor .
they can join up with a group project here or be part of a german pavilion .
they do n't have to do all the work themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artforum berlin despite the rosy numbers , observers have expressed concern about the effect overseas growth could have on german trade fairs .
after all , more than half of the people who come to germany to meet , greet and trade orders come from abroad .
wo n't the fairs taking place in their own backyards cut into the number of visitors who would want to make the trek to leipzig or nuremberg to do the same thing ?
numbers still high on the contrary , exhibit organizers say .
" we are n't cannibalizing ourselves by doing business this way , " said stephan kurzawski , vice president for business development at the messe frankfurt trade fair .
" our foreign trade fairs actually end up being marketing campaigns for frankfurt .
if we do an auto mechanics fair in argentina , for example , we notice a definite rise in argentine attendance at our fairs - both as exhibitors and as visitors . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms seem to have figured out what visitors want thomas kötter , a pr representative for the messe düsseldorf , agreed .
" the overseas trade fairs tend to be much smaller .
so after our exhibitors at the medica in china have had success and filled their order books at a smaller fair , we tell them , ' you 've experienced this version , but if you really want to be at the center of the entire medical world , it is in düsseldorf . '
they come ; the numbers bear that out . " kötter said he ca n't imagine that germany will be rendered obsolete by competition from overseas in the near or distant future .
" we have over 50 years of experience in building trade shows … we know how to set up the stands , how to do it so people are happy , so their information gets distributed , so they make sales . … we 've studied this , worked on it .
they do n't have that experience .

iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia iaea chief : iran atomic crisis at " critical stage " current affairs -pipe- 17.01.2006 world powers split over iran nuclear program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has warned of serious consequences if it 's referred to the un europe sought tuesday to keep up pressure on iran over its nuclear program , dismissing as vacuous a tehran offer to resume talks and seeking to overcome russian and chinese opposition to un action . amid signs of an international split over how to respond to the crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions , british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman said tehran 's call for fresh talks was " vacuous . "
but he conceded there was a " great deal of diplomacy to pursue " in order to build an international consensus to bring iran into line over a program which the united states claims is hiding covert atomic weapons development . world powers seemed divided a day after britain , france and germany called for an emergency meeting feb .
2-3 of the 35-nation board of governors of the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
their call followed talks in london which also gathered together officials from china , russia and the united states . the iaea could refer iran to the un security council , which has the powers to impose sanctions , but russia and china are resisting european and us calls for such intervention .
russia said sanctions were not the best way forward , while china called for a return to the negotiating table . tehran , meanwhile , vowed reprisals against any crackdown , saying it would end tough un inspections and fully resume nuclear fuel work if the dossier is referred to the security council . ali asgar soltaniyeh , its ambassador to the vienna-based iaea , said iran 's decision to kick-start nuclear research was " irreversible . " israel warns iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert warned iran separately , israel 's acting prime minister ehud olmert warned iran that it would not allow any regime that threatened its existence to obtain weapons of mass destruction .
israel has come to view the islamic republic in tehran as its number one enemy , its fears heightened when iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad called in october for the jewish state to be " wiped off the map . " the talks in london joining the five permanent security council members and germany were called after iran , defying the iaea , broke the seals on a nuclear facility last week in order to resume research on uranium enrichment after a voluntary suspension . enriched uranium can be fuel for civilian nuclear reactors , but in a highly enriched form also the raw material for an atomic bomb .
no clear movement diplomats said the talks were inconclusive . " the chinese and russians are still formulating their own tactics of what to do at the board meeting , " a british foreign office spokesman said . a european diplomat close to the iaea said that while russia had previously agreed not to block referral to the security council , " the russians are backing off , it seems to me . " an iranian official said tehran had written to britain , france and germany asking for talks wednesday , a date scrapped by the eu troika . diplomats said that if the case goes to the security council , a first step would be a statement urging iran to honor existing iaea demands that it cease nuclear fuel activities and resume talks on guaranteeing that its program is peaceful .
any sanctions would come later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's foreign minister cautioned against sanctions russia and china , which have close trade and energy ties to iran , have been reluctant in the past to pursue international action against it , but a senior british official said neither had objected to an iaea session .
" we do n't see this leading straight into sanctions , " he said under cover of anonymity .
diplomacy could still prevail russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said sanctions were " not the best and by no means the only way to resolve international problems . "
he urged iran to do more to cooperate with the iaea .
" iran should do much more than it has done .
certain progress has been achieved in clarifying dark spots , but more is required of iran . " chinese foreign ministry spokesman kong quan said all sides at the talks in london had expressed concerns over iran 's actions .
" all the parties believed that iran should return to the moratorium and to the diplomatic negotiation process , " he said . in vienna , diplomats said that iran still had a chance to back off and let diplomacy resume before the february meeting . a diplomat close to the iaea said that while the iranians have taken seals off machines which manufacture nuclear reactor fuel , they have not started up the machines . on sunday , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei held a secret meeting with iran 's chief negotiator ali larijani , who lobbied for help in avoiding measures and offered the concession of allowing snap inspections , a diplomat in vienna said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-3 call for iaea action over iran nuclear program europe 's leading nations pressed monday for an emergency meeting of the un atomic watchdog in two weeks over iran 's nuclear program , bringing the prospect of referral to the un security council a step closer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.01.2006 bundestag likely to probe german role in us invasion of iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german parliament will vote on whether to investigate the bnd 's role in iraq germany 's opposition parties agreed tuesday that there should be an enquiry into the possible involvement of the federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- in the iraq war .
parliament will debate the issue friday . parliamentarians from the greens , the free democrats and the left party all agreed on tuesday there should be an investigation into the alleged role of german agents in the invasion of iraq in march 2003 . a parliamentary debate scheduled for wednesday to decide on an enquiry was postponed until friday .
it is expected that the opposition parties will get the necessary 25 percent of votes during the debate for the investigation to go ahead . there are 614 parliamentarians in the bundestag and the necessary amount of votes in favor to begin the investigation would be 154 .
the three opposition parties hold 166 seats in the parliament . six fdp members have said they will abstain , and one green parliamentarian , former foreign minister joschka fischer , is expected to oppose the probe just as he rejected it in his parliamentary group 's vote on tuesday .
however , with the left party saying it will vote unanimously for the enquiry , it will still be enough to set the investigation in motion .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will return early from his middle east tour to attend the debate .
steinmeier is cutting his trip short to answer questions as to what exactly transpired when the former social democratic-green party coalition government retained german agents in baghdad ahead of the opening salvos of the iraq war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agents are accused of guiding missile attacks on baghdad volker beck , the chairman of the greens ' parliamentary group said it was likely that steinmeier would be called to testify during the probe to explain the government 's decision to leave two agents in baghdad despite germany 's official condemnation of the war . steinmeier , who served as then chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff , confirmed and defended the step last week , saying he had been party to it . his spokesman told reporters : " there was a decision from the german government that two agents would remain in iraq to gather information .
there was a regular exchange of information with the us side . " the government said they had passed on information to prevent the bombing of civilian targets and save lives , but the news has sparked an outcry in germany because of the bitter opposition here to the war . a report by ard television last week quoted a former us defense department official as saying that the german secret services also provided " direct help " to the us military in identifying targets that should be bombed . greens call for investigation into possible breach of policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants the secrecy laws to be loosened to aid any enquiry the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , jürgen trittin , said it should be established whether the presence of the agents constituted a breach of stated government policy . renate künast , the green 's chief in the bundestag , said tuesday that the investigating committee into the affair should be given " the necessary parliamentary tools " to gather the evidence and come to a conclusion . for this to happen , künast added , the secrecy rule restricting the committee 's investigations should be loosened .
" this allegation must be addressed , " she said , calling for the rules concerning inspection of records and the examination of witnesses to be eased . she said that she did not want to comment on those who could be involved in the case so as not to influence any possible investigation but that " all the circumstances should be clarified . "
künast added that it would be a " normal process " for records to be kept of any agent activity in baghdad before the war and the data should therefore be investigated . künast , steinmeier refute claims of a double role she defended the social democratic-green party coalition 's stance during the iraq war and dismissed accusations that the government had been " two-faced " in its policies towards military action - on the one hand publicly denouncing the war and on the other covertly supporting the us-led invasion . steinmeier also angrily dismissed the notion that germany played a double role in the war .
" it is absurd to say that the government officially opposed the war in iraq but covertly supported it .
i will not allow history to be rewritten , " he said on friday . künast also called on the investigation committee to look into any german complicity in the cia extraordinary rendition scandal , us-instigated abductions and secret prisons on european soil . liberals see a question mark over previous administration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhardt says the previous government has a question mark over its head the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said that it wanted a completely open book on germany ’ s alleged involvement in iraq , not to accuse the bnd of wrongdoing but to clarify the allegations . parliamentary group leader wolfgang gerhardt said on tuesday that an investigation would be about " the question mark hanging over the political guidance of the social democratic-green government . " gerhardt expressed " the highest doubts " that the previous government had no knowledge of any alleged secret service activity in iraq prior to the war and said the fdp wanted a " complete investigation into the processes during and after the war .

parliament will debate the issue friday . parliamentarians from the greens , the free democrats and the left party all agreed on tuesday there should be an investigation into the alleged role of german agents in the invasion of iraq in march 2003 . a parliamentary debate scheduled for wednesday to decide on an enquiry was postponed until friday .
it is expected that the opposition parties will get the necessary 25 percent of votes during the debate for the investigation to go ahead . there are 614 parliamentarians in the bundestag and the necessary amount of votes in favor to begin the investigation would be 154 .
the three opposition parties hold 166 seats in the parliament . six fdp members have said they will abstain , and one green parliamentarian , former foreign minister joschka fischer , is expected to oppose the probe just as he rejected it in his parliamentary group 's vote on tuesday .
however , with the left party saying it will vote unanimously for the enquiry , it will still be enough to set the investigation in motion .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will return early from his middle east tour to attend the debate .
steinmeier is cutting his trip short to answer questions as to what exactly transpired when the former social democratic-green party coalition government retained german agents in baghdad ahead of the opening salvos of the iraq war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agents are accused of guiding missile attacks on baghdad volker beck , the chairman of the greens ' parliamentary group said it was likely that steinmeier would be called to testify during the probe to explain the government 's decision to leave two agents in baghdad despite germany 's official condemnation of the war . steinmeier , who served as then chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff , confirmed and defended the step last week , saying he had been party to it . his spokesman told reporters : " there was a decision from the german government that two agents would remain in iraq to gather information .
there was a regular exchange of information with the us side . " the government said they had passed on information to prevent the bombing of civilian targets and save lives , but the news has sparked an outcry in germany because of the bitter opposition here to the war . a report by ard television last week quoted a former us defense department official as saying that the german secret services also provided " direct help " to the us military in identifying targets that should be bombed . greens call for investigation into possible breach of policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants the secrecy laws to be loosened to aid any enquiry the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , jürgen trittin , said it should be established whether the presence of the agents constituted a breach of stated government policy . renate künast , the green 's chief in the bundestag , said tuesday that the investigating committee into the affair should be given " the necessary parliamentary tools " to gather the evidence and come to a conclusion . for this to happen , künast added , the secrecy rule restricting the committee 's investigations should be loosened .
" this allegation must be addressed , " she said , calling for the rules concerning inspection of records and the examination of witnesses to be eased . she said that she did not want to comment on those who could be involved in the case so as not to influence any possible investigation but that " all the circumstances should be clarified . "
künast added that it would be a " normal process " for records to be kept of any agent activity in baghdad before the war and the data should therefore be investigated . künast , steinmeier refute claims of a double role she defended the social democratic-green party coalition 's stance during the iraq war and dismissed accusations that the government had been " two-faced " in its policies towards military action - on the one hand publicly denouncing the war and on the other covertly supporting the us-led invasion . steinmeier also angrily dismissed the notion that germany played a double role in the war .
" it is absurd to say that the government officially opposed the war in iraq but covertly supported it .
i will not allow history to be rewritten , " he said on friday . künast also called on the investigation committee to look into any german complicity in the cia extraordinary rendition scandal , us-instigated abductions and secret prisons on european soil . liberals see a question mark over previous administration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhardt says the previous government has a question mark over its head the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said that it wanted a completely open book on germany ’ s alleged involvement in iraq , not to accuse the bnd of wrongdoing but to clarify the allegations . parliamentary group leader wolfgang gerhardt said on tuesday that an investigation would be about " the question mark hanging over the political guidance of the social democratic-green government .

"
but he conceded there was a " great deal of diplomacy to pursue " in order to build an international consensus to bring iran into line over a program which the united states claims is hiding covert atomic weapons development . world powers seemed divided a day after britain , france and germany called for an emergency meeting feb .
2-3 of the 35-nation board of governors of the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
their call followed talks in london which also gathered together officials from china , russia and the united states . the iaea could refer iran to the un security council , which has the powers to impose sanctions , but russia and china are resisting european and us calls for such intervention .
russia said sanctions were not the best way forward , while china called for a return to the negotiating table . tehran , meanwhile , vowed reprisals against any crackdown , saying it would end tough un inspections and fully resume nuclear fuel work if the dossier is referred to the security council . ali asgar soltaniyeh , its ambassador to the vienna-based iaea , said iran 's decision to kick-start nuclear research was " irreversible .

no clear movement diplomats said the talks were inconclusive . " the chinese and russians are still formulating their own tactics of what to do at the board meeting , " a british foreign office spokesman said . a european diplomat close to the iaea said that while russia had previously agreed not to block referral to the security council , " the russians are backing off , it seems to me . " an iranian official said tehran had written to britain , france and germany asking for talks wednesday , a date scrapped by the eu troika . diplomats said that if the case goes to the security council , a first step would be a statement urging iran to honor existing iaea demands that it cease nuclear fuel activities and resume talks on guaranteeing that its program is peaceful .
any sanctions would come later .

diplomacy could still prevail russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said sanctions were " not the best and by no means the only way to resolve international problems . "
he urged iran to do more to cooperate with the iaea .
" iran should do much more than it has done .

two-thirds come from belgium , germany or france , " said mark josemans , chairman of an organization representing the 16 officially licensed coffee shops operating in maastricht . but the soft-drugs tourism is causing increasing problems for the town , according to maastricht officials , such as cannabis tourists taking up the limited parking spaces , petty crime and hard drugs dealers offering their goods in the vicinity of coffee shops . choosi n g regulatio n in december the city council unanimously put their weight behind plans by maastricht mayor gerd leers to move the coffee shops out of town .

" criticism from n eighbors supported by maastricht 's aldermen and the coffee shop owners , the mayor 's project , dubbed the " weed boulevard " in the local media , has attracted fierce criticism from the neighboring belgian communities of fourons and lanaken . " some 80 to 90 percent of the traffic in the direction of maastricht passes through fourons and as the legal sale of soft drugs comes closer to the border the illegal traffic in hard drugs will also come to the surrounding areas , being the territory of fourons or -lrb- near-by -rrb- vise , " said huub broers , the mayor of fourons , a town some 15 kilometers -lrb- 10 miles -rrb- from maastricht .

parliament will debate the issue friday . parliamentarians from the greens , the free democrats and the left party all agreed on tuesday there should be an investigation into the alleged role of german agents in the invasion of iraq in march 2003 . a parliamentary debate scheduled for wednesday to decide on an enquiry was postponed until friday .
it is expected that the opposition parties will get the necessary 25 percent of votes during the debate for the investigation to go ahead . there are 614 parliamentarians in the bundestag and the necessary amount of votes in favor to begin the investigation would be 154 .
the three opposition parties hold 166 seats in the parliament . six fdp members have said they will abstain , and one green parliamentarian , former foreign minister joschka fischer , is expected to oppose the probe just as he rejected it in his parliamentary group 's vote on tuesday .
however , with the left party saying it will vote unanimously for the enquiry , it will still be enough to set the investigation in motion .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will return early from his middle east tour to attend the debate .
steinmeier is cutting his trip short to answer questions as to what exactly transpired when the former social democratic-green party coalition government retained german agents in baghdad ahead of the opening salvos of the iraq war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agents are accused of guiding missile attacks on baghdad volker beck , the chairman of the greens ' parliamentary group said it was likely that steinmeier would be called to testify during the probe to explain the government 's decision to leave two agents in baghdad despite germany 's official condemnation of the war . steinmeier , who served as then chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff , confirmed and defended the step last week , saying he had been party to it . his spokesman told reporters : " there was a decision from the german government that two agents would remain in iraq to gather information .
there was a regular exchange of information with the us side . " the government said they had passed on information to prevent the bombing of civilian targets and save lives , but the news has sparked an outcry in germany because of the bitter opposition here to the war . a report by ard television last week quoted a former us defense department official as saying that the german secret services also provided " direct help " to the us military in identifying targets that should be bombed . greens call for investigation into possible breach of policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants the secrecy laws to be loosened to aid any enquiry the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , jürgen trittin , said it should be established whether the presence of the agents constituted a breach of stated government policy . renate künast , the green 's chief in the bundestag , said tuesday that the investigating committee into the affair should be given " the necessary parliamentary tools " to gather the evidence and come to a conclusion . for this to happen , künast added , the secrecy rule restricting the committee 's investigations should be loosened .
" this allegation must be addressed , " she said , calling for the rules concerning inspection of records and the examination of witnesses to be eased . she said that she did not want to comment on those who could be involved in the case so as not to influence any possible investigation but that " all the circumstances should be clarified . "
künast added that it would be a " normal process " for records to be kept of any agent activity in baghdad before the war and the data should therefore be investigated . künast , steinmeier refute claims of a double role she defended the social democratic-green party coalition 's stance during the iraq war and dismissed accusations that the government had been " two-faced " in its policies towards military action - on the one hand publicly denouncing the war and on the other covertly supporting the us-led invasion . steinmeier also angrily dismissed the notion that germany played a double role in the war .
" it is absurd to say that the government officially opposed the war in iraq but covertly supported it .
i will not allow history to be rewritten , " he said on friday . künast also called on the investigation committee to look into any german complicity in the cia extraordinary rendition scandal , us-instigated abductions and secret prisons on european soil . liberals see a question mark over previous administration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhardt says the previous government has a question mark over its head the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said that it wanted a completely open book on germany ’ s alleged involvement in iraq , not to accuse the bnd of wrongdoing but to clarify the allegations . parliamentary group leader wolfgang gerhardt said on tuesday that an investigation would be about " the question mark hanging over the political guidance of the social democratic-green government . " gerhardt expressed " the highest doubts " that the previous government had no knowledge of any alleged secret service activity in iraq prior to the war and said the fdp wanted a " complete investigation into the processes during and after the war .

trade fairs are increasingly moving overseas , and insiders say it 's a win-win situation . germany has long been known as a country of trade fairs .
two thirds of the world 's leading trade fairs are held in the country , including big-name events like the cebit digital solutions fair in hanover , the international motor show in frankfurt , and the anuga food fair in cologne .
but the number of fairs held in germany has hovered steadily around 150 over the past five years , and overall visitor counts have dropped off slightly , along with revenues .
yet if the homegrown market is stagnant , asia , eastern europe and certain parts of the middle east are exploding , offering new growth opportunities to well-established german companies .
" ten to 20 new trade fairs overseas are added each year , with no sign of slowing down " over the past five years or so , said marco spinger , head of global marketing at the association of the german trade fair industry , or auma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photokina , in cologne , draws the photography world exporting a trade fair " is n't as simple as just picking up an entire fair , booths and all , and moving it to another country , " spinger said .
rather , the idea is to capitalize on the brand names and know-how german trade fair companies have developed over the years and mold it to fit local needs .
düsseldorf fashion , munich high tech most of the exports are done via subsidiaries or joint ventures in other countries .
thus , electronics junkies who may have missed cebit in germany - or could n't afford the passage to hanover - can find one in australia or turkey .
the messe düsseldorf trade fair boasts 12 subsidiaries and 65 representatives across the globe ; its longstanding presence in the russian market has given it a strong foothold there and made it one of the most successful foreign companies in that country .
the frankfurt fair has built up strong ties with china , holding automotive and textile fairs there . auma designates these exported german events as " gqt " , or " german quality trade " fairs .
the exports tend to represent the strengths of what the companies do at home , spinger said .
so düsseldorf will export its know-how and contacts in medicine and fashion , while cologne may push the food industry -lrb- in thailand , for instance , -rrb- and munich brings high-tech to shanghai . the hottest expansion spots appear to be dubai , china , and russia , but any place where there is a need , and funding , to tap 50 years of german experience will do .
even the us is a prime ground for exports - 11 german trade fairs are slated to cross the atlantic in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's international auto show iaa the export growth took off around 2000 , when europe 's economy ground into decline , according to auma 's spinger .
in 2005 germans organized 172 fairs abroad , which accounted for 1.1 million square meters -lrb- 3.6 million square feet -rrb- of a total worldwide 9.2 million - a full 12 percent of all german exhibition space .
good for smaller businesses while there are winners all around in the booming trade fair market , the biggest gainers in germany appear to be the midsize companies that form the backbone of the economy . " having german fairs abroad give smaller firms the chance to go directly to their clients overseas , " spinger explained .
" they do n't have to go through some other american or arab exhibitor .
they can join up with a group project here or be part of a german pavilion .
they do n't have to do all the work themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artforum berlin despite the rosy numbers , observers have expressed concern about the effect overseas growth could have on german trade fairs .
after all , more than half of the people who come to germany to meet , greet and trade orders come from abroad .
wo n't the fairs taking place in their own backyards cut into the number of visitors who would want to make the trek to leipzig or nuremberg to do the same thing ?
numbers still high on the contrary , exhibit organizers say .
" we are n't cannibalizing ourselves by doing business this way , " said stephan kurzawski , vice president for business development at the messe frankfurt trade fair .
" our foreign trade fairs actually end up being marketing campaigns for frankfurt .
if we do an auto mechanics fair in argentina , for example , we notice a definite rise in argentine attendance at our fairs - both as exhibitors and as visitors . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms seem to have figured out what visitors want thomas kötter , a pr representative for the messe düsseldorf , agreed .
" the overseas trade fairs tend to be much smaller .
so after our exhibitors at the medica in china have had success and filled their order books at a smaller fair , we tell them , ' you 've experienced this version , but if you really want to be at the center of the entire medical world , it is in düsseldorf . '
they come ; the numbers bear that out . " kötter said he ca n't imagine that germany will be rendered obsolete by competition from overseas in the near or distant future .
" we have over 50 years of experience in building trade shows … we know how to set up the stands , how to do it so people are happy , so their information gets distributed , so they make sales . … we 've studied this , worked on it .
they do n't have that experience .

most have also taken stock of merkel 's visits to both washington and moscow , which took place within a span of five days . the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g said merkel had " emancipated herself " from her predecessor 's policies .
" under the east german chancellor , the pendulum of berlin 's foreign policy is swinging back to the center position , from which america is no greater cause for concern than russia , " the paper noted .
it added that merkel had not given up germany 's claim to an independent role in global politics .
" this intermediate power in the heart of europe can not shirk the responsibility and the influence which it has come to acquire since reunification , " the paper said . the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d said merkel had used her visits to washington and moscow for an " important realignment " but without completely shaking up relations .
" merkel has simply taken out the overriding and damaging emotions from ties : the icy hostility towards the bush administration and the cozy proximity to vladimir putin , " the paper wrote .
" the german thermostat has been set to the right rational temperatures towards east and west and thus relations with both partners is now more sober and better , " it noted , adding that it still remains unclear after merkel 's visits to washington and moscow , what the normalization means for practical politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has earned praise for being frank in talks with putin the ha n n oversche allegemei n e zeitu n g said it remained to be seen whether merkel 's criticism of " the increasing authoritarian features of the russian state " would have an effect on putin .
" but merkel 's words have fallen on fertile ground outside the moscow center , " the paper wrote .
" it 's about a long-term effect : the groups , who do n't accept their civil rights being restricted , are strengthened .
and berlin has a duty towards them . " other european newspapers commented on the personal chemistry between merkel and putin , wondering whether she would keep up the cozy ties cultivated by schröder . french daily le mo n de wrote that merkel is unlikely to get on as well with putin as her predecessor schröder .
" with time the two men developed such a great friendship that it provoked criticism in germany , " it said .
that closeness " annoyed germany 's eastern neighbors which retained a very bad memory of the alliances between berlin and moscow , " it added .
but , since she came to power , " merkel has been saying that she is working towards readjusting the right balance , " the paper said . britain 's the guardia n wrote that it was clear that merkel 's visit to moscow was going to be more difficult than her trip to washington .
" her brief businesslike trip was in striking contrast with the male bonding sessions mr. schröder , george bush and tony blair have all held over a few beers with vladimir putin .
none of them have been as forthright as they should have been on issues as important as human rights , the chechnya war , media freedoms and the yukos affair , " the paper pointed out .
" so it was impressive to see the german christian democratic chancellor talking of a " strategic partnership " but still doing publicly what the social democratic schröder -lrb- who called mr. putin a " flawless democrat " -rrb- never did privately - meeting russian ngos to register objections to laws restricting their activities .
encouraging democracy , civil society and stability is in the interest of russia 's neighbors , " the paper wrote . in russia , the trud daily said that although the " iron frau " will not be " the same kind of friend that gerhard schröder was to vladimir putin , " this should have little effect on general relations between germany and russia .
these relations , the paper argued , " are based on firm economic foundations . " another russian paper , kommersa n t ran an article headlined " friend angela : new german chancellor turns out to be no worse than the old one . "
the paper wrote : " mrs. merkel was doing her best to stress the continuity of gerhard schröder 's policies .
angela merkel seems to be running ahead of her own locomotive .
she even declared that the partnership between russia and germany must be far more intensive than before .

but because it sits at a crossroads of two major highways , coming from belgium and germany , it has also become a key stopping point for belgians , germans and french who enjoy holland 's lax laws on soft drugs . boomi n g tourism trade " each day between 3,500 and 4,000 tourists come to the coffee shops in the city center , making up a total of 1.5 million cannabis users annually .
two-thirds come from belgium , germany or france , " said mark josemans , chairman of an organization representing the 16 officially licensed coffee shops operating in maastricht . but the soft-drugs tourism is causing increasing problems for the town , according to maastricht officials , such as cannabis tourists taking up the limited parking spaces , petty crime and hard drugs dealers offering their goods in the vicinity of coffee shops . choosi n g regulatio n in december the city council unanimously put their weight behind plans by maastricht mayor gerd leers to move the coffee shops out of town .
leers is actually opposed to drugs , but said he preferred to regulate the legal trade of soft drugs rather than have everything go underground . " the coffee shops are located in the city centre , " leers said , " but in maastricht there are over a hundred private residencies that also illegally cater to this wave of drug users . " criticism from n eighbors supported by maastricht 's aldermen and the coffee shop owners , the mayor 's project , dubbed the " weed boulevard " in the local media , has attracted fierce criticism from the neighboring belgian communities of fourons and lanaken . " some 80 to 90 percent of the traffic in the direction of maastricht passes through fourons and as the legal sale of soft drugs comes closer to the border the illegal traffic in hard drugs will also come to the surrounding areas , being the territory of fourons or -lrb- near-by -rrb- vise , " said huub broers , the mayor of fourons , a town some 15 kilometers -lrb- 10 miles -rrb- from maastricht .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on health german bio boom shows organic shopping no flash in the pan study shows germans getting heavier german health system not quite in intensive care germany still lighting up germany -pipe- 17.01.2006 addiction experts fear binge drinking trend in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no half measures : germans are being encouraged to drink as much as they can bar offers which include all drinks at under a euro and vacation-themed nights fuelled by buckets of sangria are the stuff of raucous holidays abroad .
but these and other booze bargains are now taking hold in germany . hot , leisurely days spent in beer gardens nursing stein after stein of ice-cold ale ; boisterous swaying and singing in crowded halls with frothy brew on tap - the more well-known of german drinking habits conjure up images of dedicated boozers in for the long haul .
but a disturbing new trend with the younger crowd is causing concern . while binge drinking seems to be a national sport in britain , the practice of necking vast quantities of alcohol in a short amount of time has until recently failed to find a foothold in germany where beer making is a tradition and drinking it is a pastime to be savored . however , thanks to the well-publicized introduction of an alcohol flat-rate in hanover clubs , germans may be on the brink of descending into the same violent , vomit-sprayed drinking culture which is the current bane of their island-dwelling neighbors . entry prices at bars and clubs in hanover range from four to eight euros -lrb- $ 4.83 - $ 9.66 -rrb- and then from there on in , the sparkling wine , vodka and gin flows freely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may be the scene in mallorca but do you really want to see it in german bars ?
offers such as the 99-cent party , where every drink costs under a euro , or the mallorca party where sangria is served by the bucket , are helping bars attract customers in an extremely competitive industry . but the practice is worrying health officials in germany , a country which is already among the front runners in alcohol consumption in the european union . fears that price dumpi n g will e n courage you n gsters rolf hüllinghorst from the german head office for dependency matters told the dpa press agency that " landlords are acting irresponsibly " and that price dumping offers need to be controlled if the scourge of binge drinking is n't going to add to the temptations and dangers open to children and young people across the country . lower saxony 's conservative social minister , mechthild ross-luttmann , has also appealed to the club operators to act more responsibly when dealing with young people . the hanover landlords have defended themselves by saying that they would never entice young people to drink excessive amounts of alcohol for the sake of it . one bar manager , jan witte , claims that he has no knowledge of such overtly boozy behavior and wild alcohol parties at his establishment . " my club is not a binging center and has no shooters bar -lrb- a selection of cheap and powerful single measures -rrb- , " he said . this goes against the advertisement on his club 's web site that says " for those who ca n't get enough down their neck , there is now the flat rate every thursday and friday .

but these and other booze bargains are now taking hold in germany . hot , leisurely days spent in beer gardens nursing stein after stein of ice-cold ale ; boisterous swaying and singing in crowded halls with frothy brew on tap - the more well-known of german drinking habits conjure up images of dedicated boozers in for the long haul .
but a disturbing new trend with the younger crowd is causing concern . while binge drinking seems to be a national sport in britain , the practice of necking vast quantities of alcohol in a short amount of time has until recently failed to find a foothold in germany where beer making is a tradition and drinking it is a pastime to be savored . however , thanks to the well-publicized introduction of an alcohol flat-rate in hanover clubs , germans may be on the brink of descending into the same violent , vomit-sprayed drinking culture which is the current bane of their island-dwelling neighbors . entry prices at bars and clubs in hanover range from four to eight euros -lrb- $ 4.83 - $ 9.66 -rrb- and then from there on in , the sparkling wine , vodka and gin flows freely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may be the scene in mallorca but do you really want to see it in german bars ?
offers such as the 99-cent party , where every drink costs under a euro , or the mallorca party where sangria is served by the bucket , are helping bars attract customers in an extremely competitive industry . but the practice is worrying health officials in germany , a country which is already among the front runners in alcohol consumption in the european union . fears that price dumpi n g will e n courage you n gsters rolf hüllinghorst from the german head office for dependency matters told the dpa press agency that " landlords are acting irresponsibly " and that price dumping offers need to be controlled if the scourge of binge drinking is n't going to add to the temptations and dangers open to children and young people across the country . lower saxony 's conservative social minister , mechthild ross-luttmann , has also appealed to the club operators to act more responsibly when dealing with young people . the hanover landlords have defended themselves by saying that they would never entice young people to drink excessive amounts of alcohol for the sake of it . one bar manager , jan witte , claims that he has no knowledge of such overtly boozy behavior and wild alcohol parties at his establishment . " my club is not a binging center and has no shooters bar -lrb- a selection of cheap and powerful single measures -rrb- , " he said . this goes against the advertisement on his club 's web site that says " for those who ca n't get enough down their neck , there is now the flat rate every thursday and friday . " witte defended this by saying people could also drink as much mineral water and soft drinks as they like . legal age limit n o guara n tee while many bars and clubs advertise the bargain sessions as " all you can drink , " the majority make it clear that identification bearing the date of birth will be required upon entry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more young people are seeking treatment for alcohol problems .
the law stipulates that young people under the age of 18 are not allowed to be served alcohol .
however , while most bars are very strict at adhering to the rule , young people continue to turn up as casualties of alcohol in hospitals and as patients in addiction clinics across germany .
it seems obvious to state , say some but turning 18 does not immediately furnish a young drinker with a sensible attitude to alcohol consumption . the authorities in hanover have joined forces to assess the threat and apply pressure on those clubs which consciously or otherwise encourage cut-price drinking binges in the city . addiction experts and state ministers continue to discuss the dangers while police and other emergency services deal with the realities on the ground .

parliament will debate the issue friday . parliamentarians from the greens , the free democrats and the left party all agreed on tuesday there should be an investigation into the alleged role of german agents in the invasion of iraq in march 2003 . a parliamentary debate scheduled for wednesday to decide on an enquiry was postponed until friday .
it is expected that the opposition parties will get the necessary 25 percent of votes during the debate for the investigation to go ahead . there are 614 parliamentarians in the bundestag and the necessary amount of votes in favor to begin the investigation would be 154 .
the three opposition parties hold 166 seats in the parliament . six fdp members have said they will abstain , and one green parliamentarian , former foreign minister joschka fischer , is expected to oppose the probe just as he rejected it in his parliamentary group 's vote on tuesday .
however , with the left party saying it will vote unanimously for the enquiry , it will still be enough to set the investigation in motion .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will return early from his middle east tour to attend the debate .
steinmeier is cutting his trip short to answer questions as to what exactly transpired when the former social democratic-green party coalition government retained german agents in baghdad ahead of the opening salvos of the iraq war .

" this allegation must be addressed , " she said , calling for the rules concerning inspection of records and the examination of witnesses to be eased . she said that she did not want to comment on those who could be involved in the case so as not to influence any possible investigation but that " all the circumstances should be clarified .

künast added that it would be a " normal process " for records to be kept of any agent activity in baghdad before the war and the data should therefore be investigated . künast , steinmeier refute claims of a double role she defended the social democratic-green party coalition 's stance during the iraq war and dismissed accusations that the government had been " two-faced " in its policies towards military action - on the one hand publicly denouncing the war and on the other covertly supporting the us-led invasion . steinmeier also angrily dismissed the notion that germany played a double role in the war .

iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia iaea chief : iran atomic crisis at " critical stage " current affairs -pipe- 17.01.2006 world powers split over iran nuclear program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has warned of serious consequences if it 's referred to the un europe sought tuesday to keep up pressure on iran over its nuclear program , dismissing as vacuous a tehran offer to resume talks and seeking to overcome russian and chinese opposition to un action . amid signs of an international split over how to respond to the crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions , british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman said tehran 's call for fresh talks was " vacuous . "
but he conceded there was a " great deal of diplomacy to pursue " in order to build an international consensus to bring iran into line over a program which the united states claims is hiding covert atomic weapons development . world powers seemed divided a day after britain , france and germany called for an emergency meeting feb .
2-3 of the 35-nation board of governors of the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
their call followed talks in london which also gathered together officials from china , russia and the united states . the iaea could refer iran to the un security council , which has the powers to impose sanctions , but russia and china are resisting european and us calls for such intervention .
russia said sanctions were not the best way forward , while china called for a return to the negotiating table . tehran , meanwhile , vowed reprisals against any crackdown , saying it would end tough un inspections and fully resume nuclear fuel work if the dossier is referred to the security council . ali asgar soltaniyeh , its ambassador to the vienna-based iaea , said iran 's decision to kick-start nuclear research was " irreversible . " israel warns iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert warned iran separately , israel 's acting prime minister ehud olmert warned iran that it would not allow any regime that threatened its existence to obtain weapons of mass destruction .
israel has come to view the islamic republic in tehran as its number one enemy , its fears heightened when iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad called in october for the jewish state to be " wiped off the map . " the talks in london joining the five permanent security council members and germany were called after iran , defying the iaea , broke the seals on a nuclear facility last week in order to resume research on uranium enrichment after a voluntary suspension . enriched uranium can be fuel for civilian nuclear reactors , but in a highly enriched form also the raw material for an atomic bomb .
no clear movement diplomats said the talks were inconclusive . " the chinese and russians are still formulating their own tactics of what to do at the board meeting , " a british foreign office spokesman said . a european diplomat close to the iaea said that while russia had previously agreed not to block referral to the security council , " the russians are backing off , it seems to me . " an iranian official said tehran had written to britain , france and germany asking for talks wednesday , a date scrapped by the eu troika . diplomats said that if the case goes to the security council , a first step would be a statement urging iran to honor existing iaea demands that it cease nuclear fuel activities and resume talks on guaranteeing that its program is peaceful .
any sanctions would come later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's foreign minister cautioned against sanctions russia and china , which have close trade and energy ties to iran , have been reluctant in the past to pursue international action against it , but a senior british official said neither had objected to an iaea session .
" we do n't see this leading straight into sanctions , " he said under cover of anonymity .
diplomacy could still prevail russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said sanctions were " not the best and by no means the only way to resolve international problems . "
he urged iran to do more to cooperate with the iaea .

parliament will debate the issue friday . parliamentarians from the greens , the free democrats and the left party all agreed on tuesday there should be an investigation into the alleged role of german agents in the invasion of iraq in march 2003 . a parliamentary debate scheduled for wednesday to decide on an enquiry was postponed until friday .
it is expected that the opposition parties will get the necessary 25 percent of votes during the debate for the investigation to go ahead . there are 614 parliamentarians in the bundestag and the necessary amount of votes in favor to begin the investigation would be 154 .
the three opposition parties hold 166 seats in the parliament . six fdp members have said they will abstain , and one green parliamentarian , former foreign minister joschka fischer , is expected to oppose the probe just as he rejected it in his parliamentary group 's vote on tuesday .
however , with the left party saying it will vote unanimously for the enquiry , it will still be enough to set the investigation in motion .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will return early from his middle east tour to attend the debate .
steinmeier is cutting his trip short to answer questions as to what exactly transpired when the former social democratic-green party coalition government retained german agents in baghdad ahead of the opening salvos of the iraq war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agents are accused of guiding missile attacks on baghdad volker beck , the chairman of the greens ' parliamentary group said it was likely that steinmeier would be called to testify during the probe to explain the government 's decision to leave two agents in baghdad despite germany 's official condemnation of the war . steinmeier , who served as then chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff , confirmed and defended the step last week , saying he had been party to it . his spokesman told reporters : " there was a decision from the german government that two agents would remain in iraq to gather information .
there was a regular exchange of information with the us side . " the government said they had passed on information to prevent the bombing of civilian targets and save lives , but the news has sparked an outcry in germany because of the bitter opposition here to the war . a report by ard television last week quoted a former us defense department official as saying that the german secret services also provided " direct help " to the us military in identifying targets that should be bombed . greens call for investigation into possible breach of policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants the secrecy laws to be loosened to aid any enquiry the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , jürgen trittin , said it should be established whether the presence of the agents constituted a breach of stated government policy . renate künast , the green 's chief in the bundestag , said tuesday that the investigating committee into the affair should be given " the necessary parliamentary tools " to gather the evidence and come to a conclusion . for this to happen , künast added , the secrecy rule restricting the committee 's investigations should be loosened .
" this allegation must be addressed , " she said , calling for the rules concerning inspection of records and the examination of witnesses to be eased . she said that she did not want to comment on those who could be involved in the case so as not to influence any possible investigation but that " all the circumstances should be clarified . "
künast added that it would be a " normal process " for records to be kept of any agent activity in baghdad before the war and the data should therefore be investigated . künast , steinmeier refute claims of a double role she defended the social democratic-green party coalition 's stance during the iraq war and dismissed accusations that the government had been " two-faced " in its policies towards military action - on the one hand publicly denouncing the war and on the other covertly supporting the us-led invasion . steinmeier also angrily dismissed the notion that germany played a double role in the war .
" it is absurd to say that the government officially opposed the war in iraq but covertly supported it .
i will not allow history to be rewritten , " he said on friday . künast also called on the investigation committee to look into any german complicity in the cia extraordinary rendition scandal , us-instigated abductions and secret prisons on european soil . liberals see a question mark over previous administration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhardt says the previous government has a question mark over its head the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said that it wanted a completely open book on germany ’ s alleged involvement in iraq , not to accuse the bnd of wrongdoing but to clarify the allegations . parliamentary group leader wolfgang gerhardt said on tuesday that an investigation would be about " the question mark hanging over the political guidance of the social democratic-green government . " gerhardt expressed " the highest doubts " that the previous government had no knowledge of any alleged secret service activity in iraq prior to the war and said the fdp wanted a " complete investigation into the processes during and after the war .

but what would happen if a suspected case of bird flu was confirmed in central europe ?
dw-world has been finding out . nobody can and wants to say whether the virus could hit central europe .
on jan .
14 , the worst fears seemed confirmed , ironically right in the bureaucratic heart of europe .
a journalist returning from turkey to brussels complained about flu-like symptoms , which eventually turned out to be a false alarm . a day later , another person , this time in germany , was suspected to be infected with the bird flu virus .
but this too turned out to be unfounded .
the cause for the flu symptoms after a visit to bird flu-affected turkey was not the deadly h5n1 strain , but rather bronchitis .
the concerned hospital in cologne confirmed that the affected man simply had a " bad cold . " much ado about n othi n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " emergency bag , bird flu " reads the sign virologist werner lange , the former director of the influenza department of the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- in berlin , said that concerns are warranted .
he added that the hoopla surrounding the virus is a positive sign . " the fact that the doctors examined the patient so swiftly for the h5n1 virus makes me optimistic , " lange said , adding that it showed that authorities were alert and that the action plan against the epidemic in central europe was working . swift actio n crucial so far , there is no danger from those infected to others - current up-to-date information shows that there can be no human to human transmission of the virus . " the most decisive thing is that there is an initial suspicion that is acted upon , " lange said .
in other words , it 's important that the doctor thinks so far as to check a patient , who has just returned from turkey , for bird flu . after that , on a clinical and administrative level , everything then works according to the national influenza pandemic plan developed by the robert koch institute in accordance with international regulations issued by the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- .
even if there is the slightest suspicion of bird flu , the patient , for safety reasons , will be isolated in an intensive care unit of the hospital that can be quarantined . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab tests can determine the virus experts say that finally there 's no ruling out that the virus ca n't " learn " how to mutate into one that 's transmitted between humans .
laboratory tests can determine which virus has infected the patient .
at the same time there will be efforts to warn people who have come into contact with the patient , to also check themselves for the virus . lange stressed that even this procedure had " worked brilliantly " in suspected cases so far .
" in the case of the belgian man for instance , authorities already had a list of passengers who were with the affected person on the same flight . "
lange added that " if the virus was detected early , the chances of healing are good . " the case then , according to the epidemic law , has to be registered .
the national pandemic commission would then coordinate measures - in germany that would mean between who , the federal government , the states , emergency management and other authorities .
here , according to the level of danger , authorities would orient themselves towards so-called " pandemic warning periods , " of which there are six .
currently , germany is on level three . " high " likelihood of outbreak the friedrich-löffler institute -lrb- fli -rrb- complements the robert koch institute on veterinary medicine .
in an exhaustive study on the risk of bird flu from jan .
11 , 2006 , the scientists concluded that the likelihood was " high " of bird flu being transported to central europe from the affected regions in turkey or romania through illegal imports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german customs offiicials have stepped up controls at airports the german ministry for agriculture and consumer protection , however said in a statement that germany and the eu were still " well prepared " when it came to targeted monitoring of migratory birds , which could be carriers of the virus , and stepped-up controls at airports , ports or highways . and if german poultry stocks still do get infected with the virus despite all the measures , fli spokesman elke reinking said the eu was well-equipped .
the eu catalogue of measures on containing poultry epidemics " had been refined over the years , " thus increasing chances of containing a possible outbreak . " i sleep very well when it comes to this , " reinking said .
" and we 're doing everything so that it remains that way .

trade fairs are increasingly moving overseas , and insiders say it 's a win-win situation . germany has long been known as a country of trade fairs .
two thirds of the world 's leading trade fairs are held in the country , including big-name events like the cebit digital solutions fair in hanover , the international motor show in frankfurt , and the anuga food fair in cologne .
but the number of fairs held in germany has hovered steadily around 150 over the past five years , and overall visitor counts have dropped off slightly , along with revenues .
yet if the homegrown market is stagnant , asia , eastern europe and certain parts of the middle east are exploding , offering new growth opportunities to well-established german companies .
" ten to 20 new trade fairs overseas are added each year , with no sign of slowing down " over the past five years or so , said marco spinger , head of global marketing at the association of the german trade fair industry , or auma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photokina , in cologne , draws the photography world exporting a trade fair " is n't as simple as just picking up an entire fair , booths and all , and moving it to another country , " spinger said .

the frankfurt fair has built up strong ties with china , holding automotive and textile fairs there . auma designates these exported german events as " gqt " , or " german quality trade " fairs .
the exports tend to represent the strengths of what the companies do at home , spinger said .
so düsseldorf will export its know-how and contacts in medicine and fashion , while cologne may push the food industry -lrb- in thailand , for instance , -rrb- and munich brings high-tech to shanghai . the hottest expansion spots appear to be dubai , china , and russia , but any place where there is a need , and funding , to tap 50 years of german experience will do .

in 2005 germans organized 172 fairs abroad , which accounted for 1.1 million square meters -lrb- 3.6 million square feet -rrb- of a total worldwide 9.2 million - a full 12 percent of all german exhibition space .
good for smaller businesses while there are winners all around in the booming trade fair market , the biggest gainers in germany appear to be the midsize companies that form the backbone of the economy . " having german fairs abroad give smaller firms the chance to go directly to their clients overseas , " spinger explained .
" they do n't have to go through some other american or arab exhibitor .
they can join up with a group project here or be part of a german pavilion .

" we are n't cannibalizing ourselves by doing business this way , " said stephan kurzawski , vice president for business development at the messe frankfurt trade fair .

most have also taken stock of merkel 's visits to both washington and moscow , which took place within a span of five days . the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g said merkel had " emancipated herself " from her predecessor 's policies .
" under the east german chancellor , the pendulum of berlin 's foreign policy is swinging back to the center position , from which america is no greater cause for concern than russia , " the paper noted .
it added that merkel had not given up germany 's claim to an independent role in global politics .
" this intermediate power in the heart of europe can not shirk the responsibility and the influence which it has come to acquire since reunification , " the paper said . the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d said merkel had used her visits to washington and moscow for an " important realignment " but without completely shaking up relations .
" merkel has simply taken out the overriding and damaging emotions from ties : the icy hostility towards the bush administration and the cozy proximity to vladimir putin , " the paper wrote .
" the german thermostat has been set to the right rational temperatures towards east and west and thus relations with both partners is now more sober and better , " it noted , adding that it still remains unclear after merkel 's visits to washington and moscow , what the normalization means for practical politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has earned praise for being frank in talks with putin the ha n n oversche allegemei n e zeitu n g said it remained to be seen whether merkel 's criticism of " the increasing authoritarian features of the russian state " would have an effect on putin .
" but merkel 's words have fallen on fertile ground outside the moscow center , " the paper wrote .
" it 's about a long-term effect : the groups , who do n't accept their civil rights being restricted , are strengthened .
and berlin has a duty towards them . " other european newspapers commented on the personal chemistry between merkel and putin , wondering whether she would keep up the cozy ties cultivated by schröder . french daily le mo n de wrote that merkel is unlikely to get on as well with putin as her predecessor schröder .
" with time the two men developed such a great friendship that it provoked criticism in germany , " it said .
that closeness " annoyed germany 's eastern neighbors which retained a very bad memory of the alliances between berlin and moscow , " it added .
but , since she came to power , " merkel has been saying that she is working towards readjusting the right balance , " the paper said . britain 's the guardia n wrote that it was clear that merkel 's visit to moscow was going to be more difficult than her trip to washington .
" her brief businesslike trip was in striking contrast with the male bonding sessions mr. schröder , george bush and tony blair have all held over a few beers with vladimir putin .
none of them have been as forthright as they should have been on issues as important as human rights , the chechnya war , media freedoms and the yukos affair , " the paper pointed out .
" so it was impressive to see the german christian democratic chancellor talking of a " strategic partnership " but still doing publicly what the social democratic schröder -lrb- who called mr. putin a " flawless democrat " -rrb- never did privately - meeting russian ngos to register objections to laws restricting their activities .

a journalist returning from turkey to brussels complained about flu-like symptoms , which eventually turned out to be a false alarm . a day later , another person , this time in germany , was suspected to be infected with the bird flu virus .

trade fairs are increasingly moving overseas , and insiders say it 's a win-win situation . germany has long been known as a country of trade fairs .
two thirds of the world 's leading trade fairs are held in the country , including big-name events like the cebit digital solutions fair in hanover , the international motor show in frankfurt , and the anuga food fair in cologne .
but the number of fairs held in germany has hovered steadily around 150 over the past five years , and overall visitor counts have dropped off slightly , along with revenues .
yet if the homegrown market is stagnant , asia , eastern europe and certain parts of the middle east are exploding , offering new growth opportunities to well-established german companies .
" ten to 20 new trade fairs overseas are added each year , with no sign of slowing down " over the past five years or so , said marco spinger , head of global marketing at the association of the german trade fair industry , or auma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photokina , in cologne , draws the photography world exporting a trade fair " is n't as simple as just picking up an entire fair , booths and all , and moving it to another country , " spinger said .
rather , the idea is to capitalize on the brand names and know-how german trade fair companies have developed over the years and mold it to fit local needs .
düsseldorf fashion , munich high tech most of the exports are done via subsidiaries or joint ventures in other countries .
thus , electronics junkies who may have missed cebit in germany - or could n't afford the passage to hanover - can find one in australia or turkey .
the messe düsseldorf trade fair boasts 12 subsidiaries and 65 representatives across the globe ; its longstanding presence in the russian market has given it a strong foothold there and made it one of the most successful foreign companies in that country .
the frankfurt fair has built up strong ties with china , holding automotive and textile fairs there . auma designates these exported german events as " gqt " , or " german quality trade " fairs .
the exports tend to represent the strengths of what the companies do at home , spinger said .
so düsseldorf will export its know-how and contacts in medicine and fashion , while cologne may push the food industry -lrb- in thailand , for instance , -rrb- and munich brings high-tech to shanghai . the hottest expansion spots appear to be dubai , china , and russia , but any place where there is a need , and funding , to tap 50 years of german experience will do .
even the us is a prime ground for exports - 11 german trade fairs are slated to cross the atlantic in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's international auto show iaa the export growth took off around 2000 , when europe 's economy ground into decline , according to auma 's spinger .
in 2005 germans organized 172 fairs abroad , which accounted for 1.1 million square meters -lrb- 3.6 million square feet -rrb- of a total worldwide 9.2 million - a full 12 percent of all german exhibition space .
good for smaller businesses while there are winners all around in the booming trade fair market , the biggest gainers in germany appear to be the midsize companies that form the backbone of the economy . " having german fairs abroad give smaller firms the chance to go directly to their clients overseas , " spinger explained .
" they do n't have to go through some other american or arab exhibitor .
they can join up with a group project here or be part of a german pavilion .
they do n't have to do all the work themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artforum berlin despite the rosy numbers , observers have expressed concern about the effect overseas growth could have on german trade fairs .
after all , more than half of the people who come to germany to meet , greet and trade orders come from abroad .
wo n't the fairs taking place in their own backyards cut into the number of visitors who would want to make the trek to leipzig or nuremberg to do the same thing ?
numbers still high on the contrary , exhibit organizers say .
" we are n't cannibalizing ourselves by doing business this way , " said stephan kurzawski , vice president for business development at the messe frankfurt trade fair .
" our foreign trade fairs actually end up being marketing campaigns for frankfurt .
if we do an auto mechanics fair in argentina , for example , we notice a definite rise in argentine attendance at our fairs - both as exhibitors and as visitors . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms seem to have figured out what visitors want thomas kötter , a pr representative for the messe düsseldorf , agreed .
" the overseas trade fairs tend to be much smaller .
so after our exhibitors at the medica in china have had success and filled their order books at a smaller fair , we tell them , ' you 've experienced this version , but if you really want to be at the center of the entire medical world , it is in düsseldorf . '
they come ; the numbers bear that out . " kötter said he ca n't imagine that germany will be rendered obsolete by competition from overseas in the near or distant future .
" we have over 50 years of experience in building trade shows … we know how to set up the stands , how to do it so people are happy , so their information gets distributed , so they make sales . … we 've studied this , worked on it .

trade fairs are increasingly moving overseas , and insiders say it 's a win-win situation . germany has long been known as a country of trade fairs .
two thirds of the world 's leading trade fairs are held in the country , including big-name events like the cebit digital solutions fair in hanover , the international motor show in frankfurt , and the anuga food fair in cologne .
but the number of fairs held in germany has hovered steadily around 150 over the past five years , and overall visitor counts have dropped off slightly , along with revenues .
yet if the homegrown market is stagnant , asia , eastern europe and certain parts of the middle east are exploding , offering new growth opportunities to well-established german companies .
" ten to 20 new trade fairs overseas are added each year , with no sign of slowing down " over the past five years or so , said marco spinger , head of global marketing at the association of the german trade fair industry , or auma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photokina , in cologne , draws the photography world exporting a trade fair " is n't as simple as just picking up an entire fair , booths and all , and moving it to another country , " spinger said .
rather , the idea is to capitalize on the brand names and know-how german trade fair companies have developed over the years and mold it to fit local needs .
düsseldorf fashion , munich high tech most of the exports are done via subsidiaries or joint ventures in other countries .
thus , electronics junkies who may have missed cebit in germany - or could n't afford the passage to hanover - can find one in australia or turkey .
the messe düsseldorf trade fair boasts 12 subsidiaries and 65 representatives across the globe ; its longstanding presence in the russian market has given it a strong foothold there and made it one of the most successful foreign companies in that country .
the frankfurt fair has built up strong ties with china , holding automotive and textile fairs there . auma designates these exported german events as " gqt " , or " german quality trade " fairs .
the exports tend to represent the strengths of what the companies do at home , spinger said .
so düsseldorf will export its know-how and contacts in medicine and fashion , while cologne may push the food industry -lrb- in thailand , for instance , -rrb- and munich brings high-tech to shanghai . the hottest expansion spots appear to be dubai , china , and russia , but any place where there is a need , and funding , to tap 50 years of german experience will do .
even the us is a prime ground for exports - 11 german trade fairs are slated to cross the atlantic in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's international auto show iaa the export growth took off around 2000 , when europe 's economy ground into decline , according to auma 's spinger .
in 2005 germans organized 172 fairs abroad , which accounted for 1.1 million square meters -lrb- 3.6 million square feet -rrb- of a total worldwide 9.2 million - a full 12 percent of all german exhibition space .
good for smaller businesses while there are winners all around in the booming trade fair market , the biggest gainers in germany appear to be the midsize companies that form the backbone of the economy . " having german fairs abroad give smaller firms the chance to go directly to their clients overseas , " spinger explained .
" they do n't have to go through some other american or arab exhibitor .
they can join up with a group project here or be part of a german pavilion .
they do n't have to do all the work themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artforum berlin despite the rosy numbers , observers have expressed concern about the effect overseas growth could have on german trade fairs .
after all , more than half of the people who come to germany to meet , greet and trade orders come from abroad .
wo n't the fairs taking place in their own backyards cut into the number of visitors who would want to make the trek to leipzig or nuremberg to do the same thing ?
numbers still high on the contrary , exhibit organizers say .
" we are n't cannibalizing ourselves by doing business this way , " said stephan kurzawski , vice president for business development at the messe frankfurt trade fair .
" our foreign trade fairs actually end up being marketing campaigns for frankfurt .
if we do an auto mechanics fair in argentina , for example , we notice a definite rise in argentine attendance at our fairs - both as exhibitors and as visitors . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms seem to have figured out what visitors want thomas kötter , a pr representative for the messe düsseldorf , agreed .
" the overseas trade fairs tend to be much smaller .
so after our exhibitors at the medica in china have had success and filled their order books at a smaller fair , we tell them , ' you 've experienced this version , but if you really want to be at the center of the entire medical world , it is in düsseldorf . '
they come ; the numbers bear that out . " kötter said he ca n't imagine that germany will be rendered obsolete by competition from overseas in the near or distant future .
" we have over 50 years of experience in building trade shows … we know how to set up the stands , how to do it so people are happy , so their information gets distributed , so they make sales . … we 've studied this , worked on it .
they do n't have that experience .

but what would happen if a suspected case of bird flu was confirmed in central europe ?
dw-world has been finding out . nobody can and wants to say whether the virus could hit central europe .
on jan .
14 , the worst fears seemed confirmed , ironically right in the bureaucratic heart of europe .
a journalist returning from turkey to brussels complained about flu-like symptoms , which eventually turned out to be a false alarm . a day later , another person , this time in germany , was suspected to be infected with the bird flu virus .
but this too turned out to be unfounded .
the cause for the flu symptoms after a visit to bird flu-affected turkey was not the deadly h5n1 strain , but rather bronchitis .
the concerned hospital in cologne confirmed that the affected man simply had a " bad cold . " much ado about n othi n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " emergency bag , bird flu " reads the sign virologist werner lange , the former director of the influenza department of the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- in berlin , said that concerns are warranted .
he added that the hoopla surrounding the virus is a positive sign . " the fact that the doctors examined the patient so swiftly for the h5n1 virus makes me optimistic , " lange said , adding that it showed that authorities were alert and that the action plan against the epidemic in central europe was working . swift actio n crucial so far , there is no danger from those infected to others - current up-to-date information shows that there can be no human to human transmission of the virus . " the most decisive thing is that there is an initial suspicion that is acted upon , " lange said .
in other words , it 's important that the doctor thinks so far as to check a patient , who has just returned from turkey , for bird flu . after that , on a clinical and administrative level , everything then works according to the national influenza pandemic plan developed by the robert koch institute in accordance with international regulations issued by the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- .
even if there is the slightest suspicion of bird flu , the patient , for safety reasons , will be isolated in an intensive care unit of the hospital that can be quarantined . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab tests can determine the virus experts say that finally there 's no ruling out that the virus ca n't " learn " how to mutate into one that 's transmitted between humans .
laboratory tests can determine which virus has infected the patient .
at the same time there will be efforts to warn people who have come into contact with the patient , to also check themselves for the virus . lange stressed that even this procedure had " worked brilliantly " in suspected cases so far .
" in the case of the belgian man for instance , authorities already had a list of passengers who were with the affected person on the same flight . "
lange added that " if the virus was detected early , the chances of healing are good . " the case then , according to the epidemic law , has to be registered .
the national pandemic commission would then coordinate measures - in germany that would mean between who , the federal government , the states , emergency management and other authorities .
here , according to the level of danger , authorities would orient themselves towards so-called " pandemic warning periods , " of which there are six .
currently , germany is on level three . " high " likelihood of outbreak the friedrich-löffler institute -lrb- fli -rrb- complements the robert koch institute on veterinary medicine .
in an exhaustive study on the risk of bird flu from jan .
11 , 2006 , the scientists concluded that the likelihood was " high " of bird flu being transported to central europe from the affected regions in turkey or romania through illegal imports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german customs offiicials have stepped up controls at airports the german ministry for agriculture and consumer protection , however said in a statement that germany and the eu were still " well prepared " when it came to targeted monitoring of migratory birds , which could be carriers of the virus , and stepped-up controls at airports , ports or highways . and if german poultry stocks still do get infected with the virus despite all the measures , fli spokesman elke reinking said the eu was well-equipped .
the eu catalogue of measures on containing poultry epidemics " had been refined over the years , " thus increasing chances of containing a possible outbreak . " i sleep very well when it comes to this , " reinking said .
" and we 're doing everything so that it remains that way .

" better coordination at the global level is necessary to tackle the spread of avian flu and any possible outbreak of a human influenza pandemic , " kyprianou said .
" asia , and in particular china , is at the forefront in this fight .
improved surveillance , transparency and technical cooperation within the region and with the eu is key to win this battle , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers disinfect a road in heishan , in china 's northeast liaoning province china is considered one of the places where bird flu could mutate to a strain capable of human transmission , triggering a global pandemic that could spread like wildfire and kill millions . but after its cover-up of the sars respiratory disease crisis in 2003 , beijing has been praised for its transparency in tackling bird flu by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- and the un food and agriculture organization . battle against bird flu far from over the european union is co-hosting the beijing donor conference on tuesday and wednesday , along with china and the world bank .
representatives of 90 countries and 25 organizations participate . the meeting aims to hammer out a strategy to stop the deadly h5n1 virus from triggering a human pandemic that could kill millions .
the european commission is set to pledge $ 100 million -lrb- 83 million euros -rrb- . the world bank aims to raise $ 1.2 billion at the conference to battle a virus that has killed 79 people since 2003 , according to who figures . david nabarro , senior un coordinator for avian and human influenza told reuters that the fight against bird flu was far from over . " to be asking the world to invest $ 1.5 billion - which is the total i would like to see - to be asking for that sort of money , is really a very small amount in comparison with the total cost to the world of a pandemic , " nabarro said .
" we ca n't at this stage say that the situation is globally is under control .
however , i have seen a great increase in the intensity with which countries are tackling avian influenza .

parliament will debate the issue friday . parliamentarians from the greens , the free democrats and the left party all agreed on tuesday there should be an investigation into the alleged role of german agents in the invasion of iraq in march 2003 . a parliamentary debate scheduled for wednesday to decide on an enquiry was postponed until friday .
it is expected that the opposition parties will get the necessary 25 percent of votes during the debate for the investigation to go ahead . there are 614 parliamentarians in the bundestag and the necessary amount of votes in favor to begin the investigation would be 154 .
the three opposition parties hold 166 seats in the parliament . six fdp members have said they will abstain , and one green parliamentarian , former foreign minister joschka fischer , is expected to oppose the probe just as he rejected it in his parliamentary group 's vote on tuesday .
however , with the left party saying it will vote unanimously for the enquiry , it will still be enough to set the investigation in motion .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will return early from his middle east tour to attend the debate .
steinmeier is cutting his trip short to answer questions as to what exactly transpired when the former social democratic-green party coalition government retained german agents in baghdad ahead of the opening salvos of the iraq war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agents are accused of guiding missile attacks on baghdad volker beck , the chairman of the greens ' parliamentary group said it was likely that steinmeier would be called to testify during the probe to explain the government 's decision to leave two agents in baghdad despite germany 's official condemnation of the war . steinmeier , who served as then chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff , confirmed and defended the step last week , saying he had been party to it . his spokesman told reporters : " there was a decision from the german government that two agents would remain in iraq to gather information .
there was a regular exchange of information with the us side . " the government said they had passed on information to prevent the bombing of civilian targets and save lives , but the news has sparked an outcry in germany because of the bitter opposition here to the war . a report by ard television last week quoted a former us defense department official as saying that the german secret services also provided " direct help " to the us military in identifying targets that should be bombed . greens call for investigation into possible breach of policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants the secrecy laws to be loosened to aid any enquiry the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , jürgen trittin , said it should be established whether the presence of the agents constituted a breach of stated government policy . renate künast , the green 's chief in the bundestag , said tuesday that the investigating committee into the affair should be given " the necessary parliamentary tools " to gather the evidence and come to a conclusion . for this to happen , künast added , the secrecy rule restricting the committee 's investigations should be loosened .
" this allegation must be addressed , " she said , calling for the rules concerning inspection of records and the examination of witnesses to be eased . she said that she did not want to comment on those who could be involved in the case so as not to influence any possible investigation but that " all the circumstances should be clarified . "
künast added that it would be a " normal process " for records to be kept of any agent activity in baghdad before the war and the data should therefore be investigated . künast , steinmeier refute claims of a double role she defended the social democratic-green party coalition 's stance during the iraq war and dismissed accusations that the government had been " two-faced " in its policies towards military action - on the one hand publicly denouncing the war and on the other covertly supporting the us-led invasion . steinmeier also angrily dismissed the notion that germany played a double role in the war .

parliament will debate the issue friday . parliamentarians from the greens , the free democrats and the left party all agreed on tuesday there should be an investigation into the alleged role of german agents in the invasion of iraq in march 2003 . a parliamentary debate scheduled for wednesday to decide on an enquiry was postponed until friday .
it is expected that the opposition parties will get the necessary 25 percent of votes during the debate for the investigation to go ahead . there are 614 parliamentarians in the bundestag and the necessary amount of votes in favor to begin the investigation would be 154 .
the three opposition parties hold 166 seats in the parliament . six fdp members have said they will abstain , and one green parliamentarian , former foreign minister joschka fischer , is expected to oppose the probe just as he rejected it in his parliamentary group 's vote on tuesday .
however , with the left party saying it will vote unanimously for the enquiry , it will still be enough to set the investigation in motion .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will return early from his middle east tour to attend the debate .
steinmeier is cutting his trip short to answer questions as to what exactly transpired when the former social democratic-green party coalition government retained german agents in baghdad ahead of the opening salvos of the iraq war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agents are accused of guiding missile attacks on baghdad volker beck , the chairman of the greens ' parliamentary group said it was likely that steinmeier would be called to testify during the probe to explain the government 's decision to leave two agents in baghdad despite germany 's official condemnation of the war . steinmeier , who served as then chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff , confirmed and defended the step last week , saying he had been party to it . his spokesman told reporters : " there was a decision from the german government that two agents would remain in iraq to gather information .
there was a regular exchange of information with the us side . " the government said they had passed on information to prevent the bombing of civilian targets and save lives , but the news has sparked an outcry in germany because of the bitter opposition here to the war . a report by ard television last week quoted a former us defense department official as saying that the german secret services also provided " direct help " to the us military in identifying targets that should be bombed . greens call for investigation into possible breach of policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants the secrecy laws to be loosened to aid any enquiry the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , jürgen trittin , said it should be established whether the presence of the agents constituted a breach of stated government policy . renate künast , the green 's chief in the bundestag , said tuesday that the investigating committee into the affair should be given " the necessary parliamentary tools " to gather the evidence and come to a conclusion . for this to happen , künast added , the secrecy rule restricting the committee 's investigations should be loosened .
" this allegation must be addressed , " she said , calling for the rules concerning inspection of records and the examination of witnesses to be eased . she said that she did not want to comment on those who could be involved in the case so as not to influence any possible investigation but that " all the circumstances should be clarified . "
künast added that it would be a " normal process " for records to be kept of any agent activity in baghdad before the war and the data should therefore be investigated . künast , steinmeier refute claims of a double role she defended the social democratic-green party coalition 's stance during the iraq war and dismissed accusations that the government had been " two-faced " in its policies towards military action - on the one hand publicly denouncing the war and on the other covertly supporting the us-led invasion . steinmeier also angrily dismissed the notion that germany played a double role in the war .
" it is absurd to say that the government officially opposed the war in iraq but covertly supported it .
i will not allow history to be rewritten , " he said on friday . künast also called on the investigation committee to look into any german complicity in the cia extraordinary rendition scandal , us-instigated abductions and secret prisons on european soil . liberals see a question mark over previous administration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhardt says the previous government has a question mark over its head the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said that it wanted a completely open book on germany ’ s alleged involvement in iraq , not to accuse the bnd of wrongdoing but to clarify the allegations . parliamentary group leader wolfgang gerhardt said on tuesday that an investigation would be about " the question mark hanging over the political guidance of the social democratic-green government .

" merkel has simply taken out the overriding and damaging emotions from ties : the icy hostility towards the bush administration and the cozy proximity to vladimir putin , " the paper wrote .

but these and other booze bargains are now taking hold in germany . hot , leisurely days spent in beer gardens nursing stein after stein of ice-cold ale ; boisterous swaying and singing in crowded halls with frothy brew on tap - the more well-known of german drinking habits conjure up images of dedicated boozers in for the long haul .
but a disturbing new trend with the younger crowd is causing concern . while binge drinking seems to be a national sport in britain , the practice of necking vast quantities of alcohol in a short amount of time has until recently failed to find a foothold in germany where beer making is a tradition and drinking it is a pastime to be savored . however , thanks to the well-publicized introduction of an alcohol flat-rate in hanover clubs , germans may be on the brink of descending into the same violent , vomit-sprayed drinking culture which is the current bane of their island-dwelling neighbors . entry prices at bars and clubs in hanover range from four to eight euros -lrb- $ 4.83 - $ 9.66 -rrb- and then from there on in , the sparkling wine , vodka and gin flows freely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may be the scene in mallorca but do you really want to see it in german bars ?
offers such as the 99-cent party , where every drink costs under a euro , or the mallorca party where sangria is served by the bucket , are helping bars attract customers in an extremely competitive industry . but the practice is worrying health officials in germany , a country which is already among the front runners in alcohol consumption in the european union . fears that price dumpi n g will e n courage you n gsters rolf hüllinghorst from the german head office for dependency matters told the dpa press agency that " landlords are acting irresponsibly " and that price dumping offers need to be controlled if the scourge of binge drinking is n't going to add to the temptations and dangers open to children and young people across the country . lower saxony 's conservative social minister , mechthild ross-luttmann , has also appealed to the club operators to act more responsibly when dealing with young people . the hanover landlords have defended themselves by saying that they would never entice young people to drink excessive amounts of alcohol for the sake of it . one bar manager , jan witte , claims that he has no knowledge of such overtly boozy behavior and wild alcohol parties at his establishment . " my club is not a binging center and has no shooters bar -lrb- a selection of cheap and powerful single measures -rrb- , " he said . this goes against the advertisement on his club 's web site that says " for those who ca n't get enough down their neck , there is now the flat rate every thursday and friday . " witte defended this by saying people could also drink as much mineral water and soft drinks as they like . legal age limit n o guara n tee while many bars and clubs advertise the bargain sessions as " all you can drink , " the majority make it clear that identification bearing the date of birth will be required upon entry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more young people are seeking treatment for alcohol problems .
the law stipulates that young people under the age of 18 are not allowed to be served alcohol .
however , while most bars are very strict at adhering to the rule , young people continue to turn up as casualties of alcohol in hospitals and as patients in addiction clinics across germany .
it seems obvious to state , say some but turning 18 does not immediately furnish a young drinker with a sensible attitude to alcohol consumption . the authorities in hanover have joined forces to assess the threat and apply pressure on those clubs which consciously or otherwise encourage cut-price drinking binges in the city . addiction experts and state ministers continue to discuss the dangers while police and other emergency services deal with the realities on the ground .
while plans are considered , however , the cheap alcohol continues to flow . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts warn about powdered alcohol just as youth advocates hail the fact that sales of " alcopops , " sweet drinks containing alcohol , are declining among kids , another product is raising concerns - alcopops in powder form , which are growing in popularity .

offers such as the 99-cent party , where every drink costs under a euro , or the mallorca party where sangria is served by the bucket , are helping bars attract customers in an extremely competitive industry . but the practice is worrying health officials in germany , a country which is already among the front runners in alcohol consumption in the european union . fears that price dumpi n g will e n courage you n gsters rolf hüllinghorst from the german head office for dependency matters told the dpa press agency that " landlords are acting irresponsibly " and that price dumping offers need to be controlled if the scourge of binge drinking is n't going to add to the temptations and dangers open to children and young people across the country . lower saxony 's conservative social minister , mechthild ross-luttmann , has also appealed to the club operators to act more responsibly when dealing with young people . the hanover landlords have defended themselves by saying that they would never entice young people to drink excessive amounts of alcohol for the sake of it . one bar manager , jan witte , claims that he has no knowledge of such overtly boozy behavior and wild alcohol parties at his establishment . " my club is not a binging center and has no shooters bar -lrb- a selection of cheap and powerful single measures -rrb- , " he said . this goes against the advertisement on his club 's web site that says " for those who ca n't get enough down their neck , there is now the flat rate every thursday and friday . " witte defended this by saying people could also drink as much mineral water and soft drinks as they like . legal age limit n o guara n tee while many bars and clubs advertise the bargain sessions as " all you can drink , " the majority make it clear that identification bearing the date of birth will be required upon entry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more young people are seeking treatment for alcohol problems .
the law stipulates that young people under the age of 18 are not allowed to be served alcohol .
however , while most bars are very strict at adhering to the rule , young people continue to turn up as casualties of alcohol in hospitals and as patients in addiction clinics across germany .
it seems obvious to state , say some but turning 18 does not immediately furnish a young drinker with a sensible attitude to alcohol consumption . the authorities in hanover have joined forces to assess the threat and apply pressure on those clubs which consciously or otherwise encourage cut-price drinking binges in the city . addiction experts and state ministers continue to discuss the dangers while police and other emergency services deal with the realities on the ground .
while plans are considered , however , the cheap alcohol continues to flow . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts warn about powdered alcohol just as youth advocates hail the fact that sales of " alcopops , " sweet drinks containing alcohol , are declining among kids , another product is raising concerns - alcopops in powder form , which are growing in popularity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.01.2006 trade-fair know-how is hot german export großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the world leader in trade fairs german manufacturers are n't the only ones fighting to boost exports .
trade fairs are increasingly moving overseas , and insiders say it 's a win-win situation . germany has long been known as a country of trade fairs .
two thirds of the world 's leading trade fairs are held in the country , including big-name events like the cebit digital solutions fair in hanover , the international motor show in frankfurt , and the anuga food fair in cologne .
but the number of fairs held in germany has hovered steadily around 150 over the past five years , and overall visitor counts have dropped off slightly , along with revenues .
yet if the homegrown market is stagnant , asia , eastern europe and certain parts of the middle east are exploding , offering new growth opportunities to well-established german companies .
" ten to 20 new trade fairs overseas are added each year , with no sign of slowing down " over the past five years or so , said marco spinger , head of global marketing at the association of the german trade fair industry , or auma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photokina , in cologne , draws the photography world exporting a trade fair " is n't as simple as just picking up an entire fair , booths and all , and moving it to another country , " spinger said .
rather , the idea is to capitalize on the brand names and know-how german trade fair companies have developed over the years and mold it to fit local needs .
düsseldorf fashion , munich high tech most of the exports are done via subsidiaries or joint ventures in other countries .
thus , electronics junkies who may have missed cebit in germany - or could n't afford the passage to hanover - can find one in australia or turkey .
the messe düsseldorf trade fair boasts 12 subsidiaries and 65 representatives across the globe ; its longstanding presence in the russian market has given it a strong foothold there and made it one of the most successful foreign companies in that country .
the frankfurt fair has built up strong ties with china , holding automotive and textile fairs there . auma designates these exported german events as " gqt " , or " german quality trade " fairs .
the exports tend to represent the strengths of what the companies do at home , spinger said .
so düsseldorf will export its know-how and contacts in medicine and fashion , while cologne may push the food industry -lrb- in thailand , for instance , -rrb- and munich brings high-tech to shanghai . the hottest expansion spots appear to be dubai , china , and russia , but any place where there is a need , and funding , to tap 50 years of german experience will do .
even the us is a prime ground for exports - 11 german trade fairs are slated to cross the atlantic in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's international auto show iaa the export growth took off around 2000 , when europe 's economy ground into decline , according to auma 's spinger .
in 2005 germans organized 172 fairs abroad , which accounted for 1.1 million square meters -lrb- 3.6 million square feet -rrb- of a total worldwide 9.2 million - a full 12 percent of all german exhibition space .
good for smaller businesses while there are winners all around in the booming trade fair market , the biggest gainers in germany appear to be the midsize companies that form the backbone of the economy . " having german fairs abroad give smaller firms the chance to go directly to their clients overseas , " spinger explained .
" they do n't have to go through some other american or arab exhibitor .
they can join up with a group project here or be part of a german pavilion .
they do n't have to do all the work themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artforum berlin despite the rosy numbers , observers have expressed concern about the effect overseas growth could have on german trade fairs .
after all , more than half of the people who come to germany to meet , greet and trade orders come from abroad .
wo n't the fairs taking place in their own backyards cut into the number of visitors who would want to make the trek to leipzig or nuremberg to do the same thing ?
numbers still high on the contrary , exhibit organizers say .
" we are n't cannibalizing ourselves by doing business this way , " said stephan kurzawski , vice president for business development at the messe frankfurt trade fair .
" our foreign trade fairs actually end up being marketing campaigns for frankfurt .
if we do an auto mechanics fair in argentina , for example , we notice a definite rise in argentine attendance at our fairs - both as exhibitors and as visitors . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms seem to have figured out what visitors want thomas kötter , a pr representative for the messe düsseldorf , agreed .
" the overseas trade fairs tend to be much smaller .
so after our exhibitors at the medica in china have had success and filled their order books at a smaller fair , we tell them , ' you 've experienced this version , but if you really want to be at the center of the entire medical world , it is in düsseldorf . '
they come ; the numbers bear that out . " kötter said he ca n't imagine that germany will be rendered obsolete by competition from overseas in the near or distant future .
" we have over 50 years of experience in building trade shows … we know how to set up the stands , how to do it so people are happy , so their information gets distributed , so they make sales . … we 've studied this , worked on it .
they do n't have that experience .

leers is actually opposed to drugs , but said he preferred to regulate the legal trade of soft drugs rather than have everything go underground . " the coffee shops are located in the city centre , " leers said , " but in maastricht there are over a hundred private residencies that also illegally cater to this wave of drug users . " criticism from n eighbors supported by maastricht 's aldermen and the coffee shop owners , the mayor 's project , dubbed the " weed boulevard " in the local media , has attracted fierce criticism from the neighboring belgian communities of fourons and lanaken . " some 80 to 90 percent of the traffic in the direction of maastricht passes through fourons and as the legal sale of soft drugs comes closer to the border the illegal traffic in hard drugs will also come to the surrounding areas , being the territory of fourons or -lrb- near-by -rrb- vise , " said huub broers , the mayor of fourons , a town some 15 kilometers -lrb- 10 miles -rrb- from maastricht .

most have also taken stock of merkel 's visits to both washington and moscow , which took place within a span of five days . the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g said merkel had " emancipated herself " from her predecessor 's policies .
" under the east german chancellor , the pendulum of berlin 's foreign policy is swinging back to the center position , from which america is no greater cause for concern than russia , " the paper noted .
it added that merkel had not given up germany 's claim to an independent role in global politics .
" this intermediate power in the heart of europe can not shirk the responsibility and the influence which it has come to acquire since reunification , " the paper said . the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d said merkel had used her visits to washington and moscow for an " important realignment " but without completely shaking up relations .
" merkel has simply taken out the overriding and damaging emotions from ties : the icy hostility towards the bush administration and the cozy proximity to vladimir putin , " the paper wrote .
" the german thermostat has been set to the right rational temperatures towards east and west and thus relations with both partners is now more sober and better , " it noted , adding that it still remains unclear after merkel 's visits to washington and moscow , what the normalization means for practical politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has earned praise for being frank in talks with putin the ha n n oversche allegemei n e zeitu n g said it remained to be seen whether merkel 's criticism of " the increasing authoritarian features of the russian state " would have an effect on putin .
" but merkel 's words have fallen on fertile ground outside the moscow center , " the paper wrote .
" it 's about a long-term effect : the groups , who do n't accept their civil rights being restricted , are strengthened .
and berlin has a duty towards them . " other european newspapers commented on the personal chemistry between merkel and putin , wondering whether she would keep up the cozy ties cultivated by schröder . french daily le mo n de wrote that merkel is unlikely to get on as well with putin as her predecessor schröder .
" with time the two men developed such a great friendship that it provoked criticism in germany , " it said .
that closeness " annoyed germany 's eastern neighbors which retained a very bad memory of the alliances between berlin and moscow , " it added .
but , since she came to power , " merkel has been saying that she is working towards readjusting the right balance , " the paper said . britain 's the guardia n wrote that it was clear that merkel 's visit to moscow was going to be more difficult than her trip to washington .
" her brief businesslike trip was in striking contrast with the male bonding sessions mr. schröder , george bush and tony blair have all held over a few beers with vladimir putin .
none of them have been as forthright as they should have been on issues as important as human rights , the chechnya war , media freedoms and the yukos affair , " the paper pointed out .
" so it was impressive to see the german christian democratic chancellor talking of a " strategic partnership " but still doing publicly what the social democratic schröder -lrb- who called mr. putin a " flawless democrat " -rrb- never did privately - meeting russian ngos to register objections to laws restricting their activities .
encouraging democracy , civil society and stability is in the interest of russia 's neighbors , " the paper wrote . in russia , the trud daily said that although the " iron frau " will not be " the same kind of friend that gerhard schröder was to vladimir putin , " this should have little effect on general relations between germany and russia .
these relations , the paper argued , " are based on firm economic foundations . " another russian paper , kommersa n t ran an article headlined " friend angela : new german chancellor turns out to be no worse than the old one . "
the paper wrote : " mrs. merkel was doing her best to stress the continuity of gerhard schröder 's policies .
angela merkel seems to be running ahead of her own locomotive .
she even declared that the partnership between russia and germany must be far more intensive than before .

leers is actually opposed to drugs , but said he preferred to regulate the legal trade of soft drugs rather than have everything go underground . " the coffee shops are located in the city centre , " leers said , " but in maastricht there are over a hundred private residencies that also illegally cater to this wave of drug users . " criticism from n eighbors supported by maastricht 's aldermen and the coffee shop owners , the mayor 's project , dubbed the " weed boulevard " in the local media , has attracted fierce criticism from the neighboring belgian communities of fourons and lanaken . " some 80 to 90 percent of the traffic in the direction of maastricht passes through fourons and as the legal sale of soft drugs comes closer to the border the illegal traffic in hard drugs will also come to the surrounding areas , being the territory of fourons or -lrb- near-by -rrb- vise , " said huub broers , the mayor of fourons , a town some 15 kilometers -lrb- 10 miles -rrb- from maastricht .

but a disturbing new trend with the younger crowd is causing concern . while binge drinking seems to be a national sport in britain , the practice of necking vast quantities of alcohol in a short amount of time has until recently failed to find a foothold in germany where beer making is a tradition and drinking it is a pastime to be savored . however , thanks to the well-publicized introduction of an alcohol flat-rate in hanover clubs , germans may be on the brink of descending into the same violent , vomit-sprayed drinking culture which is the current bane of their island-dwelling neighbors . entry prices at bars and clubs in hanover range from four to eight euros -lrb- $ 4.83 - $ 9.66 -rrb- and then from there on in , the sparkling wine , vodka and gin flows freely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may be the scene in mallorca but do you really want to see it in german bars ?
offers such as the 99-cent party , where every drink costs under a euro , or the mallorca party where sangria is served by the bucket , are helping bars attract customers in an extremely competitive industry . but the practice is worrying health officials in germany , a country which is already among the front runners in alcohol consumption in the european union . fears that price dumpi n g will e n courage you n gsters rolf hüllinghorst from the german head office for dependency matters told the dpa press agency that " landlords are acting irresponsibly " and that price dumping offers need to be controlled if the scourge of binge drinking is n't going to add to the temptations and dangers open to children and young people across the country . lower saxony 's conservative social minister , mechthild ross-luttmann , has also appealed to the club operators to act more responsibly when dealing with young people . the hanover landlords have defended themselves by saying that they would never entice young people to drink excessive amounts of alcohol for the sake of it . one bar manager , jan witte , claims that he has no knowledge of such overtly boozy behavior and wild alcohol parties at his establishment . " my club is not a binging center and has no shooters bar -lrb- a selection of cheap and powerful single measures -rrb- , " he said . this goes against the advertisement on his club 's web site that says " for those who ca n't get enough down their neck , there is now the flat rate every thursday and friday .

the law stipulates that young people under the age of 18 are not allowed to be served alcohol .
however , while most bars are very strict at adhering to the rule , young people continue to turn up as casualties of alcohol in hospitals and as patients in addiction clinics across germany .
it seems obvious to state , say some but turning 18 does not immediately furnish a young drinker with a sensible attitude to alcohol consumption . the authorities in hanover have joined forces to assess the threat and apply pressure on those clubs which consciously or otherwise encourage cut-price drinking binges in the city . addiction experts and state ministers continue to discuss the dangers while police and other emergency services deal with the realities on the ground .

but what would happen if a suspected case of bird flu was confirmed in central europe ?
dw-world has been finding out . nobody can and wants to say whether the virus could hit central europe .
on jan .
14 , the worst fears seemed confirmed , ironically right in the bureaucratic heart of europe .
a journalist returning from turkey to brussels complained about flu-like symptoms , which eventually turned out to be a false alarm . a day later , another person , this time in germany , was suspected to be infected with the bird flu virus .
but this too turned out to be unfounded .
the cause for the flu symptoms after a visit to bird flu-affected turkey was not the deadly h5n1 strain , but rather bronchitis .
the concerned hospital in cologne confirmed that the affected man simply had a " bad cold . " much ado about n othi n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " emergency bag , bird flu " reads the sign virologist werner lange , the former director of the influenza department of the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- in berlin , said that concerns are warranted .
he added that the hoopla surrounding the virus is a positive sign . " the fact that the doctors examined the patient so swiftly for the h5n1 virus makes me optimistic , " lange said , adding that it showed that authorities were alert and that the action plan against the epidemic in central europe was working . swift actio n crucial so far , there is no danger from those infected to others - current up-to-date information shows that there can be no human to human transmission of the virus . " the most decisive thing is that there is an initial suspicion that is acted upon , " lange said .
in other words , it 's important that the doctor thinks so far as to check a patient , who has just returned from turkey , for bird flu . after that , on a clinical and administrative level , everything then works according to the national influenza pandemic plan developed by the robert koch institute in accordance with international regulations issued by the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- .
even if there is the slightest suspicion of bird flu , the patient , for safety reasons , will be isolated in an intensive care unit of the hospital that can be quarantined . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab tests can determine the virus experts say that finally there 's no ruling out that the virus ca n't " learn " how to mutate into one that 's transmitted between humans .
laboratory tests can determine which virus has infected the patient .
at the same time there will be efforts to warn people who have come into contact with the patient , to also check themselves for the virus . lange stressed that even this procedure had " worked brilliantly " in suspected cases so far .
" in the case of the belgian man for instance , authorities already had a list of passengers who were with the affected person on the same flight . "
lange added that " if the virus was detected early , the chances of healing are good . " the case then , according to the epidemic law , has to be registered .
the national pandemic commission would then coordinate measures - in germany that would mean between who , the federal government , the states , emergency management and other authorities .
here , according to the level of danger , authorities would orient themselves towards so-called " pandemic warning periods , " of which there are six .
currently , germany is on level three . " high " likelihood of outbreak the friedrich-löffler institute -lrb- fli -rrb- complements the robert koch institute on veterinary medicine .
in an exhaustive study on the risk of bird flu from jan .
11 , 2006 , the scientists concluded that the likelihood was " high " of bird flu being transported to central europe from the affected regions in turkey or romania through illegal imports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german customs offiicials have stepped up controls at airports the german ministry for agriculture and consumer protection , however said in a statement that germany and the eu were still " well prepared " when it came to targeted monitoring of migratory birds , which could be carriers of the virus , and stepped-up controls at airports , ports or highways . and if german poultry stocks still do get infected with the virus despite all the measures , fli spokesman elke reinking said the eu was well-equipped .
the eu catalogue of measures on containing poultry epidemics " had been refined over the years , " thus increasing chances of containing a possible outbreak . " i sleep very well when it comes to this , " reinking said .
" and we 're doing everything so that it remains that way .

trade fairs are increasingly moving overseas , and insiders say it 's a win-win situation . germany has long been known as a country of trade fairs .
two thirds of the world 's leading trade fairs are held in the country , including big-name events like the cebit digital solutions fair in hanover , the international motor show in frankfurt , and the anuga food fair in cologne .
but the number of fairs held in germany has hovered steadily around 150 over the past five years , and overall visitor counts have dropped off slightly , along with revenues .
yet if the homegrown market is stagnant , asia , eastern europe and certain parts of the middle east are exploding , offering new growth opportunities to well-established german companies .
" ten to 20 new trade fairs overseas are added each year , with no sign of slowing down " over the past five years or so , said marco spinger , head of global marketing at the association of the german trade fair industry , or auma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photokina , in cologne , draws the photography world exporting a trade fair " is n't as simple as just picking up an entire fair , booths and all , and moving it to another country , " spinger said .
rather , the idea is to capitalize on the brand names and know-how german trade fair companies have developed over the years and mold it to fit local needs .
düsseldorf fashion , munich high tech most of the exports are done via subsidiaries or joint ventures in other countries .
thus , electronics junkies who may have missed cebit in germany - or could n't afford the passage to hanover - can find one in australia or turkey .
the messe düsseldorf trade fair boasts 12 subsidiaries and 65 representatives across the globe ; its longstanding presence in the russian market has given it a strong foothold there and made it one of the most successful foreign companies in that country .
the frankfurt fair has built up strong ties with china , holding automotive and textile fairs there . auma designates these exported german events as " gqt " , or " german quality trade " fairs .
the exports tend to represent the strengths of what the companies do at home , spinger said .
so düsseldorf will export its know-how and contacts in medicine and fashion , while cologne may push the food industry -lrb- in thailand , for instance , -rrb- and munich brings high-tech to shanghai . the hottest expansion spots appear to be dubai , china , and russia , but any place where there is a need , and funding , to tap 50 years of german experience will do .
even the us is a prime ground for exports - 11 german trade fairs are slated to cross the atlantic in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's international auto show iaa the export growth took off around 2000 , when europe 's economy ground into decline , according to auma 's spinger .
in 2005 germans organized 172 fairs abroad , which accounted for 1.1 million square meters -lrb- 3.6 million square feet -rrb- of a total worldwide 9.2 million - a full 12 percent of all german exhibition space .
good for smaller businesses while there are winners all around in the booming trade fair market , the biggest gainers in germany appear to be the midsize companies that form the backbone of the economy . " having german fairs abroad give smaller firms the chance to go directly to their clients overseas , " spinger explained .
" they do n't have to go through some other american or arab exhibitor .
they can join up with a group project here or be part of a german pavilion .
they do n't have to do all the work themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artforum berlin despite the rosy numbers , observers have expressed concern about the effect overseas growth could have on german trade fairs .
after all , more than half of the people who come to germany to meet , greet and trade orders come from abroad .
wo n't the fairs taking place in their own backyards cut into the number of visitors who would want to make the trek to leipzig or nuremberg to do the same thing ?
numbers still high on the contrary , exhibit organizers say .
" we are n't cannibalizing ourselves by doing business this way , " said stephan kurzawski , vice president for business development at the messe frankfurt trade fair .
" our foreign trade fairs actually end up being marketing campaigns for frankfurt .
if we do an auto mechanics fair in argentina , for example , we notice a definite rise in argentine attendance at our fairs - both as exhibitors and as visitors . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms seem to have figured out what visitors want thomas kötter , a pr representative for the messe düsseldorf , agreed .
" the overseas trade fairs tend to be much smaller .
so after our exhibitors at the medica in china have had success and filled their order books at a smaller fair , we tell them , ' you 've experienced this version , but if you really want to be at the center of the entire medical world , it is in düsseldorf . '
they come ; the numbers bear that out . " kötter said he ca n't imagine that germany will be rendered obsolete by competition from overseas in the near or distant future .
" we have over 50 years of experience in building trade shows … we know how to set up the stands , how to do it so people are happy , so their information gets distributed , so they make sales . … we 've studied this , worked on it .

but what would happen if a suspected case of bird flu was confirmed in central europe ?
dw-world has been finding out . nobody can and wants to say whether the virus could hit central europe .
on jan .
14 , the worst fears seemed confirmed , ironically right in the bureaucratic heart of europe .
a journalist returning from turkey to brussels complained about flu-like symptoms , which eventually turned out to be a false alarm . a day later , another person , this time in germany , was suspected to be infected with the bird flu virus .
but this too turned out to be unfounded .

most have also taken stock of merkel 's visits to both washington and moscow , which took place within a span of five days . the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g said merkel had " emancipated herself " from her predecessor 's policies .
" under the east german chancellor , the pendulum of berlin 's foreign policy is swinging back to the center position , from which america is no greater cause for concern than russia , " the paper noted .
it added that merkel had not given up germany 's claim to an independent role in global politics .
" this intermediate power in the heart of europe can not shirk the responsibility and the influence which it has come to acquire since reunification , " the paper said . the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d said merkel had used her visits to washington and moscow for an " important realignment " but without completely shaking up relations .
" merkel has simply taken out the overriding and damaging emotions from ties : the icy hostility towards the bush administration and the cozy proximity to vladimir putin , " the paper wrote .
" the german thermostat has been set to the right rational temperatures towards east and west and thus relations with both partners is now more sober and better , " it noted , adding that it still remains unclear after merkel 's visits to washington and moscow , what the normalization means for practical politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has earned praise for being frank in talks with putin the ha n n oversche allegemei n e zeitu n g said it remained to be seen whether merkel 's criticism of " the increasing authoritarian features of the russian state " would have an effect on putin .
" but merkel 's words have fallen on fertile ground outside the moscow center , " the paper wrote .
" it 's about a long-term effect : the groups , who do n't accept their civil rights being restricted , are strengthened .
and berlin has a duty towards them . " other european newspapers commented on the personal chemistry between merkel and putin , wondering whether she would keep up the cozy ties cultivated by schröder . french daily le mo n de wrote that merkel is unlikely to get on as well with putin as her predecessor schröder .
" with time the two men developed such a great friendship that it provoked criticism in germany , " it said .
that closeness " annoyed germany 's eastern neighbors which retained a very bad memory of the alliances between berlin and moscow , " it added .
but , since she came to power , " merkel has been saying that she is working towards readjusting the right balance , " the paper said . britain 's the guardia n wrote that it was clear that merkel 's visit to moscow was going to be more difficult than her trip to washington .
" her brief businesslike trip was in striking contrast with the male bonding sessions mr. schröder , george bush and tony blair have all held over a few beers with vladimir putin .
none of them have been as forthright as they should have been on issues as important as human rights , the chechnya war , media freedoms and the yukos affair , " the paper pointed out .
" so it was impressive to see the german christian democratic chancellor talking of a " strategic partnership " but still doing publicly what the social democratic schröder -lrb- who called mr. putin a " flawless democrat " -rrb- never did privately - meeting russian ngos to register objections to laws restricting their activities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.01.2006 bundestag likely to probe german role in us invasion of iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german parliament will vote on whether to investigate the bnd 's role in iraq germany 's opposition parties agreed tuesday that there should be an enquiry into the possible involvement of the federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- in the iraq war .
parliament will debate the issue friday . parliamentarians from the greens , the free democrats and the left party all agreed on tuesday there should be an investigation into the alleged role of german agents in the invasion of iraq in march 2003 . a parliamentary debate scheduled for wednesday to decide on an enquiry was postponed until friday .
it is expected that the opposition parties will get the necessary 25 percent of votes during the debate for the investigation to go ahead . there are 614 parliamentarians in the bundestag and the necessary amount of votes in favor to begin the investigation would be 154 .
the three opposition parties hold 166 seats in the parliament . six fdp members have said they will abstain , and one green parliamentarian , former foreign minister joschka fischer , is expected to oppose the probe just as he rejected it in his parliamentary group 's vote on tuesday .
however , with the left party saying it will vote unanimously for the enquiry , it will still be enough to set the investigation in motion .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will return early from his middle east tour to attend the debate .
steinmeier is cutting his trip short to answer questions as to what exactly transpired when the former social democratic-green party coalition government retained german agents in baghdad ahead of the opening salvos of the iraq war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agents are accused of guiding missile attacks on baghdad volker beck , the chairman of the greens ' parliamentary group said it was likely that steinmeier would be called to testify during the probe to explain the government 's decision to leave two agents in baghdad despite germany 's official condemnation of the war . steinmeier , who served as then chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff , confirmed and defended the step last week , saying he had been party to it . his spokesman told reporters : " there was a decision from the german government that two agents would remain in iraq to gather information .
there was a regular exchange of information with the us side . " the government said they had passed on information to prevent the bombing of civilian targets and save lives , but the news has sparked an outcry in germany because of the bitter opposition here to the war . a report by ard television last week quoted a former us defense department official as saying that the german secret services also provided " direct help " to the us military in identifying targets that should be bombed . greens call for investigation into possible breach of policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants the secrecy laws to be loosened to aid any enquiry the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , jürgen trittin , said it should be established whether the presence of the agents constituted a breach of stated government policy . renate künast , the green 's chief in the bundestag , said tuesday that the investigating committee into the affair should be given " the necessary parliamentary tools " to gather the evidence and come to a conclusion . for this to happen , künast added , the secrecy rule restricting the committee 's investigations should be loosened .
" this allegation must be addressed , " she said , calling for the rules concerning inspection of records and the examination of witnesses to be eased . she said that she did not want to comment on those who could be involved in the case so as not to influence any possible investigation but that " all the circumstances should be clarified . "
künast added that it would be a " normal process " for records to be kept of any agent activity in baghdad before the war and the data should therefore be investigated . künast , steinmeier refute claims of a double role she defended the social democratic-green party coalition 's stance during the iraq war and dismissed accusations that the government had been " two-faced " in its policies towards military action - on the one hand publicly denouncing the war and on the other covertly supporting the us-led invasion . steinmeier also angrily dismissed the notion that germany played a double role in the war .

parliament will debate the issue friday . parliamentarians from the greens , the free democrats and the left party all agreed on tuesday there should be an investigation into the alleged role of german agents in the invasion of iraq in march 2003 . a parliamentary debate scheduled for wednesday to decide on an enquiry was postponed until friday .
it is expected that the opposition parties will get the necessary 25 percent of votes during the debate for the investigation to go ahead . there are 614 parliamentarians in the bundestag and the necessary amount of votes in favor to begin the investigation would be 154 .
the three opposition parties hold 166 seats in the parliament . six fdp members have said they will abstain , and one green parliamentarian , former foreign minister joschka fischer , is expected to oppose the probe just as he rejected it in his parliamentary group 's vote on tuesday .
however , with the left party saying it will vote unanimously for the enquiry , it will still be enough to set the investigation in motion .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will return early from his middle east tour to attend the debate .
steinmeier is cutting his trip short to answer questions as to what exactly transpired when the former social democratic-green party coalition government retained german agents in baghdad ahead of the opening salvos of the iraq war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agents are accused of guiding missile attacks on baghdad volker beck , the chairman of the greens ' parliamentary group said it was likely that steinmeier would be called to testify during the probe to explain the government 's decision to leave two agents in baghdad despite germany 's official condemnation of the war . steinmeier , who served as then chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff , confirmed and defended the step last week , saying he had been party to it . his spokesman told reporters : " there was a decision from the german government that two agents would remain in iraq to gather information .
there was a regular exchange of information with the us side . " the government said they had passed on information to prevent the bombing of civilian targets and save lives , but the news has sparked an outcry in germany because of the bitter opposition here to the war . a report by ard television last week quoted a former us defense department official as saying that the german secret services also provided " direct help " to the us military in identifying targets that should be bombed . greens call for investigation into possible breach of policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants the secrecy laws to be loosened to aid any enquiry the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , jürgen trittin , said it should be established whether the presence of the agents constituted a breach of stated government policy . renate künast , the green 's chief in the bundestag , said tuesday that the investigating committee into the affair should be given " the necessary parliamentary tools " to gather the evidence and come to a conclusion . for this to happen , künast added , the secrecy rule restricting the committee 's investigations should be loosened .
" this allegation must be addressed , " she said , calling for the rules concerning inspection of records and the examination of witnesses to be eased . she said that she did not want to comment on those who could be involved in the case so as not to influence any possible investigation but that " all the circumstances should be clarified . "
künast added that it would be a " normal process " for records to be kept of any agent activity in baghdad before the war and the data should therefore be investigated . künast , steinmeier refute claims of a double role she defended the social democratic-green party coalition 's stance during the iraq war and dismissed accusations that the government had been " two-faced " in its policies towards military action - on the one hand publicly denouncing the war and on the other covertly supporting the us-led invasion . steinmeier also angrily dismissed the notion that germany played a double role in the war .

parliament will debate the issue friday . parliamentarians from the greens , the free democrats and the left party all agreed on tuesday there should be an investigation into the alleged role of german agents in the invasion of iraq in march 2003 . a parliamentary debate scheduled for wednesday to decide on an enquiry was postponed until friday .
it is expected that the opposition parties will get the necessary 25 percent of votes during the debate for the investigation to go ahead . there are 614 parliamentarians in the bundestag and the necessary amount of votes in favor to begin the investigation would be 154 .
the three opposition parties hold 166 seats in the parliament . six fdp members have said they will abstain , and one green parliamentarian , former foreign minister joschka fischer , is expected to oppose the probe just as he rejected it in his parliamentary group 's vote on tuesday .
however , with the left party saying it will vote unanimously for the enquiry , it will still be enough to set the investigation in motion .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will return early from his middle east tour to attend the debate .
steinmeier is cutting his trip short to answer questions as to what exactly transpired when the former social democratic-green party coalition government retained german agents in baghdad ahead of the opening salvos of the iraq war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agents are accused of guiding missile attacks on baghdad volker beck , the chairman of the greens ' parliamentary group said it was likely that steinmeier would be called to testify during the probe to explain the government 's decision to leave two agents in baghdad despite germany 's official condemnation of the war . steinmeier , who served as then chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff , confirmed and defended the step last week , saying he had been party to it . his spokesman told reporters : " there was a decision from the german government that two agents would remain in iraq to gather information .
there was a regular exchange of information with the us side . " the government said they had passed on information to prevent the bombing of civilian targets and save lives , but the news has sparked an outcry in germany because of the bitter opposition here to the war . a report by ard television last week quoted a former us defense department official as saying that the german secret services also provided " direct help " to the us military in identifying targets that should be bombed . greens call for investigation into possible breach of policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants the secrecy laws to be loosened to aid any enquiry the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , jürgen trittin , said it should be established whether the presence of the agents constituted a breach of stated government policy . renate künast , the green 's chief in the bundestag , said tuesday that the investigating committee into the affair should be given " the necessary parliamentary tools " to gather the evidence and come to a conclusion . for this to happen , künast added , the secrecy rule restricting the committee 's investigations should be loosened .
" this allegation must be addressed , " she said , calling for the rules concerning inspection of records and the examination of witnesses to be eased . she said that she did not want to comment on those who could be involved in the case so as not to influence any possible investigation but that " all the circumstances should be clarified . "
künast added that it would be a " normal process " for records to be kept of any agent activity in baghdad before the war and the data should therefore be investigated . künast , steinmeier refute claims of a double role she defended the social democratic-green party coalition 's stance during the iraq war and dismissed accusations that the government had been " two-faced " in its policies towards military action - on the one hand publicly denouncing the war and on the other covertly supporting the us-led invasion . steinmeier also angrily dismissed the notion that germany played a double role in the war .

but a disturbing new trend with the younger crowd is causing concern . while binge drinking seems to be a national sport in britain , the practice of necking vast quantities of alcohol in a short amount of time has until recently failed to find a foothold in germany where beer making is a tradition and drinking it is a pastime to be savored . however , thanks to the well-publicized introduction of an alcohol flat-rate in hanover clubs , germans may be on the brink of descending into the same violent , vomit-sprayed drinking culture which is the current bane of their island-dwelling neighbors . entry prices at bars and clubs in hanover range from four to eight euros -lrb- $ 4.83 - $ 9.66 -rrb- and then from there on in , the sparkling wine , vodka and gin flows freely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may be the scene in mallorca but do you really want to see it in german bars ?
offers such as the 99-cent party , where every drink costs under a euro , or the mallorca party where sangria is served by the bucket , are helping bars attract customers in an extremely competitive industry . but the practice is worrying health officials in germany , a country which is already among the front runners in alcohol consumption in the european union . fears that price dumpi n g will e n courage you n gsters rolf hüllinghorst from the german head office for dependency matters told the dpa press agency that " landlords are acting irresponsibly " and that price dumping offers need to be controlled if the scourge of binge drinking is n't going to add to the temptations and dangers open to children and young people across the country . lower saxony 's conservative social minister , mechthild ross-luttmann , has also appealed to the club operators to act more responsibly when dealing with young people . the hanover landlords have defended themselves by saying that they would never entice young people to drink excessive amounts of alcohol for the sake of it . one bar manager , jan witte , claims that he has no knowledge of such overtly boozy behavior and wild alcohol parties at his establishment . " my club is not a binging center and has no shooters bar -lrb- a selection of cheap and powerful single measures -rrb- , " he said . this goes against the advertisement on his club 's web site that says " for those who ca n't get enough down their neck , there is now the flat rate every thursday and friday .

however , while most bars are very strict at adhering to the rule , young people continue to turn up as casualties of alcohol in hospitals and as patients in addiction clinics across germany .

but these and other booze bargains are now taking hold in germany . hot , leisurely days spent in beer gardens nursing stein after stein of ice-cold ale ; boisterous swaying and singing in crowded halls with frothy brew on tap - the more well-known of german drinking habits conjure up images of dedicated boozers in for the long haul .
but a disturbing new trend with the younger crowd is causing concern . while binge drinking seems to be a national sport in britain , the practice of necking vast quantities of alcohol in a short amount of time has until recently failed to find a foothold in germany where beer making is a tradition and drinking it is a pastime to be savored . however , thanks to the well-publicized introduction of an alcohol flat-rate in hanover clubs , germans may be on the brink of descending into the same violent , vomit-sprayed drinking culture which is the current bane of their island-dwelling neighbors . entry prices at bars and clubs in hanover range from four to eight euros -lrb- $ 4.83 - $ 9.66 -rrb- and then from there on in , the sparkling wine , vodka and gin flows freely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may be the scene in mallorca but do you really want to see it in german bars ?
offers such as the 99-cent party , where every drink costs under a euro , or the mallorca party where sangria is served by the bucket , are helping bars attract customers in an extremely competitive industry . but the practice is worrying health officials in germany , a country which is already among the front runners in alcohol consumption in the european union . fears that price dumpi n g will e n courage you n gsters rolf hüllinghorst from the german head office for dependency matters told the dpa press agency that " landlords are acting irresponsibly " and that price dumping offers need to be controlled if the scourge of binge drinking is n't going to add to the temptations and dangers open to children and young people across the country . lower saxony 's conservative social minister , mechthild ross-luttmann , has also appealed to the club operators to act more responsibly when dealing with young people . the hanover landlords have defended themselves by saying that they would never entice young people to drink excessive amounts of alcohol for the sake of it . one bar manager , jan witte , claims that he has no knowledge of such overtly boozy behavior and wild alcohol parties at his establishment . " my club is not a binging center and has no shooters bar -lrb- a selection of cheap and powerful single measures -rrb- , " he said . this goes against the advertisement on his club 's web site that says " for those who ca n't get enough down their neck , there is now the flat rate every thursday and friday . " witte defended this by saying people could also drink as much mineral water and soft drinks as they like . legal age limit n o guara n tee while many bars and clubs advertise the bargain sessions as " all you can drink , " the majority make it clear that identification bearing the date of birth will be required upon entry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more young people are seeking treatment for alcohol problems .
the law stipulates that young people under the age of 18 are not allowed to be served alcohol .
however , while most bars are very strict at adhering to the rule , young people continue to turn up as casualties of alcohol in hospitals and as patients in addiction clinics across germany .
it seems obvious to state , say some but turning 18 does not immediately furnish a young drinker with a sensible attitude to alcohol consumption . the authorities in hanover have joined forces to assess the threat and apply pressure on those clubs which consciously or otherwise encourage cut-price drinking binges in the city . addiction experts and state ministers continue to discuss the dangers while police and other emergency services deal with the realities on the ground .

but because it sits at a crossroads of two major highways , coming from belgium and germany , it has also become a key stopping point for belgians , germans and french who enjoy holland 's lax laws on soft drugs . boomi n g tourism trade " each day between 3,500 and 4,000 tourists come to the coffee shops in the city center , making up a total of 1.5 million cannabis users annually .
two-thirds come from belgium , germany or france , " said mark josemans , chairman of an organization representing the 16 officially licensed coffee shops operating in maastricht . but the soft-drugs tourism is causing increasing problems for the town , according to maastricht officials , such as cannabis tourists taking up the limited parking spaces , petty crime and hard drugs dealers offering their goods in the vicinity of coffee shops . choosi n g regulatio n in december the city council unanimously put their weight behind plans by maastricht mayor gerd leers to move the coffee shops out of town .
leers is actually opposed to drugs , but said he preferred to regulate the legal trade of soft drugs rather than have everything go underground . " the coffee shops are located in the city centre , " leers said , " but in maastricht there are over a hundred private residencies that also illegally cater to this wave of drug users . " criticism from n eighbors supported by maastricht 's aldermen and the coffee shop owners , the mayor 's project , dubbed the " weed boulevard " in the local media , has attracted fierce criticism from the neighboring belgian communities of fourons and lanaken . " some 80 to 90 percent of the traffic in the direction of maastricht passes through fourons and as the legal sale of soft drugs comes closer to the border the illegal traffic in hard drugs will also come to the surrounding areas , being the territory of fourons or -lrb- near-by -rrb- vise , " said huub broers , the mayor of fourons , a town some 15 kilometers -lrb- 10 miles -rrb- from maastricht . " i only have 20 police officers , how can i control all that ? " he asked .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.01.2006 germany prepares for potential bird flu outbreak großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry is being increasingly locked up in europe as a precaution the alleged bird flu cases in belgium and cologne turned out to be false alarms .
but what would happen if a suspected case of bird flu was confirmed in central europe ?
dw-world has been finding out . nobody can and wants to say whether the virus could hit central europe .
on jan .
14 , the worst fears seemed confirmed , ironically right in the bureaucratic heart of europe .
a journalist returning from turkey to brussels complained about flu-like symptoms , which eventually turned out to be a false alarm . a day later , another person , this time in germany , was suspected to be infected with the bird flu virus .
but this too turned out to be unfounded .
the cause for the flu symptoms after a visit to bird flu-affected turkey was not the deadly h5n1 strain , but rather bronchitis .
the concerned hospital in cologne confirmed that the affected man simply had a " bad cold . " much ado about n othi n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " emergency bag , bird flu " reads the sign virologist werner lange , the former director of the influenza department of the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- in berlin , said that concerns are warranted .
he added that the hoopla surrounding the virus is a positive sign . " the fact that the doctors examined the patient so swiftly for the h5n1 virus makes me optimistic , " lange said , adding that it showed that authorities were alert and that the action plan against the epidemic in central europe was working . swift actio n crucial so far , there is no danger from those infected to others - current up-to-date information shows that there can be no human to human transmission of the virus . " the most decisive thing is that there is an initial suspicion that is acted upon , " lange said .
in other words , it 's important that the doctor thinks so far as to check a patient , who has just returned from turkey , for bird flu . after that , on a clinical and administrative level , everything then works according to the national influenza pandemic plan developed by the robert koch institute in accordance with international regulations issued by the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- .
even if there is the slightest suspicion of bird flu , the patient , for safety reasons , will be isolated in an intensive care unit of the hospital that can be quarantined . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab tests can determine the virus experts say that finally there 's no ruling out that the virus ca n't " learn " how to mutate into one that 's transmitted between humans .
laboratory tests can determine which virus has infected the patient .
at the same time there will be efforts to warn people who have come into contact with the patient , to also check themselves for the virus . lange stressed that even this procedure had " worked brilliantly " in suspected cases so far .
" in the case of the belgian man for instance , authorities already had a list of passengers who were with the affected person on the same flight . "
lange added that " if the virus was detected early , the chances of healing are good . " the case then , according to the epidemic law , has to be registered .
the national pandemic commission would then coordinate measures - in germany that would mean between who , the federal government , the states , emergency management and other authorities .
here , according to the level of danger , authorities would orient themselves towards so-called " pandemic warning periods , " of which there are six .

most have also taken stock of merkel 's visits to both washington and moscow , which took place within a span of five days . the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g said merkel had " emancipated herself " from her predecessor 's policies .
" under the east german chancellor , the pendulum of berlin 's foreign policy is swinging back to the center position , from which america is no greater cause for concern than russia , " the paper noted .
it added that merkel had not given up germany 's claim to an independent role in global politics .
" this intermediate power in the heart of europe can not shirk the responsibility and the influence which it has come to acquire since reunification , " the paper said . the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d said merkel had used her visits to washington and moscow for an " important realignment " but without completely shaking up relations .
" merkel has simply taken out the overriding and damaging emotions from ties : the icy hostility towards the bush administration and the cozy proximity to vladimir putin , " the paper wrote .
" the german thermostat has been set to the right rational temperatures towards east and west and thus relations with both partners is now more sober and better , " it noted , adding that it still remains unclear after merkel 's visits to washington and moscow , what the normalization means for practical politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has earned praise for being frank in talks with putin the ha n n oversche allegemei n e zeitu n g said it remained to be seen whether merkel 's criticism of " the increasing authoritarian features of the russian state " would have an effect on putin .
" but merkel 's words have fallen on fertile ground outside the moscow center , " the paper wrote .
" it 's about a long-term effect : the groups , who do n't accept their civil rights being restricted , are strengthened .
and berlin has a duty towards them . " other european newspapers commented on the personal chemistry between merkel and putin , wondering whether she would keep up the cozy ties cultivated by schröder . french daily le mo n de wrote that merkel is unlikely to get on as well with putin as her predecessor schröder .
" with time the two men developed such a great friendship that it provoked criticism in germany , " it said .
that closeness " annoyed germany 's eastern neighbors which retained a very bad memory of the alliances between berlin and moscow , " it added .
but , since she came to power , " merkel has been saying that she is working towards readjusting the right balance , " the paper said . britain 's the guardia n wrote that it was clear that merkel 's visit to moscow was going to be more difficult than her trip to washington .
" her brief businesslike trip was in striking contrast with the male bonding sessions mr. schröder , george bush and tony blair have all held over a few beers with vladimir putin .
none of them have been as forthright as they should have been on issues as important as human rights , the chechnya war , media freedoms and the yukos affair , " the paper pointed out .
" so it was impressive to see the german christian democratic chancellor talking of a " strategic partnership " but still doing publicly what the social democratic schröder -lrb- who called mr. putin a " flawless democrat " -rrb- never did privately - meeting russian ngos to register objections to laws restricting their activities .
encouraging democracy , civil society and stability is in the interest of russia 's neighbors , " the paper wrote . in russia , the trud daily said that although the " iron frau " will not be " the same kind of friend that gerhard schröder was to vladimir putin , " this should have little effect on general relations between germany and russia .
these relations , the paper argued , " are based on firm economic foundations . " another russian paper , kommersa n t ran an article headlined " friend angela : new german chancellor turns out to be no worse than the old one . "

trade fairs are increasingly moving overseas , and insiders say it 's a win-win situation . germany has long been known as a country of trade fairs .
two thirds of the world 's leading trade fairs are held in the country , including big-name events like the cebit digital solutions fair in hanover , the international motor show in frankfurt , and the anuga food fair in cologne .
but the number of fairs held in germany has hovered steadily around 150 over the past five years , and overall visitor counts have dropped off slightly , along with revenues .
yet if the homegrown market is stagnant , asia , eastern europe and certain parts of the middle east are exploding , offering new growth opportunities to well-established german companies .
" ten to 20 new trade fairs overseas are added each year , with no sign of slowing down " over the past five years or so , said marco spinger , head of global marketing at the association of the german trade fair industry , or auma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photokina , in cologne , draws the photography world exporting a trade fair " is n't as simple as just picking up an entire fair , booths and all , and moving it to another country , " spinger said .
rather , the idea is to capitalize on the brand names and know-how german trade fair companies have developed over the years and mold it to fit local needs .
düsseldorf fashion , munich high tech most of the exports are done via subsidiaries or joint ventures in other countries .
thus , electronics junkies who may have missed cebit in germany - or could n't afford the passage to hanover - can find one in australia or turkey .
the messe düsseldorf trade fair boasts 12 subsidiaries and 65 representatives across the globe ; its longstanding presence in the russian market has given it a strong foothold there and made it one of the most successful foreign companies in that country .
the frankfurt fair has built up strong ties with china , holding automotive and textile fairs there . auma designates these exported german events as " gqt " , or " german quality trade " fairs .
the exports tend to represent the strengths of what the companies do at home , spinger said .
so düsseldorf will export its know-how and contacts in medicine and fashion , while cologne may push the food industry -lrb- in thailand , for instance , -rrb- and munich brings high-tech to shanghai . the hottest expansion spots appear to be dubai , china , and russia , but any place where there is a need , and funding , to tap 50 years of german experience will do .
even the us is a prime ground for exports - 11 german trade fairs are slated to cross the atlantic in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's international auto show iaa the export growth took off around 2000 , when europe 's economy ground into decline , according to auma 's spinger .
in 2005 germans organized 172 fairs abroad , which accounted for 1.1 million square meters -lrb- 3.6 million square feet -rrb- of a total worldwide 9.2 million - a full 12 percent of all german exhibition space .
good for smaller businesses while there are winners all around in the booming trade fair market , the biggest gainers in germany appear to be the midsize companies that form the backbone of the economy . " having german fairs abroad give smaller firms the chance to go directly to their clients overseas , " spinger explained .
" they do n't have to go through some other american or arab exhibitor .
they can join up with a group project here or be part of a german pavilion .
they do n't have to do all the work themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artforum berlin despite the rosy numbers , observers have expressed concern about the effect overseas growth could have on german trade fairs .
after all , more than half of the people who come to germany to meet , greet and trade orders come from abroad .
wo n't the fairs taking place in their own backyards cut into the number of visitors who would want to make the trek to leipzig or nuremberg to do the same thing ?
numbers still high on the contrary , exhibit organizers say .
" we are n't cannibalizing ourselves by doing business this way , " said stephan kurzawski , vice president for business development at the messe frankfurt trade fair .
" our foreign trade fairs actually end up being marketing campaigns for frankfurt .
if we do an auto mechanics fair in argentina , for example , we notice a definite rise in argentine attendance at our fairs - both as exhibitors and as visitors . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms seem to have figured out what visitors want thomas kötter , a pr representative for the messe düsseldorf , agreed .
" the overseas trade fairs tend to be much smaller .
so after our exhibitors at the medica in china have had success and filled their order books at a smaller fair , we tell them , ' you 've experienced this version , but if you really want to be at the center of the entire medical world , it is in düsseldorf . '
they come ; the numbers bear that out . " kötter said he ca n't imagine that germany will be rendered obsolete by competition from overseas in the near or distant future .
" we have over 50 years of experience in building trade shows … we know how to set up the stands , how to do it so people are happy , so their information gets distributed , so they make sales . … we 've studied this , worked on it .

two thirds of the world 's leading trade fairs are held in the country , including big-name events like the cebit digital solutions fair in hanover , the international motor show in frankfurt , and the anuga food fair in cologne .
but the number of fairs held in germany has hovered steadily around 150 over the past five years , and overall visitor counts have dropped off slightly , along with revenues .
yet if the homegrown market is stagnant , asia , eastern europe and certain parts of the middle east are exploding , offering new growth opportunities to well-established german companies .

it is expected that the opposition parties will get the necessary 25 percent of votes during the debate for the investigation to go ahead . there are 614 parliamentarians in the bundestag and the necessary amount of votes in favor to begin the investigation would be 154 .
the three opposition parties hold 166 seats in the parliament . six fdp members have said they will abstain , and one green parliamentarian , former foreign minister joschka fischer , is expected to oppose the probe just as he rejected it in his parliamentary group 's vote on tuesday .

parliament will debate the issue friday . parliamentarians from the greens , the free democrats and the left party all agreed on tuesday there should be an investigation into the alleged role of german agents in the invasion of iraq in march 2003 . a parliamentary debate scheduled for wednesday to decide on an enquiry was postponed until friday .
it is expected that the opposition parties will get the necessary 25 percent of votes during the debate for the investigation to go ahead . there are 614 parliamentarians in the bundestag and the necessary amount of votes in favor to begin the investigation would be 154 .

however , with the left party saying it will vote unanimously for the enquiry , it will still be enough to set the investigation in motion .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will return early from his middle east tour to attend the debate .
steinmeier is cutting his trip short to answer questions as to what exactly transpired when the former social democratic-green party coalition government retained german agents in baghdad ahead of the opening salvos of the iraq war .

iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia iaea chief : iran atomic crisis at " critical stage " current affairs -pipe- 17.01.2006 world powers split over iran nuclear program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has warned of serious consequences if it 's referred to the un europe sought tuesday to keep up pressure on iran over its nuclear program , dismissing as vacuous a tehran offer to resume talks and seeking to overcome russian and chinese opposition to un action . amid signs of an international split over how to respond to the crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions , british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman said tehran 's call for fresh talks was " vacuous . "
but he conceded there was a " great deal of diplomacy to pursue " in order to build an international consensus to bring iran into line over a program which the united states claims is hiding covert atomic weapons development . world powers seemed divided a day after britain , france and germany called for an emergency meeting feb .
2-3 of the 35-nation board of governors of the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .

parliament will debate the issue friday . parliamentarians from the greens , the free democrats and the left party all agreed on tuesday there should be an investigation into the alleged role of german agents in the invasion of iraq in march 2003 . a parliamentary debate scheduled for wednesday to decide on an enquiry was postponed until friday .
it is expected that the opposition parties will get the necessary 25 percent of votes during the debate for the investigation to go ahead . there are 614 parliamentarians in the bundestag and the necessary amount of votes in favor to begin the investigation would be 154 .
the three opposition parties hold 166 seats in the parliament . six fdp members have said they will abstain , and one green parliamentarian , former foreign minister joschka fischer , is expected to oppose the probe just as he rejected it in his parliamentary group 's vote on tuesday .
however , with the left party saying it will vote unanimously for the enquiry , it will still be enough to set the investigation in motion .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will return early from his middle east tour to attend the debate .
steinmeier is cutting his trip short to answer questions as to what exactly transpired when the former social democratic-green party coalition government retained german agents in baghdad ahead of the opening salvos of the iraq war .

" this allegation must be addressed , " she said , calling for the rules concerning inspection of records and the examination of witnesses to be eased . she said that she did not want to comment on those who could be involved in the case so as not to influence any possible investigation but that " all the circumstances should be clarified . "
künast added that it would be a " normal process " for records to be kept of any agent activity in baghdad before the war and the data should therefore be investigated . künast , steinmeier refute claims of a double role she defended the social democratic-green party coalition 's stance during the iraq war and dismissed accusations that the government had been " two-faced " in its policies towards military action - on the one hand publicly denouncing the war and on the other covertly supporting the us-led invasion . steinmeier also angrily dismissed the notion that germany played a double role in the war .

parliament will debate the issue friday . parliamentarians from the greens , the free democrats and the left party all agreed on tuesday there should be an investigation into the alleged role of german agents in the invasion of iraq in march 2003 . a parliamentary debate scheduled for wednesday to decide on an enquiry was postponed until friday .
it is expected that the opposition parties will get the necessary 25 percent of votes during the debate for the investigation to go ahead . there are 614 parliamentarians in the bundestag and the necessary amount of votes in favor to begin the investigation would be 154 .
the three opposition parties hold 166 seats in the parliament . six fdp members have said they will abstain , and one green parliamentarian , former foreign minister joschka fischer , is expected to oppose the probe just as he rejected it in his parliamentary group 's vote on tuesday .
however , with the left party saying it will vote unanimously for the enquiry , it will still be enough to set the investigation in motion .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will return early from his middle east tour to attend the debate .
steinmeier is cutting his trip short to answer questions as to what exactly transpired when the former social democratic-green party coalition government retained german agents in baghdad ahead of the opening salvos of the iraq war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agents are accused of guiding missile attacks on baghdad volker beck , the chairman of the greens ' parliamentary group said it was likely that steinmeier would be called to testify during the probe to explain the government 's decision to leave two agents in baghdad despite germany 's official condemnation of the war . steinmeier , who served as then chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff , confirmed and defended the step last week , saying he had been party to it . his spokesman told reporters : " there was a decision from the german government that two agents would remain in iraq to gather information .
there was a regular exchange of information with the us side . " the government said they had passed on information to prevent the bombing of civilian targets and save lives , but the news has sparked an outcry in germany because of the bitter opposition here to the war . a report by ard television last week quoted a former us defense department official as saying that the german secret services also provided " direct help " to the us military in identifying targets that should be bombed . greens call for investigation into possible breach of policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants the secrecy laws to be loosened to aid any enquiry the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , jürgen trittin , said it should be established whether the presence of the agents constituted a breach of stated government policy . renate künast , the green 's chief in the bundestag , said tuesday that the investigating committee into the affair should be given " the necessary parliamentary tools " to gather the evidence and come to a conclusion . for this to happen , künast added , the secrecy rule restricting the committee 's investigations should be loosened .
" this allegation must be addressed , " she said , calling for the rules concerning inspection of records and the examination of witnesses to be eased . she said that she did not want to comment on those who could be involved in the case so as not to influence any possible investigation but that " all the circumstances should be clarified . "
künast added that it would be a " normal process " for records to be kept of any agent activity in baghdad before the war and the data should therefore be investigated . künast , steinmeier refute claims of a double role she defended the social democratic-green party coalition 's stance during the iraq war and dismissed accusations that the government had been " two-faced " in its policies towards military action - on the one hand publicly denouncing the war and on the other covertly supporting the us-led invasion . steinmeier also angrily dismissed the notion that germany played a double role in the war .
" it is absurd to say that the government officially opposed the war in iraq but covertly supported it .

parliament will debate the issue friday . parliamentarians from the greens , the free democrats and the left party all agreed on tuesday there should be an investigation into the alleged role of german agents in the invasion of iraq in march 2003 . a parliamentary debate scheduled for wednesday to decide on an enquiry was postponed until friday .
it is expected that the opposition parties will get the necessary 25 percent of votes during the debate for the investigation to go ahead . there are 614 parliamentarians in the bundestag and the necessary amount of votes in favor to begin the investigation would be 154 .
the three opposition parties hold 166 seats in the parliament . six fdp members have said they will abstain , and one green parliamentarian , former foreign minister joschka fischer , is expected to oppose the probe just as he rejected it in his parliamentary group 's vote on tuesday .
however , with the left party saying it will vote unanimously for the enquiry , it will still be enough to set the investigation in motion .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will return early from his middle east tour to attend the debate .
steinmeier is cutting his trip short to answer questions as to what exactly transpired when the former social democratic-green party coalition government retained german agents in baghdad ahead of the opening salvos of the iraq war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agents are accused of guiding missile attacks on baghdad volker beck , the chairman of the greens ' parliamentary group said it was likely that steinmeier would be called to testify during the probe to explain the government 's decision to leave two agents in baghdad despite germany 's official condemnation of the war . steinmeier , who served as then chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff , confirmed and defended the step last week , saying he had been party to it . his spokesman told reporters : " there was a decision from the german government that two agents would remain in iraq to gather information .
there was a regular exchange of information with the us side . " the government said they had passed on information to prevent the bombing of civilian targets and save lives , but the news has sparked an outcry in germany because of the bitter opposition here to the war . a report by ard television last week quoted a former us defense department official as saying that the german secret services also provided " direct help " to the us military in identifying targets that should be bombed . greens call for investigation into possible breach of policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants the secrecy laws to be loosened to aid any enquiry the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , jürgen trittin , said it should be established whether the presence of the agents constituted a breach of stated government policy . renate künast , the green 's chief in the bundestag , said tuesday that the investigating committee into the affair should be given " the necessary parliamentary tools " to gather the evidence and come to a conclusion . for this to happen , künast added , the secrecy rule restricting the committee 's investigations should be loosened .
" this allegation must be addressed , " she said , calling for the rules concerning inspection of records and the examination of witnesses to be eased . she said that she did not want to comment on those who could be involved in the case so as not to influence any possible investigation but that " all the circumstances should be clarified . "
künast added that it would be a " normal process " for records to be kept of any agent activity in baghdad before the war and the data should therefore be investigated . künast , steinmeier refute claims of a double role she defended the social democratic-green party coalition 's stance during the iraq war and dismissed accusations that the government had been " two-faced " in its policies towards military action - on the one hand publicly denouncing the war and on the other covertly supporting the us-led invasion . steinmeier also angrily dismissed the notion that germany played a double role in the war .
" it is absurd to say that the government officially opposed the war in iraq but covertly supported it .
i will not allow history to be rewritten , " he said on friday . künast also called on the investigation committee to look into any german complicity in the cia extraordinary rendition scandal , us-instigated abductions and secret prisons on european soil . liberals see a question mark over previous administration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhardt says the previous government has a question mark over its head the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said that it wanted a completely open book on germany ’ s alleged involvement in iraq , not to accuse the bnd of wrongdoing but to clarify the allegations . parliamentary group leader wolfgang gerhardt said on tuesday that an investigation would be about " the question mark hanging over the political guidance of the social democratic-green government . " gerhardt expressed " the highest doubts " that the previous government had no knowledge of any alleged secret service activity in iraq prior to the war and said the fdp wanted a " complete investigation into the processes during and after the war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.01.2006 trade-fair know-how is hot german export großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the world leader in trade fairs german manufacturers are n't the only ones fighting to boost exports .
trade fairs are increasingly moving overseas , and insiders say it 's a win-win situation . germany has long been known as a country of trade fairs .
two thirds of the world 's leading trade fairs are held in the country , including big-name events like the cebit digital solutions fair in hanover , the international motor show in frankfurt , and the anuga food fair in cologne .
but the number of fairs held in germany has hovered steadily around 150 over the past five years , and overall visitor counts have dropped off slightly , along with revenues .
yet if the homegrown market is stagnant , asia , eastern europe and certain parts of the middle east are exploding , offering new growth opportunities to well-established german companies .
" ten to 20 new trade fairs overseas are added each year , with no sign of slowing down " over the past five years or so , said marco spinger , head of global marketing at the association of the german trade fair industry , or auma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photokina , in cologne , draws the photography world exporting a trade fair " is n't as simple as just picking up an entire fair , booths and all , and moving it to another country , " spinger said .
rather , the idea is to capitalize on the brand names and know-how german trade fair companies have developed over the years and mold it to fit local needs .
düsseldorf fashion , munich high tech most of the exports are done via subsidiaries or joint ventures in other countries .
thus , electronics junkies who may have missed cebit in germany - or could n't afford the passage to hanover - can find one in australia or turkey .
the messe düsseldorf trade fair boasts 12 subsidiaries and 65 representatives across the globe ; its longstanding presence in the russian market has given it a strong foothold there and made it one of the most successful foreign companies in that country .
the frankfurt fair has built up strong ties with china , holding automotive and textile fairs there . auma designates these exported german events as " gqt " , or " german quality trade " fairs .
the exports tend to represent the strengths of what the companies do at home , spinger said .
so düsseldorf will export its know-how and contacts in medicine and fashion , while cologne may push the food industry -lrb- in thailand , for instance , -rrb- and munich brings high-tech to shanghai . the hottest expansion spots appear to be dubai , china , and russia , but any place where there is a need , and funding , to tap 50 years of german experience will do .
even the us is a prime ground for exports - 11 german trade fairs are slated to cross the atlantic in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's international auto show iaa the export growth took off around 2000 , when europe 's economy ground into decline , according to auma 's spinger .
in 2005 germans organized 172 fairs abroad , which accounted for 1.1 million square meters -lrb- 3.6 million square feet -rrb- of a total worldwide 9.2 million - a full 12 percent of all german exhibition space .
good for smaller businesses while there are winners all around in the booming trade fair market , the biggest gainers in germany appear to be the midsize companies that form the backbone of the economy . " having german fairs abroad give smaller firms the chance to go directly to their clients overseas , " spinger explained .
" they do n't have to go through some other american or arab exhibitor .
they can join up with a group project here or be part of a german pavilion .
they do n't have to do all the work themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artforum berlin despite the rosy numbers , observers have expressed concern about the effect overseas growth could have on german trade fairs .
after all , more than half of the people who come to germany to meet , greet and trade orders come from abroad .
wo n't the fairs taking place in their own backyards cut into the number of visitors who would want to make the trek to leipzig or nuremberg to do the same thing ?
numbers still high on the contrary , exhibit organizers say .
" we are n't cannibalizing ourselves by doing business this way , " said stephan kurzawski , vice president for business development at the messe frankfurt trade fair .
" our foreign trade fairs actually end up being marketing campaigns for frankfurt .
if we do an auto mechanics fair in argentina , for example , we notice a definite rise in argentine attendance at our fairs - both as exhibitors and as visitors . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms seem to have figured out what visitors want thomas kötter , a pr representative for the messe düsseldorf , agreed .
" the overseas trade fairs tend to be much smaller .
so after our exhibitors at the medica in china have had success and filled their order books at a smaller fair , we tell them , ' you 've experienced this version , but if you really want to be at the center of the entire medical world , it is in düsseldorf . '
they come ; the numbers bear that out . " kötter said he ca n't imagine that germany will be rendered obsolete by competition from overseas in the near or distant future .
" we have over 50 years of experience in building trade shows … we know how to set up the stands , how to do it so people are happy , so their information gets distributed , so they make sales . … we 've studied this , worked on it .
they do n't have that experience .

a journalist returning from turkey to brussels complained about flu-like symptoms , which eventually turned out to be a false alarm . a day later , another person , this time in germany , was suspected to be infected with the bird flu virus .
but this too turned out to be unfounded .
the cause for the flu symptoms after a visit to bird flu-affected turkey was not the deadly h5n1 strain , but rather bronchitis .

most have also taken stock of merkel 's visits to both washington and moscow , which took place within a span of five days . the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g said merkel had " emancipated herself " from her predecessor 's policies .
" under the east german chancellor , the pendulum of berlin 's foreign policy is swinging back to the center position , from which america is no greater cause for concern than russia , " the paper noted .

" merkel has simply taken out the overriding and damaging emotions from ties : the icy hostility towards the bush administration and the cozy proximity to vladimir putin , " the paper wrote .
" the german thermostat has been set to the right rational temperatures towards east and west and thus relations with both partners is now more sober and better , " it noted , adding that it still remains unclear after merkel 's visits to washington and moscow , what the normalization means for practical politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has earned praise for being frank in talks with putin the ha n n oversche allegemei n e zeitu n g said it remained to be seen whether merkel 's criticism of " the increasing authoritarian features of the russian state " would have an effect on putin .

" other european newspapers commented on the personal chemistry between merkel and putin , wondering whether she would keep up the cozy ties cultivated by schröder . french daily le mo n de wrote that merkel is unlikely to get on as well with putin as her predecessor schröder .

most have also taken stock of merkel 's visits to both washington and moscow , which took place within a span of five days . the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g said merkel had " emancipated herself " from her predecessor 's policies .
" under the east german chancellor , the pendulum of berlin 's foreign policy is swinging back to the center position , from which america is no greater cause for concern than russia , " the paper noted .
it added that merkel had not given up germany 's claim to an independent role in global politics .
" this intermediate power in the heart of europe can not shirk the responsibility and the influence which it has come to acquire since reunification , " the paper said . the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d said merkel had used her visits to washington and moscow for an " important realignment " but without completely shaking up relations .
" merkel has simply taken out the overriding and damaging emotions from ties : the icy hostility towards the bush administration and the cozy proximity to vladimir putin , " the paper wrote .
" the german thermostat has been set to the right rational temperatures towards east and west and thus relations with both partners is now more sober and better , " it noted , adding that it still remains unclear after merkel 's visits to washington and moscow , what the normalization means for practical politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has earned praise for being frank in talks with putin the ha n n oversche allegemei n e zeitu n g said it remained to be seen whether merkel 's criticism of " the increasing authoritarian features of the russian state " would have an effect on putin .
" but merkel 's words have fallen on fertile ground outside the moscow center , " the paper wrote .
" it 's about a long-term effect : the groups , who do n't accept their civil rights being restricted , are strengthened .
and berlin has a duty towards them . " other european newspapers commented on the personal chemistry between merkel and putin , wondering whether she would keep up the cozy ties cultivated by schröder . french daily le mo n de wrote that merkel is unlikely to get on as well with putin as her predecessor schröder .
" with time the two men developed such a great friendship that it provoked criticism in germany , " it said .
that closeness " annoyed germany 's eastern neighbors which retained a very bad memory of the alliances between berlin and moscow , " it added .
but , since she came to power , " merkel has been saying that she is working towards readjusting the right balance , " the paper said . britain 's the guardia n wrote that it was clear that merkel 's visit to moscow was going to be more difficult than her trip to washington .
" her brief businesslike trip was in striking contrast with the male bonding sessions mr. schröder , george bush and tony blair have all held over a few beers with vladimir putin .
none of them have been as forthright as they should have been on issues as important as human rights , the chechnya war , media freedoms and the yukos affair , " the paper pointed out .
" so it was impressive to see the german christian democratic chancellor talking of a " strategic partnership " but still doing publicly what the social democratic schröder -lrb- who called mr. putin a " flawless democrat " -rrb- never did privately - meeting russian ngos to register objections to laws restricting their activities .
encouraging democracy , civil society and stability is in the interest of russia 's neighbors , " the paper wrote . in russia , the trud daily said that although the " iron frau " will not be " the same kind of friend that gerhard schröder was to vladimir putin , " this should have little effect on general relations between germany and russia .
these relations , the paper argued , " are based on firm economic foundations . " another russian paper , kommersa n t ran an article headlined " friend angela : new german chancellor turns out to be no worse than the old one . "
the paper wrote : " mrs. merkel was doing her best to stress the continuity of gerhard schröder 's policies .
angela merkel seems to be running ahead of her own locomotive .
she even declared that the partnership between russia and germany must be far more intensive than before .

trade fairs are increasingly moving overseas , and insiders say it 's a win-win situation . germany has long been known as a country of trade fairs .
two thirds of the world 's leading trade fairs are held in the country , including big-name events like the cebit digital solutions fair in hanover , the international motor show in frankfurt , and the anuga food fair in cologne .
but the number of fairs held in germany has hovered steadily around 150 over the past five years , and overall visitor counts have dropped off slightly , along with revenues .
yet if the homegrown market is stagnant , asia , eastern europe and certain parts of the middle east are exploding , offering new growth opportunities to well-established german companies .
" ten to 20 new trade fairs overseas are added each year , with no sign of slowing down " over the past five years or so , said marco spinger , head of global marketing at the association of the german trade fair industry , or auma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photokina , in cologne , draws the photography world exporting a trade fair " is n't as simple as just picking up an entire fair , booths and all , and moving it to another country , " spinger said .
rather , the idea is to capitalize on the brand names and know-how german trade fair companies have developed over the years and mold it to fit local needs .
düsseldorf fashion , munich high tech most of the exports are done via subsidiaries or joint ventures in other countries .
thus , electronics junkies who may have missed cebit in germany - or could n't afford the passage to hanover - can find one in australia or turkey .
the messe düsseldorf trade fair boasts 12 subsidiaries and 65 representatives across the globe ; its longstanding presence in the russian market has given it a strong foothold there and made it one of the most successful foreign companies in that country .
the frankfurt fair has built up strong ties with china , holding automotive and textile fairs there . auma designates these exported german events as " gqt " , or " german quality trade " fairs .
the exports tend to represent the strengths of what the companies do at home , spinger said .
so düsseldorf will export its know-how and contacts in medicine and fashion , while cologne may push the food industry -lrb- in thailand , for instance , -rrb- and munich brings high-tech to shanghai . the hottest expansion spots appear to be dubai , china , and russia , but any place where there is a need , and funding , to tap 50 years of german experience will do .
even the us is a prime ground for exports - 11 german trade fairs are slated to cross the atlantic in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's international auto show iaa the export growth took off around 2000 , when europe 's economy ground into decline , according to auma 's spinger .
in 2005 germans organized 172 fairs abroad , which accounted for 1.1 million square meters -lrb- 3.6 million square feet -rrb- of a total worldwide 9.2 million - a full 12 percent of all german exhibition space .
good for smaller businesses while there are winners all around in the booming trade fair market , the biggest gainers in germany appear to be the midsize companies that form the backbone of the economy . " having german fairs abroad give smaller firms the chance to go directly to their clients overseas , " spinger explained .
" they do n't have to go through some other american or arab exhibitor .
they can join up with a group project here or be part of a german pavilion .
they do n't have to do all the work themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artforum berlin despite the rosy numbers , observers have expressed concern about the effect overseas growth could have on german trade fairs .
after all , more than half of the people who come to germany to meet , greet and trade orders come from abroad .
wo n't the fairs taking place in their own backyards cut into the number of visitors who would want to make the trek to leipzig or nuremberg to do the same thing ?
numbers still high on the contrary , exhibit organizers say .
" we are n't cannibalizing ourselves by doing business this way , " said stephan kurzawski , vice president for business development at the messe frankfurt trade fair .
" our foreign trade fairs actually end up being marketing campaigns for frankfurt .
if we do an auto mechanics fair in argentina , for example , we notice a definite rise in argentine attendance at our fairs - both as exhibitors and as visitors . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms seem to have figured out what visitors want thomas kötter , a pr representative for the messe düsseldorf , agreed .
" the overseas trade fairs tend to be much smaller .
so after our exhibitors at the medica in china have had success and filled their order books at a smaller fair , we tell them , ' you 've experienced this version , but if you really want to be at the center of the entire medical world , it is in düsseldorf . '
they come ; the numbers bear that out . " kötter said he ca n't imagine that germany will be rendered obsolete by competition from overseas in the near or distant future .
" we have over 50 years of experience in building trade shows … we know how to set up the stands , how to do it so people are happy , so their information gets distributed , so they make sales . … we 've studied this , worked on it .

so düsseldorf will export its know-how and contacts in medicine and fashion , while cologne may push the food industry -lrb- in thailand , for instance , -rrb- and munich brings high-tech to shanghai . the hottest expansion spots appear to be dubai , china , and russia , but any place where there is a need , and funding , to tap 50 years of german experience will do .
even the us is a prime ground for exports - 11 german trade fairs are slated to cross the atlantic in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's international auto show iaa the export growth took off around 2000 , when europe 's economy ground into decline , according to auma 's spinger .
in 2005 germans organized 172 fairs abroad , which accounted for 1.1 million square meters -lrb- 3.6 million square feet -rrb- of a total worldwide 9.2 million - a full 12 percent of all german exhibition space .
good for smaller businesses while there are winners all around in the booming trade fair market , the biggest gainers in germany appear to be the midsize companies that form the backbone of the economy . " having german fairs abroad give smaller firms the chance to go directly to their clients overseas , " spinger explained .
" they do n't have to go through some other american or arab exhibitor .
they can join up with a group project here or be part of a german pavilion .
they do n't have to do all the work themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artforum berlin despite the rosy numbers , observers have expressed concern about the effect overseas growth could have on german trade fairs .
after all , more than half of the people who come to germany to meet , greet and trade orders come from abroad .
wo n't the fairs taking place in their own backyards cut into the number of visitors who would want to make the trek to leipzig or nuremberg to do the same thing ?
numbers still high on the contrary , exhibit organizers say .
" we are n't cannibalizing ourselves by doing business this way , " said stephan kurzawski , vice president for business development at the messe frankfurt trade fair .
" our foreign trade fairs actually end up being marketing campaigns for frankfurt .
if we do an auto mechanics fair in argentina , for example , we notice a definite rise in argentine attendance at our fairs - both as exhibitors and as visitors . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms seem to have figured out what visitors want thomas kötter , a pr representative for the messe düsseldorf , agreed .
" the overseas trade fairs tend to be much smaller .
so after our exhibitors at the medica in china have had success and filled their order books at a smaller fair , we tell them , ' you 've experienced this version , but if you really want to be at the center of the entire medical world , it is in düsseldorf . '
they come ; the numbers bear that out . " kötter said he ca n't imagine that germany will be rendered obsolete by competition from overseas in the near or distant future .
" we have over 50 years of experience in building trade shows … we know how to set up the stands , how to do it so people are happy , so their information gets distributed , so they make sales . … we 've studied this , worked on it .
they do n't have that experience .

parliament will debate the issue friday . parliamentarians from the greens , the free democrats and the left party all agreed on tuesday there should be an investigation into the alleged role of german agents in the invasion of iraq in march 2003 . a parliamentary debate scheduled for wednesday to decide on an enquiry was postponed until friday .
it is expected that the opposition parties will get the necessary 25 percent of votes during the debate for the investigation to go ahead . there are 614 parliamentarians in the bundestag and the necessary amount of votes in favor to begin the investigation would be 154 .
the three opposition parties hold 166 seats in the parliament . six fdp members have said they will abstain , and one green parliamentarian , former foreign minister joschka fischer , is expected to oppose the probe just as he rejected it in his parliamentary group 's vote on tuesday .
however , with the left party saying it will vote unanimously for the enquiry , it will still be enough to set the investigation in motion .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will return early from his middle east tour to attend the debate .
steinmeier is cutting his trip short to answer questions as to what exactly transpired when the former social democratic-green party coalition government retained german agents in baghdad ahead of the opening salvos of the iraq war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agents are accused of guiding missile attacks on baghdad volker beck , the chairman of the greens ' parliamentary group said it was likely that steinmeier would be called to testify during the probe to explain the government 's decision to leave two agents in baghdad despite germany 's official condemnation of the war . steinmeier , who served as then chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff , confirmed and defended the step last week , saying he had been party to it . his spokesman told reporters : " there was a decision from the german government that two agents would remain in iraq to gather information .
there was a regular exchange of information with the us side . " the government said they had passed on information to prevent the bombing of civilian targets and save lives , but the news has sparked an outcry in germany because of the bitter opposition here to the war . a report by ard television last week quoted a former us defense department official as saying that the german secret services also provided " direct help " to the us military in identifying targets that should be bombed . greens call for investigation into possible breach of policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants the secrecy laws to be loosened to aid any enquiry the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , jürgen trittin , said it should be established whether the presence of the agents constituted a breach of stated government policy . renate künast , the green 's chief in the bundestag , said tuesday that the investigating committee into the affair should be given " the necessary parliamentary tools " to gather the evidence and come to a conclusion . for this to happen , künast added , the secrecy rule restricting the committee 's investigations should be loosened .
" this allegation must be addressed , " she said , calling for the rules concerning inspection of records and the examination of witnesses to be eased . she said that she did not want to comment on those who could be involved in the case so as not to influence any possible investigation but that " all the circumstances should be clarified . "
künast added that it would be a " normal process " for records to be kept of any agent activity in baghdad before the war and the data should therefore be investigated . künast , steinmeier refute claims of a double role she defended the social democratic-green party coalition 's stance during the iraq war and dismissed accusations that the government had been " two-faced " in its policies towards military action - on the one hand publicly denouncing the war and on the other covertly supporting the us-led invasion . steinmeier also angrily dismissed the notion that germany played a double role in the war .
" it is absurd to say that the government officially opposed the war in iraq but covertly supported it .
i will not allow history to be rewritten , " he said on friday . künast also called on the investigation committee to look into any german complicity in the cia extraordinary rendition scandal , us-instigated abductions and secret prisons on european soil . liberals see a question mark over previous administration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhardt says the previous government has a question mark over its head the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said that it wanted a completely open book on germany ’ s alleged involvement in iraq , not to accuse the bnd of wrongdoing but to clarify the allegations . parliamentary group leader wolfgang gerhardt said on tuesday that an investigation would be about " the question mark hanging over the political guidance of the social democratic-green government . " gerhardt expressed " the highest doubts " that the previous government had no knowledge of any alleged secret service activity in iraq prior to the war and said the fdp wanted a " complete investigation into the processes during and after the war .

iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia iaea chief : iran atomic crisis at " critical stage " current affairs -pipe- 17.01.2006 world powers split over iran nuclear program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has warned of serious consequences if it 's referred to the un europe sought tuesday to keep up pressure on iran over its nuclear program , dismissing as vacuous a tehran offer to resume talks and seeking to overcome russian and chinese opposition to un action . amid signs of an international split over how to respond to the crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions , british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman said tehran 's call for fresh talks was " vacuous . "
but he conceded there was a " great deal of diplomacy to pursue " in order to build an international consensus to bring iran into line over a program which the united states claims is hiding covert atomic weapons development . world powers seemed divided a day after britain , france and germany called for an emergency meeting feb .
2-3 of the 35-nation board of governors of the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
their call followed talks in london which also gathered together officials from china , russia and the united states . the iaea could refer iran to the un security council , which has the powers to impose sanctions , but russia and china are resisting european and us calls for such intervention .
russia said sanctions were not the best way forward , while china called for a return to the negotiating table . tehran , meanwhile , vowed reprisals against any crackdown , saying it would end tough un inspections and fully resume nuclear fuel work if the dossier is referred to the security council . ali asgar soltaniyeh , its ambassador to the vienna-based iaea , said iran 's decision to kick-start nuclear research was " irreversible . " israel warns iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert warned iran separately , israel 's acting prime minister ehud olmert warned iran that it would not allow any regime that threatened its existence to obtain weapons of mass destruction .
israel has come to view the islamic republic in tehran as its number one enemy , its fears heightened when iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad called in october for the jewish state to be " wiped off the map . " the talks in london joining the five permanent security council members and germany were called after iran , defying the iaea , broke the seals on a nuclear facility last week in order to resume research on uranium enrichment after a voluntary suspension . enriched uranium can be fuel for civilian nuclear reactors , but in a highly enriched form also the raw material for an atomic bomb .
no clear movement diplomats said the talks were inconclusive . " the chinese and russians are still formulating their own tactics of what to do at the board meeting , " a british foreign office spokesman said . a european diplomat close to the iaea said that while russia had previously agreed not to block referral to the security council , " the russians are backing off , it seems to me . " an iranian official said tehran had written to britain , france and germany asking for talks wednesday , a date scrapped by the eu troika . diplomats said that if the case goes to the security council , a first step would be a statement urging iran to honor existing iaea demands that it cease nuclear fuel activities and resume talks on guaranteeing that its program is peaceful .
any sanctions would come later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's foreign minister cautioned against sanctions russia and china , which have close trade and energy ties to iran , have been reluctant in the past to pursue international action against it , but a senior british official said neither had objected to an iaea session .
" we do n't see this leading straight into sanctions , " he said under cover of anonymity .
diplomacy could still prevail russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said sanctions were " not the best and by no means the only way to resolve international problems . "
he urged iran to do more to cooperate with the iaea .
" iran should do much more than it has done .
certain progress has been achieved in clarifying dark spots , but more is required of iran . " chinese foreign ministry spokesman kong quan said all sides at the talks in london had expressed concerns over iran 's actions .

parliament will debate the issue friday . parliamentarians from the greens , the free democrats and the left party all agreed on tuesday there should be an investigation into the alleged role of german agents in the invasion of iraq in march 2003 . a parliamentary debate scheduled for wednesday to decide on an enquiry was postponed until friday .
it is expected that the opposition parties will get the necessary 25 percent of votes during the debate for the investigation to go ahead . there are 614 parliamentarians in the bundestag and the necessary amount of votes in favor to begin the investigation would be 154 .
the three opposition parties hold 166 seats in the parliament . six fdp members have said they will abstain , and one green parliamentarian , former foreign minister joschka fischer , is expected to oppose the probe just as he rejected it in his parliamentary group 's vote on tuesday .
however , with the left party saying it will vote unanimously for the enquiry , it will still be enough to set the investigation in motion .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will return early from his middle east tour to attend the debate .
steinmeier is cutting his trip short to answer questions as to what exactly transpired when the former social democratic-green party coalition government retained german agents in baghdad ahead of the opening salvos of the iraq war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agents are accused of guiding missile attacks on baghdad volker beck , the chairman of the greens ' parliamentary group said it was likely that steinmeier would be called to testify during the probe to explain the government 's decision to leave two agents in baghdad despite germany 's official condemnation of the war . steinmeier , who served as then chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff , confirmed and defended the step last week , saying he had been party to it . his spokesman told reporters : " there was a decision from the german government that two agents would remain in iraq to gather information .
there was a regular exchange of information with the us side . " the government said they had passed on information to prevent the bombing of civilian targets and save lives , but the news has sparked an outcry in germany because of the bitter opposition here to the war . a report by ard television last week quoted a former us defense department official as saying that the german secret services also provided " direct help " to the us military in identifying targets that should be bombed . greens call for investigation into possible breach of policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants the secrecy laws to be loosened to aid any enquiry the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , jürgen trittin , said it should be established whether the presence of the agents constituted a breach of stated government policy . renate künast , the green 's chief in the bundestag , said tuesday that the investigating committee into the affair should be given " the necessary parliamentary tools " to gather the evidence and come to a conclusion . for this to happen , künast added , the secrecy rule restricting the committee 's investigations should be loosened .
" this allegation must be addressed , " she said , calling for the rules concerning inspection of records and the examination of witnesses to be eased . she said that she did not want to comment on those who could be involved in the case so as not to influence any possible investigation but that " all the circumstances should be clarified . "
künast added that it would be a " normal process " for records to be kept of any agent activity in baghdad before the war and the data should therefore be investigated . künast , steinmeier refute claims of a double role she defended the social democratic-green party coalition 's stance during the iraq war and dismissed accusations that the government had been " two-faced " in its policies towards military action - on the one hand publicly denouncing the war and on the other covertly supporting the us-led invasion . steinmeier also angrily dismissed the notion that germany played a double role in the war .
" it is absurd to say that the government officially opposed the war in iraq but covertly supported it .
i will not allow history to be rewritten , " he said on friday . künast also called on the investigation committee to look into any german complicity in the cia extraordinary rendition scandal , us-instigated abductions and secret prisons on european soil . liberals see a question mark over previous administration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhardt says the previous government has a question mark over its head the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said that it wanted a completely open book on germany ’ s alleged involvement in iraq , not to accuse the bnd of wrongdoing but to clarify the allegations . parliamentary group leader wolfgang gerhardt said on tuesday that an investigation would be about " the question mark hanging over the political guidance of the social democratic-green government . " gerhardt expressed " the highest doubts " that the previous government had no knowledge of any alleged secret service activity in iraq prior to the war and said the fdp wanted a " complete investigation into the processes during and after the war .

iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia iaea chief : iran atomic crisis at " critical stage " current affairs -pipe- 17.01.2006 world powers split over iran nuclear program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has warned of serious consequences if it 's referred to the un europe sought tuesday to keep up pressure on iran over its nuclear program , dismissing as vacuous a tehran offer to resume talks and seeking to overcome russian and chinese opposition to un action . amid signs of an international split over how to respond to the crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions , british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman said tehran 's call for fresh talks was " vacuous . "
but he conceded there was a " great deal of diplomacy to pursue " in order to build an international consensus to bring iran into line over a program which the united states claims is hiding covert atomic weapons development . world powers seemed divided a day after britain , france and germany called for an emergency meeting feb .
2-3 of the 35-nation board of governors of the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
their call followed talks in london which also gathered together officials from china , russia and the united states . the iaea could refer iran to the un security council , which has the powers to impose sanctions , but russia and china are resisting european and us calls for such intervention .
russia said sanctions were not the best way forward , while china called for a return to the negotiating table . tehran , meanwhile , vowed reprisals against any crackdown , saying it would end tough un inspections and fully resume nuclear fuel work if the dossier is referred to the security council . ali asgar soltaniyeh , its ambassador to the vienna-based iaea , said iran 's decision to kick-start nuclear research was " irreversible . " israel warns iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acting israeli prime minister ehud olmert warned iran separately , israel 's acting prime minister ehud olmert warned iran that it would not allow any regime that threatened its existence to obtain weapons of mass destruction .
israel has come to view the islamic republic in tehran as its number one enemy , its fears heightened when iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad called in october for the jewish state to be " wiped off the map . " the talks in london joining the five permanent security council members and germany were called after iran , defying the iaea , broke the seals on a nuclear facility last week in order to resume research on uranium enrichment after a voluntary suspension . enriched uranium can be fuel for civilian nuclear reactors , but in a highly enriched form also the raw material for an atomic bomb .
no clear movement diplomats said the talks were inconclusive . " the chinese and russians are still formulating their own tactics of what to do at the board meeting , " a british foreign office spokesman said . a european diplomat close to the iaea said that while russia had previously agreed not to block referral to the security council , " the russians are backing off , it seems to me . " an iranian official said tehran had written to britain , france and germany asking for talks wednesday , a date scrapped by the eu troika . diplomats said that if the case goes to the security council , a first step would be a statement urging iran to honor existing iaea demands that it cease nuclear fuel activities and resume talks on guaranteeing that its program is peaceful .
any sanctions would come later .

diplomacy could still prevail russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said sanctions were " not the best and by no means the only way to resolve international problems . "
he urged iran to do more to cooperate with the iaea .
" iran should do much more than it has done .

but these and other booze bargains are now taking hold in germany . hot , leisurely days spent in beer gardens nursing stein after stein of ice-cold ale ; boisterous swaying and singing in crowded halls with frothy brew on tap - the more well-known of german drinking habits conjure up images of dedicated boozers in for the long haul .
but a disturbing new trend with the younger crowd is causing concern . while binge drinking seems to be a national sport in britain , the practice of necking vast quantities of alcohol in a short amount of time has until recently failed to find a foothold in germany where beer making is a tradition and drinking it is a pastime to be savored . however , thanks to the well-publicized introduction of an alcohol flat-rate in hanover clubs , germans may be on the brink of descending into the same violent , vomit-sprayed drinking culture which is the current bane of their island-dwelling neighbors . entry prices at bars and clubs in hanover range from four to eight euros -lrb- $ 4.83 - $ 9.66 -rrb- and then from there on in , the sparkling wine , vodka and gin flows freely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may be the scene in mallorca but do you really want to see it in german bars ?
offers such as the 99-cent party , where every drink costs under a euro , or the mallorca party where sangria is served by the bucket , are helping bars attract customers in an extremely competitive industry . but the practice is worrying health officials in germany , a country which is already among the front runners in alcohol consumption in the european union . fears that price dumpi n g will e n courage you n gsters rolf hüllinghorst from the german head office for dependency matters told the dpa press agency that " landlords are acting irresponsibly " and that price dumping offers need to be controlled if the scourge of binge drinking is n't going to add to the temptations and dangers open to children and young people across the country . lower saxony 's conservative social minister , mechthild ross-luttmann , has also appealed to the club operators to act more responsibly when dealing with young people . the hanover landlords have defended themselves by saying that they would never entice young people to drink excessive amounts of alcohol for the sake of it . one bar manager , jan witte , claims that he has no knowledge of such overtly boozy behavior and wild alcohol parties at his establishment . " my club is not a binging center and has no shooters bar -lrb- a selection of cheap and powerful single measures -rrb- , " he said . this goes against the advertisement on his club 's web site that says " for those who ca n't get enough down their neck , there is now the flat rate every thursday and friday . " witte defended this by saying people could also drink as much mineral water and soft drinks as they like . legal age limit n o guara n tee while many bars and clubs advertise the bargain sessions as " all you can drink , " the majority make it clear that identification bearing the date of birth will be required upon entry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more young people are seeking treatment for alcohol problems .
the law stipulates that young people under the age of 18 are not allowed to be served alcohol .
however , while most bars are very strict at adhering to the rule , young people continue to turn up as casualties of alcohol in hospitals and as patients in addiction clinics across germany .
it seems obvious to state , say some but turning 18 does not immediately furnish a young drinker with a sensible attitude to alcohol consumption . the authorities in hanover have joined forces to assess the threat and apply pressure on those clubs which consciously or otherwise encourage cut-price drinking binges in the city . addiction experts and state ministers continue to discuss the dangers while police and other emergency services deal with the realities on the ground .

but because it sits at a crossroads of two major highways , coming from belgium and germany , it has also become a key stopping point for belgians , germans and french who enjoy holland 's lax laws on soft drugs . boomi n g tourism trade " each day between 3,500 and 4,000 tourists come to the coffee shops in the city center , making up a total of 1.5 million cannabis users annually .
two-thirds come from belgium , germany or france , " said mark josemans , chairman of an organization representing the 16 officially licensed coffee shops operating in maastricht . but the soft-drugs tourism is causing increasing problems for the town , according to maastricht officials , such as cannabis tourists taking up the limited parking spaces , petty crime and hard drugs dealers offering their goods in the vicinity of coffee shops . choosi n g regulatio n in december the city council unanimously put their weight behind plans by maastricht mayor gerd leers to move the coffee shops out of town .
leers is actually opposed to drugs , but said he preferred to regulate the legal trade of soft drugs rather than have everything go underground . " the coffee shops are located in the city centre , " leers said , " but in maastricht there are over a hundred private residencies that also illegally cater to this wave of drug users . " criticism from n eighbors supported by maastricht 's aldermen and the coffee shop owners , the mayor 's project , dubbed the " weed boulevard " in the local media , has attracted fierce criticism from the neighboring belgian communities of fourons and lanaken . " some 80 to 90 percent of the traffic in the direction of maastricht passes through fourons and as the legal sale of soft drugs comes closer to the border the illegal traffic in hard drugs will also come to the surrounding areas , being the territory of fourons or -lrb- near-by -rrb- vise , " said huub broers , the mayor of fourons , a town some 15 kilometers -lrb- 10 miles -rrb- from maastricht .

some 54 % said they would accept new stations being built for this reason , the mori survey of 1,500 people for the university of east anglia found .
but in general , more people were against nuclear power than in favour .
nearly 80 % thought renewable technologies and energy efficiency were better ways of tackling global warming .
the survey comes ahead of the government 's major review on the future of energy .
part of this review will consider whether the uk needs to replace its ageing nuclear power stations as a step towards its climate objectives .
tony blair has made it clear he believes a new generation of nuclear power stations could be part of that future .
' better ways ' the survey suggested 78 % of people believed promoting renewable energy sources was a better way , and 76 % thought reducing energy through lifestyle changes and energy efficiency was better , too .
supporters of replacing old nuclear stations say it is not a question of either nuclear or renewables , but that all alternatives to fossil fuels must be exploited to the full .
and in terms energy mix , the poll found 63 % believed that britain needed a combination of energy sources , including nuclear and renewables , to ensure a reliable supply of electricity .
the bbc 's environment correspondent tim hirsch said : " the survey does seem to confirm that outright opposition to nuclear power is softening , but it 's very far from a ringing endorsement from the public . "
complex issues professor nick pidgeon , director of the centre for environmental risk , university of east anglia , led the survey research team .
he said the government had already recognised the need to take public acceptability into account when exploring future energy needs .
" however , almost nothing is known about how ordinary people are responding to the new debate about nuclear power and climate change , " he said .
" this new research helps us to understand public views on this critical question . "
he added : " there is a powerful message for the government in our findings and it is that the debate should be a mature one ; and it should not be framed purely around nuclear versus climate change .
" people will be responsive to a debate that looks at both energy demand and supply . "
efficient route dr kevin anderson , from the tyndall centre for climate change research at the university of manchester , appealed for the whole debate to be raised to another level of sophistication .
he said discussion about the uk 's future energy mix should place far greater emphasis on issues of consumption - of demand .
in this context , he said , nuclear was a very small component ; accounting for about 3-4 % of total energy used .
" we could swap out all the nuclear stations for coal or gas and see very marginal increases in our carbon emissions , " he argued .
although there were arguments for supporting nuclear for energy security reasons , it was not essential to fight climate change , he said .
far better , he believed , was a policy which sought significant emission reductions through greater efficiency .
" why are we still selling fridges with a b , c , d , and e ratings ?
an a-rated fridge is a standard and you set it .
you make sure all new buildings are well built with very high energy efficiency .
" you inform industry that standards will be incrementally increased so that they have market signals .
you tell car manufacturers , for example , that to sell a car on a uk forecourt by 2010 , it must meet a minimum fuel economy . "

the blind wheelchair user was pronounced dead at 0038 -lrb- 0838 gmt -rrb- , at san quentin prison near san francisco .
allen 's lawyers had called for clemency because of his health and age , but their appeals were rejected .
he was sentenced to death for ordering the murder of three people in 1980 while he was serving a life sentence for another killing .
relatives of allen 's victims said he deserved to die , despite his health problems .
allen , whose birthday was on monday , was the second-oldest person put to death since the us supreme court allowed capital punishment to resume in 1976 .
us death row 3315 inmates on death row more than 10 % over age of 55 oldest is viva leroy nash , 90 source : us dept of justice because of his disabilities , prison authorities arranged for allen to be brought to the execution chamber in a wheelchair and lifted onto the gurney for the lethal injection to be administered .
allen was originally jailed for life for having his teenage son 's 17-year-old girlfriend murdered , fearing she would go to the police over a burglary he committed .
from his prison cell , in 1980 , he ordered the murder of another witness .
a hit man killed the target and two bystanders at a grocery store .
for that crime , allen was sentenced to death .
trial and appeals meant he ended up spending 23 years on death row .
patricia pendergrass , sister of victim bryon schletewitz , told abc news : " his mind is still very clear .
his mind is just the way it was when he was 50 years old and planned this heinous crime .
" he knows exactly why he will be taken into that execution chamber . "
death penalty debate late on sunday , the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled against allen , saying he had " not demonstrated substantial grounds upon which relief may be granted " , and the following day , the supreme court declined to intervene .
allen : record of ruthlessness california governor arnold schwarzenegger last week also denied allen a clemency hearing , saying the " passage of time does not excuse allen from the jury 's punishment " .
allen 's case has attracted considerably less attention than that of stanley " tookie " williams , 51 , executed on 13 december despite a vigorous clemency campaign by political and religious leaders .
but it is one of a number of controversial cases keeping the spotlight on the death penalty debate in the us .
last week , dna tests confirmed the guilt of a man who was executed in virginia in 1992 while proclaiming his innocence , in what was seen as a blow to the campaign to abolish the death penalty .
opinion polls suggest that while a majority of americans are still in favour of capital punishment , the margin is far smaller than it has been in the past .
elisabeth semel , a professor at the university of california 's boalt hall school of law , says california is speeding up the pace of executions " just as public support for the death penalty is waning " .
allen is unlikely to be the last elderly person put to death , as the us prison population is ageing fast , and in california alone a third of inmates on death row are older than 50 , and five are in their 70s .

the blind wheelchair user was pronounced dead at 0038 -lrb- 0838 gmt -rrb- , at san quentin prison near san francisco .
allen 's lawyers had called for clemency because of his health and age , but their appeals were rejected .
he was sentenced to death for ordering the murder of three people in 1980 while he was serving a life sentence for another killing .
relatives of allen 's victims said he deserved to die , despite his health problems .
allen , whose birthday was on monday , was the second-oldest person put to death since the us supreme court allowed capital punishment to resume in 1976 .
us death row 3315 inmates on death row more than 10 % over age of 55 oldest is viva leroy nash , 90 source : us dept of justice because of his disabilities , prison authorities arranged for allen to be brought to the execution chamber in a wheelchair and lifted onto the gurney for the lethal injection to be administered .
allen was originally jailed for life for having his teenage son 's 17-year-old girlfriend murdered , fearing she would go to the police over a burglary he committed .
from his prison cell , in 1980 , he ordered the murder of another witness .
a hit man killed the target and two bystanders at a grocery store .
for that crime , allen was sentenced to death .
trial and appeals meant he ended up spending 23 years on death row .
patricia pendergrass , sister of victim bryon schletewitz , told abc news : " his mind is still very clear .
his mind is just the way it was when he was 50 years old and planned this heinous crime .
" he knows exactly why he will be taken into that execution chamber . "
death penalty debate late on sunday , the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled against allen , saying he had " not demonstrated substantial grounds upon which relief may be granted " , and the following day , the supreme court declined to intervene .
allen : record of ruthlessness california governor arnold schwarzenegger last week also denied allen a clemency hearing , saying the " passage of time does not excuse allen from the jury 's punishment " .
allen 's case has attracted considerably less attention than that of stanley " tookie " williams , 51 , executed on 13 december despite a vigorous clemency campaign by political and religious leaders .
but it is one of a number of controversial cases keeping the spotlight on the death penalty debate in the us .
last week , dna tests confirmed the guilt of a man who was executed in virginia in 1992 while proclaiming his innocence , in what was seen as a blow to the campaign to abolish the death penalty .
opinion polls suggest that while a majority of americans are still in favour of capital punishment , the margin is far smaller than it has been in the past .
elisabeth semel , a professor at the university of california 's boalt hall school of law , says california is speeding up the pace of executions " just as public support for the death penalty is waning " .
allen is unlikely to be the last elderly person put to death , as the us prison population is ageing fast , and in california alone a third of inmates on death row are older than 50 , and five are in their 70s .

the australian institute of marine science -lrb- aims -rrb- is working with james cook university on a project called digital skins .
smart sensors , developed originally for use in nuclear power stations , are placed in the ocean and also in water catchments on the mainland .
they are able to communicate with each other to monitor events such as coral bleaching as they happen .
" one of our problems is that we tend to monitor after things happen , and so what we see is not so much the cause as the effect , " said scott bainbridge , technology and data manager with aims .
" a good example is coral bleaching , " he told the bbc world service programme go digital .
" it becomes hot , we see corals going white , we then start measuring .
it 's all over .
what we need is continuous monitoring of these systems . "
shared computing each sensor in the skin has its own numerical address and operating system .

using a technique that was discovered by the british during world war ii , microwave signals are sent along the surface of the ocean .
initial tests have seen data sent as far as 70km -lrb- 43.5 miles -rrb- in one hop .
the final link in the chain is grid computing .
all these sensors create terabytes of data every day .
high-speed links allow the various institutions to share their computing power .
" these high-speed networks that we have now allow us to use resources that may exist over any number of places , " said mr bainbridge .
" the systems are smart enough to know what resources they have .
when they get bogged down , they can call in more resources .
" we can throw a job at a system , and that system can then decide where it actually gets run . "
with 20 % of the world 's coral reefs already damaged and a further 50 % under threat , the knowledge gained from the project could have profound implications for the future of coral around the globe .

the australian institute of marine science -lrb- aims -rrb- is working with james cook university on a project called digital skins .
smart sensors , developed originally for use in nuclear power stations , are placed in the ocean and also in water catchments on the mainland .
they are able to communicate with each other to monitor events such as coral bleaching as they happen .
" one of our problems is that we tend to monitor after things happen , and so what we see is not so much the cause as the effect , " said scott bainbridge , technology and data manager with aims .
" a good example is coral bleaching , " he told the bbc world service programme go digital .
" it becomes hot , we see corals going white , we then start measuring .
it 's all over .
what we need is continuous monitoring of these systems . "
shared computing each sensor in the skin has its own numerical address and operating system .
using a global position system , the sensors know exactly where they are .
parameters such as salinity , temperature and nutrient levels are measured .
these high-speed networks that we have now allow us to use resources that may exist over any number of places scott bainbridge , australian institute of marine science communicating with the sensors is a challenge , particularly for those sensors located out on the reef .
using a technique that was discovered by the british during world war ii , microwave signals are sent along the surface of the ocean .
initial tests have seen data sent as far as 70km -lrb- 43.5 miles -rrb- in one hop .
the final link in the chain is grid computing .
all these sensors create terabytes of data every day .
high-speed links allow the various institutions to share their computing power .
" these high-speed networks that we have now allow us to use resources that may exist over any number of places , " said mr bainbridge .

the £ 4.5m anglesey biogas plant , half a mile outside gwalchmai village , would produce electricity for 600 homes .
residents have expressed concerns about possible odours from the plant and increased traffic .
the company behind the scheme , anglesey biogas , said the latest technology would be used to prevent any odours .
it would use blood and other waste products to create gas to fuel an engine to produce electricity .
the waste material would be sent to the plant in sealed units , and it would be left to rot in special tanks .
over 100 people from gwalchmai and bryngwran attended a meeting on monday evening called by gwalchmai community council to discuss the plan .
both gwalchmai and bryngwran councils are opposed to it .
" this is a strange concept for us , and we feel that we have n't been given enough information about the plant , " said iorwerth roberts , chairman of bryngwran community council .
" i accept that something needs to be done to get rid of this waste , but why site this sort of thing between two villages and two schools ? "
mr roberts said .
anglesey biogas said the plant would use the natural process of " anaerobic digestion " to recycle materials .
not an incinerator the company emphasised , however , that the plant was not an incinerator , and that the gas would be produced from primarily liquid materials .
richard seaman from anglesey biogas said : " we have commissioned an independent expert to look at the matter of odour .
" we have looked at other matters such as noise and traffic and sustainability and the statistics all indicate the site will pose no problem to the local community whether through noise , landscape or traffic . "
one woman at the meeting did not agree with his assessment .
" i 'm definitely against it , " she told bbc radio wales .
" it 's too close to the village .
" with lorries trundling along the a5 on a regular basis , it would n't be any good for the road , would n't be any good for the community . "
according to anglesey biogas , the project would employ five people on site with a further 21 jobs created indirectly through increased expenditure in the local economy .
at present there is only one working , large scale , biogas plant in the uk , at holsworthy in devon .
