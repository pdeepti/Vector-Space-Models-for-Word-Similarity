" the aim of this function was to spread national socialist ideology , " said the court in a statement . hundreds of oil paintings , etchings and drawings were allegedly confiscated from gustav schuster , who was director of the chemitz women 's clinic , during the second world war . the artworks , which include paintings by ludwig richter , max liebermann and max klinger , are worth at least 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 662,550 -rrb- . the decision , had it have been different , could have opened the doors to thousands of other claims for compensation for artworks , property and other goods confiscated from 1945 to 1949 by the soviet forces which occupied the eastern part of germany after wwii . as it is , legal experts say the ruling could set a different precedent and negatively affect similar restitution claims that could number into the thousands , according to the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , which quoted an official from the german finance ministry . nazis are n't eligible for compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soviets troops in eastern germany seized large numbers of properties and goods the german " compensation and just satisfaction act " law , which was passed in 1994 , exempts the state from paying compensation if the person from who the goods were confiscated " extensively " supported the nazi regime , or had committed " crimes against humanity . " this can give rise to the problem that heirs are disinclined to probe deeply into their family 's background . the süddeutsche zeitung reported that the lawyers for schuster 's family have presented the court with documents showing that there were 14,427 senior positions in the nazi regime at the municipal level . the family argues that as one under thousands , dr. schuster therefore was only responsible for 0.006 percent of what occurred . however , according to the süddeutsche zeitung , there is not doubt that schuster was jointly responsible for deciding on , and conducting , the forced sterilization of dozens of women . the newspaper quotes the example of a similar court decision made in october when the son of a lawyer for the nazi regime was awarded compensation for two properties confiscated from his family . only after the court case , was it revealed that the lawyer was probably involved in the hanging of a deserter in the last days of the war . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de holocaust survivors in austria to finally receive compensation austria will at last begin handing out its final compensation payments to jewish survivors of the holocaust this month , 60 years after the end of world war ii , thanks to a recent concluding legal arrangement in the us .

in a world where one man ’ s penury is another man ’ s wealth , geographical location dictates what constitutes destitution .
and although on paper , germany is one of the world 's wealthier nations , it is nonetheless home to throngs of people struggling to make ends meet .
what is more , if the findings in the federal statistics office ’ s “ life in europe ” report are anything to go by , millions more are at risk of becoming officially “ poor . ”
the breadline quoted in the report is 856 euros -lrb- $ 1,135 -rrb- for a person living alone and 1,798 euros for a family with two children .
in reality , however , many people are already living below it . so how does poverty look in this highly developed country ?
outsiders looking into germany are often stunned at the generosity of the social welfare system , and while it is doubtless among the most charitable of its kind , being at the bottom of the financial ladder of any society is never going to be a pleasant place to be .
eyes wide shut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food stocks for the needy brother antonius of a berlin franciscan monastery , who reports a steady increase in the number of " ordinary " germans coming to the daily soup kitchen since it set up 15 years ago , says the worst thing about being poor is the isolation it brings with it . “ people don ’ t need to read reports , but just have to open their eyes and their ears to realize that we have a poverty issue here .
but they do n't look because they don ’ t want to accept the struggles going on around them , ” he said . “ when you are poor , you ’ re on your own and likely as not you have endless amounts of time to kill . ”
for millions , being poor in germany is intrinsically connected to the persistent problem of high unemployment . under the hartz iv social welfare program introduced by the schröder administration to ensure the long-term unemployed a basic level of financial security , a single claimant is entitled to 345 euros monthly and couples to 311 euros each .
for families with children , there is a supplementary payment of between 207 and 276 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
in addition , the government foots rental bills - the amount depends upon average local housing costs - and most heating bills .
scrimping is frustrating bert hansen is out-of-work bookkeeper , husband and father who tops up his benefit payments with a so-called one-euro job , which allows claimants to earn a maximum of 180 euros monthly for a 30-hour working week .
even then , he says , it ’ s not easy . “ there are so many things which you can ’ t do without money and that makes you feel shut out .
we have fewer choices even when it comes to simple things like buying diapers , hygiene items and food . while society talks about the benefits of eating organic , we have no option but to go to discount supermarkets . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discount supermarkets are big business and while he tries to make the most of his situation , and has decided to help others who share his lot by working for his hourly euro in a soup kitchen and in a berlin church , hansen says it is “ frustrating ” to be constantly scrimping .
brother antonius believes it is an inability in many german families to manage what money they have , which feeds the problem of poverty . “ families come to us asking for food for breakfast and dinner , and we are supposed to report them to the authorities on the basis that the government provides a family allowance to provide food for the children , " he said .
" but the money gets spent on other things . ” he says too many people buckle too easily under the weight of advertising , interest-free credit deals and peer pressure . “ it might be a cliché to say this , but these days everybody wants to have everything , and the money to pay for it has to come from somewhere , ” he said .
time for non-monetary values bert hansen agrees that it is hard , particularly for young people , to live in a society so driven by consumerism without falling prey to its dazzling enticements . “ many parents are helpless , they can ’ t argue with their kids , can ’ t tell them when they can ’ t afford things , ” he said . the upshot is debt and a greater struggle with what money they do have .
hansen says the answer is to teach children that they can live with less and to reintroduce the concept of values .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumerism is infectious former chancellor of west germany , helmut schmidt , recently went down on record with berlin ’ s tagesspiegel newspaper saying : “ there needs to be an end to the complaining about ‘ poverty in germany ’ .
take the case of an 18-year-old girl who has a child and who gets a flat and a television provided by social welfare , she doesn ’ t need to pay the rent herself .
this girl is considered poor , but in reality she is far better off than we were at her age . ”
but as bert hansen stresses , that was then and this is now . “ we may well have a higher standard of living now than we used to , but costs have gone up as well .
i know it is not possible to look at every single case individually , but neither is it right to talk in sweeping generalizations , " he said .
" people say hartz iv claimants have enough to live off , but in reality , that is not true .
it is an existential minimum . ” tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts shed light on germany 's poverty and welfare woes new studies in germany shed light on the twin problems of growing poverty and a deficit in the child-welfare system that could be related .

" the aim is to confirm a common understanding on the future of the enlargement process , " finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , hosting the summit as eu president , said in an invitation to his fellow leaders . before dinner , vanhanen will present an analysis on the constitution , which was meant to help the eu run more smoothly as it grows , until it was rejected by french and dutch voters in referendums last year . enlargement fatigue setting in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expansion in the eu has left bloc members exhausted those votes , due in part to fears of " enlargement fatigue " and the idea of a large , relatively poor and mainly muslim country like turkey joining , sent the union spiraling into its worst ever crisis . an eu official said that " the level of ambition is weak " at the moment on enlargement , as the member countries know that any concrete proposals could be put on the back burner until the eu 's " institutional " house is put in order . in any case , the leaders are expected to concede that the impasse over the constitution must end before new members are considered beyond bulgaria and romania . the german eu presidency , starting on january 1 , is expected to take forward the process , with no real decisions expected before france takes over the helm in the second half of 2008 . however , a study released thursday suggested that it would be in germany 's interest to promote further enlargement . according to a study commissioned by the german economy ministry , germany , the eurozone 's largest economy , had already largely profited from the extension of the eu from 15 to 25 nations in may 2004 .
the study said that enlargement had boosted germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by around one percentage point , and that the benefits would continue as the bloc expands further . germans plan to revive constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is at a dead end over the constitution in regard to the eu constitution , german chancellor angela merkel said thursday that it would be a " historical failure " if agreement on a constitutional treaty was not struck before european elections in 2009 . the chancellor said that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " whatever the outcome here , the leaders ' stance will have major repercussions for turkey , which began membership talks last year , but also for eu candidates like croatia and macedonia and other hopefuls in the balkans . british prime minister tony blair , a strong supporter of ankara 's candidacy , is expected to travel to ankara after the summit ends on friday in a gesture of solidarity . other points of order include the increasingly high-profile issue of sustainable energy supply , but the real initiatives on that subject are also expected to be taken by germany . serbia creeps up eu agenda with turkey resolved for now and nobody keen to wade too far into the issue of institutional reform , one other issue is looming as a possible bone of contention , in what is likely to be a quiet and short summit , that of serbia . the eu froze in may a stabilization and association agreement - a first step toward joining the eu - over serbia 's failure to hand over former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic to the un war crimes court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi is pushing for talks with belgrade to resume italian prime minister romano prodi is expected to ask his counterparts to lift the eu 's condition of full cooperation with the court for the talks with belgrade to resume . but britain and others oppose this idea and most would prefer to reassess ties with belgrade , and the situation in the breakaway province of kosovo , after serbia 's january elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel rallies eu for challenges ahead in germany 's presidency german chancellor angela merkel used a speech to the german bundestag to urge europe to work together to meet the challenges coming its way during germany 's six-month eu presidency .

" i would consider it an historical failure if we do not succeed in working out the substance of the constitutional treaty by the time the next european elections take place , " merkel said in her speech , which was meant to set out the aims of germany 's eu presidency which starts in january . the chancellor added that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " merkel acknowledged that the issue of the constitution would not be settled by the end of germany 's turn at the eu helm but said she hoped that with its support the treaty would be revived and put back on track . " we have the task at the end of our presidency to set a roadmap " for the future implementation of the constitution , she said . the constitution was designed to provide the institutional framework for an eu which will grow to 27 member states when bulgaria and romania join on jan.1.
but it suffered a severe blow when french and dutch voters rejected it last year . merkel : united we stand , divided we fall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags stand together but how close are the eu nations on the subjects that matter ?
merkel also urged eu states to work closer together , saying that a united europe could achieve success , but a divided europe would weaken the strength of the bloc . on the thorny issue of turkey 's bid for eu membership , which is expected to be tackled yet again during the summit in brussels , merkel said that the eu had decided on a " resolute but prudent " course of action in its standoff with turkey over cyprus . " the eu has reacted -lrb- to turkey -rrb- , in my opinion , in a way that is both resolute and prudent … prudent in that it is always made clear to turkey that is worth it to continue working on reforms , " merkel said . eu leaders were expected during the summit to endorse a decision made by their foreign ministers earlier this week which partially froze turkey 's membership talks due to its refusal to implement a 2005 deal to open its ports to cyprus . " this is not a small matter , " merkel said .
" candidates for membership and eu member states must recognize each other politically and diplomatically . " eu to put brakes on further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although this week 's eu summit will confirm that the doors remain open to turkey and western balkan states if they are willing to match the bloc 's criteria , leaders are expected to confirm a slowdown in plans for further expansion following the entry of romania and bulgaria . in keeping with that expected tone , merkel said that countries such as albania , bosnia , serbia and macedonia have a " prospect of membership ... but we know that the perspective is a medium-term one . " merkel also mapped out a number of issues that germany would tackle as eu president .
the chancellor said that germany would make energy security , research and development , education and cutting back red tape priorities . merkel also spoke of the eu 's role on the global stage .
she said that the eu needed to speak in unison " with a strong voice " when dealing with international crises , citing iran and the situation in the middle east . middle east peace a priority for europe " we face enormous problems in the middle east , " merkel said , adding that germany hoped to breathe new life into the mid-east quartet of the eu , the us , the un and russia , which has been seeking to mediate in the conflict between israel and the palestinians , and hezbollah in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's trip to syria was part of an engagement policy merkel defended the decision to send foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to syria by saying " unusual steps " were part of the search for peace in the middle east .
she added that germany balanced a " readiness for dialogue " in principle with countries such as syria and iran with " clear principles and values . " while criticizing syria , germany has sought to draw it into talks designed to solve the region 's problems .
steinmeier visited damascus last week and pressed syria to use its influence to moderate the demands of the hezbollah militant group , which fought a war with israel in the summer and is seeking the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de readying for eu role , merkel pushes values germany 's angela merkel said reminding europeans of their common values is the key to creating a feeling of unity in the 25 nation bloc .

" the aim is to confirm a common understanding on the future of the enlargement process , " finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , hosting the summit as eu president , said in an invitation to his fellow leaders . before dinner , vanhanen will present an analysis on the constitution , which was meant to help the eu run more smoothly as it grows , until it was rejected by french and dutch voters in referendums last year . enlargement fatigue setting in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expansion in the eu has left bloc members exhausted those votes , due in part to fears of " enlargement fatigue " and the idea of a large , relatively poor and mainly muslim country like turkey joining , sent the union spiraling into its worst ever crisis . an eu official said that " the level of ambition is weak " at the moment on enlargement , as the member countries know that any concrete proposals could be put on the back burner until the eu 's " institutional " house is put in order . in any case , the leaders are expected to concede that the impasse over the constitution must end before new members are considered beyond bulgaria and romania . the german eu presidency , starting on january 1 , is expected to take forward the process , with no real decisions expected before france takes over the helm in the second half of 2008 . however , a study released thursday suggested that it would be in germany 's interest to promote further enlargement . according to a study commissioned by the german economy ministry , germany , the eurozone 's largest economy , had already largely profited from the extension of the eu from 15 to 25 nations in may 2004 .
the study said that enlargement had boosted germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by around one percentage point , and that the benefits would continue as the bloc expands further . germans plan to revive constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is at a dead end over the constitution in regard to the eu constitution , german chancellor angela merkel said thursday that it would be a " historical failure " if agreement on a constitutional treaty was not struck before european elections in 2009 . the chancellor said that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " whatever the outcome here , the leaders ' stance will have major repercussions for turkey , which began membership talks last year , but also for eu candidates like croatia and macedonia and other hopefuls in the balkans . british prime minister tony blair , a strong supporter of ankara 's candidacy , is expected to travel to ankara after the summit ends on friday in a gesture of solidarity . other points of order include the increasingly high-profile issue of sustainable energy supply , but the real initiatives on that subject are also expected to be taken by germany . serbia creeps up eu agenda with turkey resolved for now and nobody keen to wade too far into the issue of institutional reform , one other issue is looming as a possible bone of contention , in what is likely to be a quiet and short summit , that of serbia . the eu froze in may a stabilization and association agreement - a first step toward joining the eu - over serbia 's failure to hand over former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic to the un war crimes court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi is pushing for talks with belgrade to resume italian prime minister romano prodi is expected to ask his counterparts to lift the eu 's condition of full cooperation with the court for the talks with belgrade to resume . but britain and others oppose this idea and most would prefer to reassess ties with belgrade , and the situation in the breakaway province of kosovo , after serbia 's january elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel rallies eu for challenges ahead in germany 's presidency german chancellor angela merkel used a speech to the german bundestag to urge europe to work together to meet the challenges coming its way during germany 's six-month eu presidency .

" we want to give them a little bit of home , " the secretary-general of the turkish community in berlin , celal altun , said at a news conference . celal 's organization and a private hospital group , marseille , joined forces to launch the home , where the first residents will move in monday . catering to cultural needs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only halal food is served at the retirement home employing 75 staff fluent in turkish and german , the institution is eventually expected to offer all the comforts of turkish life to 155 residents in germany . the new building emblazoned with a crescent moon has a prayer room and an imam who will visit the home regularly and is decorated with pictures of turkish landmarks and outfitted with bilingual menus and door signs . the breakfasts will include olives and goat 's cheese while all the meat served is halal , or permitted under islam .

" many men did hard physical work all their lives , do n't speak german well and would thus have a difficult time explaining their health problems , " altun said . less expensive than other homes marseille chairman axel hölzer said the cost of the facility would be below average for a private institution due to smaller average household incomes among turks in germany . " many turks have modest financial means , " he said .

" in a multicultural society , diversity has to be allowed to express itself .

" the aim is to confirm a common understanding on the future of the enlargement process , " finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , hosting the summit as eu president , said in an invitation to his fellow leaders . before dinner , vanhanen will present an analysis on the constitution , which was meant to help the eu run more smoothly as it grows , until it was rejected by french and dutch voters in referendums last year . enlargement fatigue setting in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expansion in the eu has left bloc members exhausted those votes , due in part to fears of " enlargement fatigue " and the idea of a large , relatively poor and mainly muslim country like turkey joining , sent the union spiraling into its worst ever crisis . an eu official said that " the level of ambition is weak " at the moment on enlargement , as the member countries know that any concrete proposals could be put on the back burner until the eu 's " institutional " house is put in order . in any case , the leaders are expected to concede that the impasse over the constitution must end before new members are considered beyond bulgaria and romania . the german eu presidency , starting on january 1 , is expected to take forward the process , with no real decisions expected before france takes over the helm in the second half of 2008 . however , a study released thursday suggested that it would be in germany 's interest to promote further enlargement . according to a study commissioned by the german economy ministry , germany , the eurozone 's largest economy , had already largely profited from the extension of the eu from 15 to 25 nations in may 2004 .
the study said that enlargement had boosted germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by around one percentage point , and that the benefits would continue as the bloc expands further . germans plan to revive constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is at a dead end over the constitution in regard to the eu constitution , german chancellor angela merkel said thursday that it would be a " historical failure " if agreement on a constitutional treaty was not struck before european elections in 2009 . the chancellor said that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " whatever the outcome here , the leaders ' stance will have major repercussions for turkey , which began membership talks last year , but also for eu candidates like croatia and macedonia and other hopefuls in the balkans . british prime minister tony blair , a strong supporter of ankara 's candidacy , is expected to travel to ankara after the summit ends on friday in a gesture of solidarity . other points of order include the increasingly high-profile issue of sustainable energy supply , but the real initiatives on that subject are also expected to be taken by germany . serbia creeps up eu agenda with turkey resolved for now and nobody keen to wade too far into the issue of institutional reform , one other issue is looming as a possible bone of contention , in what is likely to be a quiet and short summit , that of serbia . the eu froze in may a stabilization and association agreement - a first step toward joining the eu - over serbia 's failure to hand over former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic to the un war crimes court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi is pushing for talks with belgrade to resume italian prime minister romano prodi is expected to ask his counterparts to lift the eu 's condition of full cooperation with the court for the talks with belgrade to resume . but britain and others oppose this idea and most would prefer to reassess ties with belgrade , and the situation in the breakaway province of kosovo , after serbia 's january elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel rallies eu for challenges ahead in germany 's presidency german chancellor angela merkel used a speech to the german bundestag to urge europe to work together to meet the challenges coming its way during germany 's six-month eu presidency .

" i would consider it an historical failure if we do not succeed in working out the substance of the constitutional treaty by the time the next european elections take place , " merkel said in her speech , which was meant to set out the aims of germany 's eu presidency which starts in january . the chancellor added that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force .

the chancellor said that germany would make energy security , research and development , education and cutting back red tape priorities . merkel also spoke of the eu 's role on the global stage .
she said that the eu needed to speak in unison " with a strong voice " when dealing with international crises , citing iran and the situation in the middle east . middle east peace a priority for europe " we face enormous problems in the middle east , " merkel said , adding that germany hoped to breathe new life into the mid-east quartet of the eu , the us , the un and russia , which has been seeking to mediate in the conflict between israel and the palestinians , and hezbollah in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's trip to syria was part of an engagement policy merkel defended the decision to send foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to syria by saying " unusual steps " were part of the search for peace in the middle east .

" i would consider it an historical failure if we do not succeed in working out the substance of the constitutional treaty by the time the next european elections take place , " merkel said in her speech , which was meant to set out the aims of germany 's eu presidency which starts in january . the chancellor added that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " merkel acknowledged that the issue of the constitution would not be settled by the end of germany 's turn at the eu helm but said she hoped that with its support the treaty would be revived and put back on track . " we have the task at the end of our presidency to set a roadmap " for the future implementation of the constitution , she said . the constitution was designed to provide the institutional framework for an eu which will grow to 27 member states when bulgaria and romania join on jan.1.
but it suffered a severe blow when french and dutch voters rejected it last year . merkel : united we stand , divided we fall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags stand together but how close are the eu nations on the subjects that matter ?
merkel also urged eu states to work closer together , saying that a united europe could achieve success , but a divided europe would weaken the strength of the bloc . on the thorny issue of turkey 's bid for eu membership , which is expected to be tackled yet again during the summit in brussels , merkel said that the eu had decided on a " resolute but prudent " course of action in its standoff with turkey over cyprus . " the eu has reacted -lrb- to turkey -rrb- , in my opinion , in a way that is both resolute and prudent … prudent in that it is always made clear to turkey that is worth it to continue working on reforms , " merkel said . eu leaders were expected during the summit to endorse a decision made by their foreign ministers earlier this week which partially froze turkey 's membership talks due to its refusal to implement a 2005 deal to open its ports to cyprus . " this is not a small matter , " merkel said .
" candidates for membership and eu member states must recognize each other politically and diplomatically . " eu to put brakes on further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although this week 's eu summit will confirm that the doors remain open to turkey and western balkan states if they are willing to match the bloc 's criteria , leaders are expected to confirm a slowdown in plans for further expansion following the entry of romania and bulgaria . in keeping with that expected tone , merkel said that countries such as albania , bosnia , serbia and macedonia have a " prospect of membership ... but we know that the perspective is a medium-term one . " merkel also mapped out a number of issues that germany would tackle as eu president .
the chancellor said that germany would make energy security , research and development , education and cutting back red tape priorities . merkel also spoke of the eu 's role on the global stage .
she said that the eu needed to speak in unison " with a strong voice " when dealing with international crises , citing iran and the situation in the middle east . middle east peace a priority for europe " we face enormous problems in the middle east , " merkel said , adding that germany hoped to breathe new life into the mid-east quartet of the eu , the us , the un and russia , which has been seeking to mediate in the conflict between israel and the palestinians , and hezbollah in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's trip to syria was part of an engagement policy merkel defended the decision to send foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to syria by saying " unusual steps " were part of the search for peace in the middle east .
she added that germany balanced a " readiness for dialogue " in principle with countries such as syria and iran with " clear principles and values . " while criticizing syria , germany has sought to draw it into talks designed to solve the region 's problems .
steinmeier visited damascus last week and pressed syria to use its influence to moderate the demands of the hezbollah militant group , which fought a war with israel in the summer and is seeking the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de readying for eu role , merkel pushes values germany 's angela merkel said reminding europeans of their common values is the key to creating a feeling of unity in the 25 nation bloc .

mederake , who had a previous conviction for raping a 14-year-old in 1999 , had admitted kidnapping and holding the then 13-year-old girl named stephanie captive as well as repeatedly raping her over a five-week period beginning in january . " we have always said that a punishment bordering on the maximum sentence followed by preventative detention was possible , " christian avenarius , a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office , said on thursday .
" we wish stephanie and her family all the best and that she is able to find peace . " during the trial , the prosecutors showed a wooden box mederake locked stephanie in when he left the apartment where he held her captive . " the defendant kidnapped her to satisfy his demands , mainly of a sexual nature , for a period without end , " said presiding judge tom maciejewski .
" every day he performed humiliating sexual acts on her .

" we are one hundred percent relieved .
we will now try to have a good christmas and take things step by step . " after testimony in the case concluded on tuesday , mederake asked stephanie , who he kidnapped on her way to school , and her family for forgiveness . defense lawyer andreas boine , chose not comment on the sentence , but said he would consult with his client . police slip-ups prolonged trial in a dramatic turn in the case , mederake , escaped from warders in november and climbed onto a prison roof where he remained for about 20 hours . when the trial continued , it detailed several other police blunders including how authorities overlooked the fact that the pedophile lived a few blocks from the kidnapped girl 's home and how indecisive officers spent two hours outside the locked door of the dresden apartment where stephanie was imprisoned . " we thought no one was at home , " a detective testified , describing the feb .
15 arrest .
it was decided to pick the lock and quietly inspect the place so that mederake would not notice .
when a locksmith set to work , mederake opened the door . mederake told the court he had used the two hours to phone his own 12-year-old daughter and say goodbye before his impending arrest . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians propose internet registry for sex offenders after a 39-year-old woman was recently raped and murdered in bayreuth by a repeated sex offender , both liberal and conservative politicians have recommended starting an internet registry based on the us model .

the closed-door inquiry in berlin is investigating the truth of this . el-masri , a muslim of lebanese origin who lives in southern germany , is currently suing us authorities for damages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-lebanese khaled el-masri says he was tortured by the cia he says he was imprisoned by us agents in december 2003 in macedonia and tortured in afghanistan before being released five months later .
in afghanistan , el-masri says he was questioned by a man called " sam " who spoke perfect german . steinmeier , who was the head of the chancellery under schröder , said accusations that the german government had aided the kidnapping or " complicity looked away " were " scandalous . " pressure to find terrorists steinmeier described the period after the september 11 , 2001 attacks as one of enormous pressure . " we needed to collect information as quickly as possible about other potential attacks , " he said . however , steinmeier emphasized that this did not give authorities free reign to " kidnap and torture . " " we did n't blindly follow the us government , " steinmeier said .
" when i headed the chancellery , the principles of constitutionality and civility applied in this -lrb- post-sept .

mederake , who had a previous conviction for raping a 14-year-old in 1999 , had admitted kidnapping and holding the then 13-year-old girl named stephanie captive as well as repeatedly raping her over a five-week period beginning in january . " we have always said that a punishment bordering on the maximum sentence followed by preventative detention was possible , " christian avenarius , a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office , said on thursday .
" we wish stephanie and her family all the best and that she is able to find peace . " during the trial , the prosecutors showed a wooden box mederake locked stephanie in when he left the apartment where he held her captive . " the defendant kidnapped her to satisfy his demands , mainly of a sexual nature , for a period without end , " said presiding judge tom maciejewski .
" every day he performed humiliating sexual acts on her . " she was only freed by police when she managed to drop a scrap of paper in the street that carried a desperate plea for help and the address where she was being imprisoned scrawled in red pen . mentally fit to stand trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mederake stayed on the court building 's roof for 20 hours stephanie , now 14 years old , did not testify in the trial after a psychologist 's certificate said she was too frightened to face mederake in court .
another analysis declared mederake mentally capable of standing trial and said he continued to pose a threat to society . her family voiced relief outside the court on thursday . " it has helped stephanie that the trial has been in the public eye , " stephanie 's father , joachim rudolph , told journalists .
" we are one hundred percent relieved .
we will now try to have a good christmas and take things step by step . " after testimony in the case concluded on tuesday , mederake asked stephanie , who he kidnapped on her way to school , and her family for forgiveness . defense lawyer andreas boine , chose not comment on the sentence , but said he would consult with his client . police slip-ups prolonged trial in a dramatic turn in the case , mederake , escaped from warders in november and climbed onto a prison roof where he remained for about 20 hours . when the trial continued , it detailed several other police blunders including how authorities overlooked the fact that the pedophile lived a few blocks from the kidnapped girl 's home and how indecisive officers spent two hours outside the locked door of the dresden apartment where stephanie was imprisoned . " we thought no one was at home , " a detective testified , describing the feb .
15 arrest .
it was decided to pick the lock and quietly inspect the place so that mederake would not notice .
when a locksmith set to work , mederake opened the door . mederake told the court he had used the two hours to phone his own 12-year-old daughter and say goodbye before his impending arrest . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians propose internet registry for sex offenders after a 39-year-old woman was recently raped and murdered in bayreuth by a repeated sex offender , both liberal and conservative politicians have recommended starting an internet registry based on the us model .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian premier stoiber kept close tabs on the deal regional state premier edmund stoiber said in the statement : " bidders permira and kkr have put forward an offer that strengthens munich as a media center . " a combination of prosiebensat1 with luxembourg-based television group sbs - which kkr and permira also recently acquired - would catapult munich to one of the top centers in the european media industry , stoiber said . completed deal now a formality while neither buyer nor vendor were immediately available to confirm the deal , industry sources told afp that the final sale agreement was now merely a matter of a formality . saban had agreed in principle to accept the bid by kkr and permira and all that was needed now were the final signatures . the statement issued by the bavarian regional authorities said that state premier stoiber " has been informed of the decision first-hand . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haim saban can now sell off his prime asset industry experts estimate that the price tag for saban 's 50.5-percent share stake and 88-percent voting stake would be more than three billion euros -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- . pipped at the post by kkr and permira were reportedly turkish radio and television group dogan and a consortium comprising apax and goldman sachs . haim saban first tried to sell prosiebensat1 to newspaper publisher axel springer at the beginning of this year .
but the deal was blocked by competition authorities . deal ends uncertainty for prosieben for prosiebensat1 , which owns the prosieben , sat1 , kabel1 and n24 channels , the deal marks the end of a long period of uncertainty . following the failure of the axel springer deal , a long list of names of possible buyers did the speculation rounds , including tf1 in france , or silvio berlusconi 's mediaset in italy , as well as countless investment funds . there was no doubt that saban wanted to sell .
he had acquired prosiebensat1 in 2003 , but only saw the holding as a financial investment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going global ?
while kkr and permira are also financial investors , they are already owners of luxembourg-based sbs broadcasting and have indicated that they aimed to be long-term investors in the company which is active in commercial and pay-tv and radio . prosiebensat1 's strong presence in germany , where it has a market share of 30 percent , will therefore complement sbs , which is present in the benelux countries , scandinavia and eastern europe . and for the german broadcaster , the deal could give it the international reach it had hitherto lacked .
germany is certainly one of the biggest tv markets , but growth there is limited in the commercial tv sector . and last week , prosiebensat1 's ambitions to move into pay-tv were blocked by the competition authorities . it remains to be seen what axel springer will now do with its 12-percent stake in prosiebensat1 . investors appeared uncertain and prosiebensat1 shares were showing a loss of 0.68 euros or 2.87 percent at 23.00 euros in late afternoon trade on the frankfurt stock exchange . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de saban prefers to hold on to prosieben saying that prosiebensat .

in a world where one man ’ s penury is another man ’ s wealth , geographical location dictates what constitutes destitution .
and although on paper , germany is one of the world 's wealthier nations , it is nonetheless home to throngs of people struggling to make ends meet .
what is more , if the findings in the federal statistics office ’ s “ life in europe ” report are anything to go by , millions more are at risk of becoming officially “ poor . ”
the breadline quoted in the report is 856 euros -lrb- $ 1,135 -rrb- for a person living alone and 1,798 euros for a family with two children .
in reality , however , many people are already living below it . so how does poverty look in this highly developed country ?
outsiders looking into germany are often stunned at the generosity of the social welfare system , and while it is doubtless among the most charitable of its kind , being at the bottom of the financial ladder of any society is never going to be a pleasant place to be .
eyes wide shut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food stocks for the needy brother antonius of a berlin franciscan monastery , who reports a steady increase in the number of " ordinary " germans coming to the daily soup kitchen since it set up 15 years ago , says the worst thing about being poor is the isolation it brings with it . “ people don ’ t need to read reports , but just have to open their eyes and their ears to realize that we have a poverty issue here .
but they do n't look because they don ’ t want to accept the struggles going on around them , ” he said . “ when you are poor , you ’ re on your own and likely as not you have endless amounts of time to kill . ”
for millions , being poor in germany is intrinsically connected to the persistent problem of high unemployment . under the hartz iv social welfare program introduced by the schröder administration to ensure the long-term unemployed a basic level of financial security , a single claimant is entitled to 345 euros monthly and couples to 311 euros each .
for families with children , there is a supplementary payment of between 207 and 276 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
in addition , the government foots rental bills - the amount depends upon average local housing costs - and most heating bills .
scrimping is frustrating bert hansen is out-of-work bookkeeper , husband and father who tops up his benefit payments with a so-called one-euro job , which allows claimants to earn a maximum of 180 euros monthly for a 30-hour working week .
even then , he says , it ’ s not easy . “ there are so many things which you can ’ t do without money and that makes you feel shut out .
we have fewer choices even when it comes to simple things like buying diapers , hygiene items and food . while society talks about the benefits of eating organic , we have no option but to go to discount supermarkets . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discount supermarkets are big business and while he tries to make the most of his situation , and has decided to help others who share his lot by working for his hourly euro in a soup kitchen and in a berlin church , hansen says it is “ frustrating ” to be constantly scrimping .
brother antonius believes it is an inability in many german families to manage what money they have , which feeds the problem of poverty . “ families come to us asking for food for breakfast and dinner , and we are supposed to report them to the authorities on the basis that the government provides a family allowance to provide food for the children , " he said .
" but the money gets spent on other things . ” he says too many people buckle too easily under the weight of advertising , interest-free credit deals and peer pressure . “ it might be a cliché to say this , but these days everybody wants to have everything , and the money to pay for it has to come from somewhere , ” he said .
time for non-monetary values bert hansen agrees that it is hard , particularly for young people , to live in a society so driven by consumerism without falling prey to its dazzling enticements . “ many parents are helpless , they can ’ t argue with their kids , can ’ t tell them when they can ’ t afford things , ” he said . the upshot is debt and a greater struggle with what money they do have .
hansen says the answer is to teach children that they can live with less and to reintroduce the concept of values .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumerism is infectious former chancellor of west germany , helmut schmidt , recently went down on record with berlin ’ s tagesspiegel newspaper saying : “ there needs to be an end to the complaining about ‘ poverty in germany ’ .
take the case of an 18-year-old girl who has a child and who gets a flat and a television provided by social welfare , she doesn ’ t need to pay the rent herself .
this girl is considered poor , but in reality she is far better off than we were at her age . ”
but as bert hansen stresses , that was then and this is now . “ we may well have a higher standard of living now than we used to , but costs have gone up as well .
i know it is not possible to look at every single case individually , but neither is it right to talk in sweeping generalizations , " he said .
" people say hartz iv claimants have enough to live off , but in reality , that is not true .
it is an existential minimum . ” tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts shed light on germany 's poverty and welfare woes new studies in germany shed light on the twin problems of growing poverty and a deficit in the child-welfare system that could be related .

" i would consider it an historical failure if we do not succeed in working out the substance of the constitutional treaty by the time the next european elections take place , " merkel said in her speech , which was meant to set out the aims of germany 's eu presidency which starts in january . the chancellor added that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " merkel acknowledged that the issue of the constitution would not be settled by the end of germany 's turn at the eu helm but said she hoped that with its support the treaty would be revived and put back on track . " we have the task at the end of our presidency to set a roadmap " for the future implementation of the constitution , she said . the constitution was designed to provide the institutional framework for an eu which will grow to 27 member states when bulgaria and romania join on jan.1.
but it suffered a severe blow when french and dutch voters rejected it last year . merkel : united we stand , divided we fall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags stand together but how close are the eu nations on the subjects that matter ?
merkel also urged eu states to work closer together , saying that a united europe could achieve success , but a divided europe would weaken the strength of the bloc . on the thorny issue of turkey 's bid for eu membership , which is expected to be tackled yet again during the summit in brussels , merkel said that the eu had decided on a " resolute but prudent " course of action in its standoff with turkey over cyprus . " the eu has reacted -lrb- to turkey -rrb- , in my opinion , in a way that is both resolute and prudent … prudent in that it is always made clear to turkey that is worth it to continue working on reforms , " merkel said . eu leaders were expected during the summit to endorse a decision made by their foreign ministers earlier this week which partially froze turkey 's membership talks due to its refusal to implement a 2005 deal to open its ports to cyprus . " this is not a small matter , " merkel said .
" candidates for membership and eu member states must recognize each other politically and diplomatically . " eu to put brakes on further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although this week 's eu summit will confirm that the doors remain open to turkey and western balkan states if they are willing to match the bloc 's criteria , leaders are expected to confirm a slowdown in plans for further expansion following the entry of romania and bulgaria . in keeping with that expected tone , merkel said that countries such as albania , bosnia , serbia and macedonia have a " prospect of membership ... but we know that the perspective is a medium-term one .

" the aim is to confirm a common understanding on the future of the enlargement process , " finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , hosting the summit as eu president , said in an invitation to his fellow leaders . before dinner , vanhanen will present an analysis on the constitution , which was meant to help the eu run more smoothly as it grows , until it was rejected by french and dutch voters in referendums last year . enlargement fatigue setting in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expansion in the eu has left bloc members exhausted those votes , due in part to fears of " enlargement fatigue " and the idea of a large , relatively poor and mainly muslim country like turkey joining , sent the union spiraling into its worst ever crisis . an eu official said that " the level of ambition is weak " at the moment on enlargement , as the member countries know that any concrete proposals could be put on the back burner until the eu 's " institutional " house is put in order . in any case , the leaders are expected to concede that the impasse over the constitution must end before new members are considered beyond bulgaria and romania . the german eu presidency , starting on january 1 , is expected to take forward the process , with no real decisions expected before france takes over the helm in the second half of 2008 . however , a study released thursday suggested that it would be in germany 's interest to promote further enlargement . according to a study commissioned by the german economy ministry , germany , the eurozone 's largest economy , had already largely profited from the extension of the eu from 15 to 25 nations in may 2004 .
the study said that enlargement had boosted germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by around one percentage point , and that the benefits would continue as the bloc expands further . germans plan to revive constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is at a dead end over the constitution in regard to the eu constitution , german chancellor angela merkel said thursday that it would be a " historical failure " if agreement on a constitutional treaty was not struck before european elections in 2009 . the chancellor said that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " whatever the outcome here , the leaders ' stance will have major repercussions for turkey , which began membership talks last year , but also for eu candidates like croatia and macedonia and other hopefuls in the balkans . british prime minister tony blair , a strong supporter of ankara 's candidacy , is expected to travel to ankara after the summit ends on friday in a gesture of solidarity . other points of order include the increasingly high-profile issue of sustainable energy supply , but the real initiatives on that subject are also expected to be taken by germany . serbia creeps up eu agenda with turkey resolved for now and nobody keen to wade too far into the issue of institutional reform , one other issue is looming as a possible bone of contention , in what is likely to be a quiet and short summit , that of serbia . the eu froze in may a stabilization and association agreement - a first step toward joining the eu - over serbia 's failure to hand over former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic to the un war crimes court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi is pushing for talks with belgrade to resume italian prime minister romano prodi is expected to ask his counterparts to lift the eu 's condition of full cooperation with the court for the talks with belgrade to resume . but britain and others oppose this idea and most would prefer to reassess ties with belgrade , and the situation in the breakaway province of kosovo , after serbia 's january elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel rallies eu for challenges ahead in germany 's presidency german chancellor angela merkel used a speech to the german bundestag to urge europe to work together to meet the challenges coming its way during germany 's six-month eu presidency .

" many men did hard physical work all their lives , do n't speak german well and would thus have a difficult time explaining their health problems , " altun said . less expensive than other homes marseille chairman axel hölzer said the cost of the facility would be below average for a private institution due to smaller average household incomes among turks in germany .

" " people must be able to choose where they want to spend their advanced years , particularly when they become helpless , " she said .
" in a multicultural society , diversity has to be allowed to express itself .

the breadline quoted in the report is 856 euros -lrb- $ 1,135 -rrb- for a person living alone and 1,798 euros for a family with two children .
in reality , however , many people are already living below it . so how does poverty look in this highly developed country ?

mederake , who had a previous conviction for raping a 14-year-old in 1999 , had admitted kidnapping and holding the then 13-year-old girl named stephanie captive as well as repeatedly raping her over a five-week period beginning in january . " we have always said that a punishment bordering on the maximum sentence followed by preventative detention was possible , " christian avenarius , a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office , said on thursday .
" we wish stephanie and her family all the best and that she is able to find peace . " during the trial , the prosecutors showed a wooden box mederake locked stephanie in when he left the apartment where he held her captive .

" the economic uptrend continued at a rapid pace in the third quarter , " weber said . the annual growth rate for the whole of 2006 " should therefore stand at around two-and-three-quarter percent , well above potential , " the german central bank chief said , adding that exports and domestic demand were contributing to growth .

" given the tax measures due to come into effect from 2007 , the deficit ratio would likely fall further next year , weber continued . do n't celebrate yet , some work remains however , germany should not rest on its laurels , " there is still room for further substantial consolidation , " weber said . " a deficit ratio of less than 3 percent is just an interim goal , " he said .
" much of what has been achieved is cyclical .
the medium term goal is to achieve a balanced budget .
additional consolidation must follow in economically good times . " weber warned against excessive euphoria . " the current favorable economic developments and the related increase in tax revenues must not be interpreted as an indication of improved growth perspectives in the long term , " he said . more structural reforms would have to be implemented to improve the low potential growth rate of the german economy and reduce unemployment on a lasting basis , weber added . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's economic projections bounce back optimism is high in germany after new surveys show an increase in german business confidence after a 13-year low , and forecast greater than expected gdp growth for 2007 .

" the economic uptrend continued at a rapid pace in the third quarter , " weber said . the annual growth rate for the whole of 2006 " should therefore stand at around two-and-three-quarter percent , well above potential , " the german central bank chief said , adding that exports and domestic demand were contributing to growth .
" that means germany is providing substantial impulses for the euro area . " slower growth in 2007 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some economists wonder how retail sales will fare after a 3 percent vat hike but domestic consumption , long a dark spot in export-strong germany , is still troubling the nation . " there is still no sign of a deep recovery in consumption , even if there have been improvements on this front recently , " weber said .
" in the traditional retail sector , developments are still weak . " looking ahead to next year , weber said he was projecting the current upturn to weaken " but not break down altogether . " " the fundamental trend will remain intact , even if the rise in value-added tax on jan .
1 will have a substantial braking effect on the economy , " he said . the german government has decided to raise vat by 3 percent to 19 percent from next month , the biggest-ever single vat rise . berlin set to meet eu rules turning to the state of germany 's public finances , weber said that given the country 's strong economic performance , the public deficit was to set to fall back within eu limits for the first time since 2002 this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is set to meet eu regulations on new debt under the european stability and growth pact , eurozone countries are not allowed to run up public deficits in excess of 3 percent of gdp . however , germany , the pact 's main architect , has been in breach of the 3-percent rule every year since 2002 . weber said the bundesbank was penciling in a deficit ratio of " around 2 percent this year . " given the tax measures due to come into effect from 2007 , the deficit ratio would likely fall further next year , weber continued . do n't celebrate yet , some work remains however , germany should not rest on its laurels , " there is still room for further substantial consolidation , " weber said . " a deficit ratio of less than 3 percent is just an interim goal , " he said .
" much of what has been achieved is cyclical .
the medium term goal is to achieve a balanced budget .
additional consolidation must follow in economically good times . " weber warned against excessive euphoria . " the current favorable economic developments and the related increase in tax revenues must not be interpreted as an indication of improved growth perspectives in the long term , " he said . more structural reforms would have to be implemented to improve the low potential growth rate of the german economy and reduce unemployment on a lasting basis , weber added . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's economic projections bounce back optimism is high in germany after new surveys show an increase in german business confidence after a 13-year low , and forecast greater than expected gdp growth for 2007 .

he said he had then checked the veracity of statements made by el-masri and his lawyer . however , fischer said the relationship between the us and germany was extremely tense at the time - not least because several of the sept .

the closed-door inquiry in berlin is investigating the truth of this . el-masri , a muslim of lebanese origin who lives in southern germany , is currently suing us authorities for damages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-lebanese khaled el-masri says he was tortured by the cia he says he was imprisoned by us agents in december 2003 in macedonia and tortured in afghanistan before being released five months later .
in afghanistan , el-masri says he was questioned by a man called " sam " who spoke perfect german . steinmeier , who was the head of the chancellery under schröder , said accusations that the german government had aided the kidnapping or " complicity looked away " were " scandalous . " pressure to find terrorists steinmeier described the period after the september 11 , 2001 attacks as one of enormous pressure . " we needed to collect information as quickly as possible about other potential attacks , " he said . however , steinmeier emphasized that this did not give authorities free reign to " kidnap and torture . " " we did n't blindly follow the us government , " steinmeier said .
" when i headed the chancellery , the principles of constitutionality and civility applied in this -lrb- post-sept .
11 -rrb- period . " a report in the berliner zeitung newspaper on thursday said steinmeier had been informed in 2005 that el-masri had been held by the cia but had failed to pass the information on to lawmakers . fischer also denies knowledge of cia abduction the foreign minister at the time of el-masri 's kidnapping , joschka fischer , who now teaches at princeton university in the us , also gave evidence before the hearing on thursday . fischer , making one of his few public appearances since resigning his parliamentary seat earlier this year , termed the abduction " a very serious matter " and said that he did n't know about el-masri 's detention until after his release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , the german foreign minister at the time of el-masri 's abduction , came back from the us to give evidence the inquiry has already heard that the then-us ambassador to berlin , daniel coats , informed then german interior minister otto schily on may 31 , 2004 that el-masri had been mistakenly detained , then freed . fischer said he had not learned of this meeting from schily but from reading about it in the washington post newspaper .
he said he had then checked the veracity of statements made by el-masri and his lawyer . however , fischer said the relationship between the us and germany was extremely tense at the time - not least because several of the sept .
11 hijackers had been living in germany before the attacks . " the main reproaches are those that are n't said out aloud , such as , ' we have you to thank for sept .
11 . '
the effect of that on foreign relations should n't be underestimated , " fischer said before the hearing . fischer emphasized that the german government 's objections to us authorities regarding the handling of terror suspects fell on deaf ears . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european meps look into german role in cia deportations a european parliament delegation was in berlin to find out to what extent the german government and secret services turned a blind eye to us practices to deport detainees to other continents via european territory .

" i would consider it an historical failure if we do not succeed in working out the substance of the constitutional treaty by the time the next european elections take place , " merkel said in her speech , which was meant to set out the aims of germany 's eu presidency which starts in january . the chancellor added that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " merkel acknowledged that the issue of the constitution would not be settled by the end of germany 's turn at the eu helm but said she hoped that with its support the treaty would be revived and put back on track . " we have the task at the end of our presidency to set a roadmap " for the future implementation of the constitution , she said . the constitution was designed to provide the institutional framework for an eu which will grow to 27 member states when bulgaria and romania join on jan.1.

the chancellor said that germany would make energy security , research and development , education and cutting back red tape priorities . merkel also spoke of the eu 's role on the global stage .
she said that the eu needed to speak in unison " with a strong voice " when dealing with international crises , citing iran and the situation in the middle east . middle east peace a priority for europe " we face enormous problems in the middle east , " merkel said , adding that germany hoped to breathe new life into the mid-east quartet of the eu , the us , the un and russia , which has been seeking to mediate in the conflict between israel and the palestinians , and hezbollah in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's trip to syria was part of an engagement policy merkel defended the decision to send foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to syria by saying " unusual steps " were part of the search for peace in the middle east .
she added that germany balanced a " readiness for dialogue " in principle with countries such as syria and iran with " clear principles and values . " while criticizing syria , germany has sought to draw it into talks designed to solve the region 's problems .

" the eu has reacted -lrb- to turkey -rrb- , in my opinion , in a way that is both resolute and prudent … prudent in that it is always made clear to turkey that is worth it to continue working on reforms , " merkel said . eu leaders were expected during the summit to endorse a decision made by their foreign ministers earlier this week which partially froze turkey 's membership talks due to its refusal to implement a 2005 deal to open its ports to cyprus . " this is not a small matter , " merkel said .
" candidates for membership and eu member states must recognize each other politically and diplomatically . " eu to put brakes on further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although this week 's eu summit will confirm that the doors remain open to turkey and western balkan states if they are willing to match the bloc 's criteria , leaders are expected to confirm a slowdown in plans for further expansion following the entry of romania and bulgaria . in keeping with that expected tone , merkel said that countries such as albania , bosnia , serbia and macedonia have a " prospect of membership ... but we know that the perspective is a medium-term one . " merkel also mapped out a number of issues that germany would tackle as eu president .
the chancellor said that germany would make energy security , research and development , education and cutting back red tape priorities . merkel also spoke of the eu 's role on the global stage .
she said that the eu needed to speak in unison " with a strong voice " when dealing with international crises , citing iran and the situation in the middle east . middle east peace a priority for europe " we face enormous problems in the middle east , " merkel said , adding that germany hoped to breathe new life into the mid-east quartet of the eu , the us , the un and russia , which has been seeking to mediate in the conflict between israel and the palestinians , and hezbollah in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's trip to syria was part of an engagement policy merkel defended the decision to send foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to syria by saying " unusual steps " were part of the search for peace in the middle east .
she added that germany balanced a " readiness for dialogue " in principle with countries such as syria and iran with " clear principles and values . " while criticizing syria , germany has sought to draw it into talks designed to solve the region 's problems .
steinmeier visited damascus last week and pressed syria to use its influence to moderate the demands of the hezbollah militant group , which fought a war with israel in the summer and is seeking the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de readying for eu role , merkel pushes values germany 's angela merkel said reminding europeans of their common values is the key to creating a feeling of unity in the 25 nation bloc .

" many men did hard physical work all their lives , do n't speak german well and would thus have a difficult time explaining their health problems , " altun said . less expensive than other homes marseille chairman axel hölzer said the cost of the facility would be below average for a private institution due to smaller average household incomes among turks in germany .

" we want to give them a little bit of home , " the secretary-general of the turkish community in berlin , celal altun , said at a news conference . celal 's organization and a private hospital group , marseille , joined forces to launch the home , where the first residents will move in monday . catering to cultural needs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only halal food is served at the retirement home employing 75 staff fluent in turkish and german , the institution is eventually expected to offer all the comforts of turkish life to 155 residents in germany . the new building emblazoned with a crescent moon has a prayer room and an imam who will visit the home regularly and is decorated with pictures of turkish landmarks and outfitted with bilingual menus and door signs . the breakfasts will include olives and goat 's cheese while all the meat served is halal , or permitted under islam .
pork and alcohol are strictly taboo . men will receive baths and help in the toilets from male personnel while the women will be cared for by female staff . guest workers who chose to stay altun said more turkish pensioners are remaining in germany as most of their children and grandchildren live here . " it has not even occurred to many of them to return to their home country , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an intercultural apartment building for senior citizens opened in bremen in 2004 at the same time , many families living in a hectic western european culture do not always find the time to care for their elders , breaking with a long-standing turkish tradition . although there are sufficient german facilities available , many older turks feel more comfortable being in the majority , with care tailored to their needs . " many men did hard physical work all their lives , do n't speak german well and would thus have a difficult time explaining their health problems , " altun said . less expensive than other homes marseille chairman axel hölzer said the cost of the facility would be below average for a private institution due to smaller average household incomes among turks in germany . " many turks have modest financial means , " he said .

" " people must be able to choose where they want to spend their advanced years , particularly when they become helpless , " she said .
" in a multicultural society , diversity has to be allowed to express itself . " germany launched a " guest workers " program in the 1960s to fill a shortage of blue-collar labor . although the arrangement was considered temporary , many of the newcomers brought wives from home , started families and stayed on , prompting germany in recent years to liberalize its citizenship laws . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's older generation to work longer , pay more life got a little tougher for the elderly in germany this week as the government decided on new measures designed to iron out of some of the wrinkles in german society .

in a world where one man ’ s penury is another man ’ s wealth , geographical location dictates what constitutes destitution .
and although on paper , germany is one of the world 's wealthier nations , it is nonetheless home to throngs of people struggling to make ends meet .
what is more , if the findings in the federal statistics office ’ s “ life in europe ” report are anything to go by , millions more are at risk of becoming officially “ poor . ”
the breadline quoted in the report is 856 euros -lrb- $ 1,135 -rrb- for a person living alone and 1,798 euros for a family with two children .
in reality , however , many people are already living below it . so how does poverty look in this highly developed country ?
outsiders looking into germany are often stunned at the generosity of the social welfare system , and while it is doubtless among the most charitable of its kind , being at the bottom of the financial ladder of any society is never going to be a pleasant place to be .
eyes wide shut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food stocks for the needy brother antonius of a berlin franciscan monastery , who reports a steady increase in the number of " ordinary " germans coming to the daily soup kitchen since it set up 15 years ago , says the worst thing about being poor is the isolation it brings with it . “ people don ’ t need to read reports , but just have to open their eyes and their ears to realize that we have a poverty issue here .
but they do n't look because they don ’ t want to accept the struggles going on around them , ” he said . “ when you are poor , you ’ re on your own and likely as not you have endless amounts of time to kill . ”
for millions , being poor in germany is intrinsically connected to the persistent problem of high unemployment . under the hartz iv social welfare program introduced by the schröder administration to ensure the long-term unemployed a basic level of financial security , a single claimant is entitled to 345 euros monthly and couples to 311 euros each .
for families with children , there is a supplementary payment of between 207 and 276 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
in addition , the government foots rental bills - the amount depends upon average local housing costs - and most heating bills .
scrimping is frustrating bert hansen is out-of-work bookkeeper , husband and father who tops up his benefit payments with a so-called one-euro job , which allows claimants to earn a maximum of 180 euros monthly for a 30-hour working week .
even then , he says , it ’ s not easy . “ there are so many things which you can ’ t do without money and that makes you feel shut out .
we have fewer choices even when it comes to simple things like buying diapers , hygiene items and food . while society talks about the benefits of eating organic , we have no option but to go to discount supermarkets . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discount supermarkets are big business and while he tries to make the most of his situation , and has decided to help others who share his lot by working for his hourly euro in a soup kitchen and in a berlin church , hansen says it is “ frustrating ” to be constantly scrimping .
brother antonius believes it is an inability in many german families to manage what money they have , which feeds the problem of poverty . “ families come to us asking for food for breakfast and dinner , and we are supposed to report them to the authorities on the basis that the government provides a family allowance to provide food for the children , " he said .
" but the money gets spent on other things . ” he says too many people buckle too easily under the weight of advertising , interest-free credit deals and peer pressure . “ it might be a cliché to say this , but these days everybody wants to have everything , and the money to pay for it has to come from somewhere , ” he said .
time for non-monetary values bert hansen agrees that it is hard , particularly for young people , to live in a society so driven by consumerism without falling prey to its dazzling enticements . “ many parents are helpless , they can ’ t argue with their kids , can ’ t tell them when they can ’ t afford things , ” he said . the upshot is debt and a greater struggle with what money they do have .
hansen says the answer is to teach children that they can live with less and to reintroduce the concept of values .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumerism is infectious former chancellor of west germany , helmut schmidt , recently went down on record with berlin ’ s tagesspiegel newspaper saying : “ there needs to be an end to the complaining about ‘ poverty in germany ’ .
take the case of an 18-year-old girl who has a child and who gets a flat and a television provided by social welfare , she doesn ’ t need to pay the rent herself .
this girl is considered poor , but in reality she is far better off than we were at her age . ”
but as bert hansen stresses , that was then and this is now . “ we may well have a higher standard of living now than we used to , but costs have gone up as well .
i know it is not possible to look at every single case individually , but neither is it right to talk in sweeping generalizations , " he said .

it is an existential minimum . ” tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts shed light on germany 's poverty and welfare woes new studies in germany shed light on the twin problems of growing poverty and a deficit in the child-welfare system that could be related .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 14.12.2006 what does it mean to be poor in wealthy germany ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for life - thank you , " reads the sign this month ’ s publication of a new report on poverty in europe has attempted to prize open a nation of resolutely blind eyes to a harsh reality of life in contemporary germany : life on the breadline . poverty is a moveable famine .
in a world where one man ’ s penury is another man ’ s wealth , geographical location dictates what constitutes destitution .
and although on paper , germany is one of the world 's wealthier nations , it is nonetheless home to throngs of people struggling to make ends meet .
what is more , if the findings in the federal statistics office ’ s “ life in europe ” report are anything to go by , millions more are at risk of becoming officially “ poor . ”
the breadline quoted in the report is 856 euros -lrb- $ 1,135 -rrb- for a person living alone and 1,798 euros for a family with two children .
in reality , however , many people are already living below it . so how does poverty look in this highly developed country ?
outsiders looking into germany are often stunned at the generosity of the social welfare system , and while it is doubtless among the most charitable of its kind , being at the bottom of the financial ladder of any society is never going to be a pleasant place to be .
eyes wide shut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food stocks for the needy brother antonius of a berlin franciscan monastery , who reports a steady increase in the number of " ordinary " germans coming to the daily soup kitchen since it set up 15 years ago , says the worst thing about being poor is the isolation it brings with it . “ people don ’ t need to read reports , but just have to open their eyes and their ears to realize that we have a poverty issue here .
but they do n't look because they don ’ t want to accept the struggles going on around them , ” he said . “ when you are poor , you ’ re on your own and likely as not you have endless amounts of time to kill . ”
for millions , being poor in germany is intrinsically connected to the persistent problem of high unemployment . under the hartz iv social welfare program introduced by the schröder administration to ensure the long-term unemployed a basic level of financial security , a single claimant is entitled to 345 euros monthly and couples to 311 euros each .
for families with children , there is a supplementary payment of between 207 and 276 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
in addition , the government foots rental bills - the amount depends upon average local housing costs - and most heating bills .
scrimping is frustrating bert hansen is out-of-work bookkeeper , husband and father who tops up his benefit payments with a so-called one-euro job , which allows claimants to earn a maximum of 180 euros monthly for a 30-hour working week .
even then , he says , it ’ s not easy . “ there are so many things which you can ’ t do without money and that makes you feel shut out .
we have fewer choices even when it comes to simple things like buying diapers , hygiene items and food . while society talks about the benefits of eating organic , we have no option but to go to discount supermarkets . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discount supermarkets are big business and while he tries to make the most of his situation , and has decided to help others who share his lot by working for his hourly euro in a soup kitchen and in a berlin church , hansen says it is “ frustrating ” to be constantly scrimping .

" many men did hard physical work all their lives , do n't speak german well and would thus have a difficult time explaining their health problems , " altun said . less expensive than other homes marseille chairman axel hölzer said the cost of the facility would be below average for a private institution due to smaller average household incomes among turks in germany .

" the aim is to confirm a common understanding on the future of the enlargement process , " finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , hosting the summit as eu president , said in an invitation to his fellow leaders . before dinner , vanhanen will present an analysis on the constitution , which was meant to help the eu run more smoothly as it grows , until it was rejected by french and dutch voters in referendums last year . enlargement fatigue setting in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expansion in the eu has left bloc members exhausted those votes , due in part to fears of " enlargement fatigue " and the idea of a large , relatively poor and mainly muslim country like turkey joining , sent the union spiraling into its worst ever crisis . an eu official said that " the level of ambition is weak " at the moment on enlargement , as the member countries know that any concrete proposals could be put on the back burner until the eu 's " institutional " house is put in order . in any case , the leaders are expected to concede that the impasse over the constitution must end before new members are considered beyond bulgaria and romania . the german eu presidency , starting on january 1 , is expected to take forward the process , with no real decisions expected before france takes over the helm in the second half of 2008 . however , a study released thursday suggested that it would be in germany 's interest to promote further enlargement . according to a study commissioned by the german economy ministry , germany , the eurozone 's largest economy , had already largely profited from the extension of the eu from 15 to 25 nations in may 2004 .
the study said that enlargement had boosted germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by around one percentage point , and that the benefits would continue as the bloc expands further . germans plan to revive constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is at a dead end over the constitution in regard to the eu constitution , german chancellor angela merkel said thursday that it would be a " historical failure " if agreement on a constitutional treaty was not struck before european elections in 2009 . the chancellor said that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " whatever the outcome here , the leaders ' stance will have major repercussions for turkey , which began membership talks last year , but also for eu candidates like croatia and macedonia and other hopefuls in the balkans . british prime minister tony blair , a strong supporter of ankara 's candidacy , is expected to travel to ankara after the summit ends on friday in a gesture of solidarity . other points of order include the increasingly high-profile issue of sustainable energy supply , but the real initiatives on that subject are also expected to be taken by germany . serbia creeps up eu agenda with turkey resolved for now and nobody keen to wade too far into the issue of institutional reform , one other issue is looming as a possible bone of contention , in what is likely to be a quiet and short summit , that of serbia . the eu froze in may a stabilization and association agreement - a first step toward joining the eu - over serbia 's failure to hand over former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic to the un war crimes court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi is pushing for talks with belgrade to resume italian prime minister romano prodi is expected to ask his counterparts to lift the eu 's condition of full cooperation with the court for the talks with belgrade to resume . but britain and others oppose this idea and most would prefer to reassess ties with belgrade , and the situation in the breakaway province of kosovo , after serbia 's january elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel rallies eu for challenges ahead in germany 's presidency german chancellor angela merkel used a speech to the german bundestag to urge europe to work together to meet the challenges coming its way during germany 's six-month eu presidency .

mederake , who had a previous conviction for raping a 14-year-old in 1999 , had admitted kidnapping and holding the then 13-year-old girl named stephanie captive as well as repeatedly raping her over a five-week period beginning in january . " we have always said that a punishment bordering on the maximum sentence followed by preventative detention was possible , " christian avenarius , a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office , said on thursday .
" we wish stephanie and her family all the best and that she is able to find peace . " during the trial , the prosecutors showed a wooden box mederake locked stephanie in when he left the apartment where he held her captive . " the defendant kidnapped her to satisfy his demands , mainly of a sexual nature , for a period without end , " said presiding judge tom maciejewski .
" every day he performed humiliating sexual acts on her . " she was only freed by police when she managed to drop a scrap of paper in the street that carried a desperate plea for help and the address where she was being imprisoned scrawled in red pen . mentally fit to stand trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mederake stayed on the court building 's roof for 20 hours stephanie , now 14 years old , did not testify in the trial after a psychologist 's certificate said she was too frightened to face mederake in court .
another analysis declared mederake mentally capable of standing trial and said he continued to pose a threat to society . her family voiced relief outside the court on thursday . " it has helped stephanie that the trial has been in the public eye , " stephanie 's father , joachim rudolph , told journalists .
" we are one hundred percent relieved .
we will now try to have a good christmas and take things step by step . " after testimony in the case concluded on tuesday , mederake asked stephanie , who he kidnapped on her way to school , and her family for forgiveness . defense lawyer andreas boine , chose not comment on the sentence , but said he would consult with his client . police slip-ups prolonged trial in a dramatic turn in the case , mederake , escaped from warders in november and climbed onto a prison roof where he remained for about 20 hours . when the trial continued , it detailed several other police blunders including how authorities overlooked the fact that the pedophile lived a few blocks from the kidnapped girl 's home and how indecisive officers spent two hours outside the locked door of the dresden apartment where stephanie was imprisoned . " we thought no one was at home , " a detective testified , describing the feb .

the study said that enlargement had boosted germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by around one percentage point , and that the benefits would continue as the bloc expands further . germans plan to revive constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is at a dead end over the constitution in regard to the eu constitution , german chancellor angela merkel said thursday that it would be a " historical failure " if agreement on a constitutional treaty was not struck before european elections in 2009 . the chancellor said that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " whatever the outcome here , the leaders ' stance will have major repercussions for turkey , which began membership talks last year , but also for eu candidates like croatia and macedonia and other hopefuls in the balkans . british prime minister tony blair , a strong supporter of ankara 's candidacy , is expected to travel to ankara after the summit ends on friday in a gesture of solidarity . other points of order include the increasingly high-profile issue of sustainable energy supply , but the real initiatives on that subject are also expected to be taken by germany . serbia creeps up eu agenda with turkey resolved for now and nobody keen to wade too far into the issue of institutional reform , one other issue is looming as a possible bone of contention , in what is likely to be a quiet and short summit , that of serbia . the eu froze in may a stabilization and association agreement - a first step toward joining the eu - over serbia 's failure to hand over former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic to the un war crimes court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi is pushing for talks with belgrade to resume italian prime minister romano prodi is expected to ask his counterparts to lift the eu 's condition of full cooperation with the court for the talks with belgrade to resume . but britain and others oppose this idea and most would prefer to reassess ties with belgrade , and the situation in the breakaway province of kosovo , after serbia 's january elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel rallies eu for challenges ahead in germany 's presidency german chancellor angela merkel used a speech to the german bundestag to urge europe to work together to meet the challenges coming its way during germany 's six-month eu presidency .

in a world where one man ’ s penury is another man ’ s wealth , geographical location dictates what constitutes destitution .
and although on paper , germany is one of the world 's wealthier nations , it is nonetheless home to throngs of people struggling to make ends meet .
what is more , if the findings in the federal statistics office ’ s “ life in europe ” report are anything to go by , millions more are at risk of becoming officially “ poor . ”
the breadline quoted in the report is 856 euros -lrb- $ 1,135 -rrb- for a person living alone and 1,798 euros for a family with two children .
in reality , however , many people are already living below it . so how does poverty look in this highly developed country ?
outsiders looking into germany are often stunned at the generosity of the social welfare system , and while it is doubtless among the most charitable of its kind , being at the bottom of the financial ladder of any society is never going to be a pleasant place to be .
eyes wide shut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food stocks for the needy brother antonius of a berlin franciscan monastery , who reports a steady increase in the number of " ordinary " germans coming to the daily soup kitchen since it set up 15 years ago , says the worst thing about being poor is the isolation it brings with it . “ people don ’ t need to read reports , but just have to open their eyes and their ears to realize that we have a poverty issue here .
but they do n't look because they don ’ t want to accept the struggles going on around them , ” he said . “ when you are poor , you ’ re on your own and likely as not you have endless amounts of time to kill . ”
for millions , being poor in germany is intrinsically connected to the persistent problem of high unemployment . under the hartz iv social welfare program introduced by the schröder administration to ensure the long-term unemployed a basic level of financial security , a single claimant is entitled to 345 euros monthly and couples to 311 euros each .
for families with children , there is a supplementary payment of between 207 and 276 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
in addition , the government foots rental bills - the amount depends upon average local housing costs - and most heating bills .
scrimping is frustrating bert hansen is out-of-work bookkeeper , husband and father who tops up his benefit payments with a so-called one-euro job , which allows claimants to earn a maximum of 180 euros monthly for a 30-hour working week .
even then , he says , it ’ s not easy . “ there are so many things which you can ’ t do without money and that makes you feel shut out .
we have fewer choices even when it comes to simple things like buying diapers , hygiene items and food . while society talks about the benefits of eating organic , we have no option but to go to discount supermarkets . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discount supermarkets are big business and while he tries to make the most of his situation , and has decided to help others who share his lot by working for his hourly euro in a soup kitchen and in a berlin church , hansen says it is “ frustrating ” to be constantly scrimping .
brother antonius believes it is an inability in many german families to manage what money they have , which feeds the problem of poverty . “ families come to us asking for food for breakfast and dinner , and we are supposed to report them to the authorities on the basis that the government provides a family allowance to provide food for the children , " he said .
" but the money gets spent on other things . ” he says too many people buckle too easily under the weight of advertising , interest-free credit deals and peer pressure . “ it might be a cliché to say this , but these days everybody wants to have everything , and the money to pay for it has to come from somewhere , ” he said .
time for non-monetary values bert hansen agrees that it is hard , particularly for young people , to live in a society so driven by consumerism without falling prey to its dazzling enticements . “ many parents are helpless , they can ’ t argue with their kids , can ’ t tell them when they can ’ t afford things , ” he said . the upshot is debt and a greater struggle with what money they do have .
hansen says the answer is to teach children that they can live with less and to reintroduce the concept of values .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumerism is infectious former chancellor of west germany , helmut schmidt , recently went down on record with berlin ’ s tagesspiegel newspaper saying : “ there needs to be an end to the complaining about ‘ poverty in germany ’ .
take the case of an 18-year-old girl who has a child and who gets a flat and a television provided by social welfare , she doesn ’ t need to pay the rent herself .
this girl is considered poor , but in reality she is far better off than we were at her age . ”
but as bert hansen stresses , that was then and this is now . “ we may well have a higher standard of living now than we used to , but costs have gone up as well .
i know it is not possible to look at every single case individually , but neither is it right to talk in sweeping generalizations , " he said .
" people say hartz iv claimants have enough to live off , but in reality , that is not true .
it is an existential minimum . ” tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts shed light on germany 's poverty and welfare woes new studies in germany shed light on the twin problems of growing poverty and a deficit in the child-welfare system that could be related .

" we want to give them a little bit of home , " the secretary-general of the turkish community in berlin , celal altun , said at a news conference . celal 's organization and a private hospital group , marseille , joined forces to launch the home , where the first residents will move in monday . catering to cultural needs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only halal food is served at the retirement home employing 75 staff fluent in turkish and german , the institution is eventually expected to offer all the comforts of turkish life to 155 residents in germany . the new building emblazoned with a crescent moon has a prayer room and an imam who will visit the home regularly and is decorated with pictures of turkish landmarks and outfitted with bilingual menus and door signs . the breakfasts will include olives and goat 's cheese while all the meat served is halal , or permitted under islam .

" many men did hard physical work all their lives , do n't speak german well and would thus have a difficult time explaining their health problems , " altun said . less expensive than other homes marseille chairman axel hölzer said the cost of the facility would be below average for a private institution due to smaller average household incomes among turks in germany .

" i would consider it an historical failure if we do not succeed in working out the substance of the constitutional treaty by the time the next european elections take place , " merkel said in her speech , which was meant to set out the aims of germany 's eu presidency which starts in january . the chancellor added that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " merkel acknowledged that the issue of the constitution would not be settled by the end of germany 's turn at the eu helm but said she hoped that with its support the treaty would be revived and put back on track . " we have the task at the end of our presidency to set a roadmap " for the future implementation of the constitution , she said . the constitution was designed to provide the institutional framework for an eu which will grow to 27 member states when bulgaria and romania join on jan.1.
but it suffered a severe blow when french and dutch voters rejected it last year . merkel : united we stand , divided we fall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags stand together but how close are the eu nations on the subjects that matter ?
merkel also urged eu states to work closer together , saying that a united europe could achieve success , but a divided europe would weaken the strength of the bloc . on the thorny issue of turkey 's bid for eu membership , which is expected to be tackled yet again during the summit in brussels , merkel said that the eu had decided on a " resolute but prudent " course of action in its standoff with turkey over cyprus . " the eu has reacted -lrb- to turkey -rrb- , in my opinion , in a way that is both resolute and prudent … prudent in that it is always made clear to turkey that is worth it to continue working on reforms , " merkel said . eu leaders were expected during the summit to endorse a decision made by their foreign ministers earlier this week which partially froze turkey 's membership talks due to its refusal to implement a 2005 deal to open its ports to cyprus . " this is not a small matter , " merkel said .
" candidates for membership and eu member states must recognize each other politically and diplomatically . " eu to put brakes on further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although this week 's eu summit will confirm that the doors remain open to turkey and western balkan states if they are willing to match the bloc 's criteria , leaders are expected to confirm a slowdown in plans for further expansion following the entry of romania and bulgaria . in keeping with that expected tone , merkel said that countries such as albania , bosnia , serbia and macedonia have a " prospect of membership ... but we know that the perspective is a medium-term one . " merkel also mapped out a number of issues that germany would tackle as eu president .
the chancellor said that germany would make energy security , research and development , education and cutting back red tape priorities . merkel also spoke of the eu 's role on the global stage .
she said that the eu needed to speak in unison " with a strong voice " when dealing with international crises , citing iran and the situation in the middle east . middle east peace a priority for europe " we face enormous problems in the middle east , " merkel said , adding that germany hoped to breathe new life into the mid-east quartet of the eu , the us , the un and russia , which has been seeking to mediate in the conflict between israel and the palestinians , and hezbollah in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's trip to syria was part of an engagement policy merkel defended the decision to send foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to syria by saying " unusual steps " were part of the search for peace in the middle east .
she added that germany balanced a " readiness for dialogue " in principle with countries such as syria and iran with " clear principles and values . " while criticizing syria , germany has sought to draw it into talks designed to solve the region 's problems .
steinmeier visited damascus last week and pressed syria to use its influence to moderate the demands of the hezbollah militant group , which fought a war with israel in the summer and is seeking the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de readying for eu role , merkel pushes values germany 's angela merkel said reminding europeans of their common values is the key to creating a feeling of unity in the 25 nation bloc .

" i would consider it an historical failure if we do not succeed in working out the substance of the constitutional treaty by the time the next european elections take place , " merkel said in her speech , which was meant to set out the aims of germany 's eu presidency which starts in january . the chancellor added that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " merkel acknowledged that the issue of the constitution would not be settled by the end of germany 's turn at the eu helm but said she hoped that with its support the treaty would be revived and put back on track . " we have the task at the end of our presidency to set a roadmap " for the future implementation of the constitution , she said . the constitution was designed to provide the institutional framework for an eu which will grow to 27 member states when bulgaria and romania join on jan.1.
but it suffered a severe blow when french and dutch voters rejected it last year . merkel : united we stand , divided we fall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags stand together but how close are the eu nations on the subjects that matter ?
merkel also urged eu states to work closer together , saying that a united europe could achieve success , but a divided europe would weaken the strength of the bloc . on the thorny issue of turkey 's bid for eu membership , which is expected to be tackled yet again during the summit in brussels , merkel said that the eu had decided on a " resolute but prudent " course of action in its standoff with turkey over cyprus . " the eu has reacted -lrb- to turkey -rrb- , in my opinion , in a way that is both resolute and prudent … prudent in that it is always made clear to turkey that is worth it to continue working on reforms , " merkel said . eu leaders were expected during the summit to endorse a decision made by their foreign ministers earlier this week which partially froze turkey 's membership talks due to its refusal to implement a 2005 deal to open its ports to cyprus . " this is not a small matter , " merkel said .
" candidates for membership and eu member states must recognize each other politically and diplomatically . " eu to put brakes on further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although this week 's eu summit will confirm that the doors remain open to turkey and western balkan states if they are willing to match the bloc 's criteria , leaders are expected to confirm a slowdown in plans for further expansion following the entry of romania and bulgaria . in keeping with that expected tone , merkel said that countries such as albania , bosnia , serbia and macedonia have a " prospect of membership ... but we know that the perspective is a medium-term one . " merkel also mapped out a number of issues that germany would tackle as eu president .
the chancellor said that germany would make energy security , research and development , education and cutting back red tape priorities . merkel also spoke of the eu 's role on the global stage .
she said that the eu needed to speak in unison " with a strong voice " when dealing with international crises , citing iran and the situation in the middle east . middle east peace a priority for europe " we face enormous problems in the middle east , " merkel said , adding that germany hoped to breathe new life into the mid-east quartet of the eu , the us , the un and russia , which has been seeking to mediate in the conflict between israel and the palestinians , and hezbollah in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's trip to syria was part of an engagement policy merkel defended the decision to send foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to syria by saying " unusual steps " were part of the search for peace in the middle east .
she added that germany balanced a " readiness for dialogue " in principle with countries such as syria and iran with " clear principles and values . " while criticizing syria , germany has sought to draw it into talks designed to solve the region 's problems .
steinmeier visited damascus last week and pressed syria to use its influence to moderate the demands of the hezbollah militant group , which fought a war with israel in the summer and is seeking the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de readying for eu role , merkel pushes values germany 's angela merkel said reminding europeans of their common values is the key to creating a feeling of unity in the 25 nation bloc .

" the aim of this function was to spread national socialist ideology , " said the court in a statement . hundreds of oil paintings , etchings and drawings were allegedly confiscated from gustav schuster , who was director of the chemitz women 's clinic , during the second world war . the artworks , which include paintings by ludwig richter , max liebermann and max klinger , are worth at least 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 662,550 -rrb- . the decision , had it have been different , could have opened the doors to thousands of other claims for compensation for artworks , property and other goods confiscated from 1945 to 1949 by the soviet forces which occupied the eastern part of germany after wwii . as it is , legal experts say the ruling could set a different precedent and negatively affect similar restitution claims that could number into the thousands , according to the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , which quoted an official from the german finance ministry . nazis are n't eligible for compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soviets troops in eastern germany seized large numbers of properties and goods the german " compensation and just satisfaction act " law , which was passed in 1994 , exempts the state from paying compensation if the person from who the goods were confiscated " extensively " supported the nazi regime , or had committed " crimes against humanity . " this can give rise to the problem that heirs are disinclined to probe deeply into their family 's background . the süddeutsche zeitung reported that the lawyers for schuster 's family have presented the court with documents showing that there were 14,427 senior positions in the nazi regime at the municipal level . the family argues that as one under thousands , dr. schuster therefore was only responsible for 0.006 percent of what occurred . however , according to the süddeutsche zeitung , there is not doubt that schuster was jointly responsible for deciding on , and conducting , the forced sterilization of dozens of women . the newspaper quotes the example of a similar court decision made in october when the son of a lawyer for the nazi regime was awarded compensation for two properties confiscated from his family . only after the court case , was it revealed that the lawyer was probably involved in the hanging of a deserter in the last days of the war . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de holocaust survivors in austria to finally receive compensation austria will at last begin handing out its final compensation payments to jewish survivors of the holocaust this month , 60 years after the end of world war ii , thanks to a recent concluding legal arrangement in the us .

" the aim is to confirm a common understanding on the future of the enlargement process , " finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , hosting the summit as eu president , said in an invitation to his fellow leaders . before dinner , vanhanen will present an analysis on the constitution , which was meant to help the eu run more smoothly as it grows , until it was rejected by french and dutch voters in referendums last year . enlargement fatigue setting in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expansion in the eu has left bloc members exhausted those votes , due in part to fears of " enlargement fatigue " and the idea of a large , relatively poor and mainly muslim country like turkey joining , sent the union spiraling into its worst ever crisis . an eu official said that " the level of ambition is weak " at the moment on enlargement , as the member countries know that any concrete proposals could be put on the back burner until the eu 's " institutional " house is put in order . in any case , the leaders are expected to concede that the impasse over the constitution must end before new members are considered beyond bulgaria and romania . the german eu presidency , starting on january 1 , is expected to take forward the process , with no real decisions expected before france takes over the helm in the second half of 2008 . however , a study released thursday suggested that it would be in germany 's interest to promote further enlargement . according to a study commissioned by the german economy ministry , germany , the eurozone 's largest economy , had already largely profited from the extension of the eu from 15 to 25 nations in may 2004 .
the study said that enlargement had boosted germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by around one percentage point , and that the benefits would continue as the bloc expands further . germans plan to revive constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is at a dead end over the constitution in regard to the eu constitution , german chancellor angela merkel said thursday that it would be a " historical failure " if agreement on a constitutional treaty was not struck before european elections in 2009 . the chancellor said that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " whatever the outcome here , the leaders ' stance will have major repercussions for turkey , which began membership talks last year , but also for eu candidates like croatia and macedonia and other hopefuls in the balkans . british prime minister tony blair , a strong supporter of ankara 's candidacy , is expected to travel to ankara after the summit ends on friday in a gesture of solidarity . other points of order include the increasingly high-profile issue of sustainable energy supply , but the real initiatives on that subject are also expected to be taken by germany . serbia creeps up eu agenda with turkey resolved for now and nobody keen to wade too far into the issue of institutional reform , one other issue is looming as a possible bone of contention , in what is likely to be a quiet and short summit , that of serbia . the eu froze in may a stabilization and association agreement - a first step toward joining the eu - over serbia 's failure to hand over former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic to the un war crimes court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi is pushing for talks with belgrade to resume italian prime minister romano prodi is expected to ask his counterparts to lift the eu 's condition of full cooperation with the court for the talks with belgrade to resume . but britain and others oppose this idea and most would prefer to reassess ties with belgrade , and the situation in the breakaway province of kosovo , after serbia 's january elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel rallies eu for challenges ahead in germany 's presidency german chancellor angela merkel used a speech to the german bundestag to urge europe to work together to meet the challenges coming its way during germany 's six-month eu presidency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 14.12.2006 what does it mean to be poor in wealthy germany ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for life - thank you , " reads the sign this month ’ s publication of a new report on poverty in europe has attempted to prize open a nation of resolutely blind eyes to a harsh reality of life in contemporary germany : life on the breadline . poverty is a moveable famine .
in a world where one man ’ s penury is another man ’ s wealth , geographical location dictates what constitutes destitution .
and although on paper , germany is one of the world 's wealthier nations , it is nonetheless home to throngs of people struggling to make ends meet .
what is more , if the findings in the federal statistics office ’ s “ life in europe ” report are anything to go by , millions more are at risk of becoming officially “ poor . ”
the breadline quoted in the report is 856 euros -lrb- $ 1,135 -rrb- for a person living alone and 1,798 euros for a family with two children .
in reality , however , many people are already living below it . so how does poverty look in this highly developed country ?
outsiders looking into germany are often stunned at the generosity of the social welfare system , and while it is doubtless among the most charitable of its kind , being at the bottom of the financial ladder of any society is never going to be a pleasant place to be .
eyes wide shut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food stocks for the needy brother antonius of a berlin franciscan monastery , who reports a steady increase in the number of " ordinary " germans coming to the daily soup kitchen since it set up 15 years ago , says the worst thing about being poor is the isolation it brings with it . “ people don ’ t need to read reports , but just have to open their eyes and their ears to realize that we have a poverty issue here .
but they do n't look because they don ’ t want to accept the struggles going on around them , ” he said . “ when you are poor , you ’ re on your own and likely as not you have endless amounts of time to kill . ”
for millions , being poor in germany is intrinsically connected to the persistent problem of high unemployment . under the hartz iv social welfare program introduced by the schröder administration to ensure the long-term unemployed a basic level of financial security , a single claimant is entitled to 345 euros monthly and couples to 311 euros each .
for families with children , there is a supplementary payment of between 207 and 276 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
in addition , the government foots rental bills - the amount depends upon average local housing costs - and most heating bills .
scrimping is frustrating bert hansen is out-of-work bookkeeper , husband and father who tops up his benefit payments with a so-called one-euro job , which allows claimants to earn a maximum of 180 euros monthly for a 30-hour working week .
even then , he says , it ’ s not easy . “ there are so many things which you can ’ t do without money and that makes you feel shut out .
we have fewer choices even when it comes to simple things like buying diapers , hygiene items and food . while society talks about the benefits of eating organic , we have no option but to go to discount supermarkets . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discount supermarkets are big business and while he tries to make the most of his situation , and has decided to help others who share his lot by working for his hourly euro in a soup kitchen and in a berlin church , hansen says it is “ frustrating ” to be constantly scrimping .
brother antonius believes it is an inability in many german families to manage what money they have , which feeds the problem of poverty . “ families come to us asking for food for breakfast and dinner , and we are supposed to report them to the authorities on the basis that the government provides a family allowance to provide food for the children , " he said .
" but the money gets spent on other things . ” he says too many people buckle too easily under the weight of advertising , interest-free credit deals and peer pressure . “ it might be a cliché to say this , but these days everybody wants to have everything , and the money to pay for it has to come from somewhere , ” he said .
time for non-monetary values bert hansen agrees that it is hard , particularly for young people , to live in a society so driven by consumerism without falling prey to its dazzling enticements . “ many parents are helpless , they can ’ t argue with their kids , can ’ t tell them when they can ’ t afford things , ” he said . the upshot is debt and a greater struggle with what money they do have .
hansen says the answer is to teach children that they can live with less and to reintroduce the concept of values .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumerism is infectious former chancellor of west germany , helmut schmidt , recently went down on record with berlin ’ s tagesspiegel newspaper saying : “ there needs to be an end to the complaining about ‘ poverty in germany ’ .
take the case of an 18-year-old girl who has a child and who gets a flat and a television provided by social welfare , she doesn ’ t need to pay the rent herself .
this girl is considered poor , but in reality she is far better off than we were at her age . ”

in a world where one man ’ s penury is another man ’ s wealth , geographical location dictates what constitutes destitution .
and although on paper , germany is one of the world 's wealthier nations , it is nonetheless home to throngs of people struggling to make ends meet .
what is more , if the findings in the federal statistics office ’ s “ life in europe ” report are anything to go by , millions more are at risk of becoming officially “ poor . ”
the breadline quoted in the report is 856 euros -lrb- $ 1,135 -rrb- for a person living alone and 1,798 euros for a family with two children .
in reality , however , many people are already living below it . so how does poverty look in this highly developed country ?
outsiders looking into germany are often stunned at the generosity of the social welfare system , and while it is doubtless among the most charitable of its kind , being at the bottom of the financial ladder of any society is never going to be a pleasant place to be .
eyes wide shut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food stocks for the needy brother antonius of a berlin franciscan monastery , who reports a steady increase in the number of " ordinary " germans coming to the daily soup kitchen since it set up 15 years ago , says the worst thing about being poor is the isolation it brings with it . “ people don ’ t need to read reports , but just have to open their eyes and their ears to realize that we have a poverty issue here .
but they do n't look because they don ’ t want to accept the struggles going on around them , ” he said . “ when you are poor , you ’ re on your own and likely as not you have endless amounts of time to kill . ”
for millions , being poor in germany is intrinsically connected to the persistent problem of high unemployment . under the hartz iv social welfare program introduced by the schröder administration to ensure the long-term unemployed a basic level of financial security , a single claimant is entitled to 345 euros monthly and couples to 311 euros each .
for families with children , there is a supplementary payment of between 207 and 276 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
in addition , the government foots rental bills - the amount depends upon average local housing costs - and most heating bills .
scrimping is frustrating bert hansen is out-of-work bookkeeper , husband and father who tops up his benefit payments with a so-called one-euro job , which allows claimants to earn a maximum of 180 euros monthly for a 30-hour working week .
even then , he says , it ’ s not easy . “ there are so many things which you can ’ t do without money and that makes you feel shut out .
we have fewer choices even when it comes to simple things like buying diapers , hygiene items and food . while society talks about the benefits of eating organic , we have no option but to go to discount supermarkets . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discount supermarkets are big business and while he tries to make the most of his situation , and has decided to help others who share his lot by working for his hourly euro in a soup kitchen and in a berlin church , hansen says it is “ frustrating ” to be constantly scrimping .
brother antonius believes it is an inability in many german families to manage what money they have , which feeds the problem of poverty . “ families come to us asking for food for breakfast and dinner , and we are supposed to report them to the authorities on the basis that the government provides a family allowance to provide food for the children , " he said .
" but the money gets spent on other things . ” he says too many people buckle too easily under the weight of advertising , interest-free credit deals and peer pressure . “ it might be a cliché to say this , but these days everybody wants to have everything , and the money to pay for it has to come from somewhere , ” he said .
time for non-monetary values bert hansen agrees that it is hard , particularly for young people , to live in a society so driven by consumerism without falling prey to its dazzling enticements . “ many parents are helpless , they can ’ t argue with their kids , can ’ t tell them when they can ’ t afford things , ” he said . the upshot is debt and a greater struggle with what money they do have .
hansen says the answer is to teach children that they can live with less and to reintroduce the concept of values .

for millions , being poor in germany is intrinsically connected to the persistent problem of high unemployment . under the hartz iv social welfare program introduced by the schröder administration to ensure the long-term unemployed a basic level of financial security , a single claimant is entitled to 345 euros monthly and couples to 311 euros each .
for families with children , there is a supplementary payment of between 207 and 276 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
in addition , the government foots rental bills - the amount depends upon average local housing costs - and most heating bills .
scrimping is frustrating bert hansen is out-of-work bookkeeper , husband and father who tops up his benefit payments with a so-called one-euro job , which allows claimants to earn a maximum of 180 euros monthly for a 30-hour working week .
even then , he says , it ’ s not easy . “ there are so many things which you can ’ t do without money and that makes you feel shut out .
we have fewer choices even when it comes to simple things like buying diapers , hygiene items and food . while society talks about the benefits of eating organic , we have no option but to go to discount supermarkets . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discount supermarkets are big business and while he tries to make the most of his situation , and has decided to help others who share his lot by working for his hourly euro in a soup kitchen and in a berlin church , hansen says it is “ frustrating ” to be constantly scrimping .
brother antonius believes it is an inability in many german families to manage what money they have , which feeds the problem of poverty . “ families come to us asking for food for breakfast and dinner , and we are supposed to report them to the authorities on the basis that the government provides a family allowance to provide food for the children , " he said .
" but the money gets spent on other things . ” he says too many people buckle too easily under the weight of advertising , interest-free credit deals and peer pressure . “ it might be a cliché to say this , but these days everybody wants to have everything , and the money to pay for it has to come from somewhere , ” he said .
time for non-monetary values bert hansen agrees that it is hard , particularly for young people , to live in a society so driven by consumerism without falling prey to its dazzling enticements . “ many parents are helpless , they can ’ t argue with their kids , can ’ t tell them when they can ’ t afford things , ” he said . the upshot is debt and a greater struggle with what money they do have .
hansen says the answer is to teach children that they can live with less and to reintroduce the concept of values .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumerism is infectious former chancellor of west germany , helmut schmidt , recently went down on record with berlin ’ s tagesspiegel newspaper saying : “ there needs to be an end to the complaining about ‘ poverty in germany ’ .

the closed-door inquiry in berlin is investigating the truth of this . el-masri , a muslim of lebanese origin who lives in southern germany , is currently suing us authorities for damages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-lebanese khaled el-masri says he was tortured by the cia he says he was imprisoned by us agents in december 2003 in macedonia and tortured in afghanistan before being released five months later .
in afghanistan , el-masri says he was questioned by a man called " sam " who spoke perfect german . steinmeier , who was the head of the chancellery under schröder , said accusations that the german government had aided the kidnapping or " complicity looked away " were " scandalous . " pressure to find terrorists steinmeier described the period after the september 11 , 2001 attacks as one of enormous pressure . " we needed to collect information as quickly as possible about other potential attacks , " he said . however , steinmeier emphasized that this did not give authorities free reign to " kidnap and torture . " " we did n't blindly follow the us government , " steinmeier said .
" when i headed the chancellery , the principles of constitutionality and civility applied in this -lrb- post-sept .
11 -rrb- period . " a report in the berliner zeitung newspaper on thursday said steinmeier had been informed in 2005 that el-masri had been held by the cia but had failed to pass the information on to lawmakers . fischer also denies knowledge of cia abduction the foreign minister at the time of el-masri 's kidnapping , joschka fischer , who now teaches at princeton university in the us , also gave evidence before the hearing on thursday . fischer , making one of his few public appearances since resigning his parliamentary seat earlier this year , termed the abduction " a very serious matter " and said that he did n't know about el-masri 's detention until after his release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , the german foreign minister at the time of el-masri 's abduction , came back from the us to give evidence the inquiry has already heard that the then-us ambassador to berlin , daniel coats , informed then german interior minister otto schily on may 31 , 2004 that el-masri had been mistakenly detained , then freed . fischer said he had not learned of this meeting from schily but from reading about it in the washington post newspaper .
he said he had then checked the veracity of statements made by el-masri and his lawyer . however , fischer said the relationship between the us and germany was extremely tense at the time - not least because several of the sept .
11 hijackers had been living in germany before the attacks . " the main reproaches are those that are n't said out aloud , such as , ' we have you to thank for sept .

the effect of that on foreign relations should n't be underestimated , " fischer said before the hearing . fischer emphasized that the german government 's objections to us authorities regarding the handling of terror suspects fell on deaf ears . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european meps look into german role in cia deportations a european parliament delegation was in berlin to find out to what extent the german government and secret services turned a blind eye to us practices to deport detainees to other continents via european territory .

" a deficit ratio of less than 3 percent is just an interim goal , " he said .
" much of what has been achieved is cyclical .
the medium term goal is to achieve a balanced budget .
additional consolidation must follow in economically good times . " weber warned against excessive euphoria . " the current favorable economic developments and the related increase in tax revenues must not be interpreted as an indication of improved growth perspectives in the long term , " he said . more structural reforms would have to be implemented to improve the low potential growth rate of the german economy and reduce unemployment on a lasting basis , weber added . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's economic projections bounce back optimism is high in germany after new surveys show an increase in german business confidence after a 13-year low , and forecast greater than expected gdp growth for 2007 .

in a world where one man ’ s penury is another man ’ s wealth , geographical location dictates what constitutes destitution .
and although on paper , germany is one of the world 's wealthier nations , it is nonetheless home to throngs of people struggling to make ends meet .
what is more , if the findings in the federal statistics office ’ s “ life in europe ” report are anything to go by , millions more are at risk of becoming officially “ poor . ”
the breadline quoted in the report is 856 euros -lrb- $ 1,135 -rrb- for a person living alone and 1,798 euros for a family with two children .
in reality , however , many people are already living below it . so how does poverty look in this highly developed country ?
outsiders looking into germany are often stunned at the generosity of the social welfare system , and while it is doubtless among the most charitable of its kind , being at the bottom of the financial ladder of any society is never going to be a pleasant place to be .
eyes wide shut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food stocks for the needy brother antonius of a berlin franciscan monastery , who reports a steady increase in the number of " ordinary " germans coming to the daily soup kitchen since it set up 15 years ago , says the worst thing about being poor is the isolation it brings with it . “ people don ’ t need to read reports , but just have to open their eyes and their ears to realize that we have a poverty issue here .

" i would consider it an historical failure if we do not succeed in working out the substance of the constitutional treaty by the time the next european elections take place , " merkel said in her speech , which was meant to set out the aims of germany 's eu presidency which starts in january . the chancellor added that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " merkel acknowledged that the issue of the constitution would not be settled by the end of germany 's turn at the eu helm but said she hoped that with its support the treaty would be revived and put back on track . " we have the task at the end of our presidency to set a roadmap " for the future implementation of the constitution , she said . the constitution was designed to provide the institutional framework for an eu which will grow to 27 member states when bulgaria and romania join on jan.1.
but it suffered a severe blow when french and dutch voters rejected it last year . merkel : united we stand , divided we fall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags stand together but how close are the eu nations on the subjects that matter ?
merkel also urged eu states to work closer together , saying that a united europe could achieve success , but a divided europe would weaken the strength of the bloc . on the thorny issue of turkey 's bid for eu membership , which is expected to be tackled yet again during the summit in brussels , merkel said that the eu had decided on a " resolute but prudent " course of action in its standoff with turkey over cyprus . " the eu has reacted -lrb- to turkey -rrb- , in my opinion , in a way that is both resolute and prudent … prudent in that it is always made clear to turkey that is worth it to continue working on reforms , " merkel said . eu leaders were expected during the summit to endorse a decision made by their foreign ministers earlier this week which partially froze turkey 's membership talks due to its refusal to implement a 2005 deal to open its ports to cyprus . " this is not a small matter , " merkel said .
" candidates for membership and eu member states must recognize each other politically and diplomatically . " eu to put brakes on further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although this week 's eu summit will confirm that the doors remain open to turkey and western balkan states if they are willing to match the bloc 's criteria , leaders are expected to confirm a slowdown in plans for further expansion following the entry of romania and bulgaria . in keeping with that expected tone , merkel said that countries such as albania , bosnia , serbia and macedonia have a " prospect of membership ... but we know that the perspective is a medium-term one . " merkel also mapped out a number of issues that germany would tackle as eu president .
the chancellor said that germany would make energy security , research and development , education and cutting back red tape priorities . merkel also spoke of the eu 's role on the global stage .

" i would consider it an historical failure if we do not succeed in working out the substance of the constitutional treaty by the time the next european elections take place , " merkel said in her speech , which was meant to set out the aims of germany 's eu presidency which starts in january . the chancellor added that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " merkel acknowledged that the issue of the constitution would not be settled by the end of germany 's turn at the eu helm but said she hoped that with its support the treaty would be revived and put back on track . " we have the task at the end of our presidency to set a roadmap " for the future implementation of the constitution , she said . the constitution was designed to provide the institutional framework for an eu which will grow to 27 member states when bulgaria and romania join on jan.1.
but it suffered a severe blow when french and dutch voters rejected it last year . merkel : united we stand , divided we fall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags stand together but how close are the eu nations on the subjects that matter ?
merkel also urged eu states to work closer together , saying that a united europe could achieve success , but a divided europe would weaken the strength of the bloc . on the thorny issue of turkey 's bid for eu membership , which is expected to be tackled yet again during the summit in brussels , merkel said that the eu had decided on a " resolute but prudent " course of action in its standoff with turkey over cyprus . " the eu has reacted -lrb- to turkey -rrb- , in my opinion , in a way that is both resolute and prudent … prudent in that it is always made clear to turkey that is worth it to continue working on reforms , " merkel said . eu leaders were expected during the summit to endorse a decision made by their foreign ministers earlier this week which partially froze turkey 's membership talks due to its refusal to implement a 2005 deal to open its ports to cyprus . " this is not a small matter , " merkel said .
" candidates for membership and eu member states must recognize each other politically and diplomatically . " eu to put brakes on further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although this week 's eu summit will confirm that the doors remain open to turkey and western balkan states if they are willing to match the bloc 's criteria , leaders are expected to confirm a slowdown in plans for further expansion following the entry of romania and bulgaria . in keeping with that expected tone , merkel said that countries such as albania , bosnia , serbia and macedonia have a " prospect of membership ... but we know that the perspective is a medium-term one . " merkel also mapped out a number of issues that germany would tackle as eu president .
the chancellor said that germany would make energy security , research and development , education and cutting back red tape priorities . merkel also spoke of the eu 's role on the global stage .
she said that the eu needed to speak in unison " with a strong voice " when dealing with international crises , citing iran and the situation in the middle east . middle east peace a priority for europe " we face enormous problems in the middle east , " merkel said , adding that germany hoped to breathe new life into the mid-east quartet of the eu , the us , the un and russia , which has been seeking to mediate in the conflict between israel and the palestinians , and hezbollah in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's trip to syria was part of an engagement policy merkel defended the decision to send foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to syria by saying " unusual steps " were part of the search for peace in the middle east .

the closed-door inquiry in berlin is investigating the truth of this . el-masri , a muslim of lebanese origin who lives in southern germany , is currently suing us authorities for damages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-lebanese khaled el-masri says he was tortured by the cia he says he was imprisoned by us agents in december 2003 in macedonia and tortured in afghanistan before being released five months later .
in afghanistan , el-masri says he was questioned by a man called " sam " who spoke perfect german . steinmeier , who was the head of the chancellery under schröder , said accusations that the german government had aided the kidnapping or " complicity looked away " were " scandalous . " pressure to find terrorists steinmeier described the period after the september 11 , 2001 attacks as one of enormous pressure . " we needed to collect information as quickly as possible about other potential attacks , " he said . however , steinmeier emphasized that this did not give authorities free reign to " kidnap and torture . " " we did n't blindly follow the us government , " steinmeier said .
" when i headed the chancellery , the principles of constitutionality and civility applied in this -lrb- post-sept .
11 -rrb- period . " a report in the berliner zeitung newspaper on thursday said steinmeier had been informed in 2005 that el-masri had been held by the cia but had failed to pass the information on to lawmakers . fischer also denies knowledge of cia abduction the foreign minister at the time of el-masri 's kidnapping , joschka fischer , who now teaches at princeton university in the us , also gave evidence before the hearing on thursday . fischer , making one of his few public appearances since resigning his parliamentary seat earlier this year , termed the abduction " a very serious matter " and said that he did n't know about el-masri 's detention until after his release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , the german foreign minister at the time of el-masri 's abduction , came back from the us to give evidence the inquiry has already heard that the then-us ambassador to berlin , daniel coats , informed then german interior minister otto schily on may 31 , 2004 that el-masri had been mistakenly detained , then freed . fischer said he had not learned of this meeting from schily but from reading about it in the washington post newspaper .
he said he had then checked the veracity of statements made by el-masri and his lawyer . however , fischer said the relationship between the us and germany was extremely tense at the time - not least because several of the sept .
11 hijackers had been living in germany before the attacks . " the main reproaches are those that are n't said out aloud , such as , ' we have you to thank for sept .
11 . '
the effect of that on foreign relations should n't be underestimated , " fischer said before the hearing . fischer emphasized that the german government 's objections to us authorities regarding the handling of terror suspects fell on deaf ears . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european meps look into german role in cia deportations a european parliament delegation was in berlin to find out to what extent the german government and secret services turned a blind eye to us practices to deport detainees to other continents via european territory .

he said he had then checked the veracity of statements made by el-masri and his lawyer . however , fischer said the relationship between the us and germany was extremely tense at the time - not least because several of the sept .
11 hijackers had been living in germany before the attacks . " the main reproaches are those that are n't said out aloud , such as , ' we have you to thank for sept .

" i would consider it an historical failure if we do not succeed in working out the substance of the constitutional treaty by the time the next european elections take place , " merkel said in her speech , which was meant to set out the aims of germany 's eu presidency which starts in january . the chancellor added that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " merkel acknowledged that the issue of the constitution would not be settled by the end of germany 's turn at the eu helm but said she hoped that with its support the treaty would be revived and put back on track . " we have the task at the end of our presidency to set a roadmap " for the future implementation of the constitution , she said . the constitution was designed to provide the institutional framework for an eu which will grow to 27 member states when bulgaria and romania join on jan.1.

" the eu has reacted -lrb- to turkey -rrb- , in my opinion , in a way that is both resolute and prudent … prudent in that it is always made clear to turkey that is worth it to continue working on reforms , " merkel said . eu leaders were expected during the summit to endorse a decision made by their foreign ministers earlier this week which partially froze turkey 's membership talks due to its refusal to implement a 2005 deal to open its ports to cyprus .

the chancellor said that germany would make energy security , research and development , education and cutting back red tape priorities . merkel also spoke of the eu 's role on the global stage .
she said that the eu needed to speak in unison " with a strong voice " when dealing with international crises , citing iran and the situation in the middle east . middle east peace a priority for europe " we face enormous problems in the middle east , " merkel said , adding that germany hoped to breathe new life into the mid-east quartet of the eu , the us , the un and russia , which has been seeking to mediate in the conflict between israel and the palestinians , and hezbollah in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's trip to syria was part of an engagement policy merkel defended the decision to send foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to syria by saying " unusual steps " were part of the search for peace in the middle east .
she added that germany balanced a " readiness for dialogue " in principle with countries such as syria and iran with " clear principles and values . " while criticizing syria , germany has sought to draw it into talks designed to solve the region 's problems .
steinmeier visited damascus last week and pressed syria to use its influence to moderate the demands of the hezbollah militant group , which fought a war with israel in the summer and is seeking the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de readying for eu role , merkel pushes values germany 's angela merkel said reminding europeans of their common values is the key to creating a feeling of unity in the 25 nation bloc .

" this is not a small matter , " merkel said .

" eu to put brakes on further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although this week 's eu summit will confirm that the doors remain open to turkey and western balkan states if they are willing to match the bloc 's criteria , leaders are expected to confirm a slowdown in plans for further expansion following the entry of romania and bulgaria . in keeping with that expected tone , merkel said that countries such as albania , bosnia , serbia and macedonia have a " prospect of membership ... but we know that the perspective is a medium-term one . " merkel also mapped out a number of issues that germany would tackle as eu president .
the chancellor said that germany would make energy security , research and development , education and cutting back red tape priorities . merkel also spoke of the eu 's role on the global stage .
she said that the eu needed to speak in unison " with a strong voice " when dealing with international crises , citing iran and the situation in the middle east . middle east peace a priority for europe " we face enormous problems in the middle east , " merkel said , adding that germany hoped to breathe new life into the mid-east quartet of the eu , the us , the un and russia , which has been seeking to mediate in the conflict between israel and the palestinians , and hezbollah in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's trip to syria was part of an engagement policy merkel defended the decision to send foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to syria by saying " unusual steps " were part of the search for peace in the middle east .
she added that germany balanced a " readiness for dialogue " in principle with countries such as syria and iran with " clear principles and values . " while criticizing syria , germany has sought to draw it into talks designed to solve the region 's problems .
steinmeier visited damascus last week and pressed syria to use its influence to moderate the demands of the hezbollah militant group , which fought a war with israel in the summer and is seeking the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de readying for eu role , merkel pushes values germany 's angela merkel said reminding europeans of their common values is the key to creating a feeling of unity in the 25 nation bloc .

" the aim is to confirm a common understanding on the future of the enlargement process , " finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , hosting the summit as eu president , said in an invitation to his fellow leaders . before dinner , vanhanen will present an analysis on the constitution , which was meant to help the eu run more smoothly as it grows , until it was rejected by french and dutch voters in referendums last year . enlargement fatigue setting in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expansion in the eu has left bloc members exhausted those votes , due in part to fears of " enlargement fatigue " and the idea of a large , relatively poor and mainly muslim country like turkey joining , sent the union spiraling into its worst ever crisis . an eu official said that " the level of ambition is weak " at the moment on enlargement , as the member countries know that any concrete proposals could be put on the back burner until the eu 's " institutional " house is put in order . in any case , the leaders are expected to concede that the impasse over the constitution must end before new members are considered beyond bulgaria and romania . the german eu presidency , starting on january 1 , is expected to take forward the process , with no real decisions expected before france takes over the helm in the second half of 2008 . however , a study released thursday suggested that it would be in germany 's interest to promote further enlargement . according to a study commissioned by the german economy ministry , germany , the eurozone 's largest economy , had already largely profited from the extension of the eu from 15 to 25 nations in may 2004 .
the study said that enlargement had boosted germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by around one percentage point , and that the benefits would continue as the bloc expands further . germans plan to revive constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is at a dead end over the constitution in regard to the eu constitution , german chancellor angela merkel said thursday that it would be a " historical failure " if agreement on a constitutional treaty was not struck before european elections in 2009 . the chancellor said that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " whatever the outcome here , the leaders ' stance will have major repercussions for turkey , which began membership talks last year , but also for eu candidates like croatia and macedonia and other hopefuls in the balkans . british prime minister tony blair , a strong supporter of ankara 's candidacy , is expected to travel to ankara after the summit ends on friday in a gesture of solidarity . other points of order include the increasingly high-profile issue of sustainable energy supply , but the real initiatives on that subject are also expected to be taken by germany . serbia creeps up eu agenda with turkey resolved for now and nobody keen to wade too far into the issue of institutional reform , one other issue is looming as a possible bone of contention , in what is likely to be a quiet and short summit , that of serbia . the eu froze in may a stabilization and association agreement - a first step toward joining the eu - over serbia 's failure to hand over former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic to the un war crimes court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi is pushing for talks with belgrade to resume italian prime minister romano prodi is expected to ask his counterparts to lift the eu 's condition of full cooperation with the court for the talks with belgrade to resume . but britain and others oppose this idea and most would prefer to reassess ties with belgrade , and the situation in the breakaway province of kosovo , after serbia 's january elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel rallies eu for challenges ahead in germany 's presidency german chancellor angela merkel used a speech to the german bundestag to urge europe to work together to meet the challenges coming its way during germany 's six-month eu presidency .

" the economic uptrend continued at a rapid pace in the third quarter , " weber said . the annual growth rate for the whole of 2006 " should therefore stand at around two-and-three-quarter percent , well above potential , " the german central bank chief said , adding that exports and domestic demand were contributing to growth .

mederake , who had a previous conviction for raping a 14-year-old in 1999 , had admitted kidnapping and holding the then 13-year-old girl named stephanie captive as well as repeatedly raping her over a five-week period beginning in january . " we have always said that a punishment bordering on the maximum sentence followed by preventative detention was possible , " christian avenarius , a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office , said on thursday .
" we wish stephanie and her family all the best and that she is able to find peace . " during the trial , the prosecutors showed a wooden box mederake locked stephanie in when he left the apartment where he held her captive . " the defendant kidnapped her to satisfy his demands , mainly of a sexual nature , for a period without end , " said presiding judge tom maciejewski .
" every day he performed humiliating sexual acts on her . " she was only freed by police when she managed to drop a scrap of paper in the street that carried a desperate plea for help and the address where she was being imprisoned scrawled in red pen . mentally fit to stand trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mederake stayed on the court building 's roof for 20 hours stephanie , now 14 years old , did not testify in the trial after a psychologist 's certificate said she was too frightened to face mederake in court .
another analysis declared mederake mentally capable of standing trial and said he continued to pose a threat to society . her family voiced relief outside the court on thursday . " it has helped stephanie that the trial has been in the public eye , " stephanie 's father , joachim rudolph , told journalists .
" we are one hundred percent relieved .
we will now try to have a good christmas and take things step by step . " after testimony in the case concluded on tuesday , mederake asked stephanie , who he kidnapped on her way to school , and her family for forgiveness . defense lawyer andreas boine , chose not comment on the sentence , but said he would consult with his client . police slip-ups prolonged trial in a dramatic turn in the case , mederake , escaped from warders in november and climbed onto a prison roof where he remained for about 20 hours . when the trial continued , it detailed several other police blunders including how authorities overlooked the fact that the pedophile lived a few blocks from the kidnapped girl 's home and how indecisive officers spent two hours outside the locked door of the dresden apartment where stephanie was imprisoned . " we thought no one was at home , " a detective testified , describing the feb .

mederake , who had a previous conviction for raping a 14-year-old in 1999 , had admitted kidnapping and holding the then 13-year-old girl named stephanie captive as well as repeatedly raping her over a five-week period beginning in january . " we have always said that a punishment bordering on the maximum sentence followed by preventative detention was possible , " christian avenarius , a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office , said on thursday .
" we wish stephanie and her family all the best and that she is able to find peace . " during the trial , the prosecutors showed a wooden box mederake locked stephanie in when he left the apartment where he held her captive . " the defendant kidnapped her to satisfy his demands , mainly of a sexual nature , for a period without end , " said presiding judge tom maciejewski .
" every day he performed humiliating sexual acts on her . " she was only freed by police when she managed to drop a scrap of paper in the street that carried a desperate plea for help and the address where she was being imprisoned scrawled in red pen . mentally fit to stand trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mederake stayed on the court building 's roof for 20 hours stephanie , now 14 years old , did not testify in the trial after a psychologist 's certificate said she was too frightened to face mederake in court .
another analysis declared mederake mentally capable of standing trial and said he continued to pose a threat to society . her family voiced relief outside the court on thursday . " it has helped stephanie that the trial has been in the public eye , " stephanie 's father , joachim rudolph , told journalists .
" we are one hundred percent relieved .
we will now try to have a good christmas and take things step by step . " after testimony in the case concluded on tuesday , mederake asked stephanie , who he kidnapped on her way to school , and her family for forgiveness . defense lawyer andreas boine , chose not comment on the sentence , but said he would consult with his client . police slip-ups prolonged trial in a dramatic turn in the case , mederake , escaped from warders in november and climbed onto a prison roof where he remained for about 20 hours . when the trial continued , it detailed several other police blunders including how authorities overlooked the fact that the pedophile lived a few blocks from the kidnapped girl 's home and how indecisive officers spent two hours outside the locked door of the dresden apartment where stephanie was imprisoned . " we thought no one was at home , " a detective testified , describing the feb .
15 arrest .
it was decided to pick the lock and quietly inspect the place so that mederake would not notice .

" the economic uptrend continued at a rapid pace in the third quarter , " weber said . the annual growth rate for the whole of 2006 " should therefore stand at around two-and-three-quarter percent , well above potential , " the german central bank chief said , adding that exports and domestic demand were contributing to growth .
" that means germany is providing substantial impulses for the euro area . " slower growth in 2007 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some economists wonder how retail sales will fare after a 3 percent vat hike but domestic consumption , long a dark spot in export-strong germany , is still troubling the nation . " there is still no sign of a deep recovery in consumption , even if there have been improvements on this front recently , " weber said .
" in the traditional retail sector , developments are still weak . " looking ahead to next year , weber said he was projecting the current upturn to weaken " but not break down altogether . " " the fundamental trend will remain intact , even if the rise in value-added tax on jan .
1 will have a substantial braking effect on the economy , " he said . the german government has decided to raise vat by 3 percent to 19 percent from next month , the biggest-ever single vat rise . berlin set to meet eu rules turning to the state of germany 's public finances , weber said that given the country 's strong economic performance , the public deficit was to set to fall back within eu limits for the first time since 2002 this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is set to meet eu regulations on new debt under the european stability and growth pact , eurozone countries are not allowed to run up public deficits in excess of 3 percent of gdp . however , germany , the pact 's main architect , has been in breach of the 3-percent rule every year since 2002 . weber said the bundesbank was penciling in a deficit ratio of " around 2 percent this year . " given the tax measures due to come into effect from 2007 , the deficit ratio would likely fall further next year , weber continued . do n't celebrate yet , some work remains however , germany should not rest on its laurels , " there is still room for further substantial consolidation , " weber said . " a deficit ratio of less than 3 percent is just an interim goal , " he said .
" much of what has been achieved is cyclical .
the medium term goal is to achieve a balanced budget .
additional consolidation must follow in economically good times . " weber warned against excessive euphoria . " the current favorable economic developments and the related increase in tax revenues must not be interpreted as an indication of improved growth perspectives in the long term , " he said . more structural reforms would have to be implemented to improve the low potential growth rate of the german economy and reduce unemployment on a lasting basis , weber added . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's economic projections bounce back optimism is high in germany after new surveys show an increase in german business confidence after a 13-year low , and forecast greater than expected gdp growth for 2007 .

in a world where one man ’ s penury is another man ’ s wealth , geographical location dictates what constitutes destitution .
and although on paper , germany is one of the world 's wealthier nations , it is nonetheless home to throngs of people struggling to make ends meet .
what is more , if the findings in the federal statistics office ’ s “ life in europe ” report are anything to go by , millions more are at risk of becoming officially “ poor . ”
the breadline quoted in the report is 856 euros -lrb- $ 1,135 -rrb- for a person living alone and 1,798 euros for a family with two children .

in a world where one man ’ s penury is another man ’ s wealth , geographical location dictates what constitutes destitution .
and although on paper , germany is one of the world 's wealthier nations , it is nonetheless home to throngs of people struggling to make ends meet .
what is more , if the findings in the federal statistics office ’ s “ life in europe ” report are anything to go by , millions more are at risk of becoming officially “ poor . ”
the breadline quoted in the report is 856 euros -lrb- $ 1,135 -rrb- for a person living alone and 1,798 euros for a family with two children .
in reality , however , many people are already living below it . so how does poverty look in this highly developed country ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 14.12.2006 merkel rallies eu for challenges ahead in germany 's presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is eager to get her hands on the eu 's presidency german chancellor angela merkel used a speech to the german bundestag to urge europe to work together to meet the challenges coming its way during germany 's six-month eu presidency . on the morning before european union leaders meet for a two-day summit in brussels to discuss the bloc 's enlargement process , merkel told members of germany 's lower house of parliament that it would be an " historical failure " if an agreement on the ailing eu constitution was not struck before european elections in 2009 . " i would consider it an historical failure if we do not succeed in working out the substance of the constitutional treaty by the time the next european elections take place , " merkel said in her speech , which was meant to set out the aims of germany 's eu presidency which starts in january . the chancellor added that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " merkel acknowledged that the issue of the constitution would not be settled by the end of germany 's turn at the eu helm but said she hoped that with its support the treaty would be revived and put back on track . " we have the task at the end of our presidency to set a roadmap " for the future implementation of the constitution , she said . the constitution was designed to provide the institutional framework for an eu which will grow to 27 member states when bulgaria and romania join on jan.1.
but it suffered a severe blow when french and dutch voters rejected it last year . merkel : united we stand , divided we fall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags stand together but how close are the eu nations on the subjects that matter ?
merkel also urged eu states to work closer together , saying that a united europe could achieve success , but a divided europe would weaken the strength of the bloc . on the thorny issue of turkey 's bid for eu membership , which is expected to be tackled yet again during the summit in brussels , merkel said that the eu had decided on a " resolute but prudent " course of action in its standoff with turkey over cyprus . " the eu has reacted -lrb- to turkey -rrb- , in my opinion , in a way that is both resolute and prudent … prudent in that it is always made clear to turkey that is worth it to continue working on reforms , " merkel said . eu leaders were expected during the summit to endorse a decision made by their foreign ministers earlier this week which partially froze turkey 's membership talks due to its refusal to implement a 2005 deal to open its ports to cyprus . " this is not a small matter , " merkel said .
" candidates for membership and eu member states must recognize each other politically and diplomatically . " eu to put brakes on further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although this week 's eu summit will confirm that the doors remain open to turkey and western balkan states if they are willing to match the bloc 's criteria , leaders are expected to confirm a slowdown in plans for further expansion following the entry of romania and bulgaria . in keeping with that expected tone , merkel said that countries such as albania , bosnia , serbia and macedonia have a " prospect of membership ... but we know that the perspective is a medium-term one . " merkel also mapped out a number of issues that germany would tackle as eu president .
the chancellor said that germany would make energy security , research and development , education and cutting back red tape priorities . merkel also spoke of the eu 's role on the global stage .
she said that the eu needed to speak in unison " with a strong voice " when dealing with international crises , citing iran and the situation in the middle east . middle east peace a priority for europe " we face enormous problems in the middle east , " merkel said , adding that germany hoped to breathe new life into the mid-east quartet of the eu , the us , the un and russia , which has been seeking to mediate in the conflict between israel and the palestinians , and hezbollah in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's trip to syria was part of an engagement policy merkel defended the decision to send foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to syria by saying " unusual steps " were part of the search for peace in the middle east .
she added that germany balanced a " readiness for dialogue " in principle with countries such as syria and iran with " clear principles and values . " while criticizing syria , germany has sought to draw it into talks designed to solve the region 's problems .
steinmeier visited damascus last week and pressed syria to use its influence to moderate the demands of the hezbollah militant group , which fought a war with israel in the summer and is seeking the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de readying for eu role , merkel pushes values germany 's angela merkel said reminding europeans of their common values is the key to creating a feeling of unity in the 25 nation bloc .

" the aim of this function was to spread national socialist ideology , " said the court in a statement . hundreds of oil paintings , etchings and drawings were allegedly confiscated from gustav schuster , who was director of the chemitz women 's clinic , during the second world war . the artworks , which include paintings by ludwig richter , max liebermann and max klinger , are worth at least 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 662,550 -rrb- . the decision , had it have been different , could have opened the doors to thousands of other claims for compensation for artworks , property and other goods confiscated from 1945 to 1949 by the soviet forces which occupied the eastern part of germany after wwii . as it is , legal experts say the ruling could set a different precedent and negatively affect similar restitution claims that could number into the thousands , according to the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , which quoted an official from the german finance ministry . nazis are n't eligible for compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soviets troops in eastern germany seized large numbers of properties and goods the german " compensation and just satisfaction act " law , which was passed in 1994 , exempts the state from paying compensation if the person from who the goods were confiscated " extensively " supported the nazi regime , or had committed " crimes against humanity . " this can give rise to the problem that heirs are disinclined to probe deeply into their family 's background . the süddeutsche zeitung reported that the lawyers for schuster 's family have presented the court with documents showing that there were 14,427 senior positions in the nazi regime at the municipal level . the family argues that as one under thousands , dr. schuster therefore was only responsible for 0.006 percent of what occurred . however , according to the süddeutsche zeitung , there is not doubt that schuster was jointly responsible for deciding on , and conducting , the forced sterilization of dozens of women . the newspaper quotes the example of a similar court decision made in october when the son of a lawyer for the nazi regime was awarded compensation for two properties confiscated from his family . only after the court case , was it revealed that the lawyer was probably involved in the hanging of a deserter in the last days of the war . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de holocaust survivors in austria to finally receive compensation austria will at last begin handing out its final compensation payments to jewish survivors of the holocaust this month , 60 years after the end of world war ii , thanks to a recent concluding legal arrangement in the us .

the breadline quoted in the report is 856 euros -lrb- $ 1,135 -rrb- for a person living alone and 1,798 euros for a family with two children .
in reality , however , many people are already living below it . so how does poverty look in this highly developed country ?
outsiders looking into germany are often stunned at the generosity of the social welfare system , and while it is doubtless among the most charitable of its kind , being at the bottom of the financial ladder of any society is never going to be a pleasant place to be .

brother antonius believes it is an inability in many german families to manage what money they have , which feeds the problem of poverty . “ families come to us asking for food for breakfast and dinner , and we are supposed to report them to the authorities on the basis that the government provides a family allowance to provide food for the children , " he said .

outsiders looking into germany are often stunned at the generosity of the social welfare system , and while it is doubtless among the most charitable of its kind , being at the bottom of the financial ladder of any society is never going to be a pleasant place to be .
eyes wide shut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food stocks for the needy brother antonius of a berlin franciscan monastery , who reports a steady increase in the number of " ordinary " germans coming to the daily soup kitchen since it set up 15 years ago , says the worst thing about being poor is the isolation it brings with it . “ people don ’ t need to read reports , but just have to open their eyes and their ears to realize that we have a poverty issue here .
but they do n't look because they don ’ t want to accept the struggles going on around them , ” he said . “ when you are poor , you ’ re on your own and likely as not you have endless amounts of time to kill . ”
for millions , being poor in germany is intrinsically connected to the persistent problem of high unemployment . under the hartz iv social welfare program introduced by the schröder administration to ensure the long-term unemployed a basic level of financial security , a single claimant is entitled to 345 euros monthly and couples to 311 euros each .
for families with children , there is a supplementary payment of between 207 and 276 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
in addition , the government foots rental bills - the amount depends upon average local housing costs - and most heating bills .
scrimping is frustrating bert hansen is out-of-work bookkeeper , husband and father who tops up his benefit payments with a so-called one-euro job , which allows claimants to earn a maximum of 180 euros monthly for a 30-hour working week .
even then , he says , it ’ s not easy . “ there are so many things which you can ’ t do without money and that makes you feel shut out .
we have fewer choices even when it comes to simple things like buying diapers , hygiene items and food . while society talks about the benefits of eating organic , we have no option but to go to discount supermarkets . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discount supermarkets are big business and while he tries to make the most of his situation , and has decided to help others who share his lot by working for his hourly euro in a soup kitchen and in a berlin church , hansen says it is “ frustrating ” to be constantly scrimping .
brother antonius believes it is an inability in many german families to manage what money they have , which feeds the problem of poverty . “ families come to us asking for food for breakfast and dinner , and we are supposed to report them to the authorities on the basis that the government provides a family allowance to provide food for the children , " he said .
" but the money gets spent on other things . ” he says too many people buckle too easily under the weight of advertising , interest-free credit deals and peer pressure . “ it might be a cliché to say this , but these days everybody wants to have everything , and the money to pay for it has to come from somewhere , ” he said .
time for non-monetary values bert hansen agrees that it is hard , particularly for young people , to live in a society so driven by consumerism without falling prey to its dazzling enticements . “ many parents are helpless , they can ’ t argue with their kids , can ’ t tell them when they can ’ t afford things , ” he said . the upshot is debt and a greater struggle with what money they do have .
hansen says the answer is to teach children that they can live with less and to reintroduce the concept of values .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumerism is infectious former chancellor of west germany , helmut schmidt , recently went down on record with berlin ’ s tagesspiegel newspaper saying : “ there needs to be an end to the complaining about ‘ poverty in germany ’ .
take the case of an 18-year-old girl who has a child and who gets a flat and a television provided by social welfare , she doesn ’ t need to pay the rent herself .
this girl is considered poor , but in reality she is far better off than we were at her age . ”
but as bert hansen stresses , that was then and this is now . “ we may well have a higher standard of living now than we used to , but costs have gone up as well .
i know it is not possible to look at every single case individually , but neither is it right to talk in sweeping generalizations , " he said .
" people say hartz iv claimants have enough to live off , but in reality , that is not true .
it is an existential minimum . ” tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts shed light on germany 's poverty and welfare woes new studies in germany shed light on the twin problems of growing poverty and a deficit in the child-welfare system that could be related .

" i would consider it an historical failure if we do not succeed in working out the substance of the constitutional treaty by the time the next european elections take place , " merkel said in her speech , which was meant to set out the aims of germany 's eu presidency which starts in january . the chancellor added that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " merkel acknowledged that the issue of the constitution would not be settled by the end of germany 's turn at the eu helm but said she hoped that with its support the treaty would be revived and put back on track . " we have the task at the end of our presidency to set a roadmap " for the future implementation of the constitution , she said . the constitution was designed to provide the institutional framework for an eu which will grow to 27 member states when bulgaria and romania join on jan.1.
but it suffered a severe blow when french and dutch voters rejected it last year . merkel : united we stand , divided we fall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags stand together but how close are the eu nations on the subjects that matter ?
merkel also urged eu states to work closer together , saying that a united europe could achieve success , but a divided europe would weaken the strength of the bloc . on the thorny issue of turkey 's bid for eu membership , which is expected to be tackled yet again during the summit in brussels , merkel said that the eu had decided on a " resolute but prudent " course of action in its standoff with turkey over cyprus . " the eu has reacted -lrb- to turkey -rrb- , in my opinion , in a way that is both resolute and prudent … prudent in that it is always made clear to turkey that is worth it to continue working on reforms , " merkel said . eu leaders were expected during the summit to endorse a decision made by their foreign ministers earlier this week which partially froze turkey 's membership talks due to its refusal to implement a 2005 deal to open its ports to cyprus . " this is not a small matter , " merkel said .
" candidates for membership and eu member states must recognize each other politically and diplomatically . " eu to put brakes on further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although this week 's eu summit will confirm that the doors remain open to turkey and western balkan states if they are willing to match the bloc 's criteria , leaders are expected to confirm a slowdown in plans for further expansion following the entry of romania and bulgaria . in keeping with that expected tone , merkel said that countries such as albania , bosnia , serbia and macedonia have a " prospect of membership ... but we know that the perspective is a medium-term one . " merkel also mapped out a number of issues that germany would tackle as eu president .
the chancellor said that germany would make energy security , research and development , education and cutting back red tape priorities . merkel also spoke of the eu 's role on the global stage .
she said that the eu needed to speak in unison " with a strong voice " when dealing with international crises , citing iran and the situation in the middle east . middle east peace a priority for europe " we face enormous problems in the middle east , " merkel said , adding that germany hoped to breathe new life into the mid-east quartet of the eu , the us , the un and russia , which has been seeking to mediate in the conflict between israel and the palestinians , and hezbollah in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's trip to syria was part of an engagement policy merkel defended the decision to send foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to syria by saying " unusual steps " were part of the search for peace in the middle east .
she added that germany balanced a " readiness for dialogue " in principle with countries such as syria and iran with " clear principles and values . " while criticizing syria , germany has sought to draw it into talks designed to solve the region 's problems .
steinmeier visited damascus last week and pressed syria to use its influence to moderate the demands of the hezbollah militant group , which fought a war with israel in the summer and is seeking the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de readying for eu role , merkel pushes values germany 's angela merkel said reminding europeans of their common values is the key to creating a feeling of unity in the 25 nation bloc .

" the aim is to confirm a common understanding on the future of the enlargement process , " finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , hosting the summit as eu president , said in an invitation to his fellow leaders . before dinner , vanhanen will present an analysis on the constitution , which was meant to help the eu run more smoothly as it grows , until it was rejected by french and dutch voters in referendums last year . enlargement fatigue setting in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expansion in the eu has left bloc members exhausted those votes , due in part to fears of " enlargement fatigue " and the idea of a large , relatively poor and mainly muslim country like turkey joining , sent the union spiraling into its worst ever crisis . an eu official said that " the level of ambition is weak " at the moment on enlargement , as the member countries know that any concrete proposals could be put on the back burner until the eu 's " institutional " house is put in order . in any case , the leaders are expected to concede that the impasse over the constitution must end before new members are considered beyond bulgaria and romania . the german eu presidency , starting on january 1 , is expected to take forward the process , with no real decisions expected before france takes over the helm in the second half of 2008 . however , a study released thursday suggested that it would be in germany 's interest to promote further enlargement . according to a study commissioned by the german economy ministry , germany , the eurozone 's largest economy , had already largely profited from the extension of the eu from 15 to 25 nations in may 2004 .
the study said that enlargement had boosted germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by around one percentage point , and that the benefits would continue as the bloc expands further . germans plan to revive constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is at a dead end over the constitution in regard to the eu constitution , german chancellor angela merkel said thursday that it would be a " historical failure " if agreement on a constitutional treaty was not struck before european elections in 2009 . the chancellor said that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " whatever the outcome here , the leaders ' stance will have major repercussions for turkey , which began membership talks last year , but also for eu candidates like croatia and macedonia and other hopefuls in the balkans . british prime minister tony blair , a strong supporter of ankara 's candidacy , is expected to travel to ankara after the summit ends on friday in a gesture of solidarity . other points of order include the increasingly high-profile issue of sustainable energy supply , but the real initiatives on that subject are also expected to be taken by germany . serbia creeps up eu agenda with turkey resolved for now and nobody keen to wade too far into the issue of institutional reform , one other issue is looming as a possible bone of contention , in what is likely to be a quiet and short summit , that of serbia . the eu froze in may a stabilization and association agreement - a first step toward joining the eu - over serbia 's failure to hand over former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic to the un war crimes court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi is pushing for talks with belgrade to resume italian prime minister romano prodi is expected to ask his counterparts to lift the eu 's condition of full cooperation with the court for the talks with belgrade to resume . but britain and others oppose this idea and most would prefer to reassess ties with belgrade , and the situation in the breakaway province of kosovo , after serbia 's january elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel rallies eu for challenges ahead in germany 's presidency german chancellor angela merkel used a speech to the german bundestag to urge europe to work together to meet the challenges coming its way during germany 's six-month eu presidency .

" the aim of this function was to spread national socialist ideology , " said the court in a statement . hundreds of oil paintings , etchings and drawings were allegedly confiscated from gustav schuster , who was director of the chemitz women 's clinic , during the second world war . the artworks , which include paintings by ludwig richter , max liebermann and max klinger , are worth at least 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 662,550 -rrb- . the decision , had it have been different , could have opened the doors to thousands of other claims for compensation for artworks , property and other goods confiscated from 1945 to 1949 by the soviet forces which occupied the eastern part of germany after wwii . as it is , legal experts say the ruling could set a different precedent and negatively affect similar restitution claims that could number into the thousands , according to the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , which quoted an official from the german finance ministry . nazis are n't eligible for compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soviets troops in eastern germany seized large numbers of properties and goods the german " compensation and just satisfaction act " law , which was passed in 1994 , exempts the state from paying compensation if the person from who the goods were confiscated " extensively " supported the nazi regime , or had committed " crimes against humanity . " this can give rise to the problem that heirs are disinclined to probe deeply into their family 's background . the süddeutsche zeitung reported that the lawyers for schuster 's family have presented the court with documents showing that there were 14,427 senior positions in the nazi regime at the municipal level . the family argues that as one under thousands , dr. schuster therefore was only responsible for 0.006 percent of what occurred . however , according to the süddeutsche zeitung , there is not doubt that schuster was jointly responsible for deciding on , and conducting , the forced sterilization of dozens of women . the newspaper quotes the example of a similar court decision made in october when the son of a lawyer for the nazi regime was awarded compensation for two properties confiscated from his family . only after the court case , was it revealed that the lawyer was probably involved in the hanging of a deserter in the last days of the war . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de holocaust survivors in austria to finally receive compensation austria will at last begin handing out its final compensation payments to jewish survivors of the holocaust this month , 60 years after the end of world war ii , thanks to a recent concluding legal arrangement in the us .

" the aim is to confirm a common understanding on the future of the enlargement process , " finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , hosting the summit as eu president , said in an invitation to his fellow leaders . before dinner , vanhanen will present an analysis on the constitution , which was meant to help the eu run more smoothly as it grows , until it was rejected by french and dutch voters in referendums last year . enlargement fatigue setting in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expansion in the eu has left bloc members exhausted those votes , due in part to fears of " enlargement fatigue " and the idea of a large , relatively poor and mainly muslim country like turkey joining , sent the union spiraling into its worst ever crisis . an eu official said that " the level of ambition is weak " at the moment on enlargement , as the member countries know that any concrete proposals could be put on the back burner until the eu 's " institutional " house is put in order . in any case , the leaders are expected to concede that the impasse over the constitution must end before new members are considered beyond bulgaria and romania . the german eu presidency , starting on january 1 , is expected to take forward the process , with no real decisions expected before france takes over the helm in the second half of 2008 . however , a study released thursday suggested that it would be in germany 's interest to promote further enlargement . according to a study commissioned by the german economy ministry , germany , the eurozone 's largest economy , had already largely profited from the extension of the eu from 15 to 25 nations in may 2004 .
the study said that enlargement had boosted germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by around one percentage point , and that the benefits would continue as the bloc expands further . germans plan to revive constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is at a dead end over the constitution in regard to the eu constitution , german chancellor angela merkel said thursday that it would be a " historical failure " if agreement on a constitutional treaty was not struck before european elections in 2009 . the chancellor said that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " whatever the outcome here , the leaders ' stance will have major repercussions for turkey , which began membership talks last year , but also for eu candidates like croatia and macedonia and other hopefuls in the balkans . british prime minister tony blair , a strong supporter of ankara 's candidacy , is expected to travel to ankara after the summit ends on friday in a gesture of solidarity . other points of order include the increasingly high-profile issue of sustainable energy supply , but the real initiatives on that subject are also expected to be taken by germany . serbia creeps up eu agenda with turkey resolved for now and nobody keen to wade too far into the issue of institutional reform , one other issue is looming as a possible bone of contention , in what is likely to be a quiet and short summit , that of serbia . the eu froze in may a stabilization and association agreement - a first step toward joining the eu - over serbia 's failure to hand over former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic to the un war crimes court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi is pushing for talks with belgrade to resume italian prime minister romano prodi is expected to ask his counterparts to lift the eu 's condition of full cooperation with the court for the talks with belgrade to resume . but britain and others oppose this idea and most would prefer to reassess ties with belgrade , and the situation in the breakaway province of kosovo , after serbia 's january elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel rallies eu for challenges ahead in germany 's presidency german chancellor angela merkel used a speech to the german bundestag to urge europe to work together to meet the challenges coming its way during germany 's six-month eu presidency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 14.12.2006 what does it mean to be poor in wealthy germany ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for life - thank you , " reads the sign this month ’ s publication of a new report on poverty in europe has attempted to prize open a nation of resolutely blind eyes to a harsh reality of life in contemporary germany : life on the breadline . poverty is a moveable famine .
in a world where one man ’ s penury is another man ’ s wealth , geographical location dictates what constitutes destitution .
and although on paper , germany is one of the world 's wealthier nations , it is nonetheless home to throngs of people struggling to make ends meet .
what is more , if the findings in the federal statistics office ’ s “ life in europe ” report are anything to go by , millions more are at risk of becoming officially “ poor . ”
the breadline quoted in the report is 856 euros -lrb- $ 1,135 -rrb- for a person living alone and 1,798 euros for a family with two children .
in reality , however , many people are already living below it . so how does poverty look in this highly developed country ?
outsiders looking into germany are often stunned at the generosity of the social welfare system , and while it is doubtless among the most charitable of its kind , being at the bottom of the financial ladder of any society is never going to be a pleasant place to be .
eyes wide shut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food stocks for the needy brother antonius of a berlin franciscan monastery , who reports a steady increase in the number of " ordinary " germans coming to the daily soup kitchen since it set up 15 years ago , says the worst thing about being poor is the isolation it brings with it . “ people don ’ t need to read reports , but just have to open their eyes and their ears to realize that we have a poverty issue here .
but they do n't look because they don ’ t want to accept the struggles going on around them , ” he said . “ when you are poor , you ’ re on your own and likely as not you have endless amounts of time to kill . ”
for millions , being poor in germany is intrinsically connected to the persistent problem of high unemployment . under the hartz iv social welfare program introduced by the schröder administration to ensure the long-term unemployed a basic level of financial security , a single claimant is entitled to 345 euros monthly and couples to 311 euros each .
for families with children , there is a supplementary payment of between 207 and 276 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
in addition , the government foots rental bills - the amount depends upon average local housing costs - and most heating bills .
scrimping is frustrating bert hansen is out-of-work bookkeeper , husband and father who tops up his benefit payments with a so-called one-euro job , which allows claimants to earn a maximum of 180 euros monthly for a 30-hour working week .
even then , he says , it ’ s not easy . “ there are so many things which you can ’ t do without money and that makes you feel shut out .
we have fewer choices even when it comes to simple things like buying diapers , hygiene items and food . while society talks about the benefits of eating organic , we have no option but to go to discount supermarkets . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discount supermarkets are big business and while he tries to make the most of his situation , and has decided to help others who share his lot by working for his hourly euro in a soup kitchen and in a berlin church , hansen says it is “ frustrating ” to be constantly scrimping .
brother antonius believes it is an inability in many german families to manage what money they have , which feeds the problem of poverty . “ families come to us asking for food for breakfast and dinner , and we are supposed to report them to the authorities on the basis that the government provides a family allowance to provide food for the children , " he said .
" but the money gets spent on other things . ” he says too many people buckle too easily under the weight of advertising , interest-free credit deals and peer pressure . “ it might be a cliché to say this , but these days everybody wants to have everything , and the money to pay for it has to come from somewhere , ” he said .
time for non-monetary values bert hansen agrees that it is hard , particularly for young people , to live in a society so driven by consumerism without falling prey to its dazzling enticements . “ many parents are helpless , they can ’ t argue with their kids , can ’ t tell them when they can ’ t afford things , ” he said . the upshot is debt and a greater struggle with what money they do have .

in a world where one man ’ s penury is another man ’ s wealth , geographical location dictates what constitutes destitution .
and although on paper , germany is one of the world 's wealthier nations , it is nonetheless home to throngs of people struggling to make ends meet .
what is more , if the findings in the federal statistics office ’ s “ life in europe ” report are anything to go by , millions more are at risk of becoming officially “ poor . ”
the breadline quoted in the report is 856 euros -lrb- $ 1,135 -rrb- for a person living alone and 1,798 euros for a family with two children .
in reality , however , many people are already living below it . so how does poverty look in this highly developed country ?
outsiders looking into germany are often stunned at the generosity of the social welfare system , and while it is doubtless among the most charitable of its kind , being at the bottom of the financial ladder of any society is never going to be a pleasant place to be .
eyes wide shut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food stocks for the needy brother antonius of a berlin franciscan monastery , who reports a steady increase in the number of " ordinary " germans coming to the daily soup kitchen since it set up 15 years ago , says the worst thing about being poor is the isolation it brings with it . “ people don ’ t need to read reports , but just have to open their eyes and their ears to realize that we have a poverty issue here .
but they do n't look because they don ’ t want to accept the struggles going on around them , ” he said . “ when you are poor , you ’ re on your own and likely as not you have endless amounts of time to kill . ”
for millions , being poor in germany is intrinsically connected to the persistent problem of high unemployment . under the hartz iv social welfare program introduced by the schröder administration to ensure the long-term unemployed a basic level of financial security , a single claimant is entitled to 345 euros monthly and couples to 311 euros each .
for families with children , there is a supplementary payment of between 207 and 276 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
in addition , the government foots rental bills - the amount depends upon average local housing costs - and most heating bills .
scrimping is frustrating bert hansen is out-of-work bookkeeper , husband and father who tops up his benefit payments with a so-called one-euro job , which allows claimants to earn a maximum of 180 euros monthly for a 30-hour working week .
even then , he says , it ’ s not easy . “ there are so many things which you can ’ t do without money and that makes you feel shut out .
we have fewer choices even when it comes to simple things like buying diapers , hygiene items and food . while society talks about the benefits of eating organic , we have no option but to go to discount supermarkets . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discount supermarkets are big business and while he tries to make the most of his situation , and has decided to help others who share his lot by working for his hourly euro in a soup kitchen and in a berlin church , hansen says it is “ frustrating ” to be constantly scrimping .
brother antonius believes it is an inability in many german families to manage what money they have , which feeds the problem of poverty . “ families come to us asking for food for breakfast and dinner , and we are supposed to report them to the authorities on the basis that the government provides a family allowance to provide food for the children , " he said .
" but the money gets spent on other things . ” he says too many people buckle too easily under the weight of advertising , interest-free credit deals and peer pressure . “ it might be a cliché to say this , but these days everybody wants to have everything , and the money to pay for it has to come from somewhere , ” he said .
time for non-monetary values bert hansen agrees that it is hard , particularly for young people , to live in a society so driven by consumerism without falling prey to its dazzling enticements . “ many parents are helpless , they can ’ t argue with their kids , can ’ t tell them when they can ’ t afford things , ” he said . the upshot is debt and a greater struggle with what money they do have .

" i would consider it an historical failure if we do not succeed in working out the substance of the constitutional treaty by the time the next european elections take place , " merkel said in her speech , which was meant to set out the aims of germany 's eu presidency which starts in january . the chancellor added that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " merkel acknowledged that the issue of the constitution would not be settled by the end of germany 's turn at the eu helm but said she hoped that with its support the treaty would be revived and put back on track . " we have the task at the end of our presidency to set a roadmap " for the future implementation of the constitution , she said . the constitution was designed to provide the institutional framework for an eu which will grow to 27 member states when bulgaria and romania join on jan.1.
but it suffered a severe blow when french and dutch voters rejected it last year . merkel : united we stand , divided we fall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags stand together but how close are the eu nations on the subjects that matter ?
merkel also urged eu states to work closer together , saying that a united europe could achieve success , but a divided europe would weaken the strength of the bloc . on the thorny issue of turkey 's bid for eu membership , which is expected to be tackled yet again during the summit in brussels , merkel said that the eu had decided on a " resolute but prudent " course of action in its standoff with turkey over cyprus . " the eu has reacted -lrb- to turkey -rrb- , in my opinion , in a way that is both resolute and prudent … prudent in that it is always made clear to turkey that is worth it to continue working on reforms , " merkel said . eu leaders were expected during the summit to endorse a decision made by their foreign ministers earlier this week which partially froze turkey 's membership talks due to its refusal to implement a 2005 deal to open its ports to cyprus . " this is not a small matter , " merkel said .
" candidates for membership and eu member states must recognize each other politically and diplomatically . " eu to put brakes on further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although this week 's eu summit will confirm that the doors remain open to turkey and western balkan states if they are willing to match the bloc 's criteria , leaders are expected to confirm a slowdown in plans for further expansion following the entry of romania and bulgaria . in keeping with that expected tone , merkel said that countries such as albania , bosnia , serbia and macedonia have a " prospect of membership ... but we know that the perspective is a medium-term one . " merkel also mapped out a number of issues that germany would tackle as eu president .
the chancellor said that germany would make energy security , research and development , education and cutting back red tape priorities . merkel also spoke of the eu 's role on the global stage .
she said that the eu needed to speak in unison " with a strong voice " when dealing with international crises , citing iran and the situation in the middle east . middle east peace a priority for europe " we face enormous problems in the middle east , " merkel said , adding that germany hoped to breathe new life into the mid-east quartet of the eu , the us , the un and russia , which has been seeking to mediate in the conflict between israel and the palestinians , and hezbollah in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's trip to syria was part of an engagement policy merkel defended the decision to send foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to syria by saying " unusual steps " were part of the search for peace in the middle east .
she added that germany balanced a " readiness for dialogue " in principle with countries such as syria and iran with " clear principles and values . " while criticizing syria , germany has sought to draw it into talks designed to solve the region 's problems .

" the aim is to confirm a common understanding on the future of the enlargement process , " finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , hosting the summit as eu president , said in an invitation to his fellow leaders . before dinner , vanhanen will present an analysis on the constitution , which was meant to help the eu run more smoothly as it grows , until it was rejected by french and dutch voters in referendums last year . enlargement fatigue setting in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expansion in the eu has left bloc members exhausted those votes , due in part to fears of " enlargement fatigue " and the idea of a large , relatively poor and mainly muslim country like turkey joining , sent the union spiraling into its worst ever crisis . an eu official said that " the level of ambition is weak " at the moment on enlargement , as the member countries know that any concrete proposals could be put on the back burner until the eu 's " institutional " house is put in order . in any case , the leaders are expected to concede that the impasse over the constitution must end before new members are considered beyond bulgaria and romania . the german eu presidency , starting on january 1 , is expected to take forward the process , with no real decisions expected before france takes over the helm in the second half of 2008 . however , a study released thursday suggested that it would be in germany 's interest to promote further enlargement . according to a study commissioned by the german economy ministry , germany , the eurozone 's largest economy , had already largely profited from the extension of the eu from 15 to 25 nations in may 2004 .
the study said that enlargement had boosted germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by around one percentage point , and that the benefits would continue as the bloc expands further . germans plan to revive constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is at a dead end over the constitution in regard to the eu constitution , german chancellor angela merkel said thursday that it would be a " historical failure " if agreement on a constitutional treaty was not struck before european elections in 2009 . the chancellor said that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " whatever the outcome here , the leaders ' stance will have major repercussions for turkey , which began membership talks last year , but also for eu candidates like croatia and macedonia and other hopefuls in the balkans . british prime minister tony blair , a strong supporter of ankara 's candidacy , is expected to travel to ankara after the summit ends on friday in a gesture of solidarity . other points of order include the increasingly high-profile issue of sustainable energy supply , but the real initiatives on that subject are also expected to be taken by germany . serbia creeps up eu agenda with turkey resolved for now and nobody keen to wade too far into the issue of institutional reform , one other issue is looming as a possible bone of contention , in what is likely to be a quiet and short summit , that of serbia . the eu froze in may a stabilization and association agreement - a first step toward joining the eu - over serbia 's failure to hand over former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic to the un war crimes court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi is pushing for talks with belgrade to resume italian prime minister romano prodi is expected to ask his counterparts to lift the eu 's condition of full cooperation with the court for the talks with belgrade to resume . but britain and others oppose this idea and most would prefer to reassess ties with belgrade , and the situation in the breakaway province of kosovo , after serbia 's january elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel rallies eu for challenges ahead in germany 's presidency german chancellor angela merkel used a speech to the german bundestag to urge europe to work together to meet the challenges coming its way during germany 's six-month eu presidency .

" the aim is to confirm a common understanding on the future of the enlargement process , " finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , hosting the summit as eu president , said in an invitation to his fellow leaders . before dinner , vanhanen will present an analysis on the constitution , which was meant to help the eu run more smoothly as it grows , until it was rejected by french and dutch voters in referendums last year . enlargement fatigue setting in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expansion in the eu has left bloc members exhausted those votes , due in part to fears of " enlargement fatigue " and the idea of a large , relatively poor and mainly muslim country like turkey joining , sent the union spiraling into its worst ever crisis . an eu official said that " the level of ambition is weak " at the moment on enlargement , as the member countries know that any concrete proposals could be put on the back burner until the eu 's " institutional " house is put in order . in any case , the leaders are expected to concede that the impasse over the constitution must end before new members are considered beyond bulgaria and romania . the german eu presidency , starting on january 1 , is expected to take forward the process , with no real decisions expected before france takes over the helm in the second half of 2008 . however , a study released thursday suggested that it would be in germany 's interest to promote further enlargement . according to a study commissioned by the german economy ministry , germany , the eurozone 's largest economy , had already largely profited from the extension of the eu from 15 to 25 nations in may 2004 .
the study said that enlargement had boosted germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by around one percentage point , and that the benefits would continue as the bloc expands further . germans plan to revive constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is at a dead end over the constitution in regard to the eu constitution , german chancellor angela merkel said thursday that it would be a " historical failure " if agreement on a constitutional treaty was not struck before european elections in 2009 . the chancellor said that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " whatever the outcome here , the leaders ' stance will have major repercussions for turkey , which began membership talks last year , but also for eu candidates like croatia and macedonia and other hopefuls in the balkans . british prime minister tony blair , a strong supporter of ankara 's candidacy , is expected to travel to ankara after the summit ends on friday in a gesture of solidarity . other points of order include the increasingly high-profile issue of sustainable energy supply , but the real initiatives on that subject are also expected to be taken by germany . serbia creeps up eu agenda with turkey resolved for now and nobody keen to wade too far into the issue of institutional reform , one other issue is looming as a possible bone of contention , in what is likely to be a quiet and short summit , that of serbia . the eu froze in may a stabilization and association agreement - a first step toward joining the eu - over serbia 's failure to hand over former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic to the un war crimes court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi is pushing for talks with belgrade to resume italian prime minister romano prodi is expected to ask his counterparts to lift the eu 's condition of full cooperation with the court for the talks with belgrade to resume . but britain and others oppose this idea and most would prefer to reassess ties with belgrade , and the situation in the breakaway province of kosovo , after serbia 's january elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel rallies eu for challenges ahead in germany 's presidency german chancellor angela merkel used a speech to the german bundestag to urge europe to work together to meet the challenges coming its way during germany 's six-month eu presidency .

mederake , who had a previous conviction for raping a 14-year-old in 1999 , had admitted kidnapping and holding the then 13-year-old girl named stephanie captive as well as repeatedly raping her over a five-week period beginning in january . " we have always said that a punishment bordering on the maximum sentence followed by preventative detention was possible , " christian avenarius , a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office , said on thursday .
" we wish stephanie and her family all the best and that she is able to find peace . " during the trial , the prosecutors showed a wooden box mederake locked stephanie in when he left the apartment where he held her captive . " the defendant kidnapped her to satisfy his demands , mainly of a sexual nature , for a period without end , " said presiding judge tom maciejewski .
" every day he performed humiliating sexual acts on her . " she was only freed by police when she managed to drop a scrap of paper in the street that carried a desperate plea for help and the address where she was being imprisoned scrawled in red pen . mentally fit to stand trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mederake stayed on the court building 's roof for 20 hours stephanie , now 14 years old , did not testify in the trial after a psychologist 's certificate said she was too frightened to face mederake in court .
another analysis declared mederake mentally capable of standing trial and said he continued to pose a threat to society . her family voiced relief outside the court on thursday . " it has helped stephanie that the trial has been in the public eye , " stephanie 's father , joachim rudolph , told journalists .
" we are one hundred percent relieved .
we will now try to have a good christmas and take things step by step . " after testimony in the case concluded on tuesday , mederake asked stephanie , who he kidnapped on her way to school , and her family for forgiveness . defense lawyer andreas boine , chose not comment on the sentence , but said he would consult with his client . police slip-ups prolonged trial in a dramatic turn in the case , mederake , escaped from warders in november and climbed onto a prison roof where he remained for about 20 hours . when the trial continued , it detailed several other police blunders including how authorities overlooked the fact that the pedophile lived a few blocks from the kidnapped girl 's home and how indecisive officers spent two hours outside the locked door of the dresden apartment where stephanie was imprisoned . " we thought no one was at home , " a detective testified , describing the feb .
15 arrest .
it was decided to pick the lock and quietly inspect the place so that mederake would not notice .
when a locksmith set to work , mederake opened the door . mederake told the court he had used the two hours to phone his own 12-year-old daughter and say goodbye before his impending arrest . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians propose internet registry for sex offenders after a 39-year-old woman was recently raped and murdered in bayreuth by a repeated sex offender , both liberal and conservative politicians have recommended starting an internet registry based on the us model .

" the aim of this function was to spread national socialist ideology , " said the court in a statement . hundreds of oil paintings , etchings and drawings were allegedly confiscated from gustav schuster , who was director of the chemitz women 's clinic , during the second world war . the artworks , which include paintings by ludwig richter , max liebermann and max klinger , are worth at least 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 662,550 -rrb- . the decision , had it have been different , could have opened the doors to thousands of other claims for compensation for artworks , property and other goods confiscated from 1945 to 1949 by the soviet forces which occupied the eastern part of germany after wwii . as it is , legal experts say the ruling could set a different precedent and negatively affect similar restitution claims that could number into the thousands , according to the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , which quoted an official from the german finance ministry . nazis are n't eligible for compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soviets troops in eastern germany seized large numbers of properties and goods the german " compensation and just satisfaction act " law , which was passed in 1994 , exempts the state from paying compensation if the person from who the goods were confiscated " extensively " supported the nazi regime , or had committed " crimes against humanity . " this can give rise to the problem that heirs are disinclined to probe deeply into their family 's background . the süddeutsche zeitung reported that the lawyers for schuster 's family have presented the court with documents showing that there were 14,427 senior positions in the nazi regime at the municipal level . the family argues that as one under thousands , dr. schuster therefore was only responsible for 0.006 percent of what occurred . however , according to the süddeutsche zeitung , there is not doubt that schuster was jointly responsible for deciding on , and conducting , the forced sterilization of dozens of women . the newspaper quotes the example of a similar court decision made in october when the son of a lawyer for the nazi regime was awarded compensation for two properties confiscated from his family . only after the court case , was it revealed that the lawyer was probably involved in the hanging of a deserter in the last days of the war . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de holocaust survivors in austria to finally receive compensation austria will at last begin handing out its final compensation payments to jewish survivors of the holocaust this month , 60 years after the end of world war ii , thanks to a recent concluding legal arrangement in the us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 14.12.2006 merkel rallies eu for challenges ahead in germany 's presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is eager to get her hands on the eu 's presidency german chancellor angela merkel used a speech to the german bundestag to urge europe to work together to meet the challenges coming its way during germany 's six-month eu presidency . on the morning before european union leaders meet for a two-day summit in brussels to discuss the bloc 's enlargement process , merkel told members of germany 's lower house of parliament that it would be an " historical failure " if an agreement on the ailing eu constitution was not struck before european elections in 2009 . " i would consider it an historical failure if we do not succeed in working out the substance of the constitutional treaty by the time the next european elections take place , " merkel said in her speech , which was meant to set out the aims of germany 's eu presidency which starts in january . the chancellor added that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " merkel acknowledged that the issue of the constitution would not be settled by the end of germany 's turn at the eu helm but said she hoped that with its support the treaty would be revived and put back on track . " we have the task at the end of our presidency to set a roadmap " for the future implementation of the constitution , she said . the constitution was designed to provide the institutional framework for an eu which will grow to 27 member states when bulgaria and romania join on jan.1.
but it suffered a severe blow when french and dutch voters rejected it last year . merkel : united we stand , divided we fall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags stand together but how close are the eu nations on the subjects that matter ?
merkel also urged eu states to work closer together , saying that a united europe could achieve success , but a divided europe would weaken the strength of the bloc . on the thorny issue of turkey 's bid for eu membership , which is expected to be tackled yet again during the summit in brussels , merkel said that the eu had decided on a " resolute but prudent " course of action in its standoff with turkey over cyprus . " the eu has reacted -lrb- to turkey -rrb- , in my opinion , in a way that is both resolute and prudent … prudent in that it is always made clear to turkey that is worth it to continue working on reforms , " merkel said . eu leaders were expected during the summit to endorse a decision made by their foreign ministers earlier this week which partially froze turkey 's membership talks due to its refusal to implement a 2005 deal to open its ports to cyprus . " this is not a small matter , " merkel said .
" candidates for membership and eu member states must recognize each other politically and diplomatically . " eu to put brakes on further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although this week 's eu summit will confirm that the doors remain open to turkey and western balkan states if they are willing to match the bloc 's criteria , leaders are expected to confirm a slowdown in plans for further expansion following the entry of romania and bulgaria . in keeping with that expected tone , merkel said that countries such as albania , bosnia , serbia and macedonia have a " prospect of membership ... but we know that the perspective is a medium-term one . " merkel also mapped out a number of issues that germany would tackle as eu president .
the chancellor said that germany would make energy security , research and development , education and cutting back red tape priorities . merkel also spoke of the eu 's role on the global stage .
she said that the eu needed to speak in unison " with a strong voice " when dealing with international crises , citing iran and the situation in the middle east . middle east peace a priority for europe " we face enormous problems in the middle east , " merkel said , adding that germany hoped to breathe new life into the mid-east quartet of the eu , the us , the un and russia , which has been seeking to mediate in the conflict between israel and the palestinians , and hezbollah in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's trip to syria was part of an engagement policy merkel defended the decision to send foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to syria by saying " unusual steps " were part of the search for peace in the middle east .
she added that germany balanced a " readiness for dialogue " in principle with countries such as syria and iran with " clear principles and values . " while criticizing syria , germany has sought to draw it into talks designed to solve the region 's problems .
steinmeier visited damascus last week and pressed syria to use its influence to moderate the demands of the hezbollah militant group , which fought a war with israel in the summer and is seeking the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de readying for eu role , merkel pushes values germany 's angela merkel said reminding europeans of their common values is the key to creating a feeling of unity in the 25 nation bloc .

" i would consider it an historical failure if we do not succeed in working out the substance of the constitutional treaty by the time the next european elections take place , " merkel said in her speech , which was meant to set out the aims of germany 's eu presidency which starts in january . the chancellor added that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force .

" the eu has reacted -lrb- to turkey -rrb- , in my opinion , in a way that is both resolute and prudent … prudent in that it is always made clear to turkey that is worth it to continue working on reforms , " merkel said . eu leaders were expected during the summit to endorse a decision made by their foreign ministers earlier this week which partially froze turkey 's membership talks due to its refusal to implement a 2005 deal to open its ports to cyprus .

the study said that enlargement had boosted germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by around one percentage point , and that the benefits would continue as the bloc expands further . germans plan to revive constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is at a dead end over the constitution in regard to the eu constitution , german chancellor angela merkel said thursday that it would be a " historical failure " if agreement on a constitutional treaty was not struck before european elections in 2009 . the chancellor said that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " whatever the outcome here , the leaders ' stance will have major repercussions for turkey , which began membership talks last year , but also for eu candidates like croatia and macedonia and other hopefuls in the balkans . british prime minister tony blair , a strong supporter of ankara 's candidacy , is expected to travel to ankara after the summit ends on friday in a gesture of solidarity . other points of order include the increasingly high-profile issue of sustainable energy supply , but the real initiatives on that subject are also expected to be taken by germany . serbia creeps up eu agenda with turkey resolved for now and nobody keen to wade too far into the issue of institutional reform , one other issue is looming as a possible bone of contention , in what is likely to be a quiet and short summit , that of serbia . the eu froze in may a stabilization and association agreement - a first step toward joining the eu - over serbia 's failure to hand over former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic to the un war crimes court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi is pushing for talks with belgrade to resume italian prime minister romano prodi is expected to ask his counterparts to lift the eu 's condition of full cooperation with the court for the talks with belgrade to resume . but britain and others oppose this idea and most would prefer to reassess ties with belgrade , and the situation in the breakaway province of kosovo , after serbia 's january elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel rallies eu for challenges ahead in germany 's presidency german chancellor angela merkel used a speech to the german bundestag to urge europe to work together to meet the challenges coming its way during germany 's six-month eu presidency .

" i would consider it an historical failure if we do not succeed in working out the substance of the constitutional treaty by the time the next european elections take place , " merkel said in her speech , which was meant to set out the aims of germany 's eu presidency which starts in january . the chancellor added that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " merkel acknowledged that the issue of the constitution would not be settled by the end of germany 's turn at the eu helm but said she hoped that with its support the treaty would be revived and put back on track . " we have the task at the end of our presidency to set a roadmap " for the future implementation of the constitution , she said . the constitution was designed to provide the institutional framework for an eu which will grow to 27 member states when bulgaria and romania join on jan.1.
but it suffered a severe blow when french and dutch voters rejected it last year . merkel : united we stand , divided we fall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags stand together but how close are the eu nations on the subjects that matter ?
merkel also urged eu states to work closer together , saying that a united europe could achieve success , but a divided europe would weaken the strength of the bloc . on the thorny issue of turkey 's bid for eu membership , which is expected to be tackled yet again during the summit in brussels , merkel said that the eu had decided on a " resolute but prudent " course of action in its standoff with turkey over cyprus . " the eu has reacted -lrb- to turkey -rrb- , in my opinion , in a way that is both resolute and prudent … prudent in that it is always made clear to turkey that is worth it to continue working on reforms , " merkel said . eu leaders were expected during the summit to endorse a decision made by their foreign ministers earlier this week which partially froze turkey 's membership talks due to its refusal to implement a 2005 deal to open its ports to cyprus . " this is not a small matter , " merkel said .
" candidates for membership and eu member states must recognize each other politically and diplomatically . " eu to put brakes on further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although this week 's eu summit will confirm that the doors remain open to turkey and western balkan states if they are willing to match the bloc 's criteria , leaders are expected to confirm a slowdown in plans for further expansion following the entry of romania and bulgaria . in keeping with that expected tone , merkel said that countries such as albania , bosnia , serbia and macedonia have a " prospect of membership ... but we know that the perspective is a medium-term one . " merkel also mapped out a number of issues that germany would tackle as eu president .
the chancellor said that germany would make energy security , research and development , education and cutting back red tape priorities . merkel also spoke of the eu 's role on the global stage .
she said that the eu needed to speak in unison " with a strong voice " when dealing with international crises , citing iran and the situation in the middle east . middle east peace a priority for europe " we face enormous problems in the middle east , " merkel said , adding that germany hoped to breathe new life into the mid-east quartet of the eu , the us , the un and russia , which has been seeking to mediate in the conflict between israel and the palestinians , and hezbollah in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's trip to syria was part of an engagement policy merkel defended the decision to send foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to syria by saying " unusual steps " were part of the search for peace in the middle east .
she added that germany balanced a " readiness for dialogue " in principle with countries such as syria and iran with " clear principles and values . " while criticizing syria , germany has sought to draw it into talks designed to solve the region 's problems .
steinmeier visited damascus last week and pressed syria to use its influence to moderate the demands of the hezbollah militant group , which fought a war with israel in the summer and is seeking the resignation of lebanon 's western-backed government . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de readying for eu role , merkel pushes values germany 's angela merkel said reminding europeans of their common values is the key to creating a feeling of unity in the 25 nation bloc .

" the aim is to confirm a common understanding on the future of the enlargement process , " finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , hosting the summit as eu president , said in an invitation to his fellow leaders . before dinner , vanhanen will present an analysis on the constitution , which was meant to help the eu run more smoothly as it grows , until it was rejected by french and dutch voters in referendums last year . enlargement fatigue setting in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expansion in the eu has left bloc members exhausted those votes , due in part to fears of " enlargement fatigue " and the idea of a large , relatively poor and mainly muslim country like turkey joining , sent the union spiraling into its worst ever crisis . an eu official said that " the level of ambition is weak " at the moment on enlargement , as the member countries know that any concrete proposals could be put on the back burner until the eu 's " institutional " house is put in order . in any case , the leaders are expected to concede that the impasse over the constitution must end before new members are considered beyond bulgaria and romania . the german eu presidency , starting on january 1 , is expected to take forward the process , with no real decisions expected before france takes over the helm in the second half of 2008 . however , a study released thursday suggested that it would be in germany 's interest to promote further enlargement . according to a study commissioned by the german economy ministry , germany , the eurozone 's largest economy , had already largely profited from the extension of the eu from 15 to 25 nations in may 2004 .
the study said that enlargement had boosted germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by around one percentage point , and that the benefits would continue as the bloc expands further . germans plan to revive constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is at a dead end over the constitution in regard to the eu constitution , german chancellor angela merkel said thursday that it would be a " historical failure " if agreement on a constitutional treaty was not struck before european elections in 2009 . the chancellor said that she and the german government would work " intensively " during the six-month presidency " so that such a treaty , based on our common values , can go into force . " whatever the outcome here , the leaders ' stance will have major repercussions for turkey , which began membership talks last year , but also for eu candidates like croatia and macedonia and other hopefuls in the balkans . british prime minister tony blair , a strong supporter of ankara 's candidacy , is expected to travel to ankara after the summit ends on friday in a gesture of solidarity . other points of order include the increasingly high-profile issue of sustainable energy supply , but the real initiatives on that subject are also expected to be taken by germany . serbia creeps up eu agenda with turkey resolved for now and nobody keen to wade too far into the issue of institutional reform , one other issue is looming as a possible bone of contention , in what is likely to be a quiet and short summit , that of serbia . the eu froze in may a stabilization and association agreement - a first step toward joining the eu - over serbia 's failure to hand over former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic to the un war crimes court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi is pushing for talks with belgrade to resume italian prime minister romano prodi is expected to ask his counterparts to lift the eu 's condition of full cooperation with the court for the talks with belgrade to resume . but britain and others oppose this idea and most would prefer to reassess ties with belgrade , and the situation in the breakaway province of kosovo , after serbia 's january elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel rallies eu for challenges ahead in germany 's presidency german chancellor angela merkel used a speech to the german bundestag to urge europe to work together to meet the challenges coming its way during germany 's six-month eu presidency .

chinese vice-premier wu yi said in her opening remarks that the us was failing to fully understand china .
us treasury secretary henry paulson accused china of holding down the value of its currency to boost exports , and urged " tangible results " in the talks .
last year the us had a record trade deficit with china , of more than $ 200bn -lrb- £ 101bn -rrb- .
mr paulson acknowledged " scepticism " in the us that the talks would produce substantive progress .
" therefore , it is incumbent upon us , not only to have frank and energetic discussions , but also to produce tangible results on the most important issues facing our two nations , " he said .
but ms wu hit back , accusing the us of a lack of understanding .
" we have had the genuine feeling that some american friends are not only having limited knowledge of , but harbouring much misunderstanding about the reality in china , " she said .
" this is not conducive to the sound development of our bilateral relations , " she added .
she said she hoped that the talks would enhance mutual trust and remove misgivings between the two sides .
' barriers ' the summit , which is being billed as a " strategic economic dialogue " , follows a range of commercial deals signed between the us and china .
key topics include currencies , access to markets and information piracy .
this week marks five years since china joined the world trade organization , but the us feels that china still has much to do to open its markets as required .
the delegation in beijing includes the federal reserve 's head ben bernanke and us trade representative susan schwab .
press mulls us-china talks the visit comes days after the us issued a report assessing china 's record in implementing requirements demanded by the wto .
" china has taken many important steps to implement its wto obligations , but on the fifth anniversary of its wto membership , china 's overall record is decidedly mixed , " said susan schwab following the report .
ms schwab also said some industries faced " frustrating barriers " when doing business in china , and highlighted concerns that china 's market liberalisation had been slowing down in the past year .
but analysts also say china has transformed into a far more sophisticated nation in the past five years - and that mr paulson and his mission will face a country that is more assertive in trade matters .
the trip comes amid mounting pressure for china to reform its currency , and a day after data showed that china has replaced mexico as the second largest trading partner with the us .
the us - the world 's largest economy - posted figures showing its deficit with china had risen by 6.1 % in october compared with the previous month .
critics blame the growing deficit with china largely on china 's currency , the yuan , being artificially weak .
this makes chinese exports to the us cheap in comparison with us goods .

the plan to reduce the troubled company 's debt to £ 2.84bn -lrb- $ 5.6bn -rrb- from the current level of £ 6.2bn has already secured the backing of other creditors .
if bondholders back the proposal later on thursday , the firm will be able to exit french bankruptcy protection .
the anglo-french firm ran up massive debts building the channel tunnel .
but since the tunnel opened in 1994 , car and freight numbers have failed to meet projections , and the resulting revenue shortfalls meant the debts could not be serviced as expected .
' realistic and balanced ' for the plan to be approved , bondholders representing at least half of the value of registered bonds must cast votes , and at least two-thirds of them must vote in favour .
key bondholders deutsche bank and the arco group have already pledged to vote for the plan .
whatever the result of thursday 's vote , eurotunnel may face a legal challenge from creditors opposed to the plan , such as oaktree capital management .
if the plan is rejected , the commercial court in paris may be forced to declare eurotunnel insolvent triggering a sale of its assets , although analysts say such an outcome is unlikely .
eurotunnel is currently operating under a so-called " safeguard procedure " - the french version of bankruptcy protection - on the direction of the commercial court in paris .
the firm has described its financial restructuring proposal as the " most realistic and balanced plan that can be imagined " .

if bondholders back the proposal later on thursday , the firm will be able to exit french bankruptcy protection .
the anglo-french firm ran up massive debts building the channel tunnel .
but since the tunnel opened in 1994 , car and freight numbers have failed to meet projections , and the resulting revenue shortfalls meant the debts could not be serviced as expected .
' realistic and balanced ' for the plan to be approved , bondholders representing at least half of the value of registered bonds must cast votes , and at least two-thirds of them must vote in favour .
key bondholders deutsche bank and the arco group have already pledged to vote for the plan .
whatever the result of thursday 's vote , eurotunnel may face a legal challenge from creditors opposed to the plan , such as oaktree capital management .
if the plan is rejected , the commercial court in paris may be forced to declare eurotunnel insolvent triggering a sale of its assets , although analysts say such an outcome is unlikely .
eurotunnel is currently operating under a so-called " safeguard procedure " - the french version of bankruptcy protection - on the direction of the commercial court in paris .
the firm has described its financial restructuring proposal as the " most realistic and balanced plan that can be imagined " .

the turtle was discovered on the sand at pembrey country park in carmarthenshire by a park ranger .
it is thought recent stormy weather sent the creature off course .
named pembrey , the turtle has been taken to the turtle rehabilitation facility in dorset to recover and will eventually be released into the wild .
rod penrose from marine environmental monitoring said he received a call from park ranger wyn parry who found the turtle and drove it to the rescue centre in weymouth .
" the water in the turtle 's holding tank will be raised 1c a day until it reaches 20c , at this temperature the internal organs should start to function and pembrey can start to be fed , " he explained .
" staff are hoping that pembrey , who 's gullet appeared on initial examination to be impacted with sand , will with treatment eventually recover and become fit enough to be released back to the wild in warm waters off the canary islands . "
he said that although the cold blooded loggerheads are seen in low numbers off the coast of wales each year , it is not native to uk waters .
" attracted by the warm gulf stream they can become forced off course by strong storms at sea and end up in our colder waters where they become cold and lethargic and can die , " he explained .
" with the recent persistent gale force winds it is possible that more marine animals may also strand .
" any whales , dolphins , porpoises or marine turtles found stranded around the welsh coastline should be reported immediately to the rspca or marine environmental monitoring , " he added .

" a british comedy award , quite a prize .

gwynedd council invited two companies to present cases for redeveloping glyn rhonwy quarry as a mountain bike centre or a ski complex .
but the council said there were fundamental weaknesses in both cases .
the companies - becio llanberis and adwy eryri - will now reconsider their plans to redevelop the 75-hectare -lrb- 185-acre -rrb- site .
the council working group said it was concerned whether there was a strong enough market in north wales to sustain the outdoor activities the companies are promoting .
councillor trefor edwards , chair of the working group , said : " we have here two exciting schemes for the area but unfortunately the evidence within the business cases as they stand is n't enough to convince us that the developments could be realised and that they would thrive .
what we have to do is create a new market - we need to bring more people in gwyn pritchard , adwy eryri " the glyn rhonwy site is a special asset to this area and it would be extremely irresponsible of us to earmark the land for a development without a robust business plan . "
mr edwards said bids from other companies would now also be invited .
becio llanberis - set up by a group of local bike enthusiasts - has said it wants to create britain 's best mountain biking venue .
and adwy eryri want to turn the quarry into a year-round leisure complex featuring britain 's longest ski slope .

gwynedd council invited two companies to present cases for redeveloping glyn rhonwy quarry as a mountain bike centre or a ski complex .
but the council said there were fundamental weaknesses in both cases .
the companies - becio llanberis and adwy eryri - will now reconsider their plans to redevelop the 75-hectare -lrb- 185-acre -rrb- site .
the council working group said it was concerned whether there was a strong enough market in north wales to sustain the outdoor activities the companies are promoting .
councillor trefor edwards , chair of the working group , said : " we have here two exciting schemes for the area but unfortunately the evidence within the business cases as they stand is n't enough to convince us that the developments could be realised and that they would thrive .
what we have to do is create a new market - we need to bring more people in gwyn pritchard , adwy eryri " the glyn rhonwy site is a special asset to this area and it would be extremely irresponsible of us to earmark the land for a development without a robust business plan . "
mr edwards said bids from other companies would now also be invited .
becio llanberis - set up by a group of local bike enthusiasts - has said it wants to create britain 's best mountain biking venue .
and adwy eryri want to turn the quarry into a year-round leisure complex featuring britain 's longest ski slope .
but gwyn pritchard , from adwy eryri , said he was confident he can alleviate some of the council 's anxieties .
new product he said : " what we have to do is create a new market - we need to bring more people in , not rely on the existing people coming in .

moray council , which has been co-ordinating the removal of the 43ft -lrb- 13m -rrb- carcass , said it had been cut up and taken away for incineration .
the whale 's 500lb -lrb- 226kg -rrb- lower jawbone had gone missing but has now been recovered by police .
experts said the mammal , found at roseisle , moray , most likely died from malnutrition .
the whale was cut into three pieces by abattoir staff on tuesday and then incinerated .
experts from the scottish agricultural college , who examined the whale at the scene , believed that the animal failed to find enough food moray council spokesman the scottish agricultural college -lrb- sac -rrb- has analysed the whale remains and determined that it was a 20-year-old male .
a moray council spokesman said : " early indications are that it died from malnutrition .
" experts from the scottish agricultural college , who examined the whale at the scene , believed that the animal failed to find enough food .
" its staple diet is giant squid . "
meanwhile , police said the jawbone was removed by people following a local custom of keeping the teeth as souvenirs .
an officer said no-one would be charged .
the whale was washed up on a popular beach pc mike middlehurst , a wildlife crime officer with grampian police , said the short investigation into the missing jaw ranked among the most unusual he has been involved with .
the deep diving whale 's carcass was found on sunday by a dog walker .
he said : " the jawbone went missing overnight and we got some information where it may be and who was involved with it .
" we spoke to those people and they were forthcoming about why they removed it and where it was .
" we were taken to where it was buried and council staff dug it up . "
pc middlehurst added : " it was n't buried to keep it out of sight of the police , but to leave it to rot and to be dug up 18 months later once the flesh had been removed . "
royal property the officer said the area has a long tradition in fishing and links with the sea and many people believe it is lucky to have a whale tooth .
however , because of its size the whale carcass was protected under an ancient law classing it as the property of the crown and by rights the royal family had first call on what should happen to it .
its remains are also protected by international law on the trade of endangered species , while the removal of the jawbone could have been treated as a common law offence .

meanwhile , police said the jawbone was removed by people following a local custom of keeping the teeth as souvenirs .
an officer said no-one would be charged .
the whale was washed up on a popular beach pc mike middlehurst , a wildlife crime officer with grampian police , said the short investigation into the missing jaw ranked among the most unusual he has been involved with .
the deep diving whale 's carcass was found on sunday by a dog walker .
he said : " the jawbone went missing overnight and we got some information where it may be and who was involved with it .
" we spoke to those people and they were forthcoming about why they removed it and where it was .
" we were taken to where it was buried and council staff dug it up . "

royal property the officer said the area has a long tradition in fishing and links with the sea and many people believe it is lucky to have a whale tooth .

he was 38 .
nobody quite knows why lt col jha pulled the trigger on himself - he had been serving in the military for the past 14 years .
according to his mother , lalita jha , " there was no tension , no problems .
i just ca n't understand why he did it " .
he is far from the only soldier to take his own life this year - capt sunit kohli , maj sobha rani , lt sushmita chatterjee ... the list goes on .
in fact , the indian army is losing more soldiers in these incidents than in action against the enemy .
the army has lost 72 soldiers to enemy attacks so far this year .
but over 100 soldiers have already taken their lives .
in addition , another 32 have been killed by their colleagues .
what is happening to the army ?
disturbing trend since 2004 , 282 soldiers have been killed in militant attacks since 2004 , 408 soldiers have taken their lives , killed colleagues or died after colleagues ran amok of the 408 soldiers , 333 killed themselves the million-strong force is clearly under tremendous stress .
though it has not fought a full-blown war in decades , the force is bogged down in fighting domestic insurgencies , guarding restive borders and sometimes quelling civilian rioting .
most experts attribute the growing stress to low morale , bad service conditions , lack of adequate home leave , unattractive pay and a communication gap with superiors .
retired maj gen afsar karim , who has fought three wars , says that the stress may be high among soldiers because of lack of leave .
" the army is involved in a -lsb- difficult -rsb- long running internal security environment .
there is lack of rest and they get very little leave .
lack of leave increases his stress , " he says .
" soldiers get angry when they are denied leave and their officers themselves take time off .
it triggers a reaction , they are well armed and they take their own lives . "
then there is the question of what many say is low pay - starting salaries in many jobs in middle-class india are double that of a new soldier , and for many of them the army no longer holds out the promise of a good life .
retired maj gen karim suspects that with the increase in numbers of soldiers , cohesiveness is being eroded .
" in our times , we used to know the names of our soldiers , where they came from .
we used to meet their families , but now the army has expanded manifold and this cohesiveness is gone , " he says .
frayed nerves the army says it is worried about this disconcerting trend .
spokesman col sk sakhuja says soldiers kill each other when one of them perceives that they are being harassed by superiors or when they have heated arguments among themselves .
' ' we have strengthened formal and informal interaction between soldiers and officers .
leave policy , especially for soldiers posted in difficult areas , has been liberalised so that a soldier can go home to sort out his domestic problems , " he says .
" also , counselling by officers , psychiatrics and religious teachers is being undertaken . "
delhi-based psychiatrist achal bhagat says a combination of stress and high alcohol consumption could lead to frayed nerves .
" what is needed is confidential counselling , creating a support system for the soldiers working in adverse conditions , " he says .
the army is confident that this is a " testing time " for the force and it will pass .
" our foundations are strong , " says col sakhuja .
the problem is that there is not enough clarity still on what precisely is causing these soldier deaths .
lalita jha , mother of pankaj jha , hopes that she will find out more about her son 's suicide .
" i am sure the army will look into the matter and find out what happened , " she says .
before more soldiers take their lives , one hopes .

labour mps are angry at the proposals in sir hayden phillips 's funding review which they say would end the party 's " historic link " with the unions .
sir hayden has suggested a £ 50,000 cap on donations to all parties .
but left-wing mp john mcdonnell said there had been " absolute fury " among the parliamentary labour party -lrb- plp -rrb- .
the party 's ruling national executive council is being convened later to discuss party funding .
' hidden agenda ' there has been no official word from downing street on whether tony blair supports a cap on donations .
but mr mcdonnell said it looked as though the prime minister was backing the proposals and suggested his " hidden agenda " was to break the party 's link with the trade unions . "
we feel we 're being sold out " john mcdonnell " i think there will be uproar not just among the plp and the trade unions but also across rank-and-file members of the labour party as well , " said mr mcdonnell - who has said he will run for the leadership when mr blair stands down next year .
we feel we 're being sold out . "
' cash for honours ' education secretary alan johnson , the former head of the communication workers ' union , also said union ties should be defended and enhanced .
he said they offered " highly regulated , transparent funding from working people " .
sir hayden was asked by mr blair to examine whether agreement could be reached over changes to party funding . "
i see no reason why donations from trade unions should be exempt from the cap " sir hayden phillips it followed allegations , denied by all concerned , that honours have been given to people in return for people donating , or lending , money to political parties .
in a memorandum seen by the bbc , sir hayden suggests a £ 500,000 limit on donations from organisations , falling to £ 50,000 in four years .
he adds : " i see no reason why donations from trade unions should be exempt from the cap . "
trade union members pay a £ 3 annual levy , which its leaders can then use to help fund the labour party .
but sir hayden is understood to be suggesting that each union member be registered as an individual donor - which could reduce the influence of union leaders on party policy .
the times reported on thursday that sir hayden is also recommending a £ 12.5m spending limit on general elections and giving extra state support to the liberal democrats and some smaller parties .
he has also suggested a cap on spending between elections as well and a ban on anonymous bodies donating funds .
it would mean all the main parties would no longer be able to get multi-million pound donations from individual supporters .
all the main parties say they want the process of funding to be more transparent , to help increase public trust in politics .

labour mps are angry at the proposals in sir hayden phillips 's funding review which they say would end the party 's " historic link " with the unions .
sir hayden has suggested a £ 50,000 cap on donations to all parties .
but left-wing mp john mcdonnell said there had been " absolute fury " among the parliamentary labour party -lrb- plp -rrb- .
the party 's ruling national executive council is being convened later to discuss party funding .
' hidden agenda ' there has been no official word from downing street on whether tony blair supports a cap on donations .
but mr mcdonnell said it looked as though the prime minister was backing the proposals and suggested his " hidden agenda " was to break the party 's link with the trade unions .
we feel we 're being sold out john mcdonnell " i think there will be uproar not just among the plp and the trade unions but also across rank-and-file members of the labour party as well , " said mr mcdonnell - who has said he will run for the leadership when mr blair stands down next year .
we feel we 're being sold out . "
' cash for honours ' education secretary alan johnson , the former head of the communication workers ' union , also said union ties should be defended and enhanced .
he said they offered " highly regulated , transparent funding from working people " .
sir hayden was asked by mr blair to examine whether agreement could be reached over changes to party funding .
i see no reason why donations from trade unions should be exempt from the cap sir hayden phillips it followed allegations , denied by all concerned , that honours have been given to people in return for people donating , or lending , money to political parties .
in a memorandum seen by the bbc , sir hayden suggests a £ 500,000 limit on donations from organisations , falling to £ 50,000 in four years .
he adds : " i see no reason why donations from trade unions should be exempt from the cap . "
trade union members pay a £ 3 annual levy , which its leaders can then use to help fund the labour party .
but sir hayden is understood to be suggesting that each union member be registered as an individual donor - which could reduce the influence of union leaders on party policy .
the times reported on thursday that sir hayden is also recommending a £ 12.5m spending limit on general elections and giving extra state support to the liberal democrats and some smaller parties .
he has also suggested a cap on spending between elections as well and a ban on anonymous bodies donating funds .
it would mean all the main parties would no longer be able to get multi-million pound donations from individual supporters .
all the main parties say they want the process of funding to be more transparent , to help increase public trust in politics .

koral karsan , 50 , from new york said he would release photos and audio tapes of ono unless she paid $ 2m -lrb- £ 1.02m -rrb- .
he was arrested on wednesday after ono reported the plot , said a police spokesman .
karsan denies the claims .
the driver also talked about killing her and her son sean in a conversation which was recorded by investigators , police said .
charges are pending .
karsan denied trying to blackmail ono while being led into a new york police station : " no , " he said .
" no way . "
' shocked ' the turkish-born chauffeur had worked for ono for six years , driving her on an almost daily basis when she was in new york .
" she is one woman who has been through enough , " said ono 's spokesperson eliot mintz .
" for an employee - especially a trusted employee who drove her - to attempt a shakedown has left her just absolutely shocked . "
karsan 's alleged blackmail attempt is said to have taken place last week , on the 26th anniversary of the murder of ono 's husband , john lennon .
ono 's security staff say karsan dropped off a letter and a photograph of ono in nightclothes to the artist 's apartment in new york , where she once lived with the former beatle .
staff told detectives that in his " rambling " note , karsan claimed to have secretly photographed ono and made recordings of her private conversations - apparently while she was in the car with him .
the driver warned he would make the material public if she did not pay him , police said .
anniversary " you 're reminded that this takes place around that time of the anniversary , when she is in a particularly vulnerable position , " mintz said .
" it just adds insult to injury .
this one 's really cold . "
ono and lennon married in 1969 after the singer left his previous wife , cynthia .
they recorded together throughout the 1970s , and became notorious for their anti-war stance .
but in 1980 , shortly after his double fantasy album went to number one around the world , lennon was shot dead by mark chapman outside his new york apartment .
fans observe the anniversary of his death by gathering at strawberry fields , a section of central park opposite the dakota apartment building .
