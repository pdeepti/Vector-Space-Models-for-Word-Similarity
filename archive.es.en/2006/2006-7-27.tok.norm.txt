program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sounds like germany krautrock created a new sound for a new generation german rap keeps it real mozart classic gets street treatment in berlin update happy birthday , herbert grönemeyer ! culture & lifestyle -pipe- 27.07.2006 debate over subsidies brings drama backstage in bayreuth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner wants to pull the plug on public money for bayreuth nike wagner , the niece of bayreuth festival director wolfgang wagner , advocated cuts to the opera festival 's state subsidies .
her appeal aggravated family tensions , but raised valid questions on german art subsidies . richard wagner wrote operas and his descendants seem to be living in one . the composer founded the bayreuth festival in 1876 and it 's been a family-run show since then .
his grandson , 86-year-old wolfgang wagner , has been single-handedly directing the annual opera event since his brother wieland 's death in 1966 and it looks like his daughter katharina , 28 , will be the next to take the reigns . then there is nike wagner , wieland 's daughter - wolfgang 's niece - who successfully directs her own arts festival in weimar . nike wag n er wa n ts cuts i n bayreuth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner in an article in the july edition of german cultural and political magazine cicero , nike wagner made an explicit appeal that cuts be made to the state subsidies her family 's festival receives .
the bayreuth festival currently receives 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 2.1 million -rrb- each from the federal government , the state of bavaria and the city of bayreuth . " it 's difficult to understand why this festival , which is sold out years in advance and can work risk-free , continues to receive millions in public funds instead of hiking the ticket prices for a period of time and making the funds available to needier cultural institutions , festivals and cities , " nike wagner wrote . public mo n ey will co n ti n ue to roll i n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner directs the " kunstfest " in weimar the german news magazine focus estimated that prices would need to be raised by 70 percent to compensate for public funds to the seen-and-be-seen event .

her appeal aggravated family tensions , but raised valid questions on german art subsidies . richard wagner wrote operas and his descendants seem to be living in one . the composer founded the bayreuth festival in 1876 and it 's been a family-run show since then .
his grandson , 86-year-old wolfgang wagner , has been single-handedly directing the annual opera event since his brother wieland 's death in 1966 and it looks like his daughter katharina , 28 , will be the next to take the reigns . then there is nike wagner , wieland 's daughter - wolfgang 's niece - who successfully directs her own arts festival in weimar . nike wag n er wa n ts cuts i n bayreuth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner in an article in the july edition of german cultural and political magazine cicero , nike wagner made an explicit appeal that cuts be made to the state subsidies her family 's festival receives .
the bayreuth festival currently receives 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 2.1 million -rrb- each from the federal government , the state of bavaria and the city of bayreuth . " it 's difficult to understand why this festival , which is sold out years in advance and can work risk-free , continues to receive millions in public funds instead of hiking the ticket prices for a period of time and making the funds available to needier cultural institutions , festivals and cities , " nike wagner wrote . public mo n ey will co n ti n ue to roll i n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner directs the " kunstfest " in weimar the german news magazine focus estimated that prices would need to be raised by 70 percent to compensate for public funds to the seen-and-be-seen event .
the current maximum ticket price for an evening at the bayreuth festival is 208 euros -lrb- $ 263 -rrb- , but the waiting list to get one of them can run up to 10 years .
the german culture council wrote that last year 370,000 orders were made for around 54,000 tickets , so there 's no danger of empty seats . the demands of richard wagner 's great-granddaughter , who is also franz liszt 's great-great-granddaughter , seem to have fallen on deaf ears .
during his visit to the festival 's opening , german culture minister bernd neumann announced tuesday that the federal government 's financial contribution to the event would remain unchanged . a festival made stale by subsidies ? nike wagner 's article , actually a parallel chronicle of the two music festivals in weimar and bayreuth , contained some harsh barbs that infer nothing other than a family feud . " the wagner festival concerns itself year in and year out with the reproduction of its own myth , always subjected to the same program , the same pieces , and it froze up in routine and modernity during the 1970s , " she wrote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayreuth guests like former president roman herzog could afford a price hike , but should they have to ?
as for the leadership in bayreuth , not only have " media strategies " and elements of spectacle removed from art and intellect " gained ground , but the " regime " there has been " compared to a police state by many artists , " nike wagner added .
in weimar , of course , " the police state has ended . " not everyo n e agrees germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung meanwhile commented that as an intelligent person , nike wagner " should forego petty battles with the hostile family clan . "
besides , she " should know that raising the ticket prices at the bayreuth festival would be against the will of her great-grandfather richard . " family quarrels aside , does nike wagner have a point ?

germany 's pension confusion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more germans want to decide when to call it a career germany has decided to boost its mandatory retirement age from 65 to 67 .
at the same time , many firms are shedding older workers with help from subsidized retirement plans .
is germany suffering from pension confusion ? bmw 's ultra-successful ceo helmut panke will resign from his post on sept.1 , even though he really does n't want to .
he 's leaving because on aug .
31 , he reaches the company 's mandatory retirement age of 60 .
this week , he introduced the press to his successor , 50-year-old norbert reithofer . forced retirement at 60 remains more the exception than the rule in germany , and it applies mainly to family-controlled concerns like bmw and bertelsmann , explained andreas zimmermann , director for social policy at the german confederation of managers , a berlin lobbying organization that represents business managers . socially accepted discrimination ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panke is out of the driver 's seat whether he likes it or not " in germany , it has always been socially accepted to treat older employees differently , " zimmermann said .
" only a few people perceive it as real discrimination .
on the contrary , if older employees were given the opportunity to leave early , it was more welcomed than criticized . " germany 's officially mandated retirement age is currently 65 and a new law will gradually increase it to 67 over the next three years .
but in reality , the average german already leaves work at 63 , when early retirement and disabilities are taken into consideration , according to holger schäfer of the cologne institute for economic research -lrb- iwk -rrb- . in fact , retiring around 60 was normal in germany until recently .
firms often preferred to push aside expensive older employees in favor of cheaper , younger ones , and the government facilitated this by subsidizing early retirement schemes . early retirement made appealing to employers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these four know how to enjoy themselves after a lifetime of work the plans are intended to lure older employees away before they reach official pension age with plump buyout settlements partly paid by the government .
they were part of a massive daimlerchrysler restructuring push called " cultural model 60 " to get rid of any employee over age 60 deemed unessential . for the employee getting the soft boot , the plan " is a face-saving option , " said zimmermann .
" and the government subsidies make it very attractive for employers . " it was not until the 1990s that people begin to realize the cost of putting potentially productive workers out to pasture to feed off the system instead of feeding their work into it , zimmerman added . is retirement the right way to go ? although the current subsidies , which will be phased out in 2009 , are a lower than earlier government payouts , some involved in the debate say it is still too easy for workers take early retirement and businesses to offer it . " replacing one bad idea with another bad idea is n't a good solution , " said the iwk 's schäfer .
" germany does n't need it ; it provides the wrong sort of incentive .
if older people lose their job , they should have to go out and find a new one . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is he reading the job ads ?
he insists that , despite common wisdom that people over 40 face a much more difficult employment outlook , the jobs are there to be had " if they are prepared to compromise " on such issues as training , salary and location . zimmermann said he sees things differently . " in the past , subsidized early retirement programs have been abused , " he admitted .
however , " we are not convinced so far that employers are really willing to retain older employees .
if you see how eagerly , how intensively companies have used these programs , it not a very encouraging sign .
it does n't send a signal of trust to the older workers . " a study published monday by the bertelsmann institute showed most workers would like to stay at their desks after their 60th birthday and have more of a hand in determining the conditions of their retirement . researchers interviewed 1,000 workers between the ages of 35 and 55 on their attitudes toward retirement and found some 61 percent said they would like to decide for themselves when to collect their gold watches , sometime between the age 60 and 67 . graying population a danger to pension system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's pension system needs more people staying at their desks longer the sexagenarians ' decision to stay on the job is also important for germany , according to the report . " given the demographic developments , the country urgently needs a social paradigm shift in favor of a longer working life , " bertelsmann institute head johannes meier told reporters when he presented the study 's results . the number of workers aged between 50 and 64 across the eu will increase by 25 percent over the next two decades while those aged 20 to 29 will decrease by 20 percent , leaving german economists wringing their hands over the impending skilled-labor shortage and fretting over the country 's pay-as-you-go pension system , which is already teetering on the brink of insolvency . " this -lrb- pension -rrb- system will break down if there are not enough people working , " schäfer said .
" the dilemma can be solved by lowering the amount of pensions people get , increasing the amount people have to pay in , or raising the retirement age .
and in fact we are going to have to do all three of those at the same time .

is germany suffering from pension confusion ? bmw 's ultra-successful ceo helmut panke will resign from his post on sept.1 , even though he really does n't want to .
he 's leaving because on aug .
31 , he reaches the company 's mandatory retirement age of 60 .
this week , he introduced the press to his successor , 50-year-old norbert reithofer . forced retirement at 60 remains more the exception than the rule in germany , and it applies mainly to family-controlled concerns like bmw and bertelsmann , explained andreas zimmermann , director for social policy at the german confederation of managers , a berlin lobbying organization that represents business managers . socially accepted discrimination ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panke is out of the driver 's seat whether he likes it or not " in germany , it has always been socially accepted to treat older employees differently , " zimmermann said .
" only a few people perceive it as real discrimination .
on the contrary , if older employees were given the opportunity to leave early , it was more welcomed than criticized . " germany 's officially mandated retirement age is currently 65 and a new law will gradually increase it to 67 over the next three years .
but in reality , the average german already leaves work at 63 , when early retirement and disabilities are taken into consideration , according to holger schäfer of the cologne institute for economic research -lrb- iwk -rrb- . in fact , retiring around 60 was normal in germany until recently .
firms often preferred to push aside expensive older employees in favor of cheaper , younger ones , and the government facilitated this by subsidizing early retirement schemes . early retirement made appealing to employers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these four know how to enjoy themselves after a lifetime of work the plans are intended to lure older employees away before they reach official pension age with plump buyout settlements partly paid by the government .
they were part of a massive daimlerchrysler restructuring push called " cultural model 60 " to get rid of any employee over age 60 deemed unessential . for the employee getting the soft boot , the plan " is a face-saving option , " said zimmermann .
" and the government subsidies make it very attractive for employers . " it was not until the 1990s that people begin to realize the cost of putting potentially productive workers out to pasture to feed off the system instead of feeding their work into it , zimmerman added . is retirement the right way to go ? although the current subsidies , which will be phased out in 2009 , are a lower than earlier government payouts , some involved in the debate say it is still too easy for workers take early retirement and businesses to offer it . " replacing one bad idea with another bad idea is n't a good solution , " said the iwk 's schäfer .

if older people lose their job , they should have to go out and find a new one . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is he reading the job ads ?
he insists that , despite common wisdom that people over 40 face a much more difficult employment outlook , the jobs are there to be had " if they are prepared to compromise " on such issues as training , salary and location . zimmermann said he sees things differently . " in the past , subsidized early retirement programs have been abused , " he admitted .
however , " we are not convinced so far that employers are really willing to retain older employees .
if you see how eagerly , how intensively companies have used these programs , it not a very encouraging sign .
it does n't send a signal of trust to the older workers . " a study published monday by the bertelsmann institute showed most workers would like to stay at their desks after their 60th birthday and have more of a hand in determining the conditions of their retirement . researchers interviewed 1,000 workers between the ages of 35 and 55 on their attitudes toward retirement and found some 61 percent said they would like to decide for themselves when to collect their gold watches , sometime between the age 60 and 67 . graying population a danger to pension system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's pension system needs more people staying at their desks longer the sexagenarians ' decision to stay on the job is also important for germany , according to the report . " given the demographic developments , the country urgently needs a social paradigm shift in favor of a longer working life , " bertelsmann institute head johannes meier told reporters when he presented the study 's results . the number of workers aged between 50 and 64 across the eu will increase by 25 percent over the next two decades while those aged 20 to 29 will decrease by 20 percent , leaving german economists wringing their hands over the impending skilled-labor shortage and fretting over the country 's pay-as-you-go pension system , which is already teetering on the brink of insolvency . " this -lrb- pension -rrb- system will break down if there are not enough people working , " schäfer said .
" the dilemma can be solved by lowering the amount of pensions people get , increasing the amount people have to pay in , or raising the retirement age .

the aircraft are part of a controversial billion-euro deal , which has the opposition questioning the project 's aim . the eurofighter deal is one of the largest defense projects in germany .
the first four aircraft - at a price of 74 million euros -lrb- $ 94 million -rrb- each - landed at the air force base in bavaria 's neuburg an der donau this week . the european aerospace group eads will deliver 180 fighter jets over the next few years to germany in a contract totaling over 21 billion euros .
these will form the backbone of the country 's air defense , replacing the phantom aircraft . but this controversial acquisition by the german armed forces or bundeswehr , has long been the focus of criticism .
when the eurofighter typhoon was developed 25 years ago , the world still looked very different .
it was the cold war ; the warsaw pact still existed . war scenarios at the time were still based on the assumption that western europe could be attacked from the east .
so a fighter jet was planned that could compete with the russian mig aircraft .

the aircraft are part of a controversial billion-euro deal , which has the opposition questioning the project 's aim . the eurofighter deal is one of the largest defense projects in germany .
the first four aircraft - at a price of 74 million euros -lrb- $ 94 million -rrb- each - landed at the air force base in bavaria 's neuburg an der donau this week . the european aerospace group eads will deliver 180 fighter jets over the next few years to germany in a contract totaling over 21 billion euros .
these will form the backbone of the country 's air defense , replacing the phantom aircraft . but this controversial acquisition by the german armed forces or bundeswehr , has long been the focus of criticism .
when the eurofighter typhoon was developed 25 years ago , the world still looked very different .
it was the cold war ; the warsaw pact still existed . war scenarios at the time were still based on the assumption that western europe could be attacked from the east .

while the former has a broader europea n focus , the latter explores cultural issues withi n germa n y . do you agree with nike wag n er that subsidies to the bayreuth wag n er festival should be cut ? she does have a point there .
in germany we have little legal basis for art funding .
it is more or less done on a day-to-day basis of means .
the german federal court once issued a ruling to the effect that money is scarce so it should go to those artists and events that need it .
often the money goes to the more popular events anyway .
the bayreuth festival gets 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 2.15 million -rrb- from the federal government , which may sound like a lot but it 's not really that much .
we spend over two billion euros per year for theater in germany .
one should also not forget that the family affair has a big part in this .
the wagner family situation has been called a soap opera . what is the goal behi n d public arts subsidies i n germa n y ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesand : new media art is n't part of the subsidy infrastructure yet germany does n't have a clear cut cultural financing policy .
it 's a wild mixture of cities , lä n der -lrb- states -rrb- and the federal government , so that 's a very difficult question to answer .
germany has n't had a discussion about this , like some other countries have .
we conduct surveys and it is astonishing that the general public does not question art subsidies , which may be different elsewhere .
it 's very traditional here .
a town with 30,000 residents can have its own opera - like coburg next to bayreuth .
that 's because of history : these towns were once capitals of little states and they wanted to have their share of the arts . if fu n di n g to the wag n er festival were to be cut , where should the mo n ey be redirected ? there are so many events that deserve something , not only -lrb- nike wagner 's kunstfestival in -rrb- weimar .
nike wagner is quite active in getting money from different sources , so she should n't complain .
i can understand her .
she 's more avant-garde , which would make the bayreuth festival interesting if she took over there , but that 's already out of the question .
there are other , less traditional sectors in germany too , which do n't yet have a proper place in this infrastructure : cultural education , community arts , immigrants , new media art .
subsidies have been stable in germany in the last few years , with a total expenditure of about eight billion euros per year .
actually , the real costs have been going down slightly , but not as much as in other countries . what do you expect from this year 's wag n er festival ? i have n't been in many years , so i really ca n't say .
but it 's always really remarkable .
i have a tip for anyone who wants to get tickets .
if you 're from very far away , your chances of getting tickets are much better .
i thought about calling up my friend in chile and asking him to get tickets for me . kate bowen interviewed andreas wiesand send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drama and fantasy at bayreuth 's wagner festival german playwright and director tankred dorst 's brand new production of wagner 's 16-hour " ring " cycle tops the program for the one-month festival and has critics on the edge of their seats .
-lrb- july 25 , 2006 -rrb- german politicians cozy up to the arts politicians have always been keen to ingratiate themselves with the arts and culture community .
but are their gestures of support mere posturing - or will they translate into constructive policies ?

the aircraft are part of a controversial billion-euro deal , which has the opposition questioning the project 's aim . the eurofighter deal is one of the largest defense projects in germany .
the first four aircraft - at a price of 74 million euros -lrb- $ 94 million -rrb- each - landed at the air force base in bavaria 's neuburg an der donau this week . the european aerospace group eads will deliver 180 fighter jets over the next few years to germany in a contract totaling over 21 billion euros .
these will form the backbone of the country 's air defense , replacing the phantom aircraft . but this controversial acquisition by the german armed forces or bundeswehr , has long been the focus of criticism .
when the eurofighter typhoon was developed 25 years ago , the world still looked very different .
it was the cold war ; the warsaw pact still existed . war scenarios at the time were still based on the assumption that western europe could be attacked from the east .
so a fighter jet was planned that could compete with the russian mig aircraft .
now , air battles over europe are scenarios from the past . co n tribute to soldiers ' safety abroad in view of the changed situation in the world , it has become controversial whether the german armed forces even really need 180 fighter jets .

" they will be a significant part of ensuring our soldiers ' safety on foreign deployments . " he said german soldiers increasingly face dangerous situations during their missions abroad .
the german armed forces long ago changed from an army for national defense to a mobile deployment force , operating worldwide on peacekeeping missions . " if i look at the development in afghanistan , i can imagine that it will become necessary to deploy our eurofighters for intelligence and for protecting our soldiers , which have gotten into trouble , " siebert said . oppositio n : n ot n eeded for peacekeepi n g the opposition green party fought against the eurofighter for a long time , as it considered the billion-euro defense project to be outdated .
it does n't agree with the conservatives on the purpose of the deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eurofighter typhoon is now in service in germany , spain , italy and britain " in all of the conflicts in which the bundeswehr is deployed under a un mandate or with an alliance , there is n't one single case where a weapons system such as the eurofighter is needed , " said andreas bonde , the green 's defense spokesman . he added it was an instrument required for warfare between highly armed nations . " but in our missions today , where it 's about nation building and stabilization measures , we do n't need weapons systems like this , " bonde said . no lo n ger meeti n g the bu n deswehr 's n eeds both the cdu and the greens agree that the eurofighter should be deployed for a very clear purpose within germany 's borders , namely in air surveillance or " air policing .

at the same time , many firms are shedding older workers with help from subsidized retirement plans .

this week , he introduced the press to his successor , 50-year-old norbert reithofer . forced retirement at 60 remains more the exception than the rule in germany , and it applies mainly to family-controlled concerns like bmw and bertelsmann , explained andreas zimmermann , director for social policy at the german confederation of managers , a berlin lobbying organization that represents business managers . socially accepted discrimination ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panke is out of the driver 's seat whether he likes it or not " in germany , it has always been socially accepted to treat older employees differently , " zimmermann said .

on the contrary , if older employees were given the opportunity to leave early , it was more welcomed than criticized . " germany 's officially mandated retirement age is currently 65 and a new law will gradually increase it to 67 over the next three years .
but in reality , the average german already leaves work at 63 , when early retirement and disabilities are taken into consideration , according to holger schäfer of the cologne institute for economic research -lrb- iwk -rrb- . in fact , retiring around 60 was normal in germany until recently .

" and the government subsidies make it very attractive for employers . " it was not until the 1990s that people begin to realize the cost of putting potentially productive workers out to pasture to feed off the system instead of feeding their work into it , zimmerman added . is retirement the right way to go ? although the current subsidies , which will be phased out in 2009 , are a lower than earlier government payouts , some involved in the debate say it is still too easy for workers take early retirement and businesses to offer it .

wulf diepenbrock , an agriculture expert at halle university , predicted that more of these kinds of heat waves in the year to come will force farmers to change their planting strategies . " some farmers are already mulling planting varieties which are better suited to resist longer periods of heat with no rainfall in between , " he said . water levels low also in germany , navigation on the river elbe in the north of the country was disrupted after water levels dropped below navigable levels .
four months after flooding its banks , water in the river was just 90 centimeters -lrb- three feet -rrb- deep in some parts .
commercial vessels , which need water levels of at least 2.3 meters , were diverted into less affected canals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead fish in a dry river bed in eastern germany the low level and temperature of the water in the river also led nuclear power generators along the banks of the elbe to cut output . high water temperatures have also disrupted electricity production at nuclear power stations in france and spain .
water is used as a cooling agent at the plants but the temperature of discharged water must be within environmental norms . " we are adjusting our output on a constant basis according to the temperature of the water , " said a spokesman for the vattenfall electricity company in germany . despite the continuing heat , there 's no need yet to worry about water supplies , since water reservoirs and ground water levels are still at acceptable norms . " this is not to say that we 're telling people to waste water , " said hermann hahn from the german water management association .
" i 'm just saying that it 's unjustified to speak of a water supply catastrophe right now . " loss of life the heat wave has claimed an estimated 40 lives in europe over the past two weeks but there has been no repetition of the massive loss of life in the heat wave of 2003 when in france alone 15,000 died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans like it sunny and warm , but it 's become extreme the heat was blamed for the deaths of a man of 87 and a woman of 89 in the northern italian city of turin during the night tuesday , the italian ansa news agency reported , adding that there was a heavy call on hospitals during the night with many people wanting to stay in their air-conditioned buildings . the death of an 83-year-old woman in barcelona brought the toll in spain to nine . in denmark , also undergoing one of the hottest summers in its history , many local authorities have banned open air fires except at fixed barbecue sites . polish firefighters are on maximum alert to tackle forest fires caused by the drought .
over 8,000 fires have broken out in recent days and access has been banned to most forests . according to the gazeta wyborcza daily , warsaw has seen the hottest month of july since temperatures began to be recorded 227 years ago .

the scene , caught on russian tv cameras filming the g8 meetings in russia and blitzed around the world via the internet , shows a caught-off-guard chancellor breaking off mid-sentence with italian prime minister romano prodi to jerk her shoulders and throw up her balled fists .
one can almost here the " yuck " in her grimace .
still , it was a pretty hot moment for the g8 .
love attack the incident at first was overshadowed by other slips at the normally staid and staged meetings - such as one in which bush uses an expletive in a candid conversation with british prime minister tony blair when he did n't know was being taped .
but a few days after the meetings , the video clip became one of the most downloaded and shared clips on the web , inspiring columns , comedians and even political pundits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she is no gerhard schröder " bush : love attack on merkel ! " read the headline in german mass-market tabloid bild .
comedian jon stewart on the " daily show " wondered out loud if the president realized that , " you do n't do that to women you do n't know , especially the chancellor of germany . "
some wondered if bush was n't reverting to his fratboy days .
" this isn ’ t a sigma chi kegger , it 's the g-8 summit , ” wrote blogger christy hardin smith on firedoglake.com before being informed bush was actually a member of the delta kappa epsilon fraternity .
lessons on taste and etiquette some seized on the opportunity to criticize the president politically .
" when he is away from his script and his handlers , his true lack of intelligence and emotional maturity surfaces for all to see , " wrote bloggers on the dialogue international web site , which focuses transatlantic issues .
" the dangerous situation in lebanon ... requires true leadership .
do n't look for it from the world 's uberpower . "
the incident was seized upon by some liberals .
steve young 's blog on the huffington post web site called bush the " lounge lizard in chief " and extolled the " the irony of a president who 's supposed to represent our best , giving the chancellor of germany an inappropriate and unrequested backrub . "

the scene , caught on russian tv cameras filming the g8 meetings in russia and blitzed around the world via the internet , shows a caught-off-guard chancellor breaking off mid-sentence with italian prime minister romano prodi to jerk her shoulders and throw up her balled fists .
one can almost here the " yuck " in her grimace .
still , it was a pretty hot moment for the g8 .
love attack the incident at first was overshadowed by other slips at the normally staid and staged meetings - such as one in which bush uses an expletive in a candid conversation with british prime minister tony blair when he did n't know was being taped .
but a few days after the meetings , the video clip became one of the most downloaded and shared clips on the web , inspiring columns , comedians and even political pundits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she is no gerhard schröder " bush : love attack on merkel ! " read the headline in german mass-market tabloid bild .
comedian jon stewart on the " daily show " wondered out loud if the president realized that , " you do n't do that to women you do n't know , especially the chancellor of germany . "
some wondered if bush was n't reverting to his fratboy days .
" this isn ’ t a sigma chi kegger , it 's the g-8 summit , ” wrote blogger christy hardin smith on firedoglake.com before being informed bush was actually a member of the delta kappa epsilon fraternity .
lessons on taste and etiquette some seized on the opportunity to criticize the president politically .
" when he is away from his script and his handlers , his true lack of intelligence and emotional maturity surfaces for all to see , " wrote bloggers on the dialogue international web site , which focuses transatlantic issues .
" the dangerous situation in lebanon ... requires true leadership .
do n't look for it from the world 's uberpower . "
the incident was seized upon by some liberals .
steve young 's blog on the huffington post web site called bush the " lounge lizard in chief " and extolled the " the irony of a president who 's supposed to represent our best , giving the chancellor of germany an inappropriate and unrequested backrub . "
sexual-harassment training , maybe ?
many bloggers wondered if the president was n't up-to-date on sexual harassment rules and office etiquette .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she did n't turn away then larry sabato , professor of politics at the university of virginia , told the associated press that today , public figures have to be more careful in " a thousand ways " even as he values the honesty of web sites like youtube , which posted the video .
" if they 're not doing something that 's embarrassing , they have nothing to worry about , " he said .
" a president ought to know enough not use an expletive in a fairly open meeting , and almost any male alive today knows that you do n't offer uninvited massages to any female , much less the chancellor of germany . "
bush fans pooh-pooh the matter saying that it was nothing to get worked up about .
" president bush just ca n't win , " said fox news ' karen hanretty .
" are n't these the same women who have been angry about cowboy diplomacy ?
do they want a kinder , more sensitive bush - or a cowboy ?
once again , there 's no pleasing women .
give them the cowboy and they want alan alda .

the wagner family situation has been called a soap opera . what is the goal behi n d public arts subsidies i n germa n y ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesand : new media art is n't part of the subsidy infrastructure yet germany does n't have a clear cut cultural financing policy .
it 's a wild mixture of cities , lä n der -lrb- states -rrb- and the federal government , so that 's a very difficult question to answer .
germany has n't had a discussion about this , like some other countries have .
we conduct surveys and it is astonishing that the general public does not question art subsidies , which may be different elsewhere .
it 's very traditional here .
a town with 30,000 residents can have its own opera - like coburg next to bayreuth .
that 's because of history : these towns were once capitals of little states and they wanted to have their share of the arts . if fu n di n g to the wag n er festival were to be cut , where should the mo n ey be redirected ? there are so many events that deserve something , not only -lrb- nike wagner 's kunstfestival in -rrb- weimar .
nike wagner is quite active in getting money from different sources , so she should n't complain .
i can understand her .
she 's more avant-garde , which would make the bayreuth festival interesting if she took over there , but that 's already out of the question .
there are other , less traditional sectors in germany too , which do n't yet have a proper place in this infrastructure : cultural education , community arts , immigrants , new media art .
subsidies have been stable in germany in the last few years , with a total expenditure of about eight billion euros per year .
actually , the real costs have been going down slightly , but not as much as in other countries . what do you expect from this year 's wag n er festival ? i have n't been in many years , so i really ca n't say .
but it 's always really remarkable .
i have a tip for anyone who wants to get tickets .
if you 're from very far away , your chances of getting tickets are much better .

while the former has a broader europea n focus , the latter explores cultural issues withi n germa n y . do you agree with nike wag n er that subsidies to the bayreuth wag n er festival should be cut ? she does have a point there .
in germany we have little legal basis for art funding .
it is more or less done on a day-to-day basis of means .
the german federal court once issued a ruling to the effect that money is scarce so it should go to those artists and events that need it .
often the money goes to the more popular events anyway .
the bayreuth festival gets 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 2.15 million -rrb- from the federal government , which may sound like a lot but it 's not really that much .
we spend over two billion euros per year for theater in germany .

germany 's pension confusion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more germans want to decide when to call it a career germany has decided to boost its mandatory retirement age from 65 to 67 .
at the same time , many firms are shedding older workers with help from subsidized retirement plans .
is germany suffering from pension confusion ? bmw 's ultra-successful ceo helmut panke will resign from his post on sept.1 , even though he really does n't want to .
he 's leaving because on aug .
31 , he reaches the company 's mandatory retirement age of 60 .
this week , he introduced the press to his successor , 50-year-old norbert reithofer . forced retirement at 60 remains more the exception than the rule in germany , and it applies mainly to family-controlled concerns like bmw and bertelsmann , explained andreas zimmermann , director for social policy at the german confederation of managers , a berlin lobbying organization that represents business managers . socially accepted discrimination ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panke is out of the driver 's seat whether he likes it or not " in germany , it has always been socially accepted to treat older employees differently , " zimmermann said .
" only a few people perceive it as real discrimination .
on the contrary , if older employees were given the opportunity to leave early , it was more welcomed than criticized . " germany 's officially mandated retirement age is currently 65 and a new law will gradually increase it to 67 over the next three years .
but in reality , the average german already leaves work at 63 , when early retirement and disabilities are taken into consideration , according to holger schäfer of the cologne institute for economic research -lrb- iwk -rrb- . in fact , retiring around 60 was normal in germany until recently .
firms often preferred to push aside expensive older employees in favor of cheaper , younger ones , and the government facilitated this by subsidizing early retirement schemes . early retirement made appealing to employers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these four know how to enjoy themselves after a lifetime of work the plans are intended to lure older employees away before they reach official pension age with plump buyout settlements partly paid by the government .
they were part of a massive daimlerchrysler restructuring push called " cultural model 60 " to get rid of any employee over age 60 deemed unessential . for the employee getting the soft boot , the plan " is a face-saving option , " said zimmermann .
" and the government subsidies make it very attractive for employers . " it was not until the 1990s that people begin to realize the cost of putting potentially productive workers out to pasture to feed off the system instead of feeding their work into it , zimmerman added . is retirement the right way to go ? although the current subsidies , which will be phased out in 2009 , are a lower than earlier government payouts , some involved in the debate say it is still too easy for workers take early retirement and businesses to offer it . " replacing one bad idea with another bad idea is n't a good solution , " said the iwk 's schäfer .
" germany does n't need it ; it provides the wrong sort of incentive .
if older people lose their job , they should have to go out and find a new one . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is he reading the job ads ?
he insists that , despite common wisdom that people over 40 face a much more difficult employment outlook , the jobs are there to be had " if they are prepared to compromise " on such issues as training , salary and location . zimmermann said he sees things differently . " in the past , subsidized early retirement programs have been abused , " he admitted .
however , " we are not convinced so far that employers are really willing to retain older employees .
if you see how eagerly , how intensively companies have used these programs , it not a very encouraging sign .
it does n't send a signal of trust to the older workers . " a study published monday by the bertelsmann institute showed most workers would like to stay at their desks after their 60th birthday and have more of a hand in determining the conditions of their retirement . researchers interviewed 1,000 workers between the ages of 35 and 55 on their attitudes toward retirement and found some 61 percent said they would like to decide for themselves when to collect their gold watches , sometime between the age 60 and 67 . graying population a danger to pension system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's pension system needs more people staying at their desks longer the sexagenarians ' decision to stay on the job is also important for germany , according to the report . " given the demographic developments , the country urgently needs a social paradigm shift in favor of a longer working life , " bertelsmann institute head johannes meier told reporters when he presented the study 's results . the number of workers aged between 50 and 64 across the eu will increase by 25 percent over the next two decades while those aged 20 to 29 will decrease by 20 percent , leaving german economists wringing their hands over the impending skilled-labor shortage and fretting over the country 's pay-as-you-go pension system , which is already teetering on the brink of insolvency . " this -lrb- pension -rrb- system will break down if there are not enough people working , " schäfer said .
" the dilemma can be solved by lowering the amount of pensions people get , increasing the amount people have to pay in , or raising the retirement age .
and in fact we are going to have to do all three of those at the same time .

her appeal aggravated family tensions , but raised valid questions on german art subsidies . richard wagner wrote operas and his descendants seem to be living in one . the composer founded the bayreuth festival in 1876 and it 's been a family-run show since then .
his grandson , 86-year-old wolfgang wagner , has been single-handedly directing the annual opera event since his brother wieland 's death in 1966 and it looks like his daughter katharina , 28 , will be the next to take the reigns . then there is nike wagner , wieland 's daughter - wolfgang 's niece - who successfully directs her own arts festival in weimar . nike wag n er wa n ts cuts i n bayreuth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner in an article in the july edition of german cultural and political magazine cicero , nike wagner made an explicit appeal that cuts be made to the state subsidies her family 's festival receives .
the bayreuth festival currently receives 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 2.1 million -rrb- each from the federal government , the state of bavaria and the city of bayreuth . " it 's difficult to understand why this festival , which is sold out years in advance and can work risk-free , continues to receive millions in public funds instead of hiking the ticket prices for a period of time and making the funds available to needier cultural institutions , festivals and cities , " nike wagner wrote . public mo n ey will co n ti n ue to roll i n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner directs the " kunstfest " in weimar the german news magazine focus estimated that prices would need to be raised by 70 percent to compensate for public funds to the seen-and-be-seen event .
the current maximum ticket price for an evening at the bayreuth festival is 208 euros -lrb- $ 263 -rrb- , but the waiting list to get one of them can run up to 10 years .
the german culture council wrote that last year 370,000 orders were made for around 54,000 tickets , so there 's no danger of empty seats . the demands of richard wagner 's great-granddaughter , who is also franz liszt 's great-great-granddaughter , seem to have fallen on deaf ears .
during his visit to the festival 's opening , german culture minister bernd neumann announced tuesday that the federal government 's financial contribution to the event would remain unchanged . a festival made stale by subsidies ? nike wagner 's article , actually a parallel chronicle of the two music festivals in weimar and bayreuth , contained some harsh barbs that infer nothing other than a family feud . " the wagner festival concerns itself year in and year out with the reproduction of its own myth , always subjected to the same program , the same pieces , and it froze up in routine and modernity during the 1970s , " she wrote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayreuth guests like former president roman herzog could afford a price hike , but should they have to ?
as for the leadership in bayreuth , not only have " media strategies " and elements of spectacle removed from art and intellect " gained ground , but the " regime " there has been " compared to a police state by many artists , " nike wagner added .
in weimar , of course , " the police state has ended . " not everyo n e agrees germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung meanwhile commented that as an intelligent person , nike wagner " should forego petty battles with the hostile family clan . "
besides , she " should know that raising the ticket prices at the bayreuth festival would be against the will of her great-grandfather richard . " family quarrels aside , does nike wagner have a point ?
why should a festival that could more than support itself receive public money ? dw-world.de spoke with andreas wiesand , director of two cultural research organizations , about subsidies for the arts .

this week , he introduced the press to his successor , 50-year-old norbert reithofer . forced retirement at 60 remains more the exception than the rule in germany , and it applies mainly to family-controlled concerns like bmw and bertelsmann , explained andreas zimmermann , director for social policy at the german confederation of managers , a berlin lobbying organization that represents business managers . socially accepted discrimination ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panke is out of the driver 's seat whether he likes it or not " in germany , it has always been socially accepted to treat older employees differently , " zimmermann said .
" only a few people perceive it as real discrimination .
on the contrary , if older employees were given the opportunity to leave early , it was more welcomed than criticized . " germany 's officially mandated retirement age is currently 65 and a new law will gradually increase it to 67 over the next three years .
but in reality , the average german already leaves work at 63 , when early retirement and disabilities are taken into consideration , according to holger schäfer of the cologne institute for economic research -lrb- iwk -rrb- . in fact , retiring around 60 was normal in germany until recently .

" a study published monday by the bertelsmann institute showed most workers would like to stay at their desks after their 60th birthday and have more of a hand in determining the conditions of their retirement . researchers interviewed 1,000 workers between the ages of 35 and 55 on their attitudes toward retirement and found some 61 percent said they would like to decide for themselves when to collect their gold watches , sometime between the age 60 and 67 . graying population a danger to pension system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's pension system needs more people staying at their desks longer the sexagenarians ' decision to stay on the job is also important for germany , according to the report .

the aircraft are part of a controversial billion-euro deal , which has the opposition questioning the project 's aim . the eurofighter deal is one of the largest defense projects in germany .
the first four aircraft - at a price of 74 million euros -lrb- $ 94 million -rrb- each - landed at the air force base in bavaria 's neuburg an der donau this week . the european aerospace group eads will deliver 180 fighter jets over the next few years to germany in a contract totaling over 21 billion euros .

" the us rider will ask for a counter analysis in the coming days , it added .
the b sample test will be again carried out by france 's national anti-doping laboratory at chatenay-malabry . phonak said landis would not ride until the matter had been clarified and said that if the b sample analysis confirmed the result of the a sample , the rider would be dismissed . the test was done on the evening of his victory in the 17th stage of the tour de france to morzine when he managed to claim the mountainous stage victory after a 130km solo breakaway . the 30-year-old american regained the yellow jersey two days after winning in morzine and won the race overall in paris on july 23 . where is he ? the news comes as mystery surrounded the whereabouts of the american champion after he withdrew from two races in the netherlands and denmark the day after cycling 's world governing body uci announced a rider on the tour had failed a doping test . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landis warmed up for the 19th stage the anp dutch news agency said landis pulled out of a race in chaam on wednesday evening after medical advice but this reason for not appearing was not confirmed by race organizers . it was also discovered that landis would not be coming to thursday 's grand prix jyske bank race , the danish organizers said in a statement . landis did show top form however to win the stiphout criterium in the netherlands on tuesday night . another blow for the race this year 's tour was rocked by a drugs scandal on the eve of the race which saw 13 riders , including pre-race favorites jan ullrich of germany and italy 's ivan basso barred from taking part after they were implicated in a spanish blood-doping ring . it was the latest in a series of high-profile drugs controversies to tarnish cycling over the past decade , with the tour de france being particularly hard hit . ullrich , the 1997 champion , and giro d 'italia winner basso both denied any involvement .
ullrich was subsequently sacked by his t-mobile team . t-mobile also suspended his team mate oscar sevilla and sporting director rudy pevenage . tv coverage german public television station zdf said thursday it might cease broadcasting the tour de france in reaction to landis testing positive for testosterone . " we signed a broadcasting contract for a sporting event , not a show demonstrating the performances of the pharmaceutical industry , " zdf 's editor-in-chief nikolaus brender said .

the aircraft are part of a controversial billion-euro deal , which has the opposition questioning the project 's aim . the eurofighter deal is one of the largest defense projects in germany .

these will form the backbone of the country 's air defense , replacing the phantom aircraft . but this controversial acquisition by the german armed forces or bundeswehr , has long been the focus of criticism .
when the eurofighter typhoon was developed 25 years ago , the world still looked very different .
it was the cold war ; the warsaw pact still existed . war scenarios at the time were still based on the assumption that western europe could be attacked from the east .
so a fighter jet was planned that could compete with the russian mig aircraft .

he said there were military strategists who believed there would be a return to national defense , with the classic threatening scenario of highly armed old-fashioned war between nations .

the scene , caught on russian tv cameras filming the g8 meetings in russia and blitzed around the world via the internet , shows a caught-off-guard chancellor breaking off mid-sentence with italian prime minister romano prodi to jerk her shoulders and throw up her balled fists .
one can almost here the " yuck " in her grimace .
still , it was a pretty hot moment for the g8 .
love attack the incident at first was overshadowed by other slips at the normally staid and staged meetings - such as one in which bush uses an expletive in a candid conversation with british prime minister tony blair when he did n't know was being taped .
but a few days after the meetings , the video clip became one of the most downloaded and shared clips on the web , inspiring columns , comedians and even political pundits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she is no gerhard schröder " bush : love attack on merkel ! " read the headline in german mass-market tabloid bild .
comedian jon stewart on the " daily show " wondered out loud if the president realized that , " you do n't do that to women you do n't know , especially the chancellor of germany . "
some wondered if bush was n't reverting to his fratboy days .
" this isn ’ t a sigma chi kegger , it 's the g-8 summit , ” wrote blogger christy hardin smith on firedoglake.com before being informed bush was actually a member of the delta kappa epsilon fraternity .
lessons on taste and etiquette some seized on the opportunity to criticize the president politically .
" when he is away from his script and his handlers , his true lack of intelligence and emotional maturity surfaces for all to see , " wrote bloggers on the dialogue international web site , which focuses transatlantic issues .
" the dangerous situation in lebanon ... requires true leadership .
do n't look for it from the world 's uberpower . "
the incident was seized upon by some liberals .
steve young 's blog on the huffington post web site called bush the " lounge lizard in chief " and extolled the " the irony of a president who 's supposed to represent our best , giving the chancellor of germany an inappropriate and unrequested backrub . "
sexual-harassment training , maybe ?
many bloggers wondered if the president was n't up-to-date on sexual harassment rules and office etiquette .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she did n't turn away then larry sabato , professor of politics at the university of virginia , told the associated press that today , public figures have to be more careful in " a thousand ways " even as he values the honesty of web sites like youtube , which posted the video .
" if they 're not doing something that 's embarrassing , they have nothing to worry about , " he said .
" a president ought to know enough not use an expletive in a fairly open meeting , and almost any male alive today knows that you do n't offer uninvited massages to any female , much less the chancellor of germany . "
bush fans pooh-pooh the matter saying that it was nothing to get worked up about .
" president bush just ca n't win , " said fox news ' karen hanretty .
" are n't these the same women who have been angry about cowboy diplomacy ?
do they want a kinder , more sensitive bush - or a cowboy ?

" the sovereign task of securing air space has never been effectively transferred to switzerland , " the court said in its ruling . german officials at the transport ministry said they would wait for the court 's written judgment before commenting on the ruling series of errors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court said pilots were not at fault for the crash an inquiry concluded last year that a catastrophic chain of human error , system failures and technical problems had led to the collision . " this would have led eventually to the overload of the only air traffic controller working at the time and ultimately would have caused the collision between the planes , " the court said . had a warning program and telephone , which were undergoing repairs at the time of the accident , been in working order , the crash could have been avoided , according to wilhelm müller , who was the case 's chief judge . a single skyguide controller-manned station instructed the pilot of the russian plane to descend to avoid a collision despite instruments aboard the plane saying he should climb .
the dhl plane 's instruments also told it to climb to the same level , which led to its tail fin cutting through the russian jet killing all 69 aboard as well the two german dhl pilots . in 2004 , a russian man who lost his wife and two children in the disaster stabbed to death a swiss air traffic controller who had been under investigation in connection with the collision . cases still pending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial was built for the crash victims the court said it will rule at a later date on the amount of the compensation to be paid to bashkirian airlines .
the company has sought 2.6 million euros -lrb- $ 3.3 million -rrb- in damages from germany . two additional civil cases are also waiting for the court 's attention .
dhl and 19 insurance companies are suing germany for 36 million euros -lrb- $ 45 million -rrb- in damages .
in the second suit , skyguide 's swiss insurance company , winterthur , is suing bashkirian for 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- decisions on compensation for pain and suffering by the victims ' families are also pending in constance and in switzerland .

while the former has a broader europea n focus , the latter explores cultural issues withi n germa n y . do you agree with nike wag n er that subsidies to the bayreuth wag n er festival should be cut ? she does have a point there .
in germany we have little legal basis for art funding .
it is more or less done on a day-to-day basis of means .
the german federal court once issued a ruling to the effect that money is scarce so it should go to those artists and events that need it .
often the money goes to the more popular events anyway .
the bayreuth festival gets 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 2.15 million -rrb- from the federal government , which may sound like a lot but it 's not really that much .
we spend over two billion euros per year for theater in germany .
one should also not forget that the family affair has a big part in this .
the wagner family situation has been called a soap opera . what is the goal behi n d public arts subsidies i n germa n y ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesand : new media art is n't part of the subsidy infrastructure yet germany does n't have a clear cut cultural financing policy .
it 's a wild mixture of cities , lä n der -lrb- states -rrb- and the federal government , so that 's a very difficult question to answer .
germany has n't had a discussion about this , like some other countries have .
we conduct surveys and it is astonishing that the general public does not question art subsidies , which may be different elsewhere .

her appeal aggravated family tensions , but raised valid questions on german art subsidies . richard wagner wrote operas and his descendants seem to be living in one . the composer founded the bayreuth festival in 1876 and it 's been a family-run show since then .
his grandson , 86-year-old wolfgang wagner , has been single-handedly directing the annual opera event since his brother wieland 's death in 1966 and it looks like his daughter katharina , 28 , will be the next to take the reigns . then there is nike wagner , wieland 's daughter - wolfgang 's niece - who successfully directs her own arts festival in weimar . nike wag n er wa n ts cuts i n bayreuth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner in an article in the july edition of german cultural and political magazine cicero , nike wagner made an explicit appeal that cuts be made to the state subsidies her family 's festival receives .
the bayreuth festival currently receives 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 2.1 million -rrb- each from the federal government , the state of bavaria and the city of bayreuth . " it 's difficult to understand why this festival , which is sold out years in advance and can work risk-free , continues to receive millions in public funds instead of hiking the ticket prices for a period of time and making the funds available to needier cultural institutions , festivals and cities , " nike wagner wrote . public mo n ey will co n ti n ue to roll i n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner directs the " kunstfest " in weimar the german news magazine focus estimated that prices would need to be raised by 70 percent to compensate for public funds to the seen-and-be-seen event .
the current maximum ticket price for an evening at the bayreuth festival is 208 euros -lrb- $ 263 -rrb- , but the waiting list to get one of them can run up to 10 years .
the german culture council wrote that last year 370,000 orders were made for around 54,000 tickets , so there 's no danger of empty seats . the demands of richard wagner 's great-granddaughter , who is also franz liszt 's great-great-granddaughter , seem to have fallen on deaf ears .
during his visit to the festival 's opening , german culture minister bernd neumann announced tuesday that the federal government 's financial contribution to the event would remain unchanged . a festival made stale by subsidies ? nike wagner 's article , actually a parallel chronicle of the two music festivals in weimar and bayreuth , contained some harsh barbs that infer nothing other than a family feud . " the wagner festival concerns itself year in and year out with the reproduction of its own myth , always subjected to the same program , the same pieces , and it froze up in routine and modernity during the 1970s , " she wrote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayreuth guests like former president roman herzog could afford a price hike , but should they have to ?
as for the leadership in bayreuth , not only have " media strategies " and elements of spectacle removed from art and intellect " gained ground , but the " regime " there has been " compared to a police state by many artists , " nike wagner added .
in weimar , of course , " the police state has ended . " not everyo n e agrees germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung meanwhile commented that as an intelligent person , nike wagner " should forego petty battles with the hostile family clan . "

her appeal aggravated family tensions , but raised valid questions on german art subsidies . richard wagner wrote operas and his descendants seem to be living in one . the composer founded the bayreuth festival in 1876 and it 's been a family-run show since then .
his grandson , 86-year-old wolfgang wagner , has been single-handedly directing the annual opera event since his brother wieland 's death in 1966 and it looks like his daughter katharina , 28 , will be the next to take the reigns . then there is nike wagner , wieland 's daughter - wolfgang 's niece - who successfully directs her own arts festival in weimar . nike wag n er wa n ts cuts i n bayreuth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner in an article in the july edition of german cultural and political magazine cicero , nike wagner made an explicit appeal that cuts be made to the state subsidies her family 's festival receives .
the bayreuth festival currently receives 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 2.1 million -rrb- each from the federal government , the state of bavaria and the city of bayreuth . " it 's difficult to understand why this festival , which is sold out years in advance and can work risk-free , continues to receive millions in public funds instead of hiking the ticket prices for a period of time and making the funds available to needier cultural institutions , festivals and cities , " nike wagner wrote . public mo n ey will co n ti n ue to roll i n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner directs the " kunstfest " in weimar the german news magazine focus estimated that prices would need to be raised by 70 percent to compensate for public funds to the seen-and-be-seen event .
the current maximum ticket price for an evening at the bayreuth festival is 208 euros -lrb- $ 263 -rrb- , but the waiting list to get one of them can run up to 10 years .
the german culture council wrote that last year 370,000 orders were made for around 54,000 tickets , so there 's no danger of empty seats . the demands of richard wagner 's great-granddaughter , who is also franz liszt 's great-great-granddaughter , seem to have fallen on deaf ears .
during his visit to the festival 's opening , german culture minister bernd neumann announced tuesday that the federal government 's financial contribution to the event would remain unchanged . a festival made stale by subsidies ? nike wagner 's article , actually a parallel chronicle of the two music festivals in weimar and bayreuth , contained some harsh barbs that infer nothing other than a family feud . " the wagner festival concerns itself year in and year out with the reproduction of its own myth , always subjected to the same program , the same pieces , and it froze up in routine and modernity during the 1970s , " she wrote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayreuth guests like former president roman herzog could afford a price hike , but should they have to ?
as for the leadership in bayreuth , not only have " media strategies " and elements of spectacle removed from art and intellect " gained ground , but the " regime " there has been " compared to a police state by many artists , " nike wagner added .
in weimar , of course , " the police state has ended . " not everyo n e agrees germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung meanwhile commented that as an intelligent person , nike wagner " should forego petty battles with the hostile family clan . "
besides , she " should know that raising the ticket prices at the bayreuth festival would be against the will of her great-grandfather richard . " family quarrels aside , does nike wagner have a point ?
why should a festival that could more than support itself receive public money ? dw-world.de spoke with andreas wiesand , director of two cultural research organizations , about subsidies for the arts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.07.2006 germans debate need for new high-tech fighter jets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers welcomed the new eurofighters to germany on tuesday the european aerospace group eads handed over four eurofighter jets to the german air force this week .
the aircraft are part of a controversial billion-euro deal , which has the opposition questioning the project 's aim . the eurofighter deal is one of the largest defense projects in germany .
the first four aircraft - at a price of 74 million euros -lrb- $ 94 million -rrb- each - landed at the air force base in bavaria 's neuburg an der donau this week . the european aerospace group eads will deliver 180 fighter jets over the next few years to germany in a contract totaling over 21 billion euros .
these will form the backbone of the country 's air defense , replacing the phantom aircraft . but this controversial acquisition by the german armed forces or bundeswehr , has long been the focus of criticism .
when the eurofighter typhoon was developed 25 years ago , the world still looked very different .
it was the cold war ; the warsaw pact still existed . war scenarios at the time were still based on the assumption that western europe could be attacked from the east .
so a fighter jet was planned that could compete with the russian mig aircraft .
now , air battles over europe are scenarios from the past . co n tribute to soldiers ' safety abroad in view of the changed situation in the world , it has become controversial whether the german armed forces even really need 180 fighter jets .
and how should they be deployed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers are also deployed in afghanistan " i think the general security situation shows that the number of eurofighters is absolutely necessary , " said bernd siebert , defense spokesman for chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" they will be a significant part of ensuring our soldiers ' safety on foreign deployments . " he said german soldiers increasingly face dangerous situations during their missions abroad .
the german armed forces long ago changed from an army for national defense to a mobile deployment force , operating worldwide on peacekeeping missions . " if i look at the development in afghanistan , i can imagine that it will become necessary to deploy our eurofighters for intelligence and for protecting our soldiers , which have gotten into trouble , " siebert said . oppositio n : n ot n eeded for peacekeepi n g the opposition green party fought against the eurofighter for a long time , as it considered the billion-euro defense project to be outdated .
it does n't agree with the conservatives on the purpose of the deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eurofighter typhoon is now in service in germany , spain , italy and britain " in all of the conflicts in which the bundeswehr is deployed under a un mandate or with an alliance , there is n't one single case where a weapons system such as the eurofighter is needed , " said andreas bonde , the green 's defense spokesman . he added it was an instrument required for warfare between highly armed nations . " but in our missions today , where it 's about nation building and stabilization measures , we do n't need weapons systems like this , " bonde said . no lo n ger meeti n g the bu n deswehr 's n eeds both the cdu and the greens agree that the eurofighter should be deployed for a very clear purpose within germany 's borders , namely in air surveillance or " air policing . " " but we do n't need 180 of them for that , " bonde said .
he said there were military strategists who believed there would be a return to national defense , with the classic threatening scenario of highly armed old-fashioned war between nations . " i luckily consider this scenario to be unrealistic and in this respect , i have serious doubts that security policy investments are being made in a meaningful direction with this defense system , " bonde said . mechthild brockamp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eads appoints rail chief and outsider to top spots the european aerospace group eads has appointed the head of the french railway system and an industry outsider to lead the company after forcing out two top executives blamed for delays to its airbus a380 superjumbo .

the aircraft are part of a controversial billion-euro deal , which has the opposition questioning the project 's aim . the eurofighter deal is one of the largest defense projects in germany .
the first four aircraft - at a price of 74 million euros -lrb- $ 94 million -rrb- each - landed at the air force base in bavaria 's neuburg an der donau this week . the european aerospace group eads will deliver 180 fighter jets over the next few years to germany in a contract totaling over 21 billion euros .
these will form the backbone of the country 's air defense , replacing the phantom aircraft . but this controversial acquisition by the german armed forces or bundeswehr , has long been the focus of criticism .
when the eurofighter typhoon was developed 25 years ago , the world still looked very different .
it was the cold war ; the warsaw pact still existed . war scenarios at the time were still based on the assumption that western europe could be attacked from the east .

germany 's pension confusion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more germans want to decide when to call it a career germany has decided to boost its mandatory retirement age from 65 to 67 .
at the same time , many firms are shedding older workers with help from subsidized retirement plans .
is germany suffering from pension confusion ? bmw 's ultra-successful ceo helmut panke will resign from his post on sept.1 , even though he really does n't want to .
he 's leaving because on aug .
31 , he reaches the company 's mandatory retirement age of 60 .
this week , he introduced the press to his successor , 50-year-old norbert reithofer . forced retirement at 60 remains more the exception than the rule in germany , and it applies mainly to family-controlled concerns like bmw and bertelsmann , explained andreas zimmermann , director for social policy at the german confederation of managers , a berlin lobbying organization that represents business managers . socially accepted discrimination ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panke is out of the driver 's seat whether he likes it or not " in germany , it has always been socially accepted to treat older employees differently , " zimmermann said .
" only a few people perceive it as real discrimination .
on the contrary , if older employees were given the opportunity to leave early , it was more welcomed than criticized . " germany 's officially mandated retirement age is currently 65 and a new law will gradually increase it to 67 over the next three years .
but in reality , the average german already leaves work at 63 , when early retirement and disabilities are taken into consideration , according to holger schäfer of the cologne institute for economic research -lrb- iwk -rrb- . in fact , retiring around 60 was normal in germany until recently .
firms often preferred to push aside expensive older employees in favor of cheaper , younger ones , and the government facilitated this by subsidizing early retirement schemes . early retirement made appealing to employers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these four know how to enjoy themselves after a lifetime of work the plans are intended to lure older employees away before they reach official pension age with plump buyout settlements partly paid by the government .
they were part of a massive daimlerchrysler restructuring push called " cultural model 60 " to get rid of any employee over age 60 deemed unessential . for the employee getting the soft boot , the plan " is a face-saving option , " said zimmermann .
" and the government subsidies make it very attractive for employers . " it was not until the 1990s that people begin to realize the cost of putting potentially productive workers out to pasture to feed off the system instead of feeding their work into it , zimmerman added . is retirement the right way to go ? although the current subsidies , which will be phased out in 2009 , are a lower than earlier government payouts , some involved in the debate say it is still too easy for workers take early retirement and businesses to offer it . " replacing one bad idea with another bad idea is n't a good solution , " said the iwk 's schäfer .
" germany does n't need it ; it provides the wrong sort of incentive .
if older people lose their job , they should have to go out and find a new one . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is he reading the job ads ?
he insists that , despite common wisdom that people over 40 face a much more difficult employment outlook , the jobs are there to be had " if they are prepared to compromise " on such issues as training , salary and location . zimmermann said he sees things differently . " in the past , subsidized early retirement programs have been abused , " he admitted .
however , " we are not convinced so far that employers are really willing to retain older employees .
if you see how eagerly , how intensively companies have used these programs , it not a very encouraging sign .
it does n't send a signal of trust to the older workers . " a study published monday by the bertelsmann institute showed most workers would like to stay at their desks after their 60th birthday and have more of a hand in determining the conditions of their retirement . researchers interviewed 1,000 workers between the ages of 35 and 55 on their attitudes toward retirement and found some 61 percent said they would like to decide for themselves when to collect their gold watches , sometime between the age 60 and 67 . graying population a danger to pension system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's pension system needs more people staying at their desks longer the sexagenarians ' decision to stay on the job is also important for germany , according to the report . " given the demographic developments , the country urgently needs a social paradigm shift in favor of a longer working life , " bertelsmann institute head johannes meier told reporters when he presented the study 's results . the number of workers aged between 50 and 64 across the eu will increase by 25 percent over the next two decades while those aged 20 to 29 will decrease by 20 percent , leaving german economists wringing their hands over the impending skilled-labor shortage and fretting over the country 's pay-as-you-go pension system , which is already teetering on the brink of insolvency . " this -lrb- pension -rrb- system will break down if there are not enough people working , " schäfer said .
" the dilemma can be solved by lowering the amount of pensions people get , increasing the amount people have to pay in , or raising the retirement age .
and in fact we are going to have to do all three of those at the same time .

while the former has a broader europea n focus , the latter explores cultural issues withi n germa n y . do you agree with nike wag n er that subsidies to the bayreuth wag n er festival should be cut ? she does have a point there .
in germany we have little legal basis for art funding .
it is more or less done on a day-to-day basis of means .
the german federal court once issued a ruling to the effect that money is scarce so it should go to those artists and events that need it .
often the money goes to the more popular events anyway .
the bayreuth festival gets 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 2.15 million -rrb- from the federal government , which may sound like a lot but it 's not really that much .
we spend over two billion euros per year for theater in germany .
one should also not forget that the family affair has a big part in this .
the wagner family situation has been called a soap opera . what is the goal behi n d public arts subsidies i n germa n y ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesand : new media art is n't part of the subsidy infrastructure yet germany does n't have a clear cut cultural financing policy .
it 's a wild mixture of cities , lä n der -lrb- states -rrb- and the federal government , so that 's a very difficult question to answer .
germany has n't had a discussion about this , like some other countries have .
we conduct surveys and it is astonishing that the general public does not question art subsidies , which may be different elsewhere .
it 's very traditional here .
a town with 30,000 residents can have its own opera - like coburg next to bayreuth .
that 's because of history : these towns were once capitals of little states and they wanted to have their share of the arts . if fu n di n g to the wag n er festival were to be cut , where should the mo n ey be redirected ? there are so many events that deserve something , not only -lrb- nike wagner 's kunstfestival in -rrb- weimar .
nike wagner is quite active in getting money from different sources , so she should n't complain .
i can understand her .
she 's more avant-garde , which would make the bayreuth festival interesting if she took over there , but that 's already out of the question .
there are other , less traditional sectors in germany too , which do n't yet have a proper place in this infrastructure : cultural education , community arts , immigrants , new media art .
subsidies have been stable in germany in the last few years , with a total expenditure of about eight billion euros per year .
actually , the real costs have been going down slightly , but not as much as in other countries . what do you expect from this year 's wag n er festival ? i have n't been in many years , so i really ca n't say .
but it 's always really remarkable .
i have a tip for anyone who wants to get tickets .
if you 're from very far away , your chances of getting tickets are much better .

the scene , caught on russian tv cameras filming the g8 meetings in russia and blitzed around the world via the internet , shows a caught-off-guard chancellor breaking off mid-sentence with italian prime minister romano prodi to jerk her shoulders and throw up her balled fists .
one can almost here the " yuck " in her grimace .
still , it was a pretty hot moment for the g8 .
love attack the incident at first was overshadowed by other slips at the normally staid and staged meetings - such as one in which bush uses an expletive in a candid conversation with british prime minister tony blair when he did n't know was being taped .
but a few days after the meetings , the video clip became one of the most downloaded and shared clips on the web , inspiring columns , comedians and even political pundits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she is no gerhard schröder " bush : love attack on merkel ! " read the headline in german mass-market tabloid bild .
comedian jon stewart on the " daily show " wondered out loud if the president realized that , " you do n't do that to women you do n't know , especially the chancellor of germany . "
some wondered if bush was n't reverting to his fratboy days .
" this isn ’ t a sigma chi kegger , it 's the g-8 summit , ” wrote blogger christy hardin smith on firedoglake.com before being informed bush was actually a member of the delta kappa epsilon fraternity .
lessons on taste and etiquette some seized on the opportunity to criticize the president politically .
" when he is away from his script and his handlers , his true lack of intelligence and emotional maturity surfaces for all to see , " wrote bloggers on the dialogue international web site , which focuses transatlantic issues .
" the dangerous situation in lebanon ... requires true leadership .
do n't look for it from the world 's uberpower . "
the incident was seized upon by some liberals .
steve young 's blog on the huffington post web site called bush the " lounge lizard in chief " and extolled the " the irony of a president who 's supposed to represent our best , giving the chancellor of germany an inappropriate and unrequested backrub . "
sexual-harassment training , maybe ?
many bloggers wondered if the president was n't up-to-date on sexual harassment rules and office etiquette .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she did n't turn away then larry sabato , professor of politics at the university of virginia , told the associated press that today , public figures have to be more careful in " a thousand ways " even as he values the honesty of web sites like youtube , which posted the video .
" if they 're not doing something that 's embarrassing , they have nothing to worry about , " he said .
" a president ought to know enough not use an expletive in a fairly open meeting , and almost any male alive today knows that you do n't offer uninvited massages to any female , much less the chancellor of germany . "
bush fans pooh-pooh the matter saying that it was nothing to get worked up about .
" president bush just ca n't win , " said fox news ' karen hanretty .
" are n't these the same women who have been angry about cowboy diplomacy ?
do they want a kinder , more sensitive bush - or a cowboy ?

while the former has a broader europea n focus , the latter explores cultural issues withi n germa n y . do you agree with nike wag n er that subsidies to the bayreuth wag n er festival should be cut ? she does have a point there .
in germany we have little legal basis for art funding .
it is more or less done on a day-to-day basis of means .
the german federal court once issued a ruling to the effect that money is scarce so it should go to those artists and events that need it .
often the money goes to the more popular events anyway .
the bayreuth festival gets 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 2.15 million -rrb- from the federal government , which may sound like a lot but it 's not really that much .
we spend over two billion euros per year for theater in germany .
one should also not forget that the family affair has a big part in this .
the wagner family situation has been called a soap opera . what is the goal behi n d public arts subsidies i n germa n y ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesand : new media art is n't part of the subsidy infrastructure yet germany does n't have a clear cut cultural financing policy .
it 's a wild mixture of cities , lä n der -lrb- states -rrb- and the federal government , so that 's a very difficult question to answer .
germany has n't had a discussion about this , like some other countries have .
we conduct surveys and it is astonishing that the general public does not question art subsidies , which may be different elsewhere .
it 's very traditional here .
a town with 30,000 residents can have its own opera - like coburg next to bayreuth .
that 's because of history : these towns were once capitals of little states and they wanted to have their share of the arts . if fu n di n g to the wag n er festival were to be cut , where should the mo n ey be redirected ? there are so many events that deserve something , not only -lrb- nike wagner 's kunstfestival in -rrb- weimar .
nike wagner is quite active in getting money from different sources , so she should n't complain .
i can understand her .
she 's more avant-garde , which would make the bayreuth festival interesting if she took over there , but that 's already out of the question .
there are other , less traditional sectors in germany too , which do n't yet have a proper place in this infrastructure : cultural education , community arts , immigrants , new media art .
subsidies have been stable in germany in the last few years , with a total expenditure of about eight billion euros per year .
actually , the real costs have been going down slightly , but not as much as in other countries . what do you expect from this year 's wag n er festival ? i have n't been in many years , so i really ca n't say .
but it 's always really remarkable .
i have a tip for anyone who wants to get tickets .
if you 're from very far away , your chances of getting tickets are much better .
i thought about calling up my friend in chile and asking him to get tickets for me . kate bowen interviewed andreas wiesand send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drama and fantasy at bayreuth 's wagner festival german playwright and director tankred dorst 's brand new production of wagner 's 16-hour " ring " cycle tops the program for the one-month festival and has critics on the edge of their seats .
-lrb- july 25 , 2006 -rrb- german politicians cozy up to the arts politicians have always been keen to ingratiate themselves with the arts and culture community .
but are their gestures of support mere posturing - or will they translate into constructive policies ?

the german federal court once issued a ruling to the effect that money is scarce so it should go to those artists and events that need it .
often the money goes to the more popular events anyway .
the bayreuth festival gets 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 2.15 million -rrb- from the federal government , which may sound like a lot but it 's not really that much .
we spend over two billion euros per year for theater in germany .
one should also not forget that the family affair has a big part in this .
the wagner family situation has been called a soap opera . what is the goal behi n d public arts subsidies i n germa n y ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesand : new media art is n't part of the subsidy infrastructure yet germany does n't have a clear cut cultural financing policy .
it 's a wild mixture of cities , lä n der -lrb- states -rrb- and the federal government , so that 's a very difficult question to answer .
germany has n't had a discussion about this , like some other countries have .
we conduct surveys and it is astonishing that the general public does not question art subsidies , which may be different elsewhere .
it 's very traditional here .
a town with 30,000 residents can have its own opera - like coburg next to bayreuth .
that 's because of history : these towns were once capitals of little states and they wanted to have their share of the arts . if fu n di n g to the wag n er festival were to be cut , where should the mo n ey be redirected ? there are so many events that deserve something , not only -lrb- nike wagner 's kunstfestival in -rrb- weimar .
nike wagner is quite active in getting money from different sources , so she should n't complain .
i can understand her .
she 's more avant-garde , which would make the bayreuth festival interesting if she took over there , but that 's already out of the question .
there are other , less traditional sectors in germany too , which do n't yet have a proper place in this infrastructure : cultural education , community arts , immigrants , new media art .
subsidies have been stable in germany in the last few years , with a total expenditure of about eight billion euros per year .
actually , the real costs have been going down slightly , but not as much as in other countries . what do you expect from this year 's wag n er festival ? i have n't been in many years , so i really ca n't say .
but it 's always really remarkable .
i have a tip for anyone who wants to get tickets .
if you 're from very far away , your chances of getting tickets are much better .

the scene , caught on russian tv cameras filming the g8 meetings in russia and blitzed around the world via the internet , shows a caught-off-guard chancellor breaking off mid-sentence with italian prime minister romano prodi to jerk her shoulders and throw up her balled fists .
one can almost here the " yuck " in her grimace .
still , it was a pretty hot moment for the g8 .
love attack the incident at first was overshadowed by other slips at the normally staid and staged meetings - such as one in which bush uses an expletive in a candid conversation with british prime minister tony blair when he did n't know was being taped .
but a few days after the meetings , the video clip became one of the most downloaded and shared clips on the web , inspiring columns , comedians and even political pundits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she is no gerhard schröder " bush : love attack on merkel ! " read the headline in german mass-market tabloid bild .
comedian jon stewart on the " daily show " wondered out loud if the president realized that , " you do n't do that to women you do n't know , especially the chancellor of germany . "
some wondered if bush was n't reverting to his fratboy days .
" this isn ’ t a sigma chi kegger , it 's the g-8 summit , ” wrote blogger christy hardin smith on firedoglake.com before being informed bush was actually a member of the delta kappa epsilon fraternity .
lessons on taste and etiquette some seized on the opportunity to criticize the president politically .
" when he is away from his script and his handlers , his true lack of intelligence and emotional maturity surfaces for all to see , " wrote bloggers on the dialogue international web site , which focuses transatlantic issues .
" the dangerous situation in lebanon ... requires true leadership .
do n't look for it from the world 's uberpower . "
the incident was seized upon by some liberals .
steve young 's blog on the huffington post web site called bush the " lounge lizard in chief " and extolled the " the irony of a president who 's supposed to represent our best , giving the chancellor of germany an inappropriate and unrequested backrub . "
sexual-harassment training , maybe ?
many bloggers wondered if the president was n't up-to-date on sexual harassment rules and office etiquette .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she did n't turn away then larry sabato , professor of politics at the university of virginia , told the associated press that today , public figures have to be more careful in " a thousand ways " even as he values the honesty of web sites like youtube , which posted the video .
" if they 're not doing something that 's embarrassing , they have nothing to worry about , " he said .
" a president ought to know enough not use an expletive in a fairly open meeting , and almost any male alive today knows that you do n't offer uninvited massages to any female , much less the chancellor of germany . "
bush fans pooh-pooh the matter saying that it was nothing to get worked up about .
" president bush just ca n't win , " said fox news ' karen hanretty .
" are n't these the same women who have been angry about cowboy diplomacy ?
do they want a kinder , more sensitive bush - or a cowboy ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the wagner festival in bayreuth drama and fantasy at bayreuth 's wagner festival bravos and boos for new " ring " production in bayreuth debate over subsidies brings drama backstage in bayreuth schlingensief 's " parsifal " deepens divide at wagner festival culture & lifestyle -pipe- 27.07.2006 " germany does n't have a clear cut cultural financing policy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german state spends 2 billion euros a year on theater , wiesand said culture researcher andreas wiesand talked with dw-world.de about the wagner family " soap opera " and said that germany 's arts subsidies are deeply rooted in history so the general public does n't question them . a n dreas wiesa n d is the director of ericarts -lrb- europea n i n stitute for comparative cultural research -rrb- a n d the ce n ter for cultural research .
while the former has a broader europea n focus , the latter explores cultural issues withi n germa n y . do you agree with nike wag n er that subsidies to the bayreuth wag n er festival should be cut ? she does have a point there .
in germany we have little legal basis for art funding .
it is more or less done on a day-to-day basis of means .
the german federal court once issued a ruling to the effect that money is scarce so it should go to those artists and events that need it .
often the money goes to the more popular events anyway .
the bayreuth festival gets 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 2.15 million -rrb- from the federal government , which may sound like a lot but it 's not really that much .
we spend over two billion euros per year for theater in germany .
one should also not forget that the family affair has a big part in this .
the wagner family situation has been called a soap opera . what is the goal behi n d public arts subsidies i n germa n y ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesand : new media art is n't part of the subsidy infrastructure yet germany does n't have a clear cut cultural financing policy .
it 's a wild mixture of cities , lä n der -lrb- states -rrb- and the federal government , so that 's a very difficult question to answer .
germany has n't had a discussion about this , like some other countries have .
we conduct surveys and it is astonishing that the general public does not question art subsidies , which may be different elsewhere .
it 's very traditional here .
a town with 30,000 residents can have its own opera - like coburg next to bayreuth .
that 's because of history : these towns were once capitals of little states and they wanted to have their share of the arts . if fu n di n g to the wag n er festival were to be cut , where should the mo n ey be redirected ? there are so many events that deserve something , not only -lrb- nike wagner 's kunstfestival in -rrb- weimar .
nike wagner is quite active in getting money from different sources , so she should n't complain .
i can understand her .
she 's more avant-garde , which would make the bayreuth festival interesting if she took over there , but that 's already out of the question .
there are other , less traditional sectors in germany too , which do n't yet have a proper place in this infrastructure : cultural education , community arts , immigrants , new media art .
subsidies have been stable in germany in the last few years , with a total expenditure of about eight billion euros per year .
actually , the real costs have been going down slightly , but not as much as in other countries . what do you expect from this year 's wag n er festival ? i have n't been in many years , so i really ca n't say .
but it 's always really remarkable .
i have a tip for anyone who wants to get tickets .
if you 're from very far away , your chances of getting tickets are much better .
i thought about calling up my friend in chile and asking him to get tickets for me . kate bowen interviewed andreas wiesand send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drama and fantasy at bayreuth 's wagner festival german playwright and director tankred dorst 's brand new production of wagner 's 16-hour " ring " cycle tops the program for the one-month festival and has critics on the edge of their seats .
-lrb- july 25 , 2006 -rrb- german politicians cozy up to the arts politicians have always been keen to ingratiate themselves with the arts and culture community .
but are their gestures of support mere posturing - or will they translate into constructive policies ?

at the same time , many firms are shedding older workers with help from subsidized retirement plans .

on the contrary , if older employees were given the opportunity to leave early , it was more welcomed than criticized . " germany 's officially mandated retirement age is currently 65 and a new law will gradually increase it to 67 over the next three years .

31 , he reaches the company 's mandatory retirement age of 60 .
this week , he introduced the press to his successor , 50-year-old norbert reithofer . forced retirement at 60 remains more the exception than the rule in germany , and it applies mainly to family-controlled concerns like bmw and bertelsmann , explained andreas zimmermann , director for social policy at the german confederation of managers , a berlin lobbying organization that represents business managers . socially accepted discrimination ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panke is out of the driver 's seat whether he likes it or not " in germany , it has always been socially accepted to treat older employees differently , " zimmermann said .
" only a few people perceive it as real discrimination .
on the contrary , if older employees were given the opportunity to leave early , it was more welcomed than criticized . " germany 's officially mandated retirement age is currently 65 and a new law will gradually increase it to 67 over the next three years .
but in reality , the average german already leaves work at 63 , when early retirement and disabilities are taken into consideration , according to holger schäfer of the cologne institute for economic research -lrb- iwk -rrb- . in fact , retiring around 60 was normal in germany until recently .
firms often preferred to push aside expensive older employees in favor of cheaper , younger ones , and the government facilitated this by subsidizing early retirement schemes . early retirement made appealing to employers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these four know how to enjoy themselves after a lifetime of work the plans are intended to lure older employees away before they reach official pension age with plump buyout settlements partly paid by the government .
they were part of a massive daimlerchrysler restructuring push called " cultural model 60 " to get rid of any employee over age 60 deemed unessential . for the employee getting the soft boot , the plan " is a face-saving option , " said zimmermann .
" and the government subsidies make it very attractive for employers . " it was not until the 1990s that people begin to realize the cost of putting potentially productive workers out to pasture to feed off the system instead of feeding their work into it , zimmerman added . is retirement the right way to go ? although the current subsidies , which will be phased out in 2009 , are a lower than earlier government payouts , some involved in the debate say it is still too easy for workers take early retirement and businesses to offer it . " replacing one bad idea with another bad idea is n't a good solution , " said the iwk 's schäfer .
" germany does n't need it ; it provides the wrong sort of incentive .
if older people lose their job , they should have to go out and find a new one . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is he reading the job ads ?
he insists that , despite common wisdom that people over 40 face a much more difficult employment outlook , the jobs are there to be had " if they are prepared to compromise " on such issues as training , salary and location . zimmermann said he sees things differently . " in the past , subsidized early retirement programs have been abused , " he admitted .
however , " we are not convinced so far that employers are really willing to retain older employees .
if you see how eagerly , how intensively companies have used these programs , it not a very encouraging sign .
it does n't send a signal of trust to the older workers . " a study published monday by the bertelsmann institute showed most workers would like to stay at their desks after their 60th birthday and have more of a hand in determining the conditions of their retirement . researchers interviewed 1,000 workers between the ages of 35 and 55 on their attitudes toward retirement and found some 61 percent said they would like to decide for themselves when to collect their gold watches , sometime between the age 60 and 67 . graying population a danger to pension system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's pension system needs more people staying at their desks longer the sexagenarians ' decision to stay on the job is also important for germany , according to the report . " given the demographic developments , the country urgently needs a social paradigm shift in favor of a longer working life , " bertelsmann institute head johannes meier told reporters when he presented the study 's results . the number of workers aged between 50 and 64 across the eu will increase by 25 percent over the next two decades while those aged 20 to 29 will decrease by 20 percent , leaving german economists wringing their hands over the impending skilled-labor shortage and fretting over the country 's pay-as-you-go pension system , which is already teetering on the brink of insolvency . " this -lrb- pension -rrb- system will break down if there are not enough people working , " schäfer said .
" the dilemma can be solved by lowering the amount of pensions people get , increasing the amount people have to pay in , or raising the retirement age .
and in fact we are going to have to do all three of those at the same time .

the aircraft are part of a controversial billion-euro deal , which has the opposition questioning the project 's aim . the eurofighter deal is one of the largest defense projects in germany .
the first four aircraft - at a price of 74 million euros -lrb- $ 94 million -rrb- each - landed at the air force base in bavaria 's neuburg an der donau this week . the european aerospace group eads will deliver 180 fighter jets over the next few years to germany in a contract totaling over 21 billion euros .
these will form the backbone of the country 's air defense , replacing the phantom aircraft . but this controversial acquisition by the german armed forces or bundeswehr , has long been the focus of criticism .
when the eurofighter typhoon was developed 25 years ago , the world still looked very different .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.07.2006 germans debate need for new high-tech fighter jets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers welcomed the new eurofighters to germany on tuesday the european aerospace group eads handed over four eurofighter jets to the german air force this week .
the aircraft are part of a controversial billion-euro deal , which has the opposition questioning the project 's aim . the eurofighter deal is one of the largest defense projects in germany .
the first four aircraft - at a price of 74 million euros -lrb- $ 94 million -rrb- each - landed at the air force base in bavaria 's neuburg an der donau this week . the european aerospace group eads will deliver 180 fighter jets over the next few years to germany in a contract totaling over 21 billion euros .
these will form the backbone of the country 's air defense , replacing the phantom aircraft . but this controversial acquisition by the german armed forces or bundeswehr , has long been the focus of criticism .
when the eurofighter typhoon was developed 25 years ago , the world still looked very different .
it was the cold war ; the warsaw pact still existed . war scenarios at the time were still based on the assumption that western europe could be attacked from the east .
so a fighter jet was planned that could compete with the russian mig aircraft .
now , air battles over europe are scenarios from the past . co n tribute to soldiers ' safety abroad in view of the changed situation in the world , it has become controversial whether the german armed forces even really need 180 fighter jets .
and how should they be deployed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers are also deployed in afghanistan " i think the general security situation shows that the number of eurofighters is absolutely necessary , " said bernd siebert , defense spokesman for chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" they will be a significant part of ensuring our soldiers ' safety on foreign deployments . " he said german soldiers increasingly face dangerous situations during their missions abroad .
the german armed forces long ago changed from an army for national defense to a mobile deployment force , operating worldwide on peacekeeping missions . " if i look at the development in afghanistan , i can imagine that it will become necessary to deploy our eurofighters for intelligence and for protecting our soldiers , which have gotten into trouble , " siebert said . oppositio n : n ot n eeded for peacekeepi n g the opposition green party fought against the eurofighter for a long time , as it considered the billion-euro defense project to be outdated .
it does n't agree with the conservatives on the purpose of the deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eurofighter typhoon is now in service in germany , spain , italy and britain " in all of the conflicts in which the bundeswehr is deployed under a un mandate or with an alliance , there is n't one single case where a weapons system such as the eurofighter is needed , " said andreas bonde , the green 's defense spokesman . he added it was an instrument required for warfare between highly armed nations . " but in our missions today , where it 's about nation building and stabilization measures , we do n't need weapons systems like this , " bonde said . no lo n ger meeti n g the bu n deswehr 's n eeds both the cdu and the greens agree that the eurofighter should be deployed for a very clear purpose within germany 's borders , namely in air surveillance or " air policing . " " but we do n't need 180 of them for that , " bonde said .
he said there were military strategists who believed there would be a return to national defense , with the classic threatening scenario of highly armed old-fashioned war between nations . " i luckily consider this scenario to be unrealistic and in this respect , i have serious doubts that security policy investments are being made in a meaningful direction with this defense system , " bonde said . mechthild brockamp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eads appoints rail chief and outsider to top spots the european aerospace group eads has appointed the head of the french railway system and an industry outsider to lead the company after forcing out two top executives blamed for delays to its airbus a380 superjumbo .

while the former has a broader europea n focus , the latter explores cultural issues withi n germa n y . do you agree with nike wag n er that subsidies to the bayreuth wag n er festival should be cut ? she does have a point there .
in germany we have little legal basis for art funding .
it is more or less done on a day-to-day basis of means .
the german federal court once issued a ruling to the effect that money is scarce so it should go to those artists and events that need it .
often the money goes to the more popular events anyway .
the bayreuth festival gets 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 2.15 million -rrb- from the federal government , which may sound like a lot but it 's not really that much .
we spend over two billion euros per year for theater in germany .
one should also not forget that the family affair has a big part in this .

but german league cup matches will raise the pressure . werder bremen and hamburg sv were the two teams german soccer fans put their hopes behind to beat out bayern munich to the top of the table last season , but the anti-bayern supporters may need to find new sides after both teams proved they were n't in top form against lower league opponents . after taking a half-time lead , bremen were surprised 1-3 by relegated bundesliga team kaiserslautern , and hamburg pulled out a 2-1 win against a tiny local team - a result trainer thomas doll said was n't as bad as it looked .

stuttgart won 3-0 while berlin put a 4-0 victory into the books with the help of brazilian playmaker marcelinho . bochum are back in the bundesliga and turned around a match beat a 10-man le mans side 2-1 , making an easier time of their bundesliga preparations than fellow bundesliga returnee energie cottbus . the former east german team booked their fifth 1-1 draw in a row against spain 's atletico madrid , leaving fans wondering if season tickets are really worth the investment . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ballack leaves munich for chelsea in three-year deal germany national soccer team captain michael ballack has signed a three-year deal to play for english champions chelsea , the club announced .

while the former has a broader europea n focus , the latter explores cultural issues withi n germa n y . do you agree with nike wag n er that subsidies to the bayreuth wag n er festival should be cut ? she does have a point there .
in germany we have little legal basis for art funding .
it is more or less done on a day-to-day basis of means .
the german federal court once issued a ruling to the effect that money is scarce so it should go to those artists and events that need it .
often the money goes to the more popular events anyway .
the bayreuth festival gets 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 2.15 million -rrb- from the federal government , which may sound like a lot but it 's not really that much .
we spend over two billion euros per year for theater in germany .
one should also not forget that the family affair has a big part in this .
the wagner family situation has been called a soap opera . what is the goal behi n d public arts subsidies i n germa n y ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesand : new media art is n't part of the subsidy infrastructure yet germany does n't have a clear cut cultural financing policy .
it 's a wild mixture of cities , lä n der -lrb- states -rrb- and the federal government , so that 's a very difficult question to answer .
germany has n't had a discussion about this , like some other countries have .
we conduct surveys and it is astonishing that the general public does not question art subsidies , which may be different elsewhere .
it 's very traditional here .
a town with 30,000 residents can have its own opera - like coburg next to bayreuth .
that 's because of history : these towns were once capitals of little states and they wanted to have their share of the arts . if fu n di n g to the wag n er festival were to be cut , where should the mo n ey be redirected ? there are so many events that deserve something , not only -lrb- nike wagner 's kunstfestival in -rrb- weimar .
nike wagner is quite active in getting money from different sources , so she should n't complain .
i can understand her .
she 's more avant-garde , which would make the bayreuth festival interesting if she took over there , but that 's already out of the question .
there are other , less traditional sectors in germany too , which do n't yet have a proper place in this infrastructure : cultural education , community arts , immigrants , new media art .
subsidies have been stable in germany in the last few years , with a total expenditure of about eight billion euros per year .
actually , the real costs have been going down slightly , but not as much as in other countries . what do you expect from this year 's wag n er festival ? i have n't been in many years , so i really ca n't say .
but it 's always really remarkable .
i have a tip for anyone who wants to get tickets .
if you 're from very far away , your chances of getting tickets are much better .

but german league cup matches will raise the pressure . werder bremen and hamburg sv were the two teams german soccer fans put their hopes behind to beat out bayern munich to the top of the table last season , but the anti-bayern supporters may need to find new sides after both teams proved they were n't in top form against lower league opponents . after taking a half-time lead , bremen were surprised 1-3 by relegated bundesliga team kaiserslautern , and hamburg pulled out a 2-1 win against a tiny local team - a result trainer thomas doll said was n't as bad as it looked .

fc schalke and bayer leverkusen play in saturday 's other game for a chance at the bundesliga 's season 's first trophy , which is sponsored by the premiere private television company . " it is the first title you can win , " schalke coach mirko slomka said .
" it can really give a boost to the first bundesliga games . " even with their ample supply of world cup stars still recovering from last month 's strenuous tournament , bayern munich , left their training camp for a chance to pulverize a local team 14-1 , though few believe the game was as taxing as a double training session under felix magath . many of the bayern players ' thoughts are likely to have been on who would be in the team 's starting line-up when the season kicks off .
former bayern captain michael ballack is off to chelsea and negotiations to get euro 2004 dutch star ruud van nistelrooy to join his countryman roy makaay in a munich jersey have failed , according to the spanish press . will bayer n do it agai n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other than the kaiser , many are confident bayern will win again even bayern 's manager and german soccer kaiser , franz beckenbauer , said he is nervous about the bavarians ' chances this season .

stuttgart won 3-0 while berlin put a 4-0 victory into the books with the help of brazilian playmaker marcelinho . bochum are back in the bundesliga and turned around a match beat a 10-man le mans side 2-1 , making an easier time of their bundesliga preparations than fellow bundesliga returnee energie cottbus . the former east german team booked their fifth 1-1 draw in a row against spain 's atletico madrid , leaving fans wondering if season tickets are really worth the investment . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ballack leaves munich for chelsea in three-year deal germany national soccer team captain michael ballack has signed a three-year deal to play for english champions chelsea , the club announced .

wulf diepenbrock , an agriculture expert at halle university , predicted that more of these kinds of heat waves in the year to come will force farmers to change their planting strategies . " some farmers are already mulling planting varieties which are better suited to resist longer periods of heat with no rainfall in between , " he said . water levels low also in germany , navigation on the river elbe in the north of the country was disrupted after water levels dropped below navigable levels .
four months after flooding its banks , water in the river was just 90 centimeters -lrb- three feet -rrb- deep in some parts .
commercial vessels , which need water levels of at least 2.3 meters , were diverted into less affected canals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead fish in a dry river bed in eastern germany the low level and temperature of the water in the river also led nuclear power generators along the banks of the elbe to cut output . high water temperatures have also disrupted electricity production at nuclear power stations in france and spain .
water is used as a cooling agent at the plants but the temperature of discharged water must be within environmental norms . " we are adjusting our output on a constant basis according to the temperature of the water , " said a spokesman for the vattenfall electricity company in germany . despite the continuing heat , there 's no need yet to worry about water supplies , since water reservoirs and ground water levels are still at acceptable norms . " this is not to say that we 're telling people to waste water , " said hermann hahn from the german water management association .
" i 'm just saying that it 's unjustified to speak of a water supply catastrophe right now . " loss of life the heat wave has claimed an estimated 40 lives in europe over the past two weeks but there has been no repetition of the massive loss of life in the heat wave of 2003 when in france alone 15,000 died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans like it sunny and warm , but it 's become extreme the heat was blamed for the deaths of a man of 87 and a woman of 89 in the northern italian city of turin during the night tuesday , the italian ansa news agency reported , adding that there was a heavy call on hospitals during the night with many people wanting to stay in their air-conditioned buildings . the death of an 83-year-old woman in barcelona brought the toll in spain to nine . in denmark , also undergoing one of the hottest summers in its history , many local authorities have banned open air fires except at fixed barbecue sites . polish firefighters are on maximum alert to tackle forest fires caused by the drought .
over 8,000 fires have broken out in recent days and access has been banned to most forests . according to the gazeta wyborcza daily , warsaw has seen the hottest month of july since temperatures began to be recorded 227 years ago .
the average temperature in the polish capital this month was 23.2 c , five degrees higher than the norm . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe enjoys brief respite before new heat wave hits europe sizzled and soaked alternately over the weekend as a deadly heat wave broke down into storms over parts of the continent amid warnings that temperatures would peak again .

water is used as a cooling agent at the plants but the temperature of discharged water must be within environmental norms . " we are adjusting our output on a constant basis according to the temperature of the water , " said a spokesman for the vattenfall electricity company in germany . despite the continuing heat , there 's no need yet to worry about water supplies , since water reservoirs and ground water levels are still at acceptable norms . " this is not to say that we 're telling people to waste water , " said hermann hahn from the german water management association .

over 8,000 fires have broken out in recent days and access has been banned to most forests . according to the gazeta wyborcza daily , warsaw has seen the hottest month of july since temperatures began to be recorded 227 years ago .

water is used as a cooling agent at the plants but the temperature of discharged water must be within environmental norms . " we are adjusting our output on a constant basis according to the temperature of the water , " said a spokesman for the vattenfall electricity company in germany . despite the continuing heat , there 's no need yet to worry about water supplies , since water reservoirs and ground water levels are still at acceptable norms . " this is not to say that we 're telling people to waste water , " said hermann hahn from the german water management association .
" i 'm just saying that it 's unjustified to speak of a water supply catastrophe right now . " loss of life the heat wave has claimed an estimated 40 lives in europe over the past two weeks but there has been no repetition of the massive loss of life in the heat wave of 2003 when in france alone 15,000 died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans like it sunny and warm , but it 's become extreme the heat was blamed for the deaths of a man of 87 and a woman of 89 in the northern italian city of turin during the night tuesday , the italian ansa news agency reported , adding that there was a heavy call on hospitals during the night with many people wanting to stay in their air-conditioned buildings . the death of an 83-year-old woman in barcelona brought the toll in spain to nine . in denmark , also undergoing one of the hottest summers in its history , many local authorities have banned open air fires except at fixed barbecue sites . polish firefighters are on maximum alert to tackle forest fires caused by the drought .
over 8,000 fires have broken out in recent days and access has been banned to most forests . according to the gazeta wyborcza daily , warsaw has seen the hottest month of july since temperatures began to be recorded 227 years ago .

" the sovereign task of securing air space has never been effectively transferred to switzerland , " the court said in its ruling . german officials at the transport ministry said they would wait for the court 's written judgment before commenting on the ruling series of errors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court said pilots were not at fault for the crash an inquiry concluded last year that a catastrophic chain of human error , system failures and technical problems had led to the collision .

the dhl plane 's instruments also told it to climb to the same level , which led to its tail fin cutting through the russian jet killing all 69 aboard as well the two german dhl pilots . in 2004 , a russian man who lost his wife and two children in the disaster stabbed to death a swiss air traffic controller who had been under investigation in connection with the collision . cases still pending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial was built for the crash victims the court said it will rule at a later date on the amount of the compensation to be paid to bashkirian airlines .
the company has sought 2.6 million euros -lrb- $ 3.3 million -rrb- in damages from germany . two additional civil cases are also waiting for the court 's attention .
dhl and 19 insurance companies are suing germany for 36 million euros -lrb- $ 45 million -rrb- in damages .

her appeal aggravated family tensions , but raised valid questions on german art subsidies . richard wagner wrote operas and his descendants seem to be living in one . the composer founded the bayreuth festival in 1876 and it 's been a family-run show since then .
his grandson , 86-year-old wolfgang wagner , has been single-handedly directing the annual opera event since his brother wieland 's death in 1966 and it looks like his daughter katharina , 28 , will be the next to take the reigns . then there is nike wagner , wieland 's daughter - wolfgang 's niece - who successfully directs her own arts festival in weimar . nike wag n er wa n ts cuts i n bayreuth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner in an article in the july edition of german cultural and political magazine cicero , nike wagner made an explicit appeal that cuts be made to the state subsidies her family 's festival receives .
the bayreuth festival currently receives 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 2.1 million -rrb- each from the federal government , the state of bavaria and the city of bayreuth . " it 's difficult to understand why this festival , which is sold out years in advance and can work risk-free , continues to receive millions in public funds instead of hiking the ticket prices for a period of time and making the funds available to needier cultural institutions , festivals and cities , " nike wagner wrote . public mo n ey will co n ti n ue to roll i n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner directs the " kunstfest " in weimar the german news magazine focus estimated that prices would need to be raised by 70 percent to compensate for public funds to the seen-and-be-seen event .
the current maximum ticket price for an evening at the bayreuth festival is 208 euros -lrb- $ 263 -rrb- , but the waiting list to get one of them can run up to 10 years .
the german culture council wrote that last year 370,000 orders were made for around 54,000 tickets , so there 's no danger of empty seats . the demands of richard wagner 's great-granddaughter , who is also franz liszt 's great-great-granddaughter , seem to have fallen on deaf ears .
during his visit to the festival 's opening , german culture minister bernd neumann announced tuesday that the federal government 's financial contribution to the event would remain unchanged . a festival made stale by subsidies ? nike wagner 's article , actually a parallel chronicle of the two music festivals in weimar and bayreuth , contained some harsh barbs that infer nothing other than a family feud . " the wagner festival concerns itself year in and year out with the reproduction of its own myth , always subjected to the same program , the same pieces , and it froze up in routine and modernity during the 1970s , " she wrote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayreuth guests like former president roman herzog could afford a price hike , but should they have to ?
as for the leadership in bayreuth , not only have " media strategies " and elements of spectacle removed from art and intellect " gained ground , but the " regime " there has been " compared to a police state by many artists , " nike wagner added .
in weimar , of course , " the police state has ended . " not everyo n e agrees germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung meanwhile commented that as an intelligent person , nike wagner " should forego petty battles with the hostile family clan . "
besides , she " should know that raising the ticket prices at the bayreuth festival would be against the will of her great-grandfather richard . " family quarrels aside , does nike wagner have a point ?
why should a festival that could more than support itself receive public money ? dw-world.de spoke with andreas wiesand , director of two cultural research organizations , about subsidies for the arts .
click on the link below for the interview . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germany does n't have a clear cut cultural financing policy " culture researcher andreas wiesand talked with dw-world.de about the wagner family " soap opera " and said that germany 's arts subsidies are deeply rooted in history so the general public does n't question them .
-lrb- july 26 , 2006 -rrb- german politicians cozy up to the arts politicians have always been keen to ingratiate themselves with the arts and culture community .
but are their gestures of support mere posturing - or will they translate into constructive policies ?

" the sovereign task of securing air space has never been effectively transferred to switzerland , " the court said in its ruling . german officials at the transport ministry said they would wait for the court 's written judgment before commenting on the ruling series of errors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court said pilots were not at fault for the crash an inquiry concluded last year that a catastrophic chain of human error , system failures and technical problems had led to the collision . " this would have led eventually to the overload of the only air traffic controller working at the time and ultimately would have caused the collision between the planes , " the court said . had a warning program and telephone , which were undergoing repairs at the time of the accident , been in working order , the crash could have been avoided , according to wilhelm müller , who was the case 's chief judge . a single skyguide controller-manned station instructed the pilot of the russian plane to descend to avoid a collision despite instruments aboard the plane saying he should climb .
the dhl plane 's instruments also told it to climb to the same level , which led to its tail fin cutting through the russian jet killing all 69 aboard as well the two german dhl pilots . in 2004 , a russian man who lost his wife and two children in the disaster stabbed to death a swiss air traffic controller who had been under investigation in connection with the collision . cases still pending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial was built for the crash victims the court said it will rule at a later date on the amount of the compensation to be paid to bashkirian airlines .
the company has sought 2.6 million euros -lrb- $ 3.3 million -rrb- in damages from germany . two additional civil cases are also waiting for the court 's attention .
dhl and 19 insurance companies are suing germany for 36 million euros -lrb- $ 45 million -rrb- in damages .

her appeal aggravated family tensions , but raised valid questions on german art subsidies . richard wagner wrote operas and his descendants seem to be living in one . the composer founded the bayreuth festival in 1876 and it 's been a family-run show since then .
his grandson , 86-year-old wolfgang wagner , has been single-handedly directing the annual opera event since his brother wieland 's death in 1966 and it looks like his daughter katharina , 28 , will be the next to take the reigns . then there is nike wagner , wieland 's daughter - wolfgang 's niece - who successfully directs her own arts festival in weimar . nike wag n er wa n ts cuts i n bayreuth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner in an article in the july edition of german cultural and political magazine cicero , nike wagner made an explicit appeal that cuts be made to the state subsidies her family 's festival receives .
the bayreuth festival currently receives 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 2.1 million -rrb- each from the federal government , the state of bavaria and the city of bayreuth . " it 's difficult to understand why this festival , which is sold out years in advance and can work risk-free , continues to receive millions in public funds instead of hiking the ticket prices for a period of time and making the funds available to needier cultural institutions , festivals and cities , " nike wagner wrote . public mo n ey will co n ti n ue to roll i n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner directs the " kunstfest " in weimar the german news magazine focus estimated that prices would need to be raised by 70 percent to compensate for public funds to the seen-and-be-seen event .
the current maximum ticket price for an evening at the bayreuth festival is 208 euros -lrb- $ 263 -rrb- , but the waiting list to get one of them can run up to 10 years .
the german culture council wrote that last year 370,000 orders were made for around 54,000 tickets , so there 's no danger of empty seats . the demands of richard wagner 's great-granddaughter , who is also franz liszt 's great-great-granddaughter , seem to have fallen on deaf ears .
during his visit to the festival 's opening , german culture minister bernd neumann announced tuesday that the federal government 's financial contribution to the event would remain unchanged . a festival made stale by subsidies ? nike wagner 's article , actually a parallel chronicle of the two music festivals in weimar and bayreuth , contained some harsh barbs that infer nothing other than a family feud . " the wagner festival concerns itself year in and year out with the reproduction of its own myth , always subjected to the same program , the same pieces , and it froze up in routine and modernity during the 1970s , " she wrote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayreuth guests like former president roman herzog could afford a price hike , but should they have to ?
as for the leadership in bayreuth , not only have " media strategies " and elements of spectacle removed from art and intellect " gained ground , but the " regime " there has been " compared to a police state by many artists , " nike wagner added .
in weimar , of course , " the police state has ended . " not everyo n e agrees germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung meanwhile commented that as an intelligent person , nike wagner " should forego petty battles with the hostile family clan . "

the aircraft are part of a controversial billion-euro deal , which has the opposition questioning the project 's aim . the eurofighter deal is one of the largest defense projects in germany .
the first four aircraft - at a price of 74 million euros -lrb- $ 94 million -rrb- each - landed at the air force base in bavaria 's neuburg an der donau this week . the european aerospace group eads will deliver 180 fighter jets over the next few years to germany in a contract totaling over 21 billion euros .
these will form the backbone of the country 's air defense , replacing the phantom aircraft . but this controversial acquisition by the german armed forces or bundeswehr , has long been the focus of criticism .
when the eurofighter typhoon was developed 25 years ago , the world still looked very different .
it was the cold war ; the warsaw pact still existed . war scenarios at the time were still based on the assumption that western europe could be attacked from the east .
so a fighter jet was planned that could compete with the russian mig aircraft .

but german league cup matches will raise the pressure . werder bremen and hamburg sv were the two teams german soccer fans put their hopes behind to beat out bayern munich to the top of the table last season , but the anti-bayern supporters may need to find new sides after both teams proved they were n't in top form against lower league opponents . after taking a half-time lead , bremen were surprised 1-3 by relegated bundesliga team kaiserslautern , and hamburg pulled out a 2-1 win against a tiny local team - a result trainer thomas doll said was n't as bad as it looked .

" it can really give a boost to the first bundesliga games . " even with their ample supply of world cup stars still recovering from last month 's strenuous tournament , bayern munich , left their training camp for a chance to pulverize a local team 14-1 , though few believe the game was as taxing as a double training session under felix magath . many of the bayern players ' thoughts are likely to have been on who would be in the team 's starting line-up when the season kicks off .

stuttgart won 3-0 while berlin put a 4-0 victory into the books with the help of brazilian playmaker marcelinho . bochum are back in the bundesliga and turned around a match beat a 10-man le mans side 2-1 , making an easier time of their bundesliga preparations than fellow bundesliga returnee energie cottbus . the former east german team booked their fifth 1-1 draw in a row against spain 's atletico madrid , leaving fans wondering if season tickets are really worth the investment . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ballack leaves munich for chelsea in three-year deal germany national soccer team captain michael ballack has signed a three-year deal to play for english champions chelsea , the club announced .

while the former has a broader europea n focus , the latter explores cultural issues withi n germa n y . do you agree with nike wag n er that subsidies to the bayreuth wag n er festival should be cut ? she does have a point there .
in germany we have little legal basis for art funding .
it is more or less done on a day-to-day basis of means .
the german federal court once issued a ruling to the effect that money is scarce so it should go to those artists and events that need it .
often the money goes to the more popular events anyway .
the bayreuth festival gets 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 2.15 million -rrb- from the federal government , which may sound like a lot but it 's not really that much .
we spend over two billion euros per year for theater in germany .
one should also not forget that the family affair has a big part in this .
the wagner family situation has been called a soap opera . what is the goal behi n d public arts subsidies i n germa n y ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesand : new media art is n't part of the subsidy infrastructure yet germany does n't have a clear cut cultural financing policy .
it 's a wild mixture of cities , lä n der -lrb- states -rrb- and the federal government , so that 's a very difficult question to answer .
germany has n't had a discussion about this , like some other countries have .
we conduct surveys and it is astonishing that the general public does not question art subsidies , which may be different elsewhere .
it 's very traditional here .
a town with 30,000 residents can have its own opera - like coburg next to bayreuth .
that 's because of history : these towns were once capitals of little states and they wanted to have their share of the arts . if fu n di n g to the wag n er festival were to be cut , where should the mo n ey be redirected ? there are so many events that deserve something , not only -lrb- nike wagner 's kunstfestival in -rrb- weimar .
nike wagner is quite active in getting money from different sources , so she should n't complain .
i can understand her .
she 's more avant-garde , which would make the bayreuth festival interesting if she took over there , but that 's already out of the question .
there are other , less traditional sectors in germany too , which do n't yet have a proper place in this infrastructure : cultural education , community arts , immigrants , new media art .
subsidies have been stable in germany in the last few years , with a total expenditure of about eight billion euros per year .
actually , the real costs have been going down slightly , but not as much as in other countries . what do you expect from this year 's wag n er festival ? i have n't been in many years , so i really ca n't say .
but it 's always really remarkable .
i have a tip for anyone who wants to get tickets .
if you 're from very far away , your chances of getting tickets are much better .
i thought about calling up my friend in chile and asking him to get tickets for me . kate bowen interviewed andreas wiesand send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drama and fantasy at bayreuth 's wagner festival german playwright and director tankred dorst 's brand new production of wagner 's 16-hour " ring " cycle tops the program for the one-month festival and has critics on the edge of their seats .
-lrb- july 25 , 2006 -rrb- german politicians cozy up to the arts politicians have always been keen to ingratiate themselves with the arts and culture community .
but are their gestures of support mere posturing - or will they translate into constructive policies ?

" the dangerous situation in lebanon ... requires true leadership .
do n't look for it from the world 's uberpower . "
the incident was seized upon by some liberals .

" a president ought to know enough not use an expletive in a fairly open meeting , and almost any male alive today knows that you do n't offer uninvited massages to any female , much less the chancellor of germany . "
bush fans pooh-pooh the matter saying that it was nothing to get worked up about .
" president bush just ca n't win , " said fox news ' karen hanretty .

her appeal aggravated family tensions , but raised valid questions on german art subsidies . richard wagner wrote operas and his descendants seem to be living in one . the composer founded the bayreuth festival in 1876 and it 's been a family-run show since then .
his grandson , 86-year-old wolfgang wagner , has been single-handedly directing the annual opera event since his brother wieland 's death in 1966 and it looks like his daughter katharina , 28 , will be the next to take the reigns . then there is nike wagner , wieland 's daughter - wolfgang 's niece - who successfully directs her own arts festival in weimar . nike wag n er wa n ts cuts i n bayreuth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner in an article in the july edition of german cultural and political magazine cicero , nike wagner made an explicit appeal that cuts be made to the state subsidies her family 's festival receives .
the bayreuth festival currently receives 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 2.1 million -rrb- each from the federal government , the state of bavaria and the city of bayreuth . " it 's difficult to understand why this festival , which is sold out years in advance and can work risk-free , continues to receive millions in public funds instead of hiking the ticket prices for a period of time and making the funds available to needier cultural institutions , festivals and cities , " nike wagner wrote . public mo n ey will co n ti n ue to roll i n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner directs the " kunstfest " in weimar the german news magazine focus estimated that prices would need to be raised by 70 percent to compensate for public funds to the seen-and-be-seen event .
the current maximum ticket price for an evening at the bayreuth festival is 208 euros -lrb- $ 263 -rrb- , but the waiting list to get one of them can run up to 10 years .
the german culture council wrote that last year 370,000 orders were made for around 54,000 tickets , so there 's no danger of empty seats . the demands of richard wagner 's great-granddaughter , who is also franz liszt 's great-great-granddaughter , seem to have fallen on deaf ears .
during his visit to the festival 's opening , german culture minister bernd neumann announced tuesday that the federal government 's financial contribution to the event would remain unchanged . a festival made stale by subsidies ? nike wagner 's article , actually a parallel chronicle of the two music festivals in weimar and bayreuth , contained some harsh barbs that infer nothing other than a family feud . " the wagner festival concerns itself year in and year out with the reproduction of its own myth , always subjected to the same program , the same pieces , and it froze up in routine and modernity during the 1970s , " she wrote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayreuth guests like former president roman herzog could afford a price hike , but should they have to ?
as for the leadership in bayreuth , not only have " media strategies " and elements of spectacle removed from art and intellect " gained ground , but the " regime " there has been " compared to a police state by many artists , " nike wagner added .
in weimar , of course , " the police state has ended . " not everyo n e agrees germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung meanwhile commented that as an intelligent person , nike wagner " should forego petty battles with the hostile family clan . "
besides , she " should know that raising the ticket prices at the bayreuth festival would be against the will of her great-grandfather richard . " family quarrels aside , does nike wagner have a point ?
why should a festival that could more than support itself receive public money ? dw-world.de spoke with andreas wiesand , director of two cultural research organizations , about subsidies for the arts .
click on the link below for the interview . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germany does n't have a clear cut cultural financing policy " culture researcher andreas wiesand talked with dw-world.de about the wagner family " soap opera " and said that germany 's arts subsidies are deeply rooted in history so the general public does n't question them .
-lrb- july 26 , 2006 -rrb- german politicians cozy up to the arts politicians have always been keen to ingratiate themselves with the arts and culture community .
but are their gestures of support mere posturing - or will they translate into constructive policies ?

the bayreuth festival gets 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 2.15 million -rrb- from the federal government , which may sound like a lot but it 's not really that much .
we spend over two billion euros per year for theater in germany .
one should also not forget that the family affair has a big part in this .
the wagner family situation has been called a soap opera . what is the goal behi n d public arts subsidies i n germa n y ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesand : new media art is n't part of the subsidy infrastructure yet germany does n't have a clear cut cultural financing policy .
it 's a wild mixture of cities , lä n der -lrb- states -rrb- and the federal government , so that 's a very difficult question to answer .
germany has n't had a discussion about this , like some other countries have .
we conduct surveys and it is astonishing that the general public does not question art subsidies , which may be different elsewhere .
it 's very traditional here .
a town with 30,000 residents can have its own opera - like coburg next to bayreuth .
that 's because of history : these towns were once capitals of little states and they wanted to have their share of the arts . if fu n di n g to the wag n er festival were to be cut , where should the mo n ey be redirected ? there are so many events that deserve something , not only -lrb- nike wagner 's kunstfestival in -rrb- weimar .
nike wagner is quite active in getting money from different sources , so she should n't complain .
i can understand her .
she 's more avant-garde , which would make the bayreuth festival interesting if she took over there , but that 's already out of the question .
there are other , less traditional sectors in germany too , which do n't yet have a proper place in this infrastructure : cultural education , community arts , immigrants , new media art .
subsidies have been stable in germany in the last few years , with a total expenditure of about eight billion euros per year .
actually , the real costs have been going down slightly , but not as much as in other countries . what do you expect from this year 's wag n er festival ? i have n't been in many years , so i really ca n't say .
but it 's always really remarkable .
i have a tip for anyone who wants to get tickets .
if you 're from very far away , your chances of getting tickets are much better .
i thought about calling up my friend in chile and asking him to get tickets for me . kate bowen interviewed andreas wiesand send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drama and fantasy at bayreuth 's wagner festival german playwright and director tankred dorst 's brand new production of wagner 's 16-hour " ring " cycle tops the program for the one-month festival and has critics on the edge of their seats .
-lrb- july 25 , 2006 -rrb- german politicians cozy up to the arts politicians have always been keen to ingratiate themselves with the arts and culture community .
but are their gestures of support mere posturing - or will they translate into constructive policies ?

the scene , caught on russian tv cameras filming the g8 meetings in russia and blitzed around the world via the internet , shows a caught-off-guard chancellor breaking off mid-sentence with italian prime minister romano prodi to jerk her shoulders and throw up her balled fists .
one can almost here the " yuck " in her grimace .
still , it was a pretty hot moment for the g8 .
love attack the incident at first was overshadowed by other slips at the normally staid and staged meetings - such as one in which bush uses an expletive in a candid conversation with british prime minister tony blair when he did n't know was being taped .
but a few days after the meetings , the video clip became one of the most downloaded and shared clips on the web , inspiring columns , comedians and even political pundits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she is no gerhard schröder " bush : love attack on merkel ! " read the headline in german mass-market tabloid bild .
comedian jon stewart on the " daily show " wondered out loud if the president realized that , " you do n't do that to women you do n't know , especially the chancellor of germany . "
some wondered if bush was n't reverting to his fratboy days .
" this isn ’ t a sigma chi kegger , it 's the g-8 summit , ” wrote blogger christy hardin smith on firedoglake.com before being informed bush was actually a member of the delta kappa epsilon fraternity .
lessons on taste and etiquette some seized on the opportunity to criticize the president politically .
" when he is away from his script and his handlers , his true lack of intelligence and emotional maturity surfaces for all to see , " wrote bloggers on the dialogue international web site , which focuses transatlantic issues .
" the dangerous situation in lebanon ... requires true leadership .
do n't look for it from the world 's uberpower . "
the incident was seized upon by some liberals .
steve young 's blog on the huffington post web site called bush the " lounge lizard in chief " and extolled the " the irony of a president who 's supposed to represent our best , giving the chancellor of germany an inappropriate and unrequested backrub . "
sexual-harassment training , maybe ?
many bloggers wondered if the president was n't up-to-date on sexual harassment rules and office etiquette .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she did n't turn away then larry sabato , professor of politics at the university of virginia , told the associated press that today , public figures have to be more careful in " a thousand ways " even as he values the honesty of web sites like youtube , which posted the video .
" if they 're not doing something that 's embarrassing , they have nothing to worry about , " he said .
" a president ought to know enough not use an expletive in a fairly open meeting , and almost any male alive today knows that you do n't offer uninvited massages to any female , much less the chancellor of germany . "
bush fans pooh-pooh the matter saying that it was nothing to get worked up about .
" president bush just ca n't win , " said fox news ' karen hanretty .
" are n't these the same women who have been angry about cowboy diplomacy ?
do they want a kinder , more sensitive bush - or a cowboy ?

wulf diepenbrock , an agriculture expert at halle university , predicted that more of these kinds of heat waves in the year to come will force farmers to change their planting strategies . " some farmers are already mulling planting varieties which are better suited to resist longer periods of heat with no rainfall in between , " he said . water levels low also in germany , navigation on the river elbe in the north of the country was disrupted after water levels dropped below navigable levels .
four months after flooding its banks , water in the river was just 90 centimeters -lrb- three feet -rrb- deep in some parts .
commercial vessels , which need water levels of at least 2.3 meters , were diverted into less affected canals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead fish in a dry river bed in eastern germany the low level and temperature of the water in the river also led nuclear power generators along the banks of the elbe to cut output . high water temperatures have also disrupted electricity production at nuclear power stations in france and spain .
water is used as a cooling agent at the plants but the temperature of discharged water must be within environmental norms . " we are adjusting our output on a constant basis according to the temperature of the water , " said a spokesman for the vattenfall electricity company in germany . despite the continuing heat , there 's no need yet to worry about water supplies , since water reservoirs and ground water levels are still at acceptable norms . " this is not to say that we 're telling people to waste water , " said hermann hahn from the german water management association .
" i 'm just saying that it 's unjustified to speak of a water supply catastrophe right now . " loss of life the heat wave has claimed an estimated 40 lives in europe over the past two weeks but there has been no repetition of the massive loss of life in the heat wave of 2003 when in france alone 15,000 died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans like it sunny and warm , but it 's become extreme the heat was blamed for the deaths of a man of 87 and a woman of 89 in the northern italian city of turin during the night tuesday , the italian ansa news agency reported , adding that there was a heavy call on hospitals during the night with many people wanting to stay in their air-conditioned buildings . the death of an 83-year-old woman in barcelona brought the toll in spain to nine . in denmark , also undergoing one of the hottest summers in its history , many local authorities have banned open air fires except at fixed barbecue sites . polish firefighters are on maximum alert to tackle forest fires caused by the drought .
over 8,000 fires have broken out in recent days and access has been banned to most forests . according to the gazeta wyborcza daily , warsaw has seen the hottest month of july since temperatures began to be recorded 227 years ago .

the scene , caught on russian tv cameras filming the g8 meetings in russia and blitzed around the world via the internet , shows a caught-off-guard chancellor breaking off mid-sentence with italian prime minister romano prodi to jerk her shoulders and throw up her balled fists .
one can almost here the " yuck " in her grimace .
still , it was a pretty hot moment for the g8 .
love attack the incident at first was overshadowed by other slips at the normally staid and staged meetings - such as one in which bush uses an expletive in a candid conversation with british prime minister tony blair when he did n't know was being taped .
but a few days after the meetings , the video clip became one of the most downloaded and shared clips on the web , inspiring columns , comedians and even political pundits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she is no gerhard schröder " bush : love attack on merkel ! " read the headline in german mass-market tabloid bild .
comedian jon stewart on the " daily show " wondered out loud if the president realized that , " you do n't do that to women you do n't know , especially the chancellor of germany . "
some wondered if bush was n't reverting to his fratboy days .
" this isn ’ t a sigma chi kegger , it 's the g-8 summit , ” wrote blogger christy hardin smith on firedoglake.com before being informed bush was actually a member of the delta kappa epsilon fraternity .
lessons on taste and etiquette some seized on the opportunity to criticize the president politically .
" when he is away from his script and his handlers , his true lack of intelligence and emotional maturity surfaces for all to see , " wrote bloggers on the dialogue international web site , which focuses transatlantic issues .
" the dangerous situation in lebanon ... requires true leadership .
do n't look for it from the world 's uberpower . "
the incident was seized upon by some liberals .
steve young 's blog on the huffington post web site called bush the " lounge lizard in chief " and extolled the " the irony of a president who 's supposed to represent our best , giving the chancellor of germany an inappropriate and unrequested backrub . "
sexual-harassment training , maybe ?
many bloggers wondered if the president was n't up-to-date on sexual harassment rules and office etiquette .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she did n't turn away then larry sabato , professor of politics at the university of virginia , told the associated press that today , public figures have to be more careful in " a thousand ways " even as he values the honesty of web sites like youtube , which posted the video .
" if they 're not doing something that 's embarrassing , they have nothing to worry about , " he said .
" a president ought to know enough not use an expletive in a fairly open meeting , and almost any male alive today knows that you do n't offer uninvited massages to any female , much less the chancellor of germany . "
bush fans pooh-pooh the matter saying that it was nothing to get worked up about .
" president bush just ca n't win , " said fox news ' karen hanretty .
" are n't these the same women who have been angry about cowboy diplomacy ?
do they want a kinder , more sensitive bush - or a cowboy ?

" the sovereign task of securing air space has never been effectively transferred to switzerland , " the court said in its ruling . german officials at the transport ministry said they would wait for the court 's written judgment before commenting on the ruling series of errors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court said pilots were not at fault for the crash an inquiry concluded last year that a catastrophic chain of human error , system failures and technical problems had led to the collision . " this would have led eventually to the overload of the only air traffic controller working at the time and ultimately would have caused the collision between the planes , " the court said . had a warning program and telephone , which were undergoing repairs at the time of the accident , been in working order , the crash could have been avoided , according to wilhelm müller , who was the case 's chief judge . a single skyguide controller-manned station instructed the pilot of the russian plane to descend to avoid a collision despite instruments aboard the plane saying he should climb .
the dhl plane 's instruments also told it to climb to the same level , which led to its tail fin cutting through the russian jet killing all 69 aboard as well the two german dhl pilots . in 2004 , a russian man who lost his wife and two children in the disaster stabbed to death a swiss air traffic controller who had been under investigation in connection with the collision . cases still pending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial was built for the crash victims the court said it will rule at a later date on the amount of the compensation to be paid to bashkirian airlines .
the company has sought 2.6 million euros -lrb- $ 3.3 million -rrb- in damages from germany . two additional civil cases are also waiting for the court 's attention .
dhl and 19 insurance companies are suing germany for 36 million euros -lrb- $ 45 million -rrb- in damages .
in the second suit , skyguide 's swiss insurance company , winterthur , is suing bashkirian for 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- decisions on compensation for pain and suffering by the victims ' families are also pending in constance and in switzerland .

wulf diepenbrock , an agriculture expert at halle university , predicted that more of these kinds of heat waves in the year to come will force farmers to change their planting strategies . " some farmers are already mulling planting varieties which are better suited to resist longer periods of heat with no rainfall in between , " he said . water levels low also in germany , navigation on the river elbe in the north of the country was disrupted after water levels dropped below navigable levels .
four months after flooding its banks , water in the river was just 90 centimeters -lrb- three feet -rrb- deep in some parts .
commercial vessels , which need water levels of at least 2.3 meters , were diverted into less affected canals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead fish in a dry river bed in eastern germany the low level and temperature of the water in the river also led nuclear power generators along the banks of the elbe to cut output . high water temperatures have also disrupted electricity production at nuclear power stations in france and spain .
water is used as a cooling agent at the plants but the temperature of discharged water must be within environmental norms . " we are adjusting our output on a constant basis according to the temperature of the water , " said a spokesman for the vattenfall electricity company in germany . despite the continuing heat , there 's no need yet to worry about water supplies , since water reservoirs and ground water levels are still at acceptable norms . " this is not to say that we 're telling people to waste water , " said hermann hahn from the german water management association .
" i 'm just saying that it 's unjustified to speak of a water supply catastrophe right now . " loss of life the heat wave has claimed an estimated 40 lives in europe over the past two weeks but there has been no repetition of the massive loss of life in the heat wave of 2003 when in france alone 15,000 died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans like it sunny and warm , but it 's become extreme the heat was blamed for the deaths of a man of 87 and a woman of 89 in the northern italian city of turin during the night tuesday , the italian ansa news agency reported , adding that there was a heavy call on hospitals during the night with many people wanting to stay in their air-conditioned buildings . the death of an 83-year-old woman in barcelona brought the toll in spain to nine . in denmark , also undergoing one of the hottest summers in its history , many local authorities have banned open air fires except at fixed barbecue sites . polish firefighters are on maximum alert to tackle forest fires caused by the drought .

this week , he introduced the press to his successor , 50-year-old norbert reithofer . forced retirement at 60 remains more the exception than the rule in germany , and it applies mainly to family-controlled concerns like bmw and bertelsmann , explained andreas zimmermann , director for social policy at the german confederation of managers , a berlin lobbying organization that represents business managers . socially accepted discrimination ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panke is out of the driver 's seat whether he likes it or not " in germany , it has always been socially accepted to treat older employees differently , " zimmermann said .

on the contrary , if older employees were given the opportunity to leave early , it was more welcomed than criticized . " germany 's officially mandated retirement age is currently 65 and a new law will gradually increase it to 67 over the next three years .
but in reality , the average german already leaves work at 63 , when early retirement and disabilities are taken into consideration , according to holger schäfer of the cologne institute for economic research -lrb- iwk -rrb- . in fact , retiring around 60 was normal in germany until recently .

the scene , caught on russian tv cameras filming the g8 meetings in russia and blitzed around the world via the internet , shows a caught-off-guard chancellor breaking off mid-sentence with italian prime minister romano prodi to jerk her shoulders and throw up her balled fists .
one can almost here the " yuck " in her grimace .
still , it was a pretty hot moment for the g8 .
love attack the incident at first was overshadowed by other slips at the normally staid and staged meetings - such as one in which bush uses an expletive in a candid conversation with british prime minister tony blair when he did n't know was being taped .
but a few days after the meetings , the video clip became one of the most downloaded and shared clips on the web , inspiring columns , comedians and even political pundits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she is no gerhard schröder " bush : love attack on merkel ! " read the headline in german mass-market tabloid bild .
comedian jon stewart on the " daily show " wondered out loud if the president realized that , " you do n't do that to women you do n't know , especially the chancellor of germany . "
some wondered if bush was n't reverting to his fratboy days .
" this isn ’ t a sigma chi kegger , it 's the g-8 summit , ” wrote blogger christy hardin smith on firedoglake.com before being informed bush was actually a member of the delta kappa epsilon fraternity .
lessons on taste and etiquette some seized on the opportunity to criticize the president politically .
" when he is away from his script and his handlers , his true lack of intelligence and emotional maturity surfaces for all to see , " wrote bloggers on the dialogue international web site , which focuses transatlantic issues .
" the dangerous situation in lebanon ... requires true leadership .
do n't look for it from the world 's uberpower . "
the incident was seized upon by some liberals .
steve young 's blog on the huffington post web site called bush the " lounge lizard in chief " and extolled the " the irony of a president who 's supposed to represent our best , giving the chancellor of germany an inappropriate and unrequested backrub . "

the scene , caught on russian tv cameras filming the g8 meetings in russia and blitzed around the world via the internet , shows a caught-off-guard chancellor breaking off mid-sentence with italian prime minister romano prodi to jerk her shoulders and throw up her balled fists .
one can almost here the " yuck " in her grimace .
still , it was a pretty hot moment for the g8 .

but a few days after the meetings , the video clip became one of the most downloaded and shared clips on the web , inspiring columns , comedians and even political pundits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she is no gerhard schröder " bush : love attack on merkel ! " read the headline in german mass-market tabloid bild .
comedian jon stewart on the " daily show " wondered out loud if the president realized that , " you do n't do that to women you do n't know , especially the chancellor of germany . "
some wondered if bush was n't reverting to his fratboy days .
" this isn ’ t a sigma chi kegger , it 's the g-8 summit , ” wrote blogger christy hardin smith on firedoglake.com before being informed bush was actually a member of the delta kappa epsilon fraternity .
lessons on taste and etiquette some seized on the opportunity to criticize the president politically .
" when he is away from his script and his handlers , his true lack of intelligence and emotional maturity surfaces for all to see , " wrote bloggers on the dialogue international web site , which focuses transatlantic issues .
" the dangerous situation in lebanon ... requires true leadership .
do n't look for it from the world 's uberpower . "
the incident was seized upon by some liberals .
steve young 's blog on the huffington post web site called bush the " lounge lizard in chief " and extolled the " the irony of a president who 's supposed to represent our best , giving the chancellor of germany an inappropriate and unrequested backrub . "

" the sovereign task of securing air space has never been effectively transferred to switzerland , " the court said in its ruling . german officials at the transport ministry said they would wait for the court 's written judgment before commenting on the ruling series of errors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court said pilots were not at fault for the crash an inquiry concluded last year that a catastrophic chain of human error , system failures and technical problems had led to the collision . " this would have led eventually to the overload of the only air traffic controller working at the time and ultimately would have caused the collision between the planes , " the court said . had a warning program and telephone , which were undergoing repairs at the time of the accident , been in working order , the crash could have been avoided , according to wilhelm müller , who was the case 's chief judge . a single skyguide controller-manned station instructed the pilot of the russian plane to descend to avoid a collision despite instruments aboard the plane saying he should climb .
the dhl plane 's instruments also told it to climb to the same level , which led to its tail fin cutting through the russian jet killing all 69 aboard as well the two german dhl pilots . in 2004 , a russian man who lost his wife and two children in the disaster stabbed to death a swiss air traffic controller who had been under investigation in connection with the collision . cases still pending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial was built for the crash victims the court said it will rule at a later date on the amount of the compensation to be paid to bashkirian airlines .
the company has sought 2.6 million euros -lrb- $ 3.3 million -rrb- in damages from germany . two additional civil cases are also waiting for the court 's attention .
dhl and 19 insurance companies are suing germany for 36 million euros -lrb- $ 45 million -rrb- in damages .
in the second suit , skyguide 's swiss insurance company , winterthur , is suing bashkirian for 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- decisions on compensation for pain and suffering by the victims ' families are also pending in constance and in switzerland .

diplomatic settlement the lebanese government and hezbollah would agree to implement security council resolution 1559 .
this resolution , passed in september 2004 , called for the disbanding of all militias in lebanon and the extension of lebanese government authority to all parts of the country .
hezbollah would move out of south lebanon and the lebanese army would move down to the border with israel .
the idea is that this would remove the source of conflict .
both israel and hezbollah would accept a ceasefire and the agreement formalised in a new security council resolution .
an international force would be deployed in the border area at least until the lebanese army arrived .
getting agreement on the mandate , size and deployment of such a force is not going to be easy .
it would replace an existing un force , unifil , which has been monitoring events but not influencing them since 1978 .
the israelis might maintain a self-declared " buffer zone " for a time , but any settlement would have to see an israeli withdrawal .
some kind of deal would be done to resolve the original trigger for this war , the capture of two israeli solders by hezbollah .
israel wants their unconditional release .
hezbollah says they were taken to be exchanged .
lebanon also wants israel to leave a strip of land known as the shebaa farms at the foot of mount hermon , but the un has ruled that this land belongs to syria and that its future should be decided by israeli-syrian negotiations .
stalemate under this scenario , the israeli military effort to remove hezbollah fighters from south lebanon gets bogged down and hezbollah refuses to pull back or reach any agreement with the lebanese government .
fighting continues .
this would leave israel far short of its aims .
there would be domestic political fall-out in that great ambitions were laid out for this conflict .
a stalemate in which israel was making little headway might also be interpreted as " israel loses " , in that it did not achieve its goals .
already the israelis have found the going tougher than they might have expected .
the terrain - mountainous , rocky , and full of caves , gullies and ravines - is ideal guerrilla country and the israelis can not use their armoured forces there easily .
it is therefore conceivable that the israelis will not achieve the decisive victory they seek .
if that happened , the fighting could go on indefinitely to a greater or lesser degree .
israeli bombing could continue in an attempt to cut off hezbollah reinforcements moving south .
hezbollah could continue firing rockets from north of any israeli-controlled zone .
the civilian suffering would go on and people might not be able to return to normal lives on both sides of the border .
israel could establish control over a self-declared " buffer zone " along the border and just stay there .
there would be stalemate , with continuing confrontations and fire fights with the potential of the conflict erupting again at any time .
israel declares success israel would go on more or less as now until it reckoned it had achieved success .
it might or might not announce a ceasefire but it would in practice hand over southern lebanon to an international force and withdraw .
in due course , the lebanese army would deploy to the border .
israel would declare victory against hezbollah , though it would probably not get its two captured soldiers back .
the war winds down it is possible that at some stage the israelis will announce they have achieved their main aims through bombing and the removal of hezbollah from the border .
there might be no ceasefire but the bombing would stop or be reduced .
hezbollah might respond by stopping its rocket attacks .
there might be occasional incidents .
this would leave issues unresolved however , including that of the missing israeli soldiers .
israel will not exchange them for the prisoner hezbollah wants most , samir qantar , who attacked a block of flats in nahariha in 1979 , killing a father and his daughter -lrb- the latter by smashing her head in -rrb- .
the only prisoner release israel says it will engage in is one through the palestinian president mahmoud abbas .
wider israeli invasion israel might decide to step up its ground attacks , for example , after a hezbollah attack on cities further south .
in 1978 , the israelis invaded up to the litani river some 20km -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- north of the border and in 1982 they went all the way to beirut .
they did not leave south lebanon until 2000 .
their aim in those operations was to remove palestinian fighters , from whom hezbollah has taken over .
it is possible that the israelis will decide to expand their currently quite limited ground attacks into the kind of big operation carried out in 1978 .
an attack on tyre on the coast would be considered as hezbollah has been firing rockets from around tyre .
however , all this would leave israel in occupation and under constant harassment and attack .
it would not be the long-term solution they seek .
if they simply left again , hezbollah would move back in .
the conflict escalates or spreads the intensity of the fighting might increase .
hezbollah might extend its attacks to other cities .
israel might step up its bombing and ground operations .
if this happened , tensions would rise all round .
the lebanese government , product of an uneasy alliance between lebanon 's various populations , and in which hezbollah sits with reforming elements from the cedar revolution , has held together .
but it could fall apart if the pressure is not eased and some solution does not become apparent , especially to the suffering of civilians .
hezbollah could emerge the stronger .
the fighting could develop into a new jihadist front , drawing in fighters from elsewhere .
hezbollah 's supporters , syria and iran , could get drawn in .
syria which has lost power in lebanon over the last couple of years could be tempted to regain influence there .
the sidelined issue of iran 's nuclear programme could come to the fore again and become a diplomatic and economic confrontation with the west if tensions increased .
the solution to the issue depends on understanding and confidence and this has been badly damaged by this crisis .

diplomatic settlement the lebanese government and hezbollah would agree to implement security council resolution 1559 .
this resolution , passed in september 2004 , called for the disbanding of all militias in lebanon and the extension of lebanese government authority to all parts of the country .
hezbollah would move out of south lebanon and the lebanese army would move down to the border with israel .
the idea is that this would remove the source of conflict .
lebanese women refugees from israeli bombing both israel and hezbollah would accept a ceasefire and the agreement formalised in a new security council resolution .
an international force would be deployed in the border area at least until the lebanese army arrived .
getting agreement on the mandate , size and deployment of such a force is not going to be easy .
it would replace an existing un force , unifil , which has been monitoring events but not influencing them since 1978 .
the israelis might maintain a self-declared " buffer zone " for a time , but any settlement would have to see an israeli withdrawal .
some kind of deal would be done to resolve the original trigger for this war , the capture of two israeli solders by hezbollah .
israel wants their unconditional release .
hezbollah says they were taken to be exchanged .
lebanon also wants israel to leave a strip of land known as the shebaa farms at the foot of mount hermon , but the un has ruled that this land belongs to syria and that its future should be decided by israeli-syrian negotiations .
stalemate under this scenario , the israeli military effort to remove hezbollah fighters from south lebanon gets bogged down and hezbollah refuses to pull back or reach any agreement with the lebanese government .
fighting continues .
this would leave israel far short of its aims .
there would be domestic political fall-out in that great ambitions were laid out for this conflict .
a stalemate in which israel was making little headway might also be interpreted as " israel loses " , in that it did not achieve its goals .
already the israelis have found the going tougher than they might have expected .
the terrain - mountainous , rocky , and full of caves , gullies and ravines - is ideal guerrilla country and the israelis can not use their armoured forces there easily .
israeli woman and children flee hezbollah rocket attack it is therefore conceivable that the israelis will not achieve the decisive victory they seek .
if that happened , the fighting could go on indefinitely to a greater or lesser degree .
israeli bombing could continue in an attempt to cut off hezbollah reinforcements moving south .
hezbollah could continue firing rockets from north of any israeli-controlled zone .
the civilian suffering would go on and people might not be able to return to normal lives on both sides of the border .
israel could establish control over a self-declared " buffer zone " along the border and just stay there .
there would be stalemate , with continuing confrontations and fire fights with the potential of the conflict erupting again at any time .
israel declares success israel would go on more or less as now until it reckoned it had achieved success .
it might or might not announce a ceasefire but it would in practice hand over southern lebanon to an international force and withdraw .
in due course , the lebanese army would deploy to the border .
israel would declare victory against hezbollah , though it would probably not get its two captured soldiers back .
the war winds down it is possible that at some stage the israelis will announce they have achieved their main aims through bombing and the removal of hezbollah from the border .
there might be no ceasefire but the bombing would stop or be reduced .
hezbollah might respond by stopping its rocket attacks .
there might be occasional incidents .
this would leave issues unresolved however , including that of the missing israeli soldiers .
israel will not exchange them for the prisoner hezbollah wants most , samir qantar , who attacked a block of flats in nahariha in 1979 , killing a father and his daughter -lrb- the latter by smashing her head in -rrb- .
the only prisoner release israel says it will engage in is one through the palestinian president mahmoud abbas .
wider israeli invasion israel might decide to step up its ground attacks , for example , after a hezbollah attack on cities further south .
in 1978 , the israelis invaded up to the litani river some 20km -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- north of the border and in 1982 they went all the way to beirut .
they did not leave south lebanon until 2000 .
their aim in those operations was to remove palestinian fighters , from whom hezbollah has taken over .
it is possible that the israelis will decide to expand their currently quite limited ground attacks into the kind of big operation carried out in 1978 .
an attack on tyre on the coast would be considered as hezbollah has been firing rockets from around tyre .
however , all this would leave israel in occupation and under constant harassment and attack .
it would not be the long-term solution they seek .
if they simply left again , hezbollah would move back in .
the conflict escalates or spreads the intensity of the fighting might increase .
hezbollah might extend its attacks to other cities .
israel might step up its bombing and ground operations .
if this happened , tensions would rise all round .
the lebanese government , product of an uneasy alliance between lebanon 's various populations , and in which hezbollah sits with reforming elements from the cedar revolution , has held together .
but it could fall apart if the pressure is not eased and some solution does not become apparent , especially to the suffering of civilians .
hezbollah could emerge the stronger .
the fighting could develop into a new jihadist front , drawing in fighters from elsewhere .
hezbollah 's supporters , syria and iran , could get drawn in .
syria which has lost power in lebanon over the last couple of years could be tempted to regain influence there .
the sidelined issue of iran 's nuclear programme could come to the fore again and become a diplomatic and economic confrontation with the west if tensions increased .
the solution to the issue depends on understanding and confidence and this has been badly damaged by this crisis .

diplomatic settlement the lebanese government and hezbollah would agree to implement security council resolution 1559 .
this resolution , passed in september 2004 , called for the disbanding of all militias in lebanon and the extension of lebanese government authority to all parts of the country .
hezbollah would move out of south lebanon and the lebanese army would move down to the border with israel .
the idea is that this would remove the source of conflict .
lebanese women refugees from israeli bombing both israel and hezbollah would accept a ceasefire and the agreement formalised in a new security council resolution .
an international force would be deployed in the border area at least until the lebanese army arrived .
getting agreement on the mandate , size and deployment of such a force is not going to be easy .
it would replace an existing un force , unifil , which has been monitoring events but not influencing them since 1978 .
the israelis might maintain a self-declared " buffer zone " for a time , but any settlement would have to see an israeli withdrawal .
some kind of deal would be done to resolve the original trigger for this war , the capture of two israeli solders by hezbollah .
israel wants their unconditional release .
hezbollah says they were taken to be exchanged .
lebanon also wants israel to leave a strip of land known as the shebaa farms at the foot of mount hermon , but the un has ruled that this land belongs to syria and that its future should be decided by israeli-syrian negotiations .
stalemate under this scenario , the israeli military effort to remove hezbollah fighters from south lebanon gets bogged down and hezbollah refuses to pull back or reach any agreement with the lebanese government .
fighting continues .
this would leave israel far short of its aims .
there would be domestic political fall-out in that great ambitions were laid out for this conflict .
a stalemate in which israel was making little headway might also be interpreted as " israel loses " , in that it did not achieve its goals .
already the israelis have found the going tougher than they might have expected .
the terrain - mountainous , rocky , and full of caves , gullies and ravines - is ideal guerrilla country and the israelis can not use their armoured forces there easily .
israeli woman and children flee hezbollah rocket attack it is therefore conceivable that the israelis will not achieve the decisive victory they seek .
if that happened , the fighting could go on indefinitely to a greater or lesser degree .
israeli bombing could continue in an attempt to cut off hezbollah reinforcements moving south .
hezbollah could continue firing rockets from north of any israeli-controlled zone .
the civilian suffering would go on and people might not be able to return to normal lives on both sides of the border .
israel could establish control over a self-declared " buffer zone " along the border and just stay there .
there would be stalemate , with continuing confrontations and fire fights with the potential of the conflict erupting again at any time .
israel declares success israel would go on more or less as now until it reckoned it had achieved success .
it might or might not announce a ceasefire but it would in practice hand over southern lebanon to an international force and withdraw .
in due course , the lebanese army would deploy to the border .
israel would declare victory against hezbollah , though it would probably not get its two captured soldiers back .
the war winds down it is possible that at some stage the israelis will announce they have achieved their main aims through bombing and the removal of hezbollah from the border .
there might be no ceasefire but the bombing would stop or be reduced .
hezbollah might respond by stopping its rocket attacks .
there might be occasional incidents .
this would leave issues unresolved however , including that of the missing israeli soldiers .
israel will not exchange them for the prisoner hezbollah wants most , samir qantar , who attacked a block of flats in nahariha in 1979 , killing a father and his daughter -lrb- the latter by smashing her head in -rrb- .
the only prisoner release israel says it will engage in is one through the palestinian president mahmoud abbas .
wider israeli invasion israel might decide to step up its ground attacks , for example , after a hezbollah attack on cities further south .
in 1978 , the israelis invaded up to the litani river some 20km -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- north of the border and in 1982 they went all the way to beirut .
they did not leave south lebanon until 2000 .
their aim in those operations was to remove palestinian fighters , from whom hezbollah has taken over .
it is possible that the israelis will decide to expand their currently quite limited ground attacks into the kind of big operation carried out in 1978 .
an attack on tyre on the coast would be considered as hezbollah has been firing rockets from around tyre .
however , all this would leave israel in occupation and under constant harassment and attack .
it would not be the long-term solution they seek .
if they simply left again , hezbollah would move back in .
the conflict escalates or spreads the intensity of the fighting might increase .
hezbollah might extend its attacks to other cities .
israel might step up its bombing and ground operations .
if this happened , tensions would rise all round .
the lebanese government , product of an uneasy alliance between lebanon 's various populations , and in which hezbollah sits with reforming elements from the cedar revolution , has held together .
but it could fall apart if the pressure is not eased and some solution does not become apparent , especially to the suffering of civilians .
hezbollah could emerge the stronger .
the fighting could develop into a new jihadist front , drawing in fighters from elsewhere .
hezbollah 's supporters , syria and iran , could get drawn in .
syria which has lost power in lebanon over the last couple of years could be tempted to regain influence there .
the sidelined issue of iran 's nuclear programme could come to the fore again and become a diplomatic and economic confrontation with the west if tensions increased .
the solution to the issue depends on understanding and confidence and this has been badly damaged by this crisis .

the current leckwith athletics stadium is due to make way for the new £ 35m 30,000 seater football stadium .
a new athletics arena was to be built before the old one was demolished but the football club has told the council it will be too costly to wait .
council leader rodney berman said he was " very disappointed " at the news .
cardiff amateur athletics club said being without a stadium for 11 months was " simply not acceptable " .
cardiff city fc plans to build the football stadium on land at leckwith , opposite the club 's current ninian park ground , with a retail development .
the athletics arena would be built nearby . "
i am deeply concerned about the impact this could have on the users of the athletics stadium " council leader rodney berman mr berman said he understood the new athletics stadium would be in place before the demolition of the current one .
but he says the football club have informed the council that to wait for a new athletics facility to be built would add millions to the cost of the project .
the council leader said this would leave athletes and other users of cardiff athletic stadium without a home for up to 11 months .
athletics club cardiff aac and the grange quins football club are among users of the stadium .
mr berman said the council had " repeatedly informed " cardiff city that a new athletics stadium needs to be built before the football stadium work begins and said the council " is determined that ccfc must find a solution to this . "
" i am very disappointed that cardiff city football club is now saying it is not going to be possible to construct a new athletic stadium before the existing one is demolished , " said mr berman .
" up until now they had always indicated that this would be possible and this news now places everyone involved in this project in a difficult position .
" i am deeply concerned about the impact this could have on the users of the athletics stadium who up until now have always been promised a seamless transfer . "
he said talk of alternative facilities at uwic or cwmbran needed to be examined carefully , including whether athletes could get there .
mr berman said he was happy to hold meetings to try to find a compromise .
jeff kirby , the chairman of cardiff aac said : " not having an athletics stadium in cardiff for 11 months is simply not acceptable .

bbc news -pipe- africa -pipe- congo election reporters ' log : wednesday home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog languages somali french arabic swahili great lakes hausa portuguese africa more last updated : thursday , 27 july 2006 , 07:56 gmt 08:56 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version congo election reporters ' log : wednesday the democratic republic of congo is getting ready for what should be the first free presidential elections since independence 45 years ago .
after years of conflict and misrule , this country some two-thirds the size of western europe does not have a road or railway running from one side to the other .
a team of bbc reporters is covering the polls and journalists are sending their observations : arnaud zajtman , kinshasa , wednesday 26 july : 2010 local time tension is rising at we get closer to the election date .
there is no curfew but in kinshasa 's city centre , people rush home before night falls .
we are getting near the height of the election battle and people remember that only a few years back , the president and the vice-presidents currently competing in the campaign were fighting a real war one against the other .
this has only ended thanks to the set-up of a power-sharing government and people in kinshasa know that some of them will lose power - and so there is a danger that fighting to resume once again .
however , my neighbour is more at peace now than a week ago .
she is one of the 2,000 lebanese who live here and her five-year-old son was stuck in southern lebanon during the bombings .
the boy fled with his uncle in syria only four days ago .
he is now safe , and so is her entire family .
kinshasa 's lebanese community is 90 % muslim from the south and 10 % christian .
some of them are successful diamond dealers , but most are shopkeepers or small industry-owners and they have not been spared by congo 's instability .
they have lost everything during the massive looting that went on here in 1991 and 1993 .
but even more recently , when joseph kabila 's father laurent was killed in january 2001 , 11 lebanese , some of them very young , were executed by the men allegedly involved in the president 's assassination .
this was because one lebanese money-changer knicknamed " heritier " was allegedly involved in the plot but failed to play his part and disappeared .
the 11 lebanese , including heritier 's own brother , were killed in retaliation .
my neighbour says , however , that she hopes things will now go smoothly in dr congo , because her country is being bombed , and she , and her 2,000 compatriots , have nowhere else to go .
noel mwakugu , kisangani , wednesday 26 july : 1930 local time there has been a lot of campaigning here in kisangani today , with four presidential candidates - eugene diomi ngongala , nzanga mobutu , arthur z 'ahidi ngoma and pierre pay pay - criss-crossing the city and going door to door in a last-minute effort .
it 's become very confusing - most of the people i spoke to had shifted from one meeting to another and it was difficult to tell who they really supported .
but people in kisangani say their main concerns are the delivery of schools and hospitals , and salaries for civil servants .
this eastern province is vital in the election - its large population means that the winner here is likely to become president .
that 's why so many candidates , even some who are relative novices , have made the efforts to come here .
president kabila 's supporters were also out in their regalia at the opposition meetings .
it 's a unique situation - you 'd expect them to be shouting insults at each other but that has n't happened .
joseph winter , lubumbashi , wednesday 26 july : 1750 local time as we left zambia market after the lap-top link-up we noticed a large crowd outside a " battle bus " belonging to one of the parliamentary candidates , denis kalonji ngoye of the christian social democratic party , pdsc .
on closer inspection , we saw that they were handing out small bottles of mineral water , while the loudspeakers strapped on top of the bus were deafening people with campaign slogans .
some people queued up patiently for these free gifts but at the front of the queue , there was quite a scramble as each bottle was handed out .
will bottled water and a t-shirt buy a vote ?
mr kalonji 's campaign director -lrb- pictured giving out the bottles -rrb- denied that he was trying to buy people 's votes - on the cheap .
" the water symbolises life .
we give out water to show that if we are elected , we will give life , " he said .
" we are not handing out money like some candidates do . "
many congolese are so poor that the free gifts - caps , t-shirts , water , food - given out at election time are extremely welcome .
and i am sure most will happily take whatever is given to them .
not everyone proudly wearing a new joseph kabila t-shirt or cap in lubumbashi will vote for him - and not all of those rushing to get water will vote for mr kalonji or the pdsc .
i wonder if the candidates are not wasting their money ?
orla guerin , goma city , wednesday 26 july : 1720 local time we drove north from goma city along roads lined with dense forest interspersed with patches of banana groves , to reach the village of kiwanja .
in the past two months thousands have fled here to escape the latest fighting and instability in the east of congo .
first they sheltered in the grounds of a church , now most have found temporary accommodation with local families .
we found the rest in a rough camp with makeshift huts made of plastic sheeting .
people told us they had fled from the interahamwe militia .
one man said he had been forced to leave his home time and again over the years because of fighting .
he told us he fled into the forest with his children .
they suffered from exposure , hunger and disease and one by one five of them died .
everyone we met said they wanted to vote and they hoped it would make a difference , but no one sounded convinced .
mark doyle , mitwaba , central katanga province , wednesday 26 july : 1415 local time five thousand feet above sea level , and the air is fresh and clean .
this is a small settlement .
there 's a rutted dirt road lined with eucalptus trees , a catholic church compound , an airstrip and a football field .
i 'm glad to be here after the dust and filth of the mines i visited in southern katanga .
but most of the rest of the people i meet are not .
next to the football field there are two camps for war displaced people .
one has civilians who fled fighting between government forces and rebels of the mai-mai group .
one has former mai mai combatants .
" mai-mai " means magic water .
if you go through the rites of initiation , it 's said , the water can stop bullets .
the two groups live in sulky acceptance of each other - for now .
that 's because here in mitwaba they have access to medical care from a small group of nurses from medecins sans frontieres and the occasional food delivery from the church .
no-one is likely to cause major trouble while the aid continues and while un peacekeepers , in this case from benin , remain in place .
while i 'm here , the beninois play a football match against the former fighters .
the score ?
one-nil to benin .
-lrb- " we did n't want to beat them too badly " , says a young lieutenant -rrb- the election ?
a small group of women sashay down the road singing the praises of the alliance backing incumbent president joseph kabila .
the woman leading the singing is the only fat person i see in mitwaba .
felin gakwaya , goma , wednesday 26 july : 1310 local time i have just been to a conference for journalists about the measures we can take to work safely in this area .
it was run by an organisation called journalists in danger .
they spoke about the health risks - it 's easy to get sick here - and some safety issues .
pygmies endure discrimination , says activist mupepa kakara journalists were warned about verbal or physical aggression , kidnapping , imprisonment by militia groups or even government soldiers - you never know - and the danger of assassination .
earlier , i interviewed mupepa kakara , the president of the adelipo association , which defends the rights of pygmies .
the pygmies feel discriminated against as they do n't get the chance to study and do n't get government jobs .
they are not supporting any particular political party in the election - they say they will vote , but their choice of candidate will be a secret .
joseph winter , lubumbashi , wednesday 26 july : 0850 local time people here in lubumbashi are far more excited about the elections than the people i met in kinshasa , and people are looking forward to casting votes .
laptop link-up some of the children who live nearby are fascinated by what we are doing .
a policeman also walked past , staring at us joseph winter zambia market , lubumbashi ask the voters in pics : congolese market president joseph kabila held a large rally here yesterday - this province , katanga , is his home area .
there are still a lot of people walking round with joseph kabila hats , t-shirts and pieces of cloth .
i 'm in the zambia market , which is the cheapest market in town .
everything is on sale here , from women selling petrol in plastic cans , to people selling piles of sugar which they scoop up in small tins .
i was surprised to see that they sell frozen fish brought all the way from south africa in refrigerated containers .
i 'm not sure about the hygiene implications but in terms of intra-african trade it 's interesting .
i 'm busy all day doing a live laptop link-up , getting people from the market to answer questions emailed in from readers around the world .
some of the children who live nearby are fascinated by what we are doing .
a policeman also walked past , staring at us .
karen allen , geti , wednesday 26 july : 0630 local time having retired to bed with the sound of a lullaby , we awake to a new day at 6am with more singing .
women from the refugee camp where we have spent the night begin their morning tasks .
dr congo is preparing for its first democratic elections in 40 years it 's hard to believe from their mood that these people have fled fighting between the congolese army and militia groups , and spending the night among them is a great levelling experience .
we 're starting to attract less attention - blending in .
as we walk through the rows of tents , there are people trying to normalise their lives .
a perfectly ironed shirt lies on a blanket , as a boy re-heats his iron in a small fire .
and in the distance a small girl washes plates on a small stand fashioned from bamboo .
not that there is any food this morning to dirty the plates , but it 's a ritual that does n't look out of place here among the tents .
the aid workers from medecins sans frontieres who have been our hosts continue their task of building a health centre for the camp .
many have left their permanent jobs in paris and geneva to lend emergency assistance out here , trading coffee and croissants for cold water baths in this vast tented city .
they are jovial and committed .
since scaling up their operation two weeks ago they 've vaccinated 10,000 kids against measles .
the immediate need now is for more food , water containers and tarpaulin for shelters .
the world food programme has warned that food supplies are drying up here .
they say this is the worst displacement they have seen in two years .
depressing , with elections just days away .
hassan arouni , kinshasa , wednesday 26 july : 0530 local time a warm " good morning ! " - or " mbote " as they say in kinshasa .
when i arrived a few days ago i was pleasantly surprised to find wide boulevards and gentle breezes blowing from the mighty congo river .
not so gentle are the tensions and expectations surrounding the first multiparty polls in more than 40 years .
only yesterday there was an exchange of petrol bombs and tear gas between security forces and supporters of veteran opposition leader , etienne tshisekedi , whose party is not taking part .
despite the problems that there have been in the east , here in kinshasa president kabila 's supporters seem sure of one thing : that come sunday , he will be given a mandate to continue ruling the country .
karen allen , geti , tuesday 25 july : 2230 local time the town of geti close to the ugandan border has a population of 15,000 , but in the past two weeks that has more than doubled , as tens of thousands of internally displaced people have fled the fighting between rebel groups and the fragmented congolese army .
ituri province has one of the highest voter registrations we arrived in the late afternoon to find swelling crowds .
more than half are children , grubby , hungry and excited at the arrival of strangers .
many of the families here try to cling on to some semblance of normality .
i pass a man having a haircut at a makeshift barber 's stall , and as night falls all you can smell is burning fires as women prepare a modest meal of beans .
but the world food programme is warning that food supplies here are drying up .
they describe the recent influx of frightened people as the worst displacement they 've seen in the past two years .
so what are the prospects for sunday 's vote ?
five people were killed in the militia attacks at the weekend and large numbers of people here are too frightened to return to their villages to vote .
the sad irony is that ituri , the province where geti is situated , has one of the highest levels of voter registrations in dr congo .
today we will spend the night in the medecins sans frontieres compound , my producer and i assigned two folding hospital beds .

after years of conflict and misrule , this country some two-thirds the size of western europe does not have a road or railway running from one side to the other .
a team of bbc reporters is covering the polls and journalists are sending their observations : arnaud zajtman , kinshasa , wednesday 26 july : 2010 local time tension is rising at we get closer to the election date .
there is no curfew but in kinshasa 's city centre , people rush home before night falls .
we are getting near the height of the election battle and people remember that only a few years back , the president and the vice-presidents currently competing in the campaign were fighting a real war one against the other .
this has only ended thanks to the set-up of a power-sharing government and people in kinshasa know that some of them will lose power - and so there is a danger that fighting to resume once again .
however , my neighbour is more at peace now than a week ago .
she is one of the 2,000 lebanese who live here and her five-year-old son was stuck in southern lebanon during the bombings .
the boy fled with his uncle in syria only four days ago .
he is now safe , and so is her entire family .
kinshasa 's lebanese community is 90 % muslim from the south and 10 % christian .
some of them are successful diamond dealers , but most are shopkeepers or small industry-owners and they have not been spared by congo 's instability .
they have lost everything during the massive looting that went on here in 1991 and 1993 .
but even more recently , when joseph kabila 's father laurent was killed in january 2001 , 11 lebanese , some of them very young , were executed by the men allegedly involved in the president 's assassination .
this was because one lebanese money-changer knicknamed " heritier " was allegedly involved in the plot but failed to play his part and disappeared .
the 11 lebanese , including heritier 's own brother , were killed in retaliation .
my neighbour says , however , that she hopes things will now go smoothly in dr congo , because her country is being bombed , and she , and her 2,000 compatriots , have nowhere else to go .
noel mwakugu , kisangani , wednesday 26 july : 1930 local time there has been a lot of campaigning here in kisangani today , with four presidential candidates - eugene diomi ngongala , nzanga mobutu , arthur z 'ahidi ngoma and pierre pay pay - criss-crossing the city and going door to door in a last-minute effort .
it 's become very confusing - most of the people i spoke to had shifted from one meeting to another and it was difficult to tell who they really supported .
but people in kisangani say their main concerns are the delivery of schools and hospitals , and salaries for civil servants .
this eastern province is vital in the election - its large population means that the winner here is likely to become president .
that 's why so many candidates , even some who are relative novices , have made the efforts to come here .
president kabila 's supporters were also out in their regalia at the opposition meetings .
it 's a unique situation - you 'd expect them to be shouting insults at each other but that has n't happened .
joseph winter , lubumbashi , wednesday 26 july : 1750 local time as we left zambia market after the lap-top link-up we noticed a large crowd outside a " battle bus " belonging to one of the parliamentary candidates , denis kalonji ngoye of the christian social democratic party , pdsc .
on closer inspection , we saw that they were handing out small bottles of mineral water , while the loudspeakers strapped on top of the bus were deafening people with campaign slogans .
some people queued up patiently for these free gifts but at the front of the queue , there was quite a scramble as each bottle was handed out .
will bottled water and a t-shirt buy a vote ?
mr kalonji 's campaign director -lrb- pictured giving out the bottles -rrb- denied that he was trying to buy people 's votes - on the cheap .
" the water symbolises life .
we give out water to show that if we are elected , we will give life , " he said .
" we are not handing out money like some candidates do . "
many congolese are so poor that the free gifts - caps , t-shirts , water , food - given out at election time are extremely welcome .
and i am sure most will happily take whatever is given to them .
not everyone proudly wearing a new joseph kabila t-shirt or cap in lubumbashi will vote for him - and not all of those rushing to get water will vote for mr kalonji or the pdsc .
i wonder if the candidates are not wasting their money ?
orla guerin , goma city , wednesday 26 july : 1720 local time we drove north from goma city along roads lined with dense forest interspersed with patches of banana groves , to reach the village of kiwanja .
in the past two months thousands have fled here to escape the latest fighting and instability in the east of congo .
first they sheltered in the grounds of a church , now most have found temporary accommodation with local families .
we found the rest in a rough camp with makeshift huts made of plastic sheeting .
people told us they had fled from the interahamwe militia .
one man said he had been forced to leave his home time and again over the years because of fighting .
he told us he fled into the forest with his children .
they suffered from exposure , hunger and disease and one by one five of them died .
everyone we met said they wanted to vote and they hoped it would make a difference , but no one sounded convinced .
mark doyle , mitwaba , central katanga province , wednesday 26 july : 1415 local time five thousand feet above sea level , and the air is fresh and clean .
this is a small settlement .
there 's a rutted dirt road lined with eucalptus trees , a catholic church compound , an airstrip and a football field .
i 'm glad to be here after the dust and filth of the mines i visited in southern katanga .
but most of the rest of the people i meet are not .
next to the football field there are two camps for war displaced people .
one has civilians who fled fighting between government forces and rebels of the mai-mai group .
one has former mai mai combatants .
" mai-mai " means magic water .
if you go through the rites of initiation , it 's said , the water can stop bullets .
the two groups live in sulky acceptance of each other - for now .
that 's because here in mitwaba they have access to medical care from a small group of nurses from medecins sans frontieres and the occasional food delivery from the church .
no-one is likely to cause major trouble while the aid continues and while un peacekeepers , in this case from benin , remain in place .
while i 'm here , the beninois play a football match against the former fighters .
the score ?
one-nil to benin .
-lrb- " we did n't want to beat them too badly " , says a young lieutenant -rrb- the election ?
a small group of women sashay down the road singing the praises of the alliance backing incumbent president joseph kabila .
the woman leading the singing is the only fat person i see in mitwaba .
felin gakwaya , goma , wednesday 26 july : 1310 local time i have just been to a conference for journalists about the measures we can take to work safely in this area .
it was run by an organisation called journalists in danger .
they spoke about the health risks - it 's easy to get sick here - and some safety issues .
pygmies endure discrimination , says activist mupepa kakara journalists were warned about verbal or physical aggression , kidnapping , imprisonment by militia groups or even government soldiers - you never know - and the danger of assassination .
earlier , i interviewed mupepa kakara , the president of the adelipo association , which defends the rights of pygmies .
the pygmies feel discriminated against as they do n't get the chance to study and do n't get government jobs .
they are not supporting any particular political party in the election - they say they will vote , but their choice of candidate will be a secret .
joseph winter , lubumbashi , wednesday 26 july : 0850 local time people here in lubumbashi are far more excited about the elections than the people i met in kinshasa , and people are looking forward to casting votes .
laptop link-up some of the children who live nearby are fascinated by what we are doing .
a policeman also walked past , staring at us joseph winter zambia market , lubumbashi ask the voters in pics : congolese market president joseph kabila held a large rally here yesterday - this province , katanga , is his home area .
there are still a lot of people walking round with joseph kabila hats , t-shirts and pieces of cloth .
i 'm in the zambia market , which is the cheapest market in town .
everything is on sale here , from women selling petrol in plastic cans , to people selling piles of sugar which they scoop up in small tins .
i was surprised to see that they sell frozen fish brought all the way from south africa in refrigerated containers .
i 'm not sure about the hygiene implications but in terms of intra-african trade it 's interesting .
i 'm busy all day doing a live laptop link-up , getting people from the market to answer questions emailed in from readers around the world .
some of the children who live nearby are fascinated by what we are doing .
a policeman also walked past , staring at us .
karen allen , geti , wednesday 26 july : 0630 local time having retired to bed with the sound of a lullaby , we awake to a new day at 6am with more singing .
women from the refugee camp where we have spent the night begin their morning tasks .
dr congo is preparing for its first democratic elections in 40 years it 's hard to believe from their mood that these people have fled fighting between the congolese army and militia groups , and spending the night among them is a great levelling experience .
we 're starting to attract less attention - blending in .
as we walk through the rows of tents , there are people trying to normalise their lives .
a perfectly ironed shirt lies on a blanket , as a boy re-heats his iron in a small fire .
and in the distance a small girl washes plates on a small stand fashioned from bamboo .
not that there is any food this morning to dirty the plates , but it 's a ritual that does n't look out of place here among the tents .
the aid workers from medecins sans frontieres who have been our hosts continue their task of building a health centre for the camp .
many have left their permanent jobs in paris and geneva to lend emergency assistance out here , trading coffee and croissants for cold water baths in this vast tented city .
they are jovial and committed .
since scaling up their operation two weeks ago they 've vaccinated 10,000 kids against measles .
the immediate need now is for more food , water containers and tarpaulin for shelters .
the world food programme has warned that food supplies are drying up here .
they say this is the worst displacement they have seen in two years .
depressing , with elections just days away .
hassan arouni , kinshasa , wednesday 26 july : 0530 local time a warm " good morning ! " - or " mbote " as they say in kinshasa .
when i arrived a few days ago i was pleasantly surprised to find wide boulevards and gentle breezes blowing from the mighty congo river .
not so gentle are the tensions and expectations surrounding the first multiparty polls in more than 40 years .
only yesterday there was an exchange of petrol bombs and tear gas between security forces and supporters of veteran opposition leader , etienne tshisekedi , whose party is not taking part .
despite the problems that there have been in the east , here in kinshasa president kabila 's supporters seem sure of one thing : that come sunday , he will be given a mandate to continue ruling the country .
karen allen , geti , tuesday 25 july : 2230 local time the town of geti close to the ugandan border has a population of 15,000 , but in the past two weeks that has more than doubled , as tens of thousands of internally displaced people have fled the fighting between rebel groups and the fragmented congolese army .
ituri province has one of the highest voter registrations we arrived in the late afternoon to find swelling crowds .
more than half are children , grubby , hungry and excited at the arrival of strangers .
many of the families here try to cling on to some semblance of normality .
i pass a man having a haircut at a makeshift barber 's stall , and as night falls all you can smell is burning fires as women prepare a modest meal of beans .
but the world food programme is warning that food supplies here are drying up .
they describe the recent influx of frightened people as the worst displacement they 've seen in the past two years .
so what are the prospects for sunday 's vote ?
five people were killed in the militia attacks at the weekend and large numbers of people here are too frightened to return to their villages to vote .
the sad irony is that ituri , the province where geti is situated , has one of the highest levels of voter registrations in dr congo .
today we will spend the night in the medecins sans frontieres compound , my producer and i assigned two folding hospital beds .
ringing in my ears when i finally hit the sack will the sound of the lullaby three elderly women sang so sweetly to the sleepy children in the camp .
there may be despair at the continuing violence in this part of the world , but for a moment this cluster of people were able to forget .

after years of conflict and misrule , this country some two-thirds the size of western europe does not have a road or railway running from one side to the other .
a team of bbc reporters is covering the polls and journalists are sending their observations : arnaud zajtman , kinshasa , wednesday 26 july : 2010 local time tension is rising at we get closer to the election date .
there is no curfew but in kinshasa 's city centre , people rush home before night falls .
we are getting near the height of the election battle and people remember that only a few years back , the president and the vice-presidents currently competing in the campaign were fighting a real war one against the other .
this has only ended thanks to the set-up of a power-sharing government and people in kinshasa know that some of them will lose power - and so there is a danger that fighting to resume once again .
however , my neighbour is more at peace now than a week ago .
she is one of the 2,000 lebanese who live here and her five-year-old son was stuck in southern lebanon during the bombings .
the boy fled with his uncle in syria only four days ago .
he is now safe , and so is her entire family .
kinshasa 's lebanese community is 90 % muslim from the south and 10 % christian .
some of them are successful diamond dealers , but most are shopkeepers or small industry-owners and they have not been spared by congo 's instability .
they have lost everything during the massive looting that went on here in 1991 and 1993 .
but even more recently , when joseph kabila 's father laurent was killed in january 2001 , 11 lebanese , some of them very young , were executed by the men allegedly involved in the president 's assassination .
this was because one lebanese money-changer knicknamed " heritier " was allegedly involved in the plot but failed to play his part and disappeared .
the 11 lebanese , including heritier 's own brother , were killed in retaliation .
my neighbour says , however , that she hopes things will now go smoothly in dr congo , because her country is being bombed , and she , and her 2,000 compatriots , have nowhere else to go .
noel mwakugu , kisangani , wednesday 26 july : 1930 local time there has been a lot of campaigning here in kisangani today , with four presidential candidates - eugene diomi ngongala , nzanga mobutu , arthur z 'ahidi ngoma and pierre pay pay - criss-crossing the city and going door to door in a last-minute effort .
it 's become very confusing - most of the people i spoke to had shifted from one meeting to another and it was difficult to tell who they really supported .
but people in kisangani say their main concerns are the delivery of schools and hospitals , and salaries for civil servants .
this eastern province is vital in the election - its large population means that the winner here is likely to become president .
that 's why so many candidates , even some who are relative novices , have made the efforts to come here .
president kabila 's supporters were also out in their regalia at the opposition meetings .
it 's a unique situation - you 'd expect them to be shouting insults at each other but that has n't happened .
joseph winter , lubumbashi , wednesday 26 july : 1750 local time as we left zambia market after the lap-top link-up we noticed a large crowd outside a " battle bus " belonging to one of the parliamentary candidates , denis kalonji ngoye of the christian social democratic party , pdsc .
on closer inspection , we saw that they were handing out small bottles of mineral water , while the loudspeakers strapped on top of the bus were deafening people with campaign slogans .
some people queued up patiently for these free gifts but at the front of the queue , there was quite a scramble as each bottle was handed out .
will bottled water and a t-shirt buy a vote ?
mr kalonji 's campaign director -lrb- pictured giving out the bottles -rrb- denied that he was trying to buy people 's votes - on the cheap .
" the water symbolises life .
we give out water to show that if we are elected , we will give life , " he said .
" we are not handing out money like some candidates do . "
many congolese are so poor that the free gifts - caps , t-shirts , water , food - given out at election time are extremely welcome .
and i am sure most will happily take whatever is given to them .
not everyone proudly wearing a new joseph kabila t-shirt or cap in lubumbashi will vote for him - and not all of those rushing to get water will vote for mr kalonji or the pdsc .
i wonder if the candidates are not wasting their money ?
orla guerin , goma city , wednesday 26 july : 1720 local time we drove north from goma city along roads lined with dense forest interspersed with patches of banana groves , to reach the village of kiwanja .
in the past two months thousands have fled here to escape the latest fighting and instability in the east of congo .
first they sheltered in the grounds of a church , now most have found temporary accommodation with local families .
we found the rest in a rough camp with makeshift huts made of plastic sheeting .
people told us they had fled from the interahamwe militia .
one man said he had been forced to leave his home time and again over the years because of fighting .
he told us he fled into the forest with his children .
they suffered from exposure , hunger and disease and one by one five of them died .
everyone we met said they wanted to vote and they hoped it would make a difference , but no one sounded convinced .
mark doyle , mitwaba , central katanga province , wednesday 26 july : 1415 local time five thousand feet above sea level , and the air is fresh and clean .
this is a small settlement .
there 's a rutted dirt road lined with eucalptus trees , a catholic church compound , an airstrip and a football field .
i 'm glad to be here after the dust and filth of the mines i visited in southern katanga .
but most of the rest of the people i meet are not .
next to the football field there are two camps for war displaced people .
one has civilians who fled fighting between government forces and rebels of the mai-mai group .
one has former mai mai combatants .
" mai-mai " means magic water .
if you go through the rites of initiation , it 's said , the water can stop bullets .
the two groups live in sulky acceptance of each other - for now .
that 's because here in mitwaba they have access to medical care from a small group of nurses from medecins sans frontieres and the occasional food delivery from the church .
no-one is likely to cause major trouble while the aid continues and while un peacekeepers , in this case from benin , remain in place .
while i 'm here , the beninois play a football match against the former fighters .
the score ?
one-nil to benin .
-lrb- " we did n't want to beat them too badly " , says a young lieutenant -rrb- the election ?
a small group of women sashay down the road singing the praises of the alliance backing incumbent president joseph kabila .
the woman leading the singing is the only fat person i see in mitwaba .
felin gakwaya , goma , wednesday 26 july : 1310 local time i have just been to a conference for journalists about the measures we can take to work safely in this area .
it was run by an organisation called journalists in danger .
they spoke about the health risks - it 's easy to get sick here - and some safety issues .
pygmies endure discrimination , says activist mupepa kakara journalists were warned about verbal or physical aggression , kidnapping , imprisonment by militia groups or even government soldiers - you never know - and the danger of assassination .
earlier , i interviewed mupepa kakara , the president of the adelipo association , which defends the rights of pygmies .
the pygmies feel discriminated against as they do n't get the chance to study and do n't get government jobs .
they are not supporting any particular political party in the election - they say they will vote , but their choice of candidate will be a secret .
joseph winter , lubumbashi , wednesday 26 july : 0850 local time people here in lubumbashi are far more excited about the elections than the people i met in kinshasa , and people are looking forward to casting votes .
laptop link-up some of the children who live nearby are fascinated by what we are doing .
a policeman also walked past , staring at us joseph winter zambia market , lubumbashi ask the voters in pics : congolese market president joseph kabila held a large rally here yesterday - this province , katanga , is his home area .
there are still a lot of people walking round with joseph kabila hats , t-shirts and pieces of cloth .
i 'm in the zambia market , which is the cheapest market in town .
everything is on sale here , from women selling petrol in plastic cans , to people selling piles of sugar which they scoop up in small tins .
i was surprised to see that they sell frozen fish brought all the way from south africa in refrigerated containers .
i 'm not sure about the hygiene implications but in terms of intra-african trade it 's interesting .
i 'm busy all day doing a live laptop link-up , getting people from the market to answer questions emailed in from readers around the world .
some of the children who live nearby are fascinated by what we are doing .
a policeman also walked past , staring at us .
karen allen , geti , wednesday 26 july : 0630 local time having retired to bed with the sound of a lullaby , we awake to a new day at 6am with more singing .
women from the refugee camp where we have spent the night begin their morning tasks .
dr congo is preparing for its first democratic elections in 40 years it 's hard to believe from their mood that these people have fled fighting between the congolese army and militia groups , and spending the night among them is a great levelling experience .
we 're starting to attract less attention - blending in .
as we walk through the rows of tents , there are people trying to normalise their lives .
a perfectly ironed shirt lies on a blanket , as a boy re-heats his iron in a small fire .
and in the distance a small girl washes plates on a small stand fashioned from bamboo .
not that there is any food this morning to dirty the plates , but it 's a ritual that does n't look out of place here among the tents .
the aid workers from medecins sans frontieres who have been our hosts continue their task of building a health centre for the camp .
many have left their permanent jobs in paris and geneva to lend emergency assistance out here , trading coffee and croissants for cold water baths in this vast tented city .
they are jovial and committed .
since scaling up their operation two weeks ago they 've vaccinated 10,000 kids against measles .
the immediate need now is for more food , water containers and tarpaulin for shelters .
the world food programme has warned that food supplies are drying up here .
they say this is the worst displacement they have seen in two years .
depressing , with elections just days away .
hassan arouni , kinshasa , wednesday 26 july : 0530 local time a warm " good morning ! " - or " mbote " as they say in kinshasa .
when i arrived a few days ago i was pleasantly surprised to find wide boulevards and gentle breezes blowing from the mighty congo river .
not so gentle are the tensions and expectations surrounding the first multiparty polls in more than 40 years .
only yesterday there was an exchange of petrol bombs and tear gas between security forces and supporters of veteran opposition leader , etienne tshisekedi , whose party is not taking part .
despite the problems that there have been in the east , here in kinshasa president kabila 's supporters seem sure of one thing : that come sunday , he will be given a mandate to continue ruling the country .
karen allen , geti , tuesday 25 july : 2230 local time the town of geti close to the ugandan border has a population of 15,000 , but in the past two weeks that has more than doubled , as tens of thousands of internally displaced people have fled the fighting between rebel groups and the fragmented congolese army .
ituri province has one of the highest voter registrations we arrived in the late afternoon to find swelling crowds .
more than half are children , grubby , hungry and excited at the arrival of strangers .
many of the families here try to cling on to some semblance of normality .
i pass a man having a haircut at a makeshift barber 's stall , and as night falls all you can smell is burning fires as women prepare a modest meal of beans .
but the world food programme is warning that food supplies here are drying up .
they describe the recent influx of frightened people as the worst displacement they 've seen in the past two years .
so what are the prospects for sunday 's vote ?
five people were killed in the militia attacks at the weekend and large numbers of people here are too frightened to return to their villages to vote .
the sad irony is that ituri , the province where geti is situated , has one of the highest levels of voter registrations in dr congo .
today we will spend the night in the medecins sans frontieres compound , my producer and i assigned two folding hospital beds .
ringing in my ears when i finally hit the sack will the sound of the lullaby three elderly women sang so sweetly to the sleepy children in the camp .
there may be despair at the continuing violence in this part of the world , but for a moment this cluster of people were able to forget .

analysis of the contents of millions of e-mails has revealed that less than 4 % is legitimate traffic .
further work has shown that most of this junk mail is originating on hijacked home computers .
e-mail security firm return path said 99 % of the computers it monitors that send mail have been taken over by spammers or virus writers .
return path reached its estimate by calculating a " reputation score " for the 20 million net addresses of those machines .
the root cause of spam is the existence of an ever growing and strengthening network of ' botnets ' matt peachey the score was derived by analyzing the e-mail traffic sent through those addresses , the number of complaints filed about that address , and if the owner of that address responds to complaints .
the vast majority of these net addresses were not good net citizens , said george bilbrey , spokesman for return path .
only 1 % of net addresses could be regarded as legitimate sources of mail .
the rest , said mr bilbrey , were hijacked computers , or bots , used by spammers and other net criminals to send e-mail .
zombie take-over typically these home computers are compromised by viruses sent in e-mail messages or by worms that trawl the net looking for vulnerable machines .
matt peachey , regional director for ironport , which monitors about a quarter of all mail sent across the net , said its research revealed that about 80 % of e-mail came from compromised hosts .
though , he said there were some cases such as with polish telecom where that percentage was likely to be much higher .
the vast majority of the 170,000 net addresses sending e-mail from polish telecom were probably zombies , he said .
ironport 's analysis of the e-mail traffic sent to large corporations reveals that more and more of the messages are junk that is not worth reading .
mr peachey said statistics for one of its customers show that from 20 june to 20 july only 4 % of the messages received were legitimate .
of the rest , he said , 70 % were spam , 11 % were bounces or error messages and 9 % was viruses .
on average , said mr peachey , only about 10 % of e-mail was now real .
nations the news comes as anti-virus firm sophos reveals the list of nations where most spam starts its journey across the net .
statistics ca n't be reduced any further unless us home users take action to secure their computers graham cluley top of the list is the us as , according to sophos , 23.2 % of spam originates there .
this is probably due to the fact that broadband has become very popular in the us and has led many people leave inadequately protected pcs connected to the net all the time .
graham cluley , senior technology consultant at sophos , said in the previous two quarters the amount of spam originating in the us had fallen but this decline had now stopped .
" perhaps the reality is that the statistics ca n't be reduced any further unless us home users take action to secure their computers and put a halt to the zombie pc problem , " he said .
in the number two position was china which sends out 20 % of junk e-mail .
although china has a low percentage of net users in its total population , more than 123 million chinese people regularly go online and more than half of those do so via broadband .
significantly the us and china occupy the number one and two spots in counts of total numbers of net users .
next in the list come south korea -lrb- 7.5 % -rrb- , france -lrb- 5.2 % -rrb- and spain -lrb- 4.8 % -rrb- .
the uk was tenth with 1.8 % .

analysis of the contents of millions of e-mails has revealed that less than 4 % is legitimate traffic .
further work has shown that most of this junk mail is originating on hijacked home computers .
e-mail security firm return path said 99 % of the computers it monitors that send mail have been taken over by spammers or virus writers .
return path reached its estimate by calculating a " reputation score " for the 20 million net addresses of those machines .
the root cause of spam is the existence of an ever growing and strengthening network of ' botnets ' matt peachey the score was derived by analyzing the e-mail traffic sent through those addresses , the number of complaints filed about that address , and if the owner of that address responds to complaints .
the vast majority of these net addresses were not good net citizens , said george bilbrey , spokesman for return path .
only 1 % of net addresses could be regarded as legitimate sources of mail .
the rest , said mr bilbrey , were hijacked computers , or bots , used by spammers and other net criminals to send e-mail .
zombie take-over typically these home computers are compromised by viruses sent in e-mail messages or by worms that trawl the net looking for vulnerable machines .
matt peachey , regional director for ironport , which monitors about a quarter of all mail sent across the net , said its research revealed that about 80 % of e-mail came from compromised hosts .
though , he said there were some cases such as with polish telecom where that percentage was likely to be much higher .
the vast majority of the 170,000 net addresses sending e-mail from polish telecom were probably zombies , he said .
ironport 's analysis of the e-mail traffic sent to large corporations reveals that more and more of the messages are junk that is not worth reading .
mr peachey said statistics for one of its customers show that from 20 june to 20 july only 4 % of the messages received were legitimate .
of the rest , he said , 70 % were spam , 11 % were bounces or error messages and 9 % was viruses .
on average , said mr peachey , only about 10 % of e-mail was now real .
nations the news comes as anti-virus firm sophos reveals the list of nations where most spam starts its journey across the net .
statistics ca n't be reduced any further unless us home users take action to secure their computers graham cluley top of the list is the us as , according to sophos , 23.2 % of spam originates there .
this is probably due to the fact that broadband has become very popular in the us and has led many people leave inadequately protected pcs connected to the net all the time .
graham cluley , senior technology consultant at sophos , said in the previous two quarters the amount of spam originating in the us had fallen but this decline had now stopped .
" perhaps the reality is that the statistics ca n't be reduced any further unless us home users take action to secure their computers and put a halt to the zombie pc problem , " he said .
in the number two position was china which sends out 20 % of junk e-mail .

significantly the us and china occupy the number one and two spots in counts of total numbers of net users .

it fought off competition from sony 's playstation portable -lrb- psp -rrb- and nintendo 's ds lite to scoop the prize .
five thousand readers of gadget magazine t3 nominated their favourite appliances for the publication 's first reader 's awards .
other winners included the ipod 30gb for best mp3 player and the sony ericsson w810i for the most sought-after mobile phone .

the firm 's electricity customers will also face a 9.4 % increase in their bills from september .
british gas said " unprecedented high wholesale energy costs " had made the price increases necessary .
news of the fresh round of price rises came as british gas reported record losses of £ 143m during the first six months of the year .
' annus horribilis ' earlier this week , rival edf energy announced it would be raising gas bills by 19 % from next tuesday , while scottish power said two weeks ago that it would also be increasing bills .

" the public assurance given earlier in the year by british gas following their record price rises in february have been rendered meaningless to their customers today , " said anne robinson , uswitch 's director of consumer policy .
" they face further price rise misery in what has become the ' annus horribilis ' for uk households , " she said .
' volatility ' the british gas price hike in march prompted some customers to switch supplier , and by the end of the six month period 432,000 energy accounts had been lost .
mark todd , head of energyhelpline , said the recent price rises announced by suppliers would probably continue for the next year .
he urged consumers to " protect their interests and actively seek the best deals on the market " to save themselves on average £ 400 per year .
the losses at british gas led to centrica seeing overall pre-tax profits drop from £ 894m to £ 569m in the six months to 30 june .
" continued volatility in winter gas and power prices in the uk provides further uncertainty for the second half of the year , " said centrica chief executive sam laidlaw .

british gas said " unprecedented high wholesale energy costs " had made the price increases necessary .
