none came the other way german soccer clubs have reported mixed results in attempts to recruit foreign talent for the upcoming 2006-2007 season . the annual off-season player shuffle has seen some of germany 's major soccer clubs unable to recruit several highly sought-after foreign players . this means the german clubs will have to rely on home-grown talent to take them through the 2006-2007 season , which they argue is worth supporting . nine of the 11 players who took germany to the semi-finals of the world cup on home soil will be lining up for german bundesliga clubs when the season kicks off next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch soccer player ruud van nistelrooy at soccer practice however , champions bayern munich have failed to recruit dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy , after the bavarian club fell short of manchester united 's asking price . van nistelrooy will now be representing real madrid after the club offered around 16 million euros -lrb- $ 20.5 million -rrb- for his signature on the dotted line . bayern general manager uli hoeness said that the club chose to drop out of the bidding war for van nistelrooy since the asking price for the player would have been ' ' against bayern 's philosophy . " italian club juventus was taxed of some of its elite players following a match-fixing debacle and subsequent club relegation .
however , few of these players were relocated to germany . ballack to britain german soccer star , michael ballack transferred from bayern to wealthy english premiership champions chelsea , which has diminished the star quality of the bundesliga . some german clubs , however , have successfully attracted foreign talent . sv hamburg landed dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart ahead of last season but failed this summer in a bid to recruit milan baros , the czech international striker who was top scorer at euro 2004 .
baros will be staying with premiership side aston villa . hamburg also succeeded bringing in vincent kompany , the highly rated 20-year-old anderlecht centerback , for eight million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander frei after scoring a goal at the 2006 world cup borussia dortmund has landed swiss alexander frei from french club rennes in a deal worth four million euros . frei has already shown his worth , with the striker scoring four goals in 45 minutes in a game against a local giessen team .
dortmund went on to win 13-0 . stayed in the bundesliga most of the summer transfers in germany involved moves between bundesliga clubs .
belgian centre-back daniel van buyten , has traded in his hamburg uniform for bayern 's and peruvian striker paolo guerrero went in the opposite direction . dortmund meanwhile bought nelson valdez , the paraguayan striker from bremen to partner frei . only ballack , and goalkeeper jens lehmann , who remains at premiership club arsenal , will play abroad . miroslav klose , the top scorer at the world cup , has said he is staying with werder bremen - at least for another season - while bayern bought lukas podolski , the 21-year-old forward who collected the best young player award at the world cup , from relegated fc cologne . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga teams beat up local competition spoiled by first-class soccer during the world cup , fans could be left wondering what happened to the stars after this week 's bundesliga test matches .
but german league cup matches will raise the pressure .
" germany will have even better players in the future " with the world cup over , dw-world.de spoke to christian streich , a leading youth soccer coach , about lessons learned , the challenges of producing tomorrow ’ s ballacks and kloses and catching up with latin america .

“ that is a recipe for more confrontation , " he said . lebanon 's prime minister fouad siniora said the draft was " not adequate . " " full " but not " immediate " cessation of hostilities the draft demands a " full cessation of hostilities based upon , in particular , the immediate cessation by hezbollah of all attacks and the immediate cessation by israel of all offensive military operations . "
the most glaring omission from the text is the statement pushed for by france which called for an “ immediate cessation of hostilities . " bildunterschrift : us ambassador john bolton welcomed the draft however , the us also appears to have compromised , with a preferred phrase explicitly demanding the return of the captured israeli soldiers also missing from the text . the text received positive responses from other members of the 15-member security council which indicated a possible ratification at next week ’ s vote .
a second resolution would be needed later to authorise an international peacekeeping force for southern lebanon to keep the peace instigated by the first . the white house said sunday that it hoped for a vote on a un resolution shaping an international force for lebanon in " days , not weeks " and for a deployment as quickly as possible after that . us ambassador to the un john bolton said the security council meeting on saturday was " very productive . ” " we received a lot of encouraging comments on the draft text , " he said , while us president george w. bush was “ happy with the progress being made ” but also “ under no illusions ” as to the impact it may have , british prime minister tony blair welcomed the tabling of the resolution . " the priority now is to get the resolution adopted as soon as possible and then to work for a permanent ceasefire and achieve the conditions in lebanon and israel which will prevent a recurrence , ” he told reporters . german chancellor angela merkel praised the french-us draft un resolution , calling it " an important step towards a halt in military operations . " " the accord on a resolution for the middle east is a strong signal by the international community to the parties involved in the conflict , " merkel was quoted by a government spokesman as saying . israel continues with devastating air strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli war planes pounded southern lebanon early sunday despite the progress at the un , israel continued its bombardment of southern lebanon as the security council welcomed the breakthrough ; an air-raid on the village of ansar killing five civilians early on sunday to further extend the hostilities that began three weeks ago after hezbollah militants captured two israeli soldiers . israeli tourism minister isaac herzog said the israeli army would " continue to act " until the resolution was enforced . more israeli air strikes were reported on roads on the eastern beka ’ a valley and on bridges in the north of the country . there were also indications that israel was preparing for further land operations within lebanon with israeli planes dropping leaflets on the lebanese city of sidon , warning people there to leave . the israeli defense force said it intended to attack hezbollah rocket-launching sites in the area and wanted to avoid civilian casualties . commando raids and increasing civilian casualties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ground offensive goes on israeli commandos also hit the coastal port of tyre in a raid on a hezbollah position .
heavy fighting left several militants dead and eight israeli troops wounded , the israeli army said , while hezbollah said it repelled the raid . in other developments , syria – which has its own army on the highest level of readiness – sent a letter to the un accusing israel of intentionally bombing a lebanese village close to the syrian border on friday , killing 28 people , most of whom were syrians . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german defense ministry rules out mid-east troop deployment germany 's defence ministry has ruled out contributing troops to a proposed international military force for south lebanon , despite calls by the israeli prime minister for german participation .

along with romania , bulgaria could join as early as january 2007 although there are still hurdles .
kuneva says she 's optimistic . herself small in physical size , minister for european affairs meglena kuneva likes to talk about confidence and the need for people to have a little more of it regarding bulgaria .
at the same time , her tone does n't come across as one of arrogance . " i think that the desire to be better is there , " she said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we are dreaming of a better life and this is a great vehicle for trying to get better and better every single day . " kuneva , 49 , said that while bulgaria has come a long way since it was a satellite state of the soviet union , her generation will likely not be the ones who really benefit from the ground-breaking changes that her country has seen since it shook one-party rule in 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meglena kuneva " i do n't believe that those people who are in the middle of their lives could easily harvest the fruits , " she said . but she said it is the next generation , the children of her peers , including her own son , who will really become a part of europe .
according to her , they already feel like europeans , having a sense of curiosity and liberty that many of their parents lack . " if we compare this generation with the one before the 90s , the difference is dramatic , " she said . hurdles to overcome but bulgaria still faces big challenges that are giving the european commission cause for concern and could prove a stumbling block to a 2007 accession date .
the eu has chided the country for its rampant corruption , several unsolved contract killings and a fight against money laundering many consider overly feeble .
kuneva said that bulgaria has some catching up to do , but stressed that progress has been made . " we have many successful cases against money laundering , " she said .
" well , many means four .
this is because of being already integrated in a much broader community . " besides time to tackle deeply rooted problems bulgaria needs a break from the bad old days , she said - not only the communist era , but also the difficult transition years of the 1990s .
the decade was marked by government shuffles , flip-flopping policies , and in 1997 an inflation rate that reached 240 percent , triggering mass protests and the downfall of another government . " those who actually brought the country to this very unfortunate stage in the 1990s have been outcast from public opinion , " she said .
" they have never regained the public 's confidence . " new blood n eeded kuneva said she hopes the old guard is replaced by qualified politicians - especially younger ones - who are ready to take on positions of responsibility in sofia .
that could be made all the more difficult due to bulgaria 's continuing problem with brain drain , in which highly skilled people leave the country in search of more lucrative opportunities abroad .
she said it 's important to improve conditions at home instead of simply making it harder for people to leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accession could take place on jan .
1 , 2007 " i think that we could rely on having our best people at home if they are confident that they could go and come back , " she said .
" i do n't believe that with restriction , we could keep people at home .
it 's not fair . " that is why eu programs such as " erasmus " are important , in which students get financial assistance to spend a semester abroad .
bulgarians already have access to these stipends , although the country is not a full eu member yet . what would happen , though , if bulgaria does not reach its goal of eu accession on jan.1 , 2007 ?
kuneva only smiled , saying she firmly believes the country with meet its target date .
besides , a big eu party has already been planned in her electoral district , ruse . it might be that the eu commission in september will decide to push bulgaria 's accession date back a year .
no , kuneva said , there 's no plan b in case that happens .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.08.2006 german job seekers find life-changing opportunities abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobs abroad are for some an alternative to chronic unemployment in germany architect daniel lambart worked in africa for four years .
he and others who have bad luck on the tight german job market are finding jobs , and the experience of a lifetime , abroad .
many return , some stay on for good . this year alone , some 145,000 germans packed up and left home , the highest number in 50 years .
two thirds of the émigrés went abroad for career reasons and most of these because their options were slim on the job market at home . " i saw that the market did n't offer me the possibilities i would have liked and i tried to find a job in other european countries , but that did n't work out either , " said architect daniel lambart . alternatives to unemployment in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's unemployment hovers above 8 percent while many are fleeing unemployment in germany , the agency for employment abroad -lrb- zav -rrb- in bonn has plenty of work on its hands .
job seekers from practically every sector are turning to this branch of the federal employment agency in an effort to try their chances across the border . last year the zav placed 13,000 germans in jobs abroad .
handcraft and gastronomy profession have the highest demand , though chances are also good for engineers . for older job seekers , a position abroad is sometimes the last prospect available .
in switzerland and the netherlands , for example , job experience is valued more than having the most up-to-date specialized knowledge , unlike in germany . nearly 40 percent of the people placed by zav are over the age of 40 , which can be considered " old " on the german job market . over 75 percent of the foreign job placements are in europe .
job seekers who venture off the continent tend to prefer canada and australia . many return sooner or later those germans who decide to pack their suitcases , learn a new language and explore a new culture are n't necessarily gone for good , said zav spokesperson sabine seidler . " the majority of opportunities involve temporary job contracts for a longer period of time .
there are some that say , i 'll stay .
but , in general , coming back is part of the deal , " added seidler . for many , a major motivation to emigrate is to improve their chances of finding a better job when they return .
that was the case for architect daniel lambart , who took a position with the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- in togo , despite original plans to stay in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty percent of job placements abroad are for job seekers over 40 " the people around me could n't really understand it , " said lambart .
" but i did n't let myself get misled and took my own path .
especially since the contract was only for one year and i saw it as an opportunity , not as some kind of challenge with lots of risks attached . " flexibility is key making the decision to go was only the first step .
then lambart had to arrange for insurance , get vaccinated and study up on his new country .
he had the advantage that he already spoke french , togo 's official language . " on the one hand , you have to be ambitious , but you also have to like the challenge and feel a sense of adventure , " said lambart .
zav 's seidler agreed that it 's most important to approach the move with the right attitude and to transition into the new culture with as much flexibility as possible . lambart settled into life in togo so well that he extended his contract with the german development service for another year , and then again for two additional years in chad in central africa . " most people give positive feedback and are glad that they did it , simply because it 's such an exciting time .

along with romania , bulgaria could join as early as january 2007 although there are still hurdles .
kuneva says she 's optimistic . herself small in physical size , minister for european affairs meglena kuneva likes to talk about confidence and the need for people to have a little more of it regarding bulgaria .
at the same time , her tone does n't come across as one of arrogance . " i think that the desire to be better is there , " she said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we are dreaming of a better life and this is a great vehicle for trying to get better and better every single day . " kuneva , 49 , said that while bulgaria has come a long way since it was a satellite state of the soviet union , her generation will likely not be the ones who really benefit from the ground-breaking changes that her country has seen since it shook one-party rule in 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meglena kuneva " i do n't believe that those people who are in the middle of their lives could easily harvest the fruits , " she said . but she said it is the next generation , the children of her peers , including her own son , who will really become a part of europe .
according to her , they already feel like europeans , having a sense of curiosity and liberty that many of their parents lack . " if we compare this generation with the one before the 90s , the difference is dramatic , " she said . hurdles to overcome but bulgaria still faces big challenges that are giving the european commission cause for concern and could prove a stumbling block to a 2007 accession date .
the eu has chided the country for its rampant corruption , several unsolved contract killings and a fight against money laundering many consider overly feeble .
kuneva said that bulgaria has some catching up to do , but stressed that progress has been made . " we have many successful cases against money laundering , " she said .
" well , many means four .
this is because of being already integrated in a much broader community . " besides time to tackle deeply rooted problems bulgaria needs a break from the bad old days , she said - not only the communist era , but also the difficult transition years of the 1990s .
the decade was marked by government shuffles , flip-flopping policies , and in 1997 an inflation rate that reached 240 percent , triggering mass protests and the downfall of another government . " those who actually brought the country to this very unfortunate stage in the 1990s have been outcast from public opinion , " she said .
" they have never regained the public 's confidence . " new blood n eeded kuneva said she hopes the old guard is replaced by qualified politicians - especially younger ones - who are ready to take on positions of responsibility in sofia .
that could be made all the more difficult due to bulgaria 's continuing problem with brain drain , in which highly skilled people leave the country in search of more lucrative opportunities abroad .
she said it 's important to improve conditions at home instead of simply making it harder for people to leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accession could take place on jan .
1 , 2007 " i think that we could rely on having our best people at home if they are confident that they could go and come back , " she said .
" i do n't believe that with restriction , we could keep people at home .
it 's not fair . " that is why eu programs such as " erasmus " are important , in which students get financial assistance to spend a semester abroad .
bulgarians already have access to these stipends , although the country is not a full eu member yet . what would happen , though , if bulgaria does not reach its goal of eu accession on jan.1 , 2007 ?
kuneva only smiled , saying she firmly believes the country with meet its target date .
besides , a big eu party has already been planned in her electoral district , ruse . it might be that the eu commission in september will decide to push bulgaria 's accession date back a year .
no , kuneva said , there 's no plan b in case that happens .

“ that is a recipe for more confrontation , " he said . lebanon 's prime minister fouad siniora said the draft was " not adequate . " " full " but not " immediate " cessation of hostilities the draft demands a " full cessation of hostilities based upon , in particular , the immediate cessation by hezbollah of all attacks and the immediate cessation by israel of all offensive military operations . "
the most glaring omission from the text is the statement pushed for by france which called for an “ immediate cessation of hostilities . " bildunterschrift : us ambassador john bolton welcomed the draft however , the us also appears to have compromised , with a preferred phrase explicitly demanding the return of the captured israeli soldiers also missing from the text . the text received positive responses from other members of the 15-member security council which indicated a possible ratification at next week ’ s vote .
a second resolution would be needed later to authorise an international peacekeeping force for southern lebanon to keep the peace instigated by the first . the white house said sunday that it hoped for a vote on a un resolution shaping an international force for lebanon in " days , not weeks " and for a deployment as quickly as possible after that . us ambassador to the un john bolton said the security council meeting on saturday was " very productive . ” " we received a lot of encouraging comments on the draft text , " he said , while us president george w. bush was “ happy with the progress being made ” but also “ under no illusions ” as to the impact it may have , british prime minister tony blair welcomed the tabling of the resolution . " the priority now is to get the resolution adopted as soon as possible and then to work for a permanent ceasefire and achieve the conditions in lebanon and israel which will prevent a recurrence , ” he told reporters . german chancellor angela merkel praised the french-us draft un resolution , calling it " an important step towards a halt in military operations . " " the accord on a resolution for the middle east is a strong signal by the international community to the parties involved in the conflict , " merkel was quoted by a government spokesman as saying . israel continues with devastating air strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli war planes pounded southern lebanon early sunday despite the progress at the un , israel continued its bombardment of southern lebanon as the security council welcomed the breakthrough ; an air-raid on the village of ansar killing five civilians early on sunday to further extend the hostilities that began three weeks ago after hezbollah militants captured two israeli soldiers . israeli tourism minister isaac herzog said the israeli army would " continue to act " until the resolution was enforced . more israeli air strikes were reported on roads on the eastern beka ’ a valley and on bridges in the north of the country . there were also indications that israel was preparing for further land operations within lebanon with israeli planes dropping leaflets on the lebanese city of sidon , warning people there to leave . the israeli defense force said it intended to attack hezbollah rocket-launching sites in the area and wanted to avoid civilian casualties . commando raids and increasing civilian casualties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ground offensive goes on israeli commandos also hit the coastal port of tyre in a raid on a hezbollah position .
heavy fighting left several militants dead and eight israeli troops wounded , the israeli army said , while hezbollah said it repelled the raid . in other developments , syria – which has its own army on the highest level of readiness – sent a letter to the un accusing israel of intentionally bombing a lebanese village close to the syrian border on friday , killing 28 people , most of whom were syrians . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german defense ministry rules out mid-east troop deployment germany 's defence ministry has ruled out contributing troops to a proposed international military force for south lebanon , despite calls by the israeli prime minister for german participation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.08.2006 german job seekers find life-changing opportunities abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobs abroad are for some an alternative to chronic unemployment in germany architect daniel lambart worked in africa for four years .
he and others who have bad luck on the tight german job market are finding jobs , and the experience of a lifetime , abroad .
many return , some stay on for good . this year alone , some 145,000 germans packed up and left home , the highest number in 50 years .
two thirds of the émigrés went abroad for career reasons and most of these because their options were slim on the job market at home . " i saw that the market did n't offer me the possibilities i would have liked and i tried to find a job in other european countries , but that did n't work out either , " said architect daniel lambart . alternatives to unemployment in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's unemployment hovers above 8 percent while many are fleeing unemployment in germany , the agency for employment abroad -lrb- zav -rrb- in bonn has plenty of work on its hands .
job seekers from practically every sector are turning to this branch of the federal employment agency in an effort to try their chances across the border . last year the zav placed 13,000 germans in jobs abroad .
handcraft and gastronomy profession have the highest demand , though chances are also good for engineers . for older job seekers , a position abroad is sometimes the last prospect available .
in switzerland and the netherlands , for example , job experience is valued more than having the most up-to-date specialized knowledge , unlike in germany . nearly 40 percent of the people placed by zav are over the age of 40 , which can be considered " old " on the german job market . over 75 percent of the foreign job placements are in europe .
job seekers who venture off the continent tend to prefer canada and australia . many return sooner or later those germans who decide to pack their suitcases , learn a new language and explore a new culture are n't necessarily gone for good , said zav spokesperson sabine seidler . " the majority of opportunities involve temporary job contracts for a longer period of time .
there are some that say , i 'll stay .
but , in general , coming back is part of the deal , " added seidler . for many , a major motivation to emigrate is to improve their chances of finding a better job when they return .
that was the case for architect daniel lambart , who took a position with the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- in togo , despite original plans to stay in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty percent of job placements abroad are for job seekers over 40 " the people around me could n't really understand it , " said lambart .
" but i did n't let myself get misled and took my own path .
especially since the contract was only for one year and i saw it as an opportunity , not as some kind of challenge with lots of risks attached . " flexibility is key making the decision to go was only the first step .
then lambart had to arrange for insurance , get vaccinated and study up on his new country .
he had the advantage that he already spoke french , togo 's official language . " on the one hand , you have to be ambitious , but you also have to like the challenge and feel a sense of adventure , " said lambart .
zav 's seidler agreed that it 's most important to approach the move with the right attitude and to transition into the new culture with as much flexibility as possible . lambart settled into life in togo so well that he extended his contract with the german development service for another year , and then again for two additional years in chad in central africa . " most people give positive feedback and are glad that they did it , simply because it 's such an exciting time .
those who were unemployed for a long time and then take this huge step abroad usually come back with a completely new sense of self-confidence , " said seidler . she added that the only problems she can remember hearing about were disagreements between co-workers , which can also arise at any workplace in germany . no guarantees upon return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experiences abroad are irreplaceable lambart 's return to germany and re-entry in the german work force after four years abroad was particularly trying .
it took nine months of serious effort and a training course in public relations for him to gain a foothold in the job market . " private enterprise , in any sector , does n't view cooperative development work abroad as a real benefit , " said lambart , who observed a big difference between work experience in other european countries and in developing countries when being considered for a position in germany . " i do n't regret the time -lrb- abroad -rrb- because i had lots of experiences that help me in my life today , " said the architect .
" i think i 've managed to make the leap back into the german work force . " clarisse weischedel -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german emigration hits highest level in 55 years germans are moving abroad in record numbers .

along with romania , bulgaria could join as early as january 2007 although there are still hurdles .
kuneva says she 's optimistic . herself small in physical size , minister for european affairs meglena kuneva likes to talk about confidence and the need for people to have a little more of it regarding bulgaria .
at the same time , her tone does n't come across as one of arrogance . " i think that the desire to be better is there , " she said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we are dreaming of a better life and this is a great vehicle for trying to get better and better every single day . " kuneva , 49 , said that while bulgaria has come a long way since it was a satellite state of the soviet union , her generation will likely not be the ones who really benefit from the ground-breaking changes that her country has seen since it shook one-party rule in 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meglena kuneva " i do n't believe that those people who are in the middle of their lives could easily harvest the fruits , " she said . but she said it is the next generation , the children of her peers , including her own son , who will really become a part of europe .
according to her , they already feel like europeans , having a sense of curiosity and liberty that many of their parents lack . " if we compare this generation with the one before the 90s , the difference is dramatic , " she said . hurdles to overcome but bulgaria still faces big challenges that are giving the european commission cause for concern and could prove a stumbling block to a 2007 accession date .
the eu has chided the country for its rampant corruption , several unsolved contract killings and a fight against money laundering many consider overly feeble .
kuneva said that bulgaria has some catching up to do , but stressed that progress has been made . " we have many successful cases against money laundering , " she said .
" well , many means four .
this is because of being already integrated in a much broader community . " besides time to tackle deeply rooted problems bulgaria needs a break from the bad old days , she said - not only the communist era , but also the difficult transition years of the 1990s .
the decade was marked by government shuffles , flip-flopping policies , and in 1997 an inflation rate that reached 240 percent , triggering mass protests and the downfall of another government . " those who actually brought the country to this very unfortunate stage in the 1990s have been outcast from public opinion , " she said .
" they have never regained the public 's confidence . " new blood n eeded kuneva said she hopes the old guard is replaced by qualified politicians - especially younger ones - who are ready to take on positions of responsibility in sofia .
that could be made all the more difficult due to bulgaria 's continuing problem with brain drain , in which highly skilled people leave the country in search of more lucrative opportunities abroad .
she said it 's important to improve conditions at home instead of simply making it harder for people to leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accession could take place on jan .
1 , 2007 " i think that we could rely on having our best people at home if they are confident that they could go and come back , " she said .
" i do n't believe that with restriction , we could keep people at home .
it 's not fair . " that is why eu programs such as " erasmus " are important , in which students get financial assistance to spend a semester abroad .
bulgarians already have access to these stipends , although the country is not a full eu member yet . what would happen , though , if bulgaria does not reach its goal of eu accession on jan.1 , 2007 ?
kuneva only smiled , saying she firmly believes the country with meet its target date .
besides , a big eu party has already been planned in her electoral district , ruse . it might be that the eu commission in september will decide to push bulgaria 's accession date back a year .
no , kuneva said , there 's no plan b in case that happens .

none came the other way german soccer clubs have reported mixed results in attempts to recruit foreign talent for the upcoming 2006-2007 season . the annual off-season player shuffle has seen some of germany 's major soccer clubs unable to recruit several highly sought-after foreign players . this means the german clubs will have to rely on home-grown talent to take them through the 2006-2007 season , which they argue is worth supporting . nine of the 11 players who took germany to the semi-finals of the world cup on home soil will be lining up for german bundesliga clubs when the season kicks off next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch soccer player ruud van nistelrooy at soccer practice however , champions bayern munich have failed to recruit dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy , after the bavarian club fell short of manchester united 's asking price . van nistelrooy will now be representing real madrid after the club offered around 16 million euros -lrb- $ 20.5 million -rrb- for his signature on the dotted line . bayern general manager uli hoeness said that the club chose to drop out of the bidding war for van nistelrooy since the asking price for the player would have been ' ' against bayern 's philosophy . " italian club juventus was taxed of some of its elite players following a match-fixing debacle and subsequent club relegation .
however , few of these players were relocated to germany . ballack to britain german soccer star , michael ballack transferred from bayern to wealthy english premiership champions chelsea , which has diminished the star quality of the bundesliga . some german clubs , however , have successfully attracted foreign talent . sv hamburg landed dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart ahead of last season but failed this summer in a bid to recruit milan baros , the czech international striker who was top scorer at euro 2004 .
baros will be staying with premiership side aston villa . hamburg also succeeded bringing in vincent kompany , the highly rated 20-year-old anderlecht centerback , for eight million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander frei after scoring a goal at the 2006 world cup borussia dortmund has landed swiss alexander frei from french club rennes in a deal worth four million euros . frei has already shown his worth , with the striker scoring four goals in 45 minutes in a game against a local giessen team .
dortmund went on to win 13-0 . stayed in the bundesliga most of the summer transfers in germany involved moves between bundesliga clubs .
belgian centre-back daniel van buyten , has traded in his hamburg uniform for bayern 's and peruvian striker paolo guerrero went in the opposite direction . dortmund meanwhile bought nelson valdez , the paraguayan striker from bremen to partner frei . only ballack , and goalkeeper jens lehmann , who remains at premiership club arsenal , will play abroad . miroslav klose , the top scorer at the world cup , has said he is staying with werder bremen - at least for another season - while bayern bought lukas podolski , the 21-year-old forward who collected the best young player award at the world cup , from relegated fc cologne . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga teams beat up local competition spoiled by first-class soccer during the world cup , fans could be left wondering what happened to the stars after this week 's bundesliga test matches .

he and others who have bad luck on the tight german job market are finding jobs , and the experience of a lifetime , abroad .
many return , some stay on for good . this year alone , some 145,000 germans packed up and left home , the highest number in 50 years .
two thirds of the émigrés went abroad for career reasons and most of these because their options were slim on the job market at home . " i saw that the market did n't offer me the possibilities i would have liked and i tried to find a job in other european countries , but that did n't work out either , " said architect daniel lambart . alternatives to unemployment in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's unemployment hovers above 8 percent while many are fleeing unemployment in germany , the agency for employment abroad -lrb- zav -rrb- in bonn has plenty of work on its hands .
job seekers from practically every sector are turning to this branch of the federal employment agency in an effort to try their chances across the border . last year the zav placed 13,000 germans in jobs abroad .
handcraft and gastronomy profession have the highest demand , though chances are also good for engineers . for older job seekers , a position abroad is sometimes the last prospect available .
in switzerland and the netherlands , for example , job experience is valued more than having the most up-to-date specialized knowledge , unlike in germany . nearly 40 percent of the people placed by zav are over the age of 40 , which can be considered " old " on the german job market . over 75 percent of the foreign job placements are in europe .
job seekers who venture off the continent tend to prefer canada and australia . many return sooner or later those germans who decide to pack their suitcases , learn a new language and explore a new culture are n't necessarily gone for good , said zav spokesperson sabine seidler . " the majority of opportunities involve temporary job contracts for a longer period of time .
there are some that say , i 'll stay .
but , in general , coming back is part of the deal , " added seidler . for many , a major motivation to emigrate is to improve their chances of finding a better job when they return .
that was the case for architect daniel lambart , who took a position with the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- in togo , despite original plans to stay in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty percent of job placements abroad are for job seekers over 40 " the people around me could n't really understand it , " said lambart .
" but i did n't let myself get misled and took my own path .
especially since the contract was only for one year and i saw it as an opportunity , not as some kind of challenge with lots of risks attached . " flexibility is key making the decision to go was only the first step .
then lambart had to arrange for insurance , get vaccinated and study up on his new country .
he had the advantage that he already spoke french , togo 's official language . " on the one hand , you have to be ambitious , but you also have to like the challenge and feel a sense of adventure , " said lambart .
zav 's seidler agreed that it 's most important to approach the move with the right attitude and to transition into the new culture with as much flexibility as possible . lambart settled into life in togo so well that he extended his contract with the german development service for another year , and then again for two additional years in chad in central africa . " most people give positive feedback and are glad that they did it , simply because it 's such an exciting time .
those who were unemployed for a long time and then take this huge step abroad usually come back with a completely new sense of self-confidence , " said seidler . she added that the only problems she can remember hearing about were disagreements between co-workers , which can also arise at any workplace in germany . no guarantees upon return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experiences abroad are irreplaceable lambart 's return to germany and re-entry in the german work force after four years abroad was particularly trying .
it took nine months of serious effort and a training course in public relations for him to gain a foothold in the job market . " private enterprise , in any sector , does n't view cooperative development work abroad as a real benefit , " said lambart , who observed a big difference between work experience in other european countries and in developing countries when being considered for a position in germany . " i do n't regret the time -lrb- abroad -rrb- because i had lots of experiences that help me in my life today , " said the architect .

“ that is a recipe for more confrontation , " he said . lebanon 's prime minister fouad siniora said the draft was " not adequate . " " full " but not " immediate " cessation of hostilities the draft demands a " full cessation of hostilities based upon , in particular , the immediate cessation by hezbollah of all attacks and the immediate cessation by israel of all offensive military operations . "
the most glaring omission from the text is the statement pushed for by france which called for an “ immediate cessation of hostilities . " bildunterschrift : us ambassador john bolton welcomed the draft however , the us also appears to have compromised , with a preferred phrase explicitly demanding the return of the captured israeli soldiers also missing from the text . the text received positive responses from other members of the 15-member security council which indicated a possible ratification at next week ’ s vote .

he and others who have bad luck on the tight german job market are finding jobs , and the experience of a lifetime , abroad .
many return , some stay on for good . this year alone , some 145,000 germans packed up and left home , the highest number in 50 years .
two thirds of the émigrés went abroad for career reasons and most of these because their options were slim on the job market at home . " i saw that the market did n't offer me the possibilities i would have liked and i tried to find a job in other european countries , but that did n't work out either , " said architect daniel lambart . alternatives to unemployment in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's unemployment hovers above 8 percent while many are fleeing unemployment in germany , the agency for employment abroad -lrb- zav -rrb- in bonn has plenty of work on its hands .
job seekers from practically every sector are turning to this branch of the federal employment agency in an effort to try their chances across the border . last year the zav placed 13,000 germans in jobs abroad .
handcraft and gastronomy profession have the highest demand , though chances are also good for engineers . for older job seekers , a position abroad is sometimes the last prospect available .
in switzerland and the netherlands , for example , job experience is valued more than having the most up-to-date specialized knowledge , unlike in germany . nearly 40 percent of the people placed by zav are over the age of 40 , which can be considered " old " on the german job market . over 75 percent of the foreign job placements are in europe .
job seekers who venture off the continent tend to prefer canada and australia . many return sooner or later those germans who decide to pack their suitcases , learn a new language and explore a new culture are n't necessarily gone for good , said zav spokesperson sabine seidler . " the majority of opportunities involve temporary job contracts for a longer period of time .
there are some that say , i 'll stay .
but , in general , coming back is part of the deal , " added seidler . for many , a major motivation to emigrate is to improve their chances of finding a better job when they return .
that was the case for architect daniel lambart , who took a position with the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- in togo , despite original plans to stay in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty percent of job placements abroad are for job seekers over 40 " the people around me could n't really understand it , " said lambart .
" but i did n't let myself get misled and took my own path .
especially since the contract was only for one year and i saw it as an opportunity , not as some kind of challenge with lots of risks attached . " flexibility is key making the decision to go was only the first step .
then lambart had to arrange for insurance , get vaccinated and study up on his new country .
he had the advantage that he already spoke french , togo 's official language . " on the one hand , you have to be ambitious , but you also have to like the challenge and feel a sense of adventure , " said lambart .
zav 's seidler agreed that it 's most important to approach the move with the right attitude and to transition into the new culture with as much flexibility as possible . lambart settled into life in togo so well that he extended his contract with the german development service for another year , and then again for two additional years in chad in central africa . " most people give positive feedback and are glad that they did it , simply because it 's such an exciting time .
those who were unemployed for a long time and then take this huge step abroad usually come back with a completely new sense of self-confidence , " said seidler . she added that the only problems she can remember hearing about were disagreements between co-workers , which can also arise at any workplace in germany . no guarantees upon return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experiences abroad are irreplaceable lambart 's return to germany and re-entry in the german work force after four years abroad was particularly trying .
it took nine months of serious effort and a training course in public relations for him to gain a foothold in the job market . " private enterprise , in any sector , does n't view cooperative development work abroad as a real benefit , " said lambart , who observed a big difference between work experience in other european countries and in developing countries when being considered for a position in germany . " i do n't regret the time -lrb- abroad -rrb- because i had lots of experiences that help me in my life today , " said the architect .

none came the other way german soccer clubs have reported mixed results in attempts to recruit foreign talent for the upcoming 2006-2007 season . the annual off-season player shuffle has seen some of germany 's major soccer clubs unable to recruit several highly sought-after foreign players . this means the german clubs will have to rely on home-grown talent to take them through the 2006-2007 season , which they argue is worth supporting . nine of the 11 players who took germany to the semi-finals of the world cup on home soil will be lining up for german bundesliga clubs when the season kicks off next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch soccer player ruud van nistelrooy at soccer practice however , champions bayern munich have failed to recruit dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy , after the bavarian club fell short of manchester united 's asking price . van nistelrooy will now be representing real madrid after the club offered around 16 million euros -lrb- $ 20.5 million -rrb- for his signature on the dotted line . bayern general manager uli hoeness said that the club chose to drop out of the bidding war for van nistelrooy since the asking price for the player would have been ' ' against bayern 's philosophy . " italian club juventus was taxed of some of its elite players following a match-fixing debacle and subsequent club relegation .
however , few of these players were relocated to germany . ballack to britain german soccer star , michael ballack transferred from bayern to wealthy english premiership champions chelsea , which has diminished the star quality of the bundesliga . some german clubs , however , have successfully attracted foreign talent . sv hamburg landed dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart ahead of last season but failed this summer in a bid to recruit milan baros , the czech international striker who was top scorer at euro 2004 .
baros will be staying with premiership side aston villa . hamburg also succeeded bringing in vincent kompany , the highly rated 20-year-old anderlecht centerback , for eight million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander frei after scoring a goal at the 2006 world cup borussia dortmund has landed swiss alexander frei from french club rennes in a deal worth four million euros . frei has already shown his worth , with the striker scoring four goals in 45 minutes in a game against a local giessen team .
dortmund went on to win 13-0 . stayed in the bundesliga most of the summer transfers in germany involved moves between bundesliga clubs .
belgian centre-back daniel van buyten , has traded in his hamburg uniform for bayern 's and peruvian striker paolo guerrero went in the opposite direction . dortmund meanwhile bought nelson valdez , the paraguayan striker from bremen to partner frei . only ballack , and goalkeeper jens lehmann , who remains at premiership club arsenal , will play abroad . miroslav klose , the top scorer at the world cup , has said he is staying with werder bremen - at least for another season - while bayern bought lukas podolski , the 21-year-old forward who collected the best young player award at the world cup , from relegated fc cologne . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga teams beat up local competition spoiled by first-class soccer during the world cup , fans could be left wondering what happened to the stars after this week 's bundesliga test matches .
but german league cup matches will raise the pressure .
" germany will have even better players in the future " with the world cup over , dw-world.de spoke to christian streich , a leading youth soccer coach , about lessons learned , the challenges of producing tomorrow ’ s ballacks and kloses and catching up with latin america .
national soccer team redefines what it means to be german as nearly one-quarter of the german soccer team have foreign roots , cheering for the home boys means coming to terms with a germany that has become increasingly diverse ethnically .
or does it ?
early blow to bayern as bremen win league cup werder bremen picked up the first piece of silverware in the 2006/07 season defeating bayern munich 2-0 in leipzig on saturday to lift the league cup for the first time in their history .

he and others who have bad luck on the tight german job market are finding jobs , and the experience of a lifetime , abroad .
many return , some stay on for good . this year alone , some 145,000 germans packed up and left home , the highest number in 50 years .
two thirds of the émigrés went abroad for career reasons and most of these because their options were slim on the job market at home . " i saw that the market did n't offer me the possibilities i would have liked and i tried to find a job in other european countries , but that did n't work out either , " said architect daniel lambart . alternatives to unemployment in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's unemployment hovers above 8 percent while many are fleeing unemployment in germany , the agency for employment abroad -lrb- zav -rrb- in bonn has plenty of work on its hands .
job seekers from practically every sector are turning to this branch of the federal employment agency in an effort to try their chances across the border . last year the zav placed 13,000 germans in jobs abroad .
handcraft and gastronomy profession have the highest demand , though chances are also good for engineers . for older job seekers , a position abroad is sometimes the last prospect available .
in switzerland and the netherlands , for example , job experience is valued more than having the most up-to-date specialized knowledge , unlike in germany . nearly 40 percent of the people placed by zav are over the age of 40 , which can be considered " old " on the german job market . over 75 percent of the foreign job placements are in europe .
job seekers who venture off the continent tend to prefer canada and australia . many return sooner or later those germans who decide to pack their suitcases , learn a new language and explore a new culture are n't necessarily gone for good , said zav spokesperson sabine seidler . " the majority of opportunities involve temporary job contracts for a longer period of time .
there are some that say , i 'll stay .
but , in general , coming back is part of the deal , " added seidler . for many , a major motivation to emigrate is to improve their chances of finding a better job when they return .
that was the case for architect daniel lambart , who took a position with the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- in togo , despite original plans to stay in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty percent of job placements abroad are for job seekers over 40 " the people around me could n't really understand it , " said lambart .
" but i did n't let myself get misled and took my own path .
especially since the contract was only for one year and i saw it as an opportunity , not as some kind of challenge with lots of risks attached . " flexibility is key making the decision to go was only the first step .
then lambart had to arrange for insurance , get vaccinated and study up on his new country .
he had the advantage that he already spoke french , togo 's official language . " on the one hand , you have to be ambitious , but you also have to like the challenge and feel a sense of adventure , " said lambart .
zav 's seidler agreed that it 's most important to approach the move with the right attitude and to transition into the new culture with as much flexibility as possible . lambart settled into life in togo so well that he extended his contract with the german development service for another year , and then again for two additional years in chad in central africa . " most people give positive feedback and are glad that they did it , simply because it 's such an exciting time .
those who were unemployed for a long time and then take this huge step abroad usually come back with a completely new sense of self-confidence , " said seidler . she added that the only problems she can remember hearing about were disagreements between co-workers , which can also arise at any workplace in germany . no guarantees upon return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experiences abroad are irreplaceable lambart 's return to germany and re-entry in the german work force after four years abroad was particularly trying .
it took nine months of serious effort and a training course in public relations for him to gain a foothold in the job market . " private enterprise , in any sector , does n't view cooperative development work abroad as a real benefit , " said lambart , who observed a big difference between work experience in other european countries and in developing countries when being considered for a position in germany . " i do n't regret the time -lrb- abroad -rrb- because i had lots of experiences that help me in my life today , " said the architect .

none came the other way german soccer clubs have reported mixed results in attempts to recruit foreign talent for the upcoming 2006-2007 season . the annual off-season player shuffle has seen some of germany 's major soccer clubs unable to recruit several highly sought-after foreign players . this means the german clubs will have to rely on home-grown talent to take them through the 2006-2007 season , which they argue is worth supporting . nine of the 11 players who took germany to the semi-finals of the world cup on home soil will be lining up for german bundesliga clubs when the season kicks off next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch soccer player ruud van nistelrooy at soccer practice however , champions bayern munich have failed to recruit dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy , after the bavarian club fell short of manchester united 's asking price . van nistelrooy will now be representing real madrid after the club offered around 16 million euros -lrb- $ 20.5 million -rrb- for his signature on the dotted line . bayern general manager uli hoeness said that the club chose to drop out of the bidding war for van nistelrooy since the asking price for the player would have been ' ' against bayern 's philosophy . " italian club juventus was taxed of some of its elite players following a match-fixing debacle and subsequent club relegation .
however , few of these players were relocated to germany . ballack to britain german soccer star , michael ballack transferred from bayern to wealthy english premiership champions chelsea , which has diminished the star quality of the bundesliga . some german clubs , however , have successfully attracted foreign talent . sv hamburg landed dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart ahead of last season but failed this summer in a bid to recruit milan baros , the czech international striker who was top scorer at euro 2004 .
baros will be staying with premiership side aston villa . hamburg also succeeded bringing in vincent kompany , the highly rated 20-year-old anderlecht centerback , for eight million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander frei after scoring a goal at the 2006 world cup borussia dortmund has landed swiss alexander frei from french club rennes in a deal worth four million euros . frei has already shown his worth , with the striker scoring four goals in 45 minutes in a game against a local giessen team .
dortmund went on to win 13-0 . stayed in the bundesliga most of the summer transfers in germany involved moves between bundesliga clubs .
belgian centre-back daniel van buyten , has traded in his hamburg uniform for bayern 's and peruvian striker paolo guerrero went in the opposite direction . dortmund meanwhile bought nelson valdez , the paraguayan striker from bremen to partner frei . only ballack , and goalkeeper jens lehmann , who remains at premiership club arsenal , will play abroad . miroslav klose , the top scorer at the world cup , has said he is staying with werder bremen - at least for another season - while bayern bought lukas podolski , the 21-year-old forward who collected the best young player award at the world cup , from relegated fc cologne . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga teams beat up local competition spoiled by first-class soccer during the world cup , fans could be left wondering what happened to the stars after this week 's bundesliga test matches .
but german league cup matches will raise the pressure .
" germany will have even better players in the future " with the world cup over , dw-world.de spoke to christian streich , a leading youth soccer coach , about lessons learned , the challenges of producing tomorrow ’ s ballacks and kloses and catching up with latin america .
national soccer team redefines what it means to be german as nearly one-quarter of the german soccer team have foreign roots , cheering for the home boys means coming to terms with a germany that has become increasingly diverse ethnically .
or does it ?

along with romania , bulgaria could join as early as january 2007 although there are still hurdles .
kuneva says she 's optimistic . herself small in physical size , minister for european affairs meglena kuneva likes to talk about confidence and the need for people to have a little more of it regarding bulgaria .
at the same time , her tone does n't come across as one of arrogance . " i think that the desire to be better is there , " she said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we are dreaming of a better life and this is a great vehicle for trying to get better and better every single day . " kuneva , 49 , said that while bulgaria has come a long way since it was a satellite state of the soviet union , her generation will likely not be the ones who really benefit from the ground-breaking changes that her country has seen since it shook one-party rule in 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meglena kuneva " i do n't believe that those people who are in the middle of their lives could easily harvest the fruits , " she said . but she said it is the next generation , the children of her peers , including her own son , who will really become a part of europe .
according to her , they already feel like europeans , having a sense of curiosity and liberty that many of their parents lack . " if we compare this generation with the one before the 90s , the difference is dramatic , " she said . hurdles to overcome but bulgaria still faces big challenges that are giving the european commission cause for concern and could prove a stumbling block to a 2007 accession date .
the eu has chided the country for its rampant corruption , several unsolved contract killings and a fight against money laundering many consider overly feeble .
kuneva said that bulgaria has some catching up to do , but stressed that progress has been made . " we have many successful cases against money laundering , " she said .
" well , many means four .
this is because of being already integrated in a much broader community . " besides time to tackle deeply rooted problems bulgaria needs a break from the bad old days , she said - not only the communist era , but also the difficult transition years of the 1990s .
the decade was marked by government shuffles , flip-flopping policies , and in 1997 an inflation rate that reached 240 percent , triggering mass protests and the downfall of another government . " those who actually brought the country to this very unfortunate stage in the 1990s have been outcast from public opinion , " she said .
" they have never regained the public 's confidence . " new blood n eeded kuneva said she hopes the old guard is replaced by qualified politicians - especially younger ones - who are ready to take on positions of responsibility in sofia .
that could be made all the more difficult due to bulgaria 's continuing problem with brain drain , in which highly skilled people leave the country in search of more lucrative opportunities abroad .
she said it 's important to improve conditions at home instead of simply making it harder for people to leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accession could take place on jan .
1 , 2007 " i think that we could rely on having our best people at home if they are confident that they could go and come back , " she said .

none came the other way german soccer clubs have reported mixed results in attempts to recruit foreign talent for the upcoming 2006-2007 season . the annual off-season player shuffle has seen some of germany 's major soccer clubs unable to recruit several highly sought-after foreign players . this means the german clubs will have to rely on home-grown talent to take them through the 2006-2007 season , which they argue is worth supporting . nine of the 11 players who took germany to the semi-finals of the world cup on home soil will be lining up for german bundesliga clubs when the season kicks off next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch soccer player ruud van nistelrooy at soccer practice however , champions bayern munich have failed to recruit dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy , after the bavarian club fell short of manchester united 's asking price . van nistelrooy will now be representing real madrid after the club offered around 16 million euros -lrb- $ 20.5 million -rrb- for his signature on the dotted line . bayern general manager uli hoeness said that the club chose to drop out of the bidding war for van nistelrooy since the asking price for the player would have been ' ' against bayern 's philosophy . " italian club juventus was taxed of some of its elite players following a match-fixing debacle and subsequent club relegation .
however , few of these players were relocated to germany . ballack to britain german soccer star , michael ballack transferred from bayern to wealthy english premiership champions chelsea , which has diminished the star quality of the bundesliga . some german clubs , however , have successfully attracted foreign talent . sv hamburg landed dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart ahead of last season but failed this summer in a bid to recruit milan baros , the czech international striker who was top scorer at euro 2004 .

none came the other way german soccer clubs have reported mixed results in attempts to recruit foreign talent for the upcoming 2006-2007 season . the annual off-season player shuffle has seen some of germany 's major soccer clubs unable to recruit several highly sought-after foreign players . this means the german clubs will have to rely on home-grown talent to take them through the 2006-2007 season , which they argue is worth supporting . nine of the 11 players who took germany to the semi-finals of the world cup on home soil will be lining up for german bundesliga clubs when the season kicks off next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch soccer player ruud van nistelrooy at soccer practice however , champions bayern munich have failed to recruit dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy , after the bavarian club fell short of manchester united 's asking price . van nistelrooy will now be representing real madrid after the club offered around 16 million euros -lrb- $ 20.5 million -rrb- for his signature on the dotted line . bayern general manager uli hoeness said that the club chose to drop out of the bidding war for van nistelrooy since the asking price for the player would have been ' ' against bayern 's philosophy . " italian club juventus was taxed of some of its elite players following a match-fixing debacle and subsequent club relegation .
however , few of these players were relocated to germany . ballack to britain german soccer star , michael ballack transferred from bayern to wealthy english premiership champions chelsea , which has diminished the star quality of the bundesliga . some german clubs , however , have successfully attracted foreign talent . sv hamburg landed dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart ahead of last season but failed this summer in a bid to recruit milan baros , the czech international striker who was top scorer at euro 2004 .
baros will be staying with premiership side aston villa . hamburg also succeeded bringing in vincent kompany , the highly rated 20-year-old anderlecht centerback , for eight million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander frei after scoring a goal at the 2006 world cup borussia dortmund has landed swiss alexander frei from french club rennes in a deal worth four million euros . frei has already shown his worth , with the striker scoring four goals in 45 minutes in a game against a local giessen team .

“ that is a recipe for more confrontation , " he said . lebanon 's prime minister fouad siniora said the draft was " not adequate . " " full " but not " immediate " cessation of hostilities the draft demands a " full cessation of hostilities based upon , in particular , the immediate cessation by hezbollah of all attacks and the immediate cessation by israel of all offensive military operations . "
the most glaring omission from the text is the statement pushed for by france which called for an “ immediate cessation of hostilities . " bildunterschrift : us ambassador john bolton welcomed the draft however , the us also appears to have compromised , with a preferred phrase explicitly demanding the return of the captured israeli soldiers also missing from the text . the text received positive responses from other members of the 15-member security council which indicated a possible ratification at next week ’ s vote .

along with romania , bulgaria could join as early as january 2007 although there are still hurdles .
kuneva says she 's optimistic . herself small in physical size , minister for european affairs meglena kuneva likes to talk about confidence and the need for people to have a little more of it regarding bulgaria .
at the same time , her tone does n't come across as one of arrogance . " i think that the desire to be better is there , " she said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we are dreaming of a better life and this is a great vehicle for trying to get better and better every single day . " kuneva , 49 , said that while bulgaria has come a long way since it was a satellite state of the soviet union , her generation will likely not be the ones who really benefit from the ground-breaking changes that her country has seen since it shook one-party rule in 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meglena kuneva " i do n't believe that those people who are in the middle of their lives could easily harvest the fruits , " she said . but she said it is the next generation , the children of her peers , including her own son , who will really become a part of europe .
according to her , they already feel like europeans , having a sense of curiosity and liberty that many of their parents lack . " if we compare this generation with the one before the 90s , the difference is dramatic , " she said . hurdles to overcome but bulgaria still faces big challenges that are giving the european commission cause for concern and could prove a stumbling block to a 2007 accession date .
the eu has chided the country for its rampant corruption , several unsolved contract killings and a fight against money laundering many consider overly feeble .
kuneva said that bulgaria has some catching up to do , but stressed that progress has been made . " we have many successful cases against money laundering , " she said .
" well , many means four .
this is because of being already integrated in a much broader community . " besides time to tackle deeply rooted problems bulgaria needs a break from the bad old days , she said - not only the communist era , but also the difficult transition years of the 1990s .
the decade was marked by government shuffles , flip-flopping policies , and in 1997 an inflation rate that reached 240 percent , triggering mass protests and the downfall of another government . " those who actually brought the country to this very unfortunate stage in the 1990s have been outcast from public opinion , " she said .
" they have never regained the public 's confidence . " new blood n eeded kuneva said she hopes the old guard is replaced by qualified politicians - especially younger ones - who are ready to take on positions of responsibility in sofia .
that could be made all the more difficult due to bulgaria 's continuing problem with brain drain , in which highly skilled people leave the country in search of more lucrative opportunities abroad .
she said it 's important to improve conditions at home instead of simply making it harder for people to leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accession could take place on jan .
1 , 2007 " i think that we could rely on having our best people at home if they are confident that they could go and come back , " she said .
" i do n't believe that with restriction , we could keep people at home .
it 's not fair . " that is why eu programs such as " erasmus " are important , in which students get financial assistance to spend a semester abroad .
bulgarians already have access to these stipends , although the country is not a full eu member yet . what would happen , though , if bulgaria does not reach its goal of eu accession on jan.1 , 2007 ?
kuneva only smiled , saying she firmly believes the country with meet its target date .
besides , a big eu party has already been planned in her electoral district , ruse . it might be that the eu commission in september will decide to push bulgaria 's accession date back a year .

none came the other way german soccer clubs have reported mixed results in attempts to recruit foreign talent for the upcoming 2006-2007 season . the annual off-season player shuffle has seen some of germany 's major soccer clubs unable to recruit several highly sought-after foreign players . this means the german clubs will have to rely on home-grown talent to take them through the 2006-2007 season , which they argue is worth supporting . nine of the 11 players who took germany to the semi-finals of the world cup on home soil will be lining up for german bundesliga clubs when the season kicks off next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch soccer player ruud van nistelrooy at soccer practice however , champions bayern munich have failed to recruit dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy , after the bavarian club fell short of manchester united 's asking price . van nistelrooy will now be representing real madrid after the club offered around 16 million euros -lrb- $ 20.5 million -rrb- for his signature on the dotted line . bayern general manager uli hoeness said that the club chose to drop out of the bidding war for van nistelrooy since the asking price for the player would have been ' ' against bayern 's philosophy . " italian club juventus was taxed of some of its elite players following a match-fixing debacle and subsequent club relegation .
however , few of these players were relocated to germany . ballack to britain german soccer star , michael ballack transferred from bayern to wealthy english premiership champions chelsea , which has diminished the star quality of the bundesliga . some german clubs , however , have successfully attracted foreign talent . sv hamburg landed dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart ahead of last season but failed this summer in a bid to recruit milan baros , the czech international striker who was top scorer at euro 2004 .
baros will be staying with premiership side aston villa . hamburg also succeeded bringing in vincent kompany , the highly rated 20-year-old anderlecht centerback , for eight million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander frei after scoring a goal at the 2006 world cup borussia dortmund has landed swiss alexander frei from french club rennes in a deal worth four million euros . frei has already shown his worth , with the striker scoring four goals in 45 minutes in a game against a local giessen team .
dortmund went on to win 13-0 . stayed in the bundesliga most of the summer transfers in germany involved moves between bundesliga clubs .
belgian centre-back daniel van buyten , has traded in his hamburg uniform for bayern 's and peruvian striker paolo guerrero went in the opposite direction . dortmund meanwhile bought nelson valdez , the paraguayan striker from bremen to partner frei . only ballack , and goalkeeper jens lehmann , who remains at premiership club arsenal , will play abroad . miroslav klose , the top scorer at the world cup , has said he is staying with werder bremen - at least for another season - while bayern bought lukas podolski , the 21-year-old forward who collected the best young player award at the world cup , from relegated fc cologne . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga teams beat up local competition spoiled by first-class soccer during the world cup , fans could be left wondering what happened to the stars after this week 's bundesliga test matches .

none came the other way german soccer clubs have reported mixed results in attempts to recruit foreign talent for the upcoming 2006-2007 season . the annual off-season player shuffle has seen some of germany 's major soccer clubs unable to recruit several highly sought-after foreign players . this means the german clubs will have to rely on home-grown talent to take them through the 2006-2007 season , which they argue is worth supporting . nine of the 11 players who took germany to the semi-finals of the world cup on home soil will be lining up for german bundesliga clubs when the season kicks off next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch soccer player ruud van nistelrooy at soccer practice however , champions bayern munich have failed to recruit dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy , after the bavarian club fell short of manchester united 's asking price . van nistelrooy will now be representing real madrid after the club offered around 16 million euros -lrb- $ 20.5 million -rrb- for his signature on the dotted line . bayern general manager uli hoeness said that the club chose to drop out of the bidding war for van nistelrooy since the asking price for the player would have been ' ' against bayern 's philosophy . " italian club juventus was taxed of some of its elite players following a match-fixing debacle and subsequent club relegation .
however , few of these players were relocated to germany . ballack to britain german soccer star , michael ballack transferred from bayern to wealthy english premiership champions chelsea , which has diminished the star quality of the bundesliga . some german clubs , however , have successfully attracted foreign talent . sv hamburg landed dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart ahead of last season but failed this summer in a bid to recruit milan baros , the czech international striker who was top scorer at euro 2004 .
baros will be staying with premiership side aston villa . hamburg also succeeded bringing in vincent kompany , the highly rated 20-year-old anderlecht centerback , for eight million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander frei after scoring a goal at the 2006 world cup borussia dortmund has landed swiss alexander frei from french club rennes in a deal worth four million euros . frei has already shown his worth , with the striker scoring four goals in 45 minutes in a game against a local giessen team .
dortmund went on to win 13-0 . stayed in the bundesliga most of the summer transfers in germany involved moves between bundesliga clubs .
belgian centre-back daniel van buyten , has traded in his hamburg uniform for bayern 's and peruvian striker paolo guerrero went in the opposite direction . dortmund meanwhile bought nelson valdez , the paraguayan striker from bremen to partner frei . only ballack , and goalkeeper jens lehmann , who remains at premiership club arsenal , will play abroad . miroslav klose , the top scorer at the world cup , has said he is staying with werder bremen - at least for another season - while bayern bought lukas podolski , the 21-year-old forward who collected the best young player award at the world cup , from relegated fc cologne . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga teams beat up local competition spoiled by first-class soccer during the world cup , fans could be left wondering what happened to the stars after this week 's bundesliga test matches .
but german league cup matches will raise the pressure .
" germany will have even better players in the future " with the world cup over , dw-world.de spoke to christian streich , a leading youth soccer coach , about lessons learned , the challenges of producing tomorrow ’ s ballacks and kloses and catching up with latin america .
national soccer team redefines what it means to be german as nearly one-quarter of the german soccer team have foreign roots , cheering for the home boys means coming to terms with a germany that has become increasingly diverse ethnically .
or does it ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.08.2006 german job seekers find life-changing opportunities abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobs abroad are for some an alternative to chronic unemployment in germany architect daniel lambart worked in africa for four years .
he and others who have bad luck on the tight german job market are finding jobs , and the experience of a lifetime , abroad .
many return , some stay on for good . this year alone , some 145,000 germans packed up and left home , the highest number in 50 years .
two thirds of the émigrés went abroad for career reasons and most of these because their options were slim on the job market at home . " i saw that the market did n't offer me the possibilities i would have liked and i tried to find a job in other european countries , but that did n't work out either , " said architect daniel lambart . alternatives to unemployment in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's unemployment hovers above 8 percent while many are fleeing unemployment in germany , the agency for employment abroad -lrb- zav -rrb- in bonn has plenty of work on its hands .
job seekers from practically every sector are turning to this branch of the federal employment agency in an effort to try their chances across the border . last year the zav placed 13,000 germans in jobs abroad .
handcraft and gastronomy profession have the highest demand , though chances are also good for engineers . for older job seekers , a position abroad is sometimes the last prospect available .
in switzerland and the netherlands , for example , job experience is valued more than having the most up-to-date specialized knowledge , unlike in germany . nearly 40 percent of the people placed by zav are over the age of 40 , which can be considered " old " on the german job market . over 75 percent of the foreign job placements are in europe .
job seekers who venture off the continent tend to prefer canada and australia . many return sooner or later those germans who decide to pack their suitcases , learn a new language and explore a new culture are n't necessarily gone for good , said zav spokesperson sabine seidler . " the majority of opportunities involve temporary job contracts for a longer period of time .
there are some that say , i 'll stay .
but , in general , coming back is part of the deal , " added seidler . for many , a major motivation to emigrate is to improve their chances of finding a better job when they return .
that was the case for architect daniel lambart , who took a position with the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- in togo , despite original plans to stay in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty percent of job placements abroad are for job seekers over 40 " the people around me could n't really understand it , " said lambart .
" but i did n't let myself get misled and took my own path .
especially since the contract was only for one year and i saw it as an opportunity , not as some kind of challenge with lots of risks attached . " flexibility is key making the decision to go was only the first step .
then lambart had to arrange for insurance , get vaccinated and study up on his new country .
he had the advantage that he already spoke french , togo 's official language . " on the one hand , you have to be ambitious , but you also have to like the challenge and feel a sense of adventure , " said lambart .
zav 's seidler agreed that it 's most important to approach the move with the right attitude and to transition into the new culture with as much flexibility as possible . lambart settled into life in togo so well that he extended his contract with the german development service for another year , and then again for two additional years in chad in central africa . " most people give positive feedback and are glad that they did it , simply because it 's such an exciting time .
those who were unemployed for a long time and then take this huge step abroad usually come back with a completely new sense of self-confidence , " said seidler . she added that the only problems she can remember hearing about were disagreements between co-workers , which can also arise at any workplace in germany . no guarantees upon return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experiences abroad are irreplaceable lambart 's return to germany and re-entry in the german work force after four years abroad was particularly trying .
it took nine months of serious effort and a training course in public relations for him to gain a foothold in the job market . " private enterprise , in any sector , does n't view cooperative development work abroad as a real benefit , " said lambart , who observed a big difference between work experience in other european countries and in developing countries when being considered for a position in germany . " i do n't regret the time -lrb- abroad -rrb- because i had lots of experiences that help me in my life today , " said the architect .

he and others who have bad luck on the tight german job market are finding jobs , and the experience of a lifetime , abroad .
many return , some stay on for good . this year alone , some 145,000 germans packed up and left home , the highest number in 50 years .
two thirds of the émigrés went abroad for career reasons and most of these because their options were slim on the job market at home . " i saw that the market did n't offer me the possibilities i would have liked and i tried to find a job in other european countries , but that did n't work out either , " said architect daniel lambart . alternatives to unemployment in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's unemployment hovers above 8 percent while many are fleeing unemployment in germany , the agency for employment abroad -lrb- zav -rrb- in bonn has plenty of work on its hands .
job seekers from practically every sector are turning to this branch of the federal employment agency in an effort to try their chances across the border . last year the zav placed 13,000 germans in jobs abroad .
handcraft and gastronomy profession have the highest demand , though chances are also good for engineers . for older job seekers , a position abroad is sometimes the last prospect available .
in switzerland and the netherlands , for example , job experience is valued more than having the most up-to-date specialized knowledge , unlike in germany . nearly 40 percent of the people placed by zav are over the age of 40 , which can be considered " old " on the german job market . over 75 percent of the foreign job placements are in europe .
job seekers who venture off the continent tend to prefer canada and australia . many return sooner or later those germans who decide to pack their suitcases , learn a new language and explore a new culture are n't necessarily gone for good , said zav spokesperson sabine seidler . " the majority of opportunities involve temporary job contracts for a longer period of time .
there are some that say , i 'll stay .
but , in general , coming back is part of the deal , " added seidler . for many , a major motivation to emigrate is to improve their chances of finding a better job when they return .
that was the case for architect daniel lambart , who took a position with the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- in togo , despite original plans to stay in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty percent of job placements abroad are for job seekers over 40 " the people around me could n't really understand it , " said lambart .
" but i did n't let myself get misled and took my own path .
especially since the contract was only for one year and i saw it as an opportunity , not as some kind of challenge with lots of risks attached . " flexibility is key making the decision to go was only the first step .
then lambart had to arrange for insurance , get vaccinated and study up on his new country .
he had the advantage that he already spoke french , togo 's official language . " on the one hand , you have to be ambitious , but you also have to like the challenge and feel a sense of adventure , " said lambart .
zav 's seidler agreed that it 's most important to approach the move with the right attitude and to transition into the new culture with as much flexibility as possible . lambart settled into life in togo so well that he extended his contract with the german development service for another year , and then again for two additional years in chad in central africa . " most people give positive feedback and are glad that they did it , simply because it 's such an exciting time .
those who were unemployed for a long time and then take this huge step abroad usually come back with a completely new sense of self-confidence , " said seidler . she added that the only problems she can remember hearing about were disagreements between co-workers , which can also arise at any workplace in germany . no guarantees upon return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experiences abroad are irreplaceable lambart 's return to germany and re-entry in the german work force after four years abroad was particularly trying .
it took nine months of serious effort and a training course in public relations for him to gain a foothold in the job market . " private enterprise , in any sector , does n't view cooperative development work abroad as a real benefit , " said lambart , who observed a big difference between work experience in other european countries and in developing countries when being considered for a position in germany . " i do n't regret the time -lrb- abroad -rrb- because i had lots of experiences that help me in my life today , " said the architect .
" i think i 've managed to make the leap back into the german work force . " clarisse weischedel -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german emigration hits highest level in 55 years germans are moving abroad in record numbers .

none came the other way german soccer clubs have reported mixed results in attempts to recruit foreign talent for the upcoming 2006-2007 season . the annual off-season player shuffle has seen some of germany 's major soccer clubs unable to recruit several highly sought-after foreign players . this means the german clubs will have to rely on home-grown talent to take them through the 2006-2007 season , which they argue is worth supporting . nine of the 11 players who took germany to the semi-finals of the world cup on home soil will be lining up for german bundesliga clubs when the season kicks off next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch soccer player ruud van nistelrooy at soccer practice however , champions bayern munich have failed to recruit dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy , after the bavarian club fell short of manchester united 's asking price . van nistelrooy will now be representing real madrid after the club offered around 16 million euros -lrb- $ 20.5 million -rrb- for his signature on the dotted line . bayern general manager uli hoeness said that the club chose to drop out of the bidding war for van nistelrooy since the asking price for the player would have been ' ' against bayern 's philosophy . " italian club juventus was taxed of some of its elite players following a match-fixing debacle and subsequent club relegation .
however , few of these players were relocated to germany . ballack to britain german soccer star , michael ballack transferred from bayern to wealthy english premiership champions chelsea , which has diminished the star quality of the bundesliga . some german clubs , however , have successfully attracted foreign talent . sv hamburg landed dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart ahead of last season but failed this summer in a bid to recruit milan baros , the czech international striker who was top scorer at euro 2004 .
baros will be staying with premiership side aston villa . hamburg also succeeded bringing in vincent kompany , the highly rated 20-year-old anderlecht centerback , for eight million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander frei after scoring a goal at the 2006 world cup borussia dortmund has landed swiss alexander frei from french club rennes in a deal worth four million euros . frei has already shown his worth , with the striker scoring four goals in 45 minutes in a game against a local giessen team .
dortmund went on to win 13-0 . stayed in the bundesliga most of the summer transfers in germany involved moves between bundesliga clubs .
belgian centre-back daniel van buyten , has traded in his hamburg uniform for bayern 's and peruvian striker paolo guerrero went in the opposite direction . dortmund meanwhile bought nelson valdez , the paraguayan striker from bremen to partner frei . only ballack , and goalkeeper jens lehmann , who remains at premiership club arsenal , will play abroad . miroslav klose , the top scorer at the world cup , has said he is staying with werder bremen - at least for another season - while bayern bought lukas podolski , the 21-year-old forward who collected the best young player award at the world cup , from relegated fc cologne . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga teams beat up local competition spoiled by first-class soccer during the world cup , fans could be left wondering what happened to the stars after this week 's bundesliga test matches .
but german league cup matches will raise the pressure .
" germany will have even better players in the future " with the world cup over , dw-world.de spoke to christian streich , a leading youth soccer coach , about lessons learned , the challenges of producing tomorrow ’ s ballacks and kloses and catching up with latin america .
national soccer team redefines what it means to be german as nearly one-quarter of the german soccer team have foreign roots , cheering for the home boys means coming to terms with a germany that has become increasingly diverse ethnically .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.08.2006 german job seekers find life-changing opportunities abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobs abroad are for some an alternative to chronic unemployment in germany architect daniel lambart worked in africa for four years .
he and others who have bad luck on the tight german job market are finding jobs , and the experience of a lifetime , abroad .
many return , some stay on for good . this year alone , some 145,000 germans packed up and left home , the highest number in 50 years .
two thirds of the émigrés went abroad for career reasons and most of these because their options were slim on the job market at home . " i saw that the market did n't offer me the possibilities i would have liked and i tried to find a job in other european countries , but that did n't work out either , " said architect daniel lambart . alternatives to unemployment in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's unemployment hovers above 8 percent while many are fleeing unemployment in germany , the agency for employment abroad -lrb- zav -rrb- in bonn has plenty of work on its hands .
job seekers from practically every sector are turning to this branch of the federal employment agency in an effort to try their chances across the border . last year the zav placed 13,000 germans in jobs abroad .
handcraft and gastronomy profession have the highest demand , though chances are also good for engineers . for older job seekers , a position abroad is sometimes the last prospect available .
in switzerland and the netherlands , for example , job experience is valued more than having the most up-to-date specialized knowledge , unlike in germany . nearly 40 percent of the people placed by zav are over the age of 40 , which can be considered " old " on the german job market . over 75 percent of the foreign job placements are in europe .
job seekers who venture off the continent tend to prefer canada and australia . many return sooner or later those germans who decide to pack their suitcases , learn a new language and explore a new culture are n't necessarily gone for good , said zav spokesperson sabine seidler . " the majority of opportunities involve temporary job contracts for a longer period of time .
there are some that say , i 'll stay .
but , in general , coming back is part of the deal , " added seidler . for many , a major motivation to emigrate is to improve their chances of finding a better job when they return .
that was the case for architect daniel lambart , who took a position with the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- in togo , despite original plans to stay in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty percent of job placements abroad are for job seekers over 40 " the people around me could n't really understand it , " said lambart .
" but i did n't let myself get misled and took my own path .
especially since the contract was only for one year and i saw it as an opportunity , not as some kind of challenge with lots of risks attached . " flexibility is key making the decision to go was only the first step .
then lambart had to arrange for insurance , get vaccinated and study up on his new country .
he had the advantage that he already spoke french , togo 's official language . " on the one hand , you have to be ambitious , but you also have to like the challenge and feel a sense of adventure , " said lambart .
zav 's seidler agreed that it 's most important to approach the move with the right attitude and to transition into the new culture with as much flexibility as possible . lambart settled into life in togo so well that he extended his contract with the german development service for another year , and then again for two additional years in chad in central africa . " most people give positive feedback and are glad that they did it , simply because it 's such an exciting time .
those who were unemployed for a long time and then take this huge step abroad usually come back with a completely new sense of self-confidence , " said seidler . she added that the only problems she can remember hearing about were disagreements between co-workers , which can also arise at any workplace in germany . no guarantees upon return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experiences abroad are irreplaceable lambart 's return to germany and re-entry in the german work force after four years abroad was particularly trying .
it took nine months of serious effort and a training course in public relations for him to gain a foothold in the job market . " private enterprise , in any sector , does n't view cooperative development work abroad as a real benefit , " said lambart , who observed a big difference between work experience in other european countries and in developing countries when being considered for a position in germany . " i do n't regret the time -lrb- abroad -rrb- because i had lots of experiences that help me in my life today , " said the architect .
" i think i 've managed to make the leap back into the german work force . " clarisse weischedel -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german emigration hits highest level in 55 years germans are moving abroad in record numbers .
according to the latest migration statistics , around 145,000 germans left home for greener pastures last year , the highest tally since 1950 .

“ that is a recipe for more confrontation , " he said . lebanon 's prime minister fouad siniora said the draft was " not adequate . " " full " but not " immediate " cessation of hostilities the draft demands a " full cessation of hostilities based upon , in particular , the immediate cessation by hezbollah of all attacks and the immediate cessation by israel of all offensive military operations . "
the most glaring omission from the text is the statement pushed for by france which called for an “ immediate cessation of hostilities . " bildunterschrift : us ambassador john bolton welcomed the draft however , the us also appears to have compromised , with a preferred phrase explicitly demanding the return of the captured israeli soldiers also missing from the text . the text received positive responses from other members of the 15-member security council which indicated a possible ratification at next week ’ s vote .
a second resolution would be needed later to authorise an international peacekeeping force for southern lebanon to keep the peace instigated by the first . the white house said sunday that it hoped for a vote on a un resolution shaping an international force for lebanon in " days , not weeks " and for a deployment as quickly as possible after that . us ambassador to the un john bolton said the security council meeting on saturday was " very productive . ” " we received a lot of encouraging comments on the draft text , " he said , while us president george w. bush was “ happy with the progress being made ” but also “ under no illusions ” as to the impact it may have , british prime minister tony blair welcomed the tabling of the resolution . " the priority now is to get the resolution adopted as soon as possible and then to work for a permanent ceasefire and achieve the conditions in lebanon and israel which will prevent a recurrence , ” he told reporters . german chancellor angela merkel praised the french-us draft un resolution , calling it " an important step towards a halt in military operations .

along with romania , bulgaria could join as early as january 2007 although there are still hurdles .
kuneva says she 's optimistic . herself small in physical size , minister for european affairs meglena kuneva likes to talk about confidence and the need for people to have a little more of it regarding bulgaria .
at the same time , her tone does n't come across as one of arrogance . " i think that the desire to be better is there , " she said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we are dreaming of a better life and this is a great vehicle for trying to get better and better every single day . " kuneva , 49 , said that while bulgaria has come a long way since it was a satellite state of the soviet union , her generation will likely not be the ones who really benefit from the ground-breaking changes that her country has seen since it shook one-party rule in 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meglena kuneva " i do n't believe that those people who are in the middle of their lives could easily harvest the fruits , " she said . but she said it is the next generation , the children of her peers , including her own son , who will really become a part of europe .

this is because of being already integrated in a much broader community . " besides time to tackle deeply rooted problems bulgaria needs a break from the bad old days , she said - not only the communist era , but also the difficult transition years of the 1990s .
the decade was marked by government shuffles , flip-flopping policies , and in 1997 an inflation rate that reached 240 percent , triggering mass protests and the downfall of another government . " those who actually brought the country to this very unfortunate stage in the 1990s have been outcast from public opinion , " she said .
" they have never regained the public 's confidence . " new blood n eeded kuneva said she hopes the old guard is replaced by qualified politicians - especially younger ones - who are ready to take on positions of responsibility in sofia .
that could be made all the more difficult due to bulgaria 's continuing problem with brain drain , in which highly skilled people leave the country in search of more lucrative opportunities abroad .

bulgarians already have access to these stipends , although the country is not a full eu member yet . what would happen , though , if bulgaria does not reach its goal of eu accession on jan.1 , 2007 ?

he and others who have bad luck on the tight german job market are finding jobs , and the experience of a lifetime , abroad .
many return , some stay on for good . this year alone , some 145,000 germans packed up and left home , the highest number in 50 years .
two thirds of the émigrés went abroad for career reasons and most of these because their options were slim on the job market at home . " i saw that the market did n't offer me the possibilities i would have liked and i tried to find a job in other european countries , but that did n't work out either , " said architect daniel lambart . alternatives to unemployment in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's unemployment hovers above 8 percent while many are fleeing unemployment in germany , the agency for employment abroad -lrb- zav -rrb- in bonn has plenty of work on its hands .
job seekers from practically every sector are turning to this branch of the federal employment agency in an effort to try their chances across the border . last year the zav placed 13,000 germans in jobs abroad .
handcraft and gastronomy profession have the highest demand , though chances are also good for engineers . for older job seekers , a position abroad is sometimes the last prospect available .
in switzerland and the netherlands , for example , job experience is valued more than having the most up-to-date specialized knowledge , unlike in germany . nearly 40 percent of the people placed by zav are over the age of 40 , which can be considered " old " on the german job market . over 75 percent of the foreign job placements are in europe .
job seekers who venture off the continent tend to prefer canada and australia . many return sooner or later those germans who decide to pack their suitcases , learn a new language and explore a new culture are n't necessarily gone for good , said zav spokesperson sabine seidler . " the majority of opportunities involve temporary job contracts for a longer period of time .
there are some that say , i 'll stay .
but , in general , coming back is part of the deal , " added seidler . for many , a major motivation to emigrate is to improve their chances of finding a better job when they return .
that was the case for architect daniel lambart , who took a position with the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- in togo , despite original plans to stay in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty percent of job placements abroad are for job seekers over 40 " the people around me could n't really understand it , " said lambart .
" but i did n't let myself get misled and took my own path .
especially since the contract was only for one year and i saw it as an opportunity , not as some kind of challenge with lots of risks attached . " flexibility is key making the decision to go was only the first step .
then lambart had to arrange for insurance , get vaccinated and study up on his new country .
he had the advantage that he already spoke french , togo 's official language . " on the one hand , you have to be ambitious , but you also have to like the challenge and feel a sense of adventure , " said lambart .
zav 's seidler agreed that it 's most important to approach the move with the right attitude and to transition into the new culture with as much flexibility as possible . lambart settled into life in togo so well that he extended his contract with the german development service for another year , and then again for two additional years in chad in central africa . " most people give positive feedback and are glad that they did it , simply because it 's such an exciting time .
those who were unemployed for a long time and then take this huge step abroad usually come back with a completely new sense of self-confidence , " said seidler . she added that the only problems she can remember hearing about were disagreements between co-workers , which can also arise at any workplace in germany . no guarantees upon return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experiences abroad are irreplaceable lambart 's return to germany and re-entry in the german work force after four years abroad was particularly trying .
it took nine months of serious effort and a training course in public relations for him to gain a foothold in the job market . " private enterprise , in any sector , does n't view cooperative development work abroad as a real benefit , " said lambart , who observed a big difference between work experience in other european countries and in developing countries when being considered for a position in germany . " i do n't regret the time -lrb- abroad -rrb- because i had lots of experiences that help me in my life today , " said the architect .

then lambart had to arrange for insurance , get vaccinated and study up on his new country .
he had the advantage that he already spoke french , togo 's official language . " on the one hand , you have to be ambitious , but you also have to like the challenge and feel a sense of adventure , " said lambart .
zav 's seidler agreed that it 's most important to approach the move with the right attitude and to transition into the new culture with as much flexibility as possible . lambart settled into life in togo so well that he extended his contract with the german development service for another year , and then again for two additional years in chad in central africa . " most people give positive feedback and are glad that they did it , simply because it 's such an exciting time .
those who were unemployed for a long time and then take this huge step abroad usually come back with a completely new sense of self-confidence , " said seidler . she added that the only problems she can remember hearing about were disagreements between co-workers , which can also arise at any workplace in germany . no guarantees upon return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experiences abroad are irreplaceable lambart 's return to germany and re-entry in the german work force after four years abroad was particularly trying .

“ that is a recipe for more confrontation , " he said . lebanon 's prime minister fouad siniora said the draft was " not adequate . " " full " but not " immediate " cessation of hostilities the draft demands a " full cessation of hostilities based upon , in particular , the immediate cessation by hezbollah of all attacks and the immediate cessation by israel of all offensive military operations . "
the most glaring omission from the text is the statement pushed for by france which called for an “ immediate cessation of hostilities . " bildunterschrift : us ambassador john bolton welcomed the draft however , the us also appears to have compromised , with a preferred phrase explicitly demanding the return of the captured israeli soldiers also missing from the text . the text received positive responses from other members of the 15-member security council which indicated a possible ratification at next week ’ s vote .
a second resolution would be needed later to authorise an international peacekeeping force for southern lebanon to keep the peace instigated by the first . the white house said sunday that it hoped for a vote on a un resolution shaping an international force for lebanon in " days , not weeks " and for a deployment as quickly as possible after that . us ambassador to the un john bolton said the security council meeting on saturday was " very productive . ” " we received a lot of encouraging comments on the draft text , " he said , while us president george w. bush was “ happy with the progress being made ” but also “ under no illusions ” as to the impact it may have , british prime minister tony blair welcomed the tabling of the resolution . " the priority now is to get the resolution adopted as soon as possible and then to work for a permanent ceasefire and achieve the conditions in lebanon and israel which will prevent a recurrence , ” he told reporters . german chancellor angela merkel praised the french-us draft un resolution , calling it " an important step towards a halt in military operations . " " the accord on a resolution for the middle east is a strong signal by the international community to the parties involved in the conflict , " merkel was quoted by a government spokesman as saying . israel continues with devastating air strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli war planes pounded southern lebanon early sunday despite the progress at the un , israel continued its bombardment of southern lebanon as the security council welcomed the breakthrough ; an air-raid on the village of ansar killing five civilians early on sunday to further extend the hostilities that began three weeks ago after hezbollah militants captured two israeli soldiers . israeli tourism minister isaac herzog said the israeli army would " continue to act " until the resolution was enforced . more israeli air strikes were reported on roads on the eastern beka ’ a valley and on bridges in the north of the country . there were also indications that israel was preparing for further land operations within lebanon with israeli planes dropping leaflets on the lebanese city of sidon , warning people there to leave . the israeli defense force said it intended to attack hezbollah rocket-launching sites in the area and wanted to avoid civilian casualties . commando raids and increasing civilian casualties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ground offensive goes on israeli commandos also hit the coastal port of tyre in a raid on a hezbollah position .
heavy fighting left several militants dead and eight israeli troops wounded , the israeli army said , while hezbollah said it repelled the raid . in other developments , syria – which has its own army on the highest level of readiness – sent a letter to the un accusing israel of intentionally bombing a lebanese village close to the syrian border on friday , killing 28 people , most of whom were syrians . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german defense ministry rules out mid-east troop deployment germany 's defence ministry has ruled out contributing troops to a proposed international military force for south lebanon , despite calls by the israeli prime minister for german participation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.08.2006 un working on resolutions for ceasefire , peace-keeping force großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us hopes for a un resolution in " days , not weeks " for the deployment of troops the un security council was working on draft resolutions sunday to end hostilities in the middle east and for the deployment of international troops in lebanon , which the white house said would be ready " in days " . after france and the united states agreed on a draft resolution to stop the conflict in the middle east on saturday , the un security council began the unenviable task sunday of considering the details of the text which would bring an end to the fighting between israel and hezbollah militants in lebanon . security council members are expected to prepare the draft for presentation before a un vote which could come on monday or tuesday . while the united states in particular were encouraged by the progress made on saturday , those on the ground in the war-torn region were less so sure of the draft which called on hezbollah to halt all attacks and for israel to stop all offensive military operations . nouhad mahmoud , a lebanese envoy to the un , told reporters : " we would have liked to see our concerns more reflected in the text , " adding that there was no mention of a withdrawal of israeli forces in lebanon .
“ that is a recipe for more confrontation , " he said . lebanon 's prime minister fouad siniora said the draft was " not adequate . " " full " but not " immediate " cessation of hostilities the draft demands a " full cessation of hostilities based upon , in particular , the immediate cessation by hezbollah of all attacks and the immediate cessation by israel of all offensive military operations . "
the most glaring omission from the text is the statement pushed for by france which called for an “ immediate cessation of hostilities .

“ that is a recipe for more confrontation , " he said . lebanon 's prime minister fouad siniora said the draft was " not adequate . " " full " but not " immediate " cessation of hostilities the draft demands a " full cessation of hostilities based upon , in particular , the immediate cessation by hezbollah of all attacks and the immediate cessation by israel of all offensive military operations .

none came the other way german soccer clubs have reported mixed results in attempts to recruit foreign talent for the upcoming 2006-2007 season . the annual off-season player shuffle has seen some of germany 's major soccer clubs unable to recruit several highly sought-after foreign players . this means the german clubs will have to rely on home-grown talent to take them through the 2006-2007 season , which they argue is worth supporting . nine of the 11 players who took germany to the semi-finals of the world cup on home soil will be lining up for german bundesliga clubs when the season kicks off next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch soccer player ruud van nistelrooy at soccer practice however , champions bayern munich have failed to recruit dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy , after the bavarian club fell short of manchester united 's asking price . van nistelrooy will now be representing real madrid after the club offered around 16 million euros -lrb- $ 20.5 million -rrb- for his signature on the dotted line . bayern general manager uli hoeness said that the club chose to drop out of the bidding war for van nistelrooy since the asking price for the player would have been ' ' against bayern 's philosophy . " italian club juventus was taxed of some of its elite players following a match-fixing debacle and subsequent club relegation .
however , few of these players were relocated to germany . ballack to britain german soccer star , michael ballack transferred from bayern to wealthy english premiership champions chelsea , which has diminished the star quality of the bundesliga . some german clubs , however , have successfully attracted foreign talent . sv hamburg landed dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart ahead of last season but failed this summer in a bid to recruit milan baros , the czech international striker who was top scorer at euro 2004 .
baros will be staying with premiership side aston villa . hamburg also succeeded bringing in vincent kompany , the highly rated 20-year-old anderlecht centerback , for eight million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander frei after scoring a goal at the 2006 world cup borussia dortmund has landed swiss alexander frei from french club rennes in a deal worth four million euros . frei has already shown his worth , with the striker scoring four goals in 45 minutes in a game against a local giessen team .
dortmund went on to win 13-0 . stayed in the bundesliga most of the summer transfers in germany involved moves between bundesliga clubs .
belgian centre-back daniel van buyten , has traded in his hamburg uniform for bayern 's and peruvian striker paolo guerrero went in the opposite direction . dortmund meanwhile bought nelson valdez , the paraguayan striker from bremen to partner frei . only ballack , and goalkeeper jens lehmann , who remains at premiership club arsenal , will play abroad . miroslav klose , the top scorer at the world cup , has said he is staying with werder bremen - at least for another season - while bayern bought lukas podolski , the 21-year-old forward who collected the best young player award at the world cup , from relegated fc cologne . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga teams beat up local competition spoiled by first-class soccer during the world cup , fans could be left wondering what happened to the stars after this week 's bundesliga test matches .
but german league cup matches will raise the pressure .
" germany will have even better players in the future " with the world cup over , dw-world.de spoke to christian streich , a leading youth soccer coach , about lessons learned , the challenges of producing tomorrow ’ s ballacks and kloses and catching up with latin america .
national soccer team redefines what it means to be german as nearly one-quarter of the german soccer team have foreign roots , cheering for the home boys means coming to terms with a germany that has become increasingly diverse ethnically .

along with romania , bulgaria could join as early as january 2007 although there are still hurdles .
kuneva says she 's optimistic . herself small in physical size , minister for european affairs meglena kuneva likes to talk about confidence and the need for people to have a little more of it regarding bulgaria .
at the same time , her tone does n't come across as one of arrogance . " i think that the desire to be better is there , " she said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we are dreaming of a better life and this is a great vehicle for trying to get better and better every single day . " kuneva , 49 , said that while bulgaria has come a long way since it was a satellite state of the soviet union , her generation will likely not be the ones who really benefit from the ground-breaking changes that her country has seen since it shook one-party rule in 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meglena kuneva " i do n't believe that those people who are in the middle of their lives could easily harvest the fruits , " she said . but she said it is the next generation , the children of her peers , including her own son , who will really become a part of europe .
according to her , they already feel like europeans , having a sense of curiosity and liberty that many of their parents lack . " if we compare this generation with the one before the 90s , the difference is dramatic , " she said . hurdles to overcome but bulgaria still faces big challenges that are giving the european commission cause for concern and could prove a stumbling block to a 2007 accession date .
the eu has chided the country for its rampant corruption , several unsolved contract killings and a fight against money laundering many consider overly feeble .
kuneva said that bulgaria has some catching up to do , but stressed that progress has been made . " we have many successful cases against money laundering , " she said .
" well , many means four .
this is because of being already integrated in a much broader community . " besides time to tackle deeply rooted problems bulgaria needs a break from the bad old days , she said - not only the communist era , but also the difficult transition years of the 1990s .
the decade was marked by government shuffles , flip-flopping policies , and in 1997 an inflation rate that reached 240 percent , triggering mass protests and the downfall of another government . " those who actually brought the country to this very unfortunate stage in the 1990s have been outcast from public opinion , " she said .
" they have never regained the public 's confidence . " new blood n eeded kuneva said she hopes the old guard is replaced by qualified politicians - especially younger ones - who are ready to take on positions of responsibility in sofia .
that could be made all the more difficult due to bulgaria 's continuing problem with brain drain , in which highly skilled people leave the country in search of more lucrative opportunities abroad .
she said it 's important to improve conditions at home instead of simply making it harder for people to leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accession could take place on jan .
1 , 2007 " i think that we could rely on having our best people at home if they are confident that they could go and come back , " she said .
" i do n't believe that with restriction , we could keep people at home .
it 's not fair . " that is why eu programs such as " erasmus " are important , in which students get financial assistance to spend a semester abroad .
bulgarians already have access to these stipends , although the country is not a full eu member yet . what would happen , though , if bulgaria does not reach its goal of eu accession on jan.1 , 2007 ?
kuneva only smiled , saying she firmly believes the country with meet its target date .
besides , a big eu party has already been planned in her electoral district , ruse . it might be that the eu commission in september will decide to push bulgaria 's accession date back a year .
no , kuneva said , there 's no plan b in case that happens .
but , she added , it wo n't . klaus dahmann -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de way open for bulgaria , romania to join eu the european parliament has given the thumbs-up to bulgaria and romania to join the european bloc in 2007 , but with conditions .

none came the other way german soccer clubs have reported mixed results in attempts to recruit foreign talent for the upcoming 2006-2007 season . the annual off-season player shuffle has seen some of germany 's major soccer clubs unable to recruit several highly sought-after foreign players . this means the german clubs will have to rely on home-grown talent to take them through the 2006-2007 season , which they argue is worth supporting . nine of the 11 players who took germany to the semi-finals of the world cup on home soil will be lining up for german bundesliga clubs when the season kicks off next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch soccer player ruud van nistelrooy at soccer practice however , champions bayern munich have failed to recruit dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy , after the bavarian club fell short of manchester united 's asking price . van nistelrooy will now be representing real madrid after the club offered around 16 million euros -lrb- $ 20.5 million -rrb- for his signature on the dotted line . bayern general manager uli hoeness said that the club chose to drop out of the bidding war for van nistelrooy since the asking price for the player would have been ' ' against bayern 's philosophy . " italian club juventus was taxed of some of its elite players following a match-fixing debacle and subsequent club relegation .
however , few of these players were relocated to germany . ballack to britain german soccer star , michael ballack transferred from bayern to wealthy english premiership champions chelsea , which has diminished the star quality of the bundesliga . some german clubs , however , have successfully attracted foreign talent . sv hamburg landed dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart ahead of last season but failed this summer in a bid to recruit milan baros , the czech international striker who was top scorer at euro 2004 .
baros will be staying with premiership side aston villa . hamburg also succeeded bringing in vincent kompany , the highly rated 20-year-old anderlecht centerback , for eight million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander frei after scoring a goal at the 2006 world cup borussia dortmund has landed swiss alexander frei from french club rennes in a deal worth four million euros . frei has already shown his worth , with the striker scoring four goals in 45 minutes in a game against a local giessen team .
dortmund went on to win 13-0 . stayed in the bundesliga most of the summer transfers in germany involved moves between bundesliga clubs .
belgian centre-back daniel van buyten , has traded in his hamburg uniform for bayern 's and peruvian striker paolo guerrero went in the opposite direction . dortmund meanwhile bought nelson valdez , the paraguayan striker from bremen to partner frei . only ballack , and goalkeeper jens lehmann , who remains at premiership club arsenal , will play abroad . miroslav klose , the top scorer at the world cup , has said he is staying with werder bremen - at least for another season - while bayern bought lukas podolski , the 21-year-old forward who collected the best young player award at the world cup , from relegated fc cologne . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga teams beat up local competition spoiled by first-class soccer during the world cup , fans could be left wondering what happened to the stars after this week 's bundesliga test matches .

this is because of being already integrated in a much broader community . " besides time to tackle deeply rooted problems bulgaria needs a break from the bad old days , she said - not only the communist era , but also the difficult transition years of the 1990s .
the decade was marked by government shuffles , flip-flopping policies , and in 1997 an inflation rate that reached 240 percent , triggering mass protests and the downfall of another government . " those who actually brought the country to this very unfortunate stage in the 1990s have been outcast from public opinion , " she said .

it 's not fair . " that is why eu programs such as " erasmus " are important , in which students get financial assistance to spend a semester abroad .
bulgarians already have access to these stipends , although the country is not a full eu member yet . what would happen , though , if bulgaria does not reach its goal of eu accession on jan.1 , 2007 ?
kuneva only smiled , saying she firmly believes the country with meet its target date .
besides , a big eu party has already been planned in her electoral district , ruse . it might be that the eu commission in september will decide to push bulgaria 's accession date back a year .

along with romania , bulgaria could join as early as january 2007 although there are still hurdles .

" we are dreaming of a better life and this is a great vehicle for trying to get better and better every single day . " kuneva , 49 , said that while bulgaria has come a long way since it was a satellite state of the soviet union , her generation will likely not be the ones who really benefit from the ground-breaking changes that her country has seen since it shook one-party rule in 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meglena kuneva " i do n't believe that those people who are in the middle of their lives could easily harvest the fruits , " she said . but she said it is the next generation , the children of her peers , including her own son , who will really become a part of europe .
according to her , they already feel like europeans , having a sense of curiosity and liberty that many of their parents lack . " if we compare this generation with the one before the 90s , the difference is dramatic , " she said . hurdles to overcome but bulgaria still faces big challenges that are giving the european commission cause for concern and could prove a stumbling block to a 2007 accession date .
the eu has chided the country for its rampant corruption , several unsolved contract killings and a fight against money laundering many consider overly feeble .
kuneva said that bulgaria has some catching up to do , but stressed that progress has been made . " we have many successful cases against money laundering , " she said .
" well , many means four .
this is because of being already integrated in a much broader community . " besides time to tackle deeply rooted problems bulgaria needs a break from the bad old days , she said - not only the communist era , but also the difficult transition years of the 1990s .
the decade was marked by government shuffles , flip-flopping policies , and in 1997 an inflation rate that reached 240 percent , triggering mass protests and the downfall of another government . " those who actually brought the country to this very unfortunate stage in the 1990s have been outcast from public opinion , " she said .
" they have never regained the public 's confidence . " new blood n eeded kuneva said she hopes the old guard is replaced by qualified politicians - especially younger ones - who are ready to take on positions of responsibility in sofia .
that could be made all the more difficult due to bulgaria 's continuing problem with brain drain , in which highly skilled people leave the country in search of more lucrative opportunities abroad .
she said it 's important to improve conditions at home instead of simply making it harder for people to leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accession could take place on jan .

" i do n't believe that with restriction , we could keep people at home .
it 's not fair . " that is why eu programs such as " erasmus " are important , in which students get financial assistance to spend a semester abroad .
bulgarians already have access to these stipends , although the country is not a full eu member yet . what would happen , though , if bulgaria does not reach its goal of eu accession on jan.1 , 2007 ?
kuneva only smiled , saying she firmly believes the country with meet its target date .
besides , a big eu party has already been planned in her electoral district , ruse . it might be that the eu commission in september will decide to push bulgaria 's accession date back a year .

along with romania , bulgaria could join as early as january 2007 although there are still hurdles .
kuneva says she 's optimistic . herself small in physical size , minister for european affairs meglena kuneva likes to talk about confidence and the need for people to have a little more of it regarding bulgaria .
at the same time , her tone does n't come across as one of arrogance . " i think that the desire to be better is there , " she said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we are dreaming of a better life and this is a great vehicle for trying to get better and better every single day . " kuneva , 49 , said that while bulgaria has come a long way since it was a satellite state of the soviet union , her generation will likely not be the ones who really benefit from the ground-breaking changes that her country has seen since it shook one-party rule in 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meglena kuneva " i do n't believe that those people who are in the middle of their lives could easily harvest the fruits , " she said . but she said it is the next generation , the children of her peers , including her own son , who will really become a part of europe .
according to her , they already feel like europeans , having a sense of curiosity and liberty that many of their parents lack . " if we compare this generation with the one before the 90s , the difference is dramatic , " she said . hurdles to overcome but bulgaria still faces big challenges that are giving the european commission cause for concern and could prove a stumbling block to a 2007 accession date .
the eu has chided the country for its rampant corruption , several unsolved contract killings and a fight against money laundering many consider overly feeble .
kuneva said that bulgaria has some catching up to do , but stressed that progress has been made . " we have many successful cases against money laundering , " she said .
" well , many means four .
this is because of being already integrated in a much broader community . " besides time to tackle deeply rooted problems bulgaria needs a break from the bad old days , she said - not only the communist era , but also the difficult transition years of the 1990s .
the decade was marked by government shuffles , flip-flopping policies , and in 1997 an inflation rate that reached 240 percent , triggering mass protests and the downfall of another government . " those who actually brought the country to this very unfortunate stage in the 1990s have been outcast from public opinion , " she said .
" they have never regained the public 's confidence . " new blood n eeded kuneva said she hopes the old guard is replaced by qualified politicians - especially younger ones - who are ready to take on positions of responsibility in sofia .
that could be made all the more difficult due to bulgaria 's continuing problem with brain drain , in which highly skilled people leave the country in search of more lucrative opportunities abroad .
she said it 's important to improve conditions at home instead of simply making it harder for people to leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accession could take place on jan .
1 , 2007 " i think that we could rely on having our best people at home if they are confident that they could go and come back , " she said .
" i do n't believe that with restriction , we could keep people at home .
it 's not fair . " that is why eu programs such as " erasmus " are important , in which students get financial assistance to spend a semester abroad .
bulgarians already have access to these stipends , although the country is not a full eu member yet . what would happen , though , if bulgaria does not reach its goal of eu accession on jan.1 , 2007 ?
kuneva only smiled , saying she firmly believes the country with meet its target date .
besides , a big eu party has already been planned in her electoral district , ruse . it might be that the eu commission in september will decide to push bulgaria 's accession date back a year .

along with romania , bulgaria could join as early as january 2007 although there are still hurdles .
kuneva says she 's optimistic . herself small in physical size , minister for european affairs meglena kuneva likes to talk about confidence and the need for people to have a little more of it regarding bulgaria .
at the same time , her tone does n't come across as one of arrogance . " i think that the desire to be better is there , " she said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we are dreaming of a better life and this is a great vehicle for trying to get better and better every single day . " kuneva , 49 , said that while bulgaria has come a long way since it was a satellite state of the soviet union , her generation will likely not be the ones who really benefit from the ground-breaking changes that her country has seen since it shook one-party rule in 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meglena kuneva " i do n't believe that those people who are in the middle of their lives could easily harvest the fruits , " she said . but she said it is the next generation , the children of her peers , including her own son , who will really become a part of europe .
according to her , they already feel like europeans , having a sense of curiosity and liberty that many of their parents lack . " if we compare this generation with the one before the 90s , the difference is dramatic , " she said . hurdles to overcome but bulgaria still faces big challenges that are giving the european commission cause for concern and could prove a stumbling block to a 2007 accession date .
the eu has chided the country for its rampant corruption , several unsolved contract killings and a fight against money laundering many consider overly feeble .
kuneva said that bulgaria has some catching up to do , but stressed that progress has been made . " we have many successful cases against money laundering , " she said .
" well , many means four .
this is because of being already integrated in a much broader community . " besides time to tackle deeply rooted problems bulgaria needs a break from the bad old days , she said - not only the communist era , but also the difficult transition years of the 1990s .
the decade was marked by government shuffles , flip-flopping policies , and in 1997 an inflation rate that reached 240 percent , triggering mass protests and the downfall of another government . " those who actually brought the country to this very unfortunate stage in the 1990s have been outcast from public opinion , " she said .
" they have never regained the public 's confidence . " new blood n eeded kuneva said she hopes the old guard is replaced by qualified politicians - especially younger ones - who are ready to take on positions of responsibility in sofia .
that could be made all the more difficult due to bulgaria 's continuing problem with brain drain , in which highly skilled people leave the country in search of more lucrative opportunities abroad .
she said it 's important to improve conditions at home instead of simply making it harder for people to leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accession could take place on jan .
1 , 2007 " i think that we could rely on having our best people at home if they are confident that they could go and come back , " she said .
" i do n't believe that with restriction , we could keep people at home .
it 's not fair . " that is why eu programs such as " erasmus " are important , in which students get financial assistance to spend a semester abroad .
bulgarians already have access to these stipends , although the country is not a full eu member yet . what would happen , though , if bulgaria does not reach its goal of eu accession on jan.1 , 2007 ?
kuneva only smiled , saying she firmly believes the country with meet its target date .
besides , a big eu party has already been planned in her electoral district , ruse . it might be that the eu commission in september will decide to push bulgaria 's accession date back a year .
no , kuneva said , there 's no plan b in case that happens .
but , she added , it wo n't . klaus dahmann -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de way open for bulgaria , romania to join eu the european parliament has given the thumbs-up to bulgaria and romania to join the european bloc in 2007 , but with conditions .

“ that is a recipe for more confrontation , " he said . lebanon 's prime minister fouad siniora said the draft was " not adequate . " " full " but not " immediate " cessation of hostilities the draft demands a " full cessation of hostilities based upon , in particular , the immediate cessation by hezbollah of all attacks and the immediate cessation by israel of all offensive military operations . "
the most glaring omission from the text is the statement pushed for by france which called for an “ immediate cessation of hostilities . " bildunterschrift : us ambassador john bolton welcomed the draft however , the us also appears to have compromised , with a preferred phrase explicitly demanding the return of the captured israeli soldiers also missing from the text . the text received positive responses from other members of the 15-member security council which indicated a possible ratification at next week ’ s vote .
a second resolution would be needed later to authorise an international peacekeeping force for southern lebanon to keep the peace instigated by the first . the white house said sunday that it hoped for a vote on a un resolution shaping an international force for lebanon in " days , not weeks " and for a deployment as quickly as possible after that . us ambassador to the un john bolton said the security council meeting on saturday was " very productive . ” " we received a lot of encouraging comments on the draft text , " he said , while us president george w. bush was “ happy with the progress being made ” but also “ under no illusions ” as to the impact it may have , british prime minister tony blair welcomed the tabling of the resolution . " the priority now is to get the resolution adopted as soon as possible and then to work for a permanent ceasefire and achieve the conditions in lebanon and israel which will prevent a recurrence , ” he told reporters . german chancellor angela merkel praised the french-us draft un resolution , calling it " an important step towards a halt in military operations . " " the accord on a resolution for the middle east is a strong signal by the international community to the parties involved in the conflict , " merkel was quoted by a government spokesman as saying . israel continues with devastating air strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli war planes pounded southern lebanon early sunday despite the progress at the un , israel continued its bombardment of southern lebanon as the security council welcomed the breakthrough ; an air-raid on the village of ansar killing five civilians early on sunday to further extend the hostilities that began three weeks ago after hezbollah militants captured two israeli soldiers . israeli tourism minister isaac herzog said the israeli army would " continue to act " until the resolution was enforced . more israeli air strikes were reported on roads on the eastern beka ’ a valley and on bridges in the north of the country . there were also indications that israel was preparing for further land operations within lebanon with israeli planes dropping leaflets on the lebanese city of sidon , warning people there to leave . the israeli defense force said it intended to attack hezbollah rocket-launching sites in the area and wanted to avoid civilian casualties . commando raids and increasing civilian casualties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ground offensive goes on israeli commandos also hit the coastal port of tyre in a raid on a hezbollah position .
heavy fighting left several militants dead and eight israeli troops wounded , the israeli army said , while hezbollah said it repelled the raid . in other developments , syria – which has its own army on the highest level of readiness – sent a letter to the un accusing israel of intentionally bombing a lebanese village close to the syrian border on friday , killing 28 people , most of whom were syrians . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german defense ministry rules out mid-east troop deployment germany 's defence ministry has ruled out contributing troops to a proposed international military force for south lebanon , despite calls by the israeli prime minister for german participation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.08.2006 german job seekers find life-changing opportunities abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobs abroad are for some an alternative to chronic unemployment in germany architect daniel lambart worked in africa for four years .
he and others who have bad luck on the tight german job market are finding jobs , and the experience of a lifetime , abroad .
many return , some stay on for good . this year alone , some 145,000 germans packed up and left home , the highest number in 50 years .
two thirds of the émigrés went abroad for career reasons and most of these because their options were slim on the job market at home . " i saw that the market did n't offer me the possibilities i would have liked and i tried to find a job in other european countries , but that did n't work out either , " said architect daniel lambart . alternatives to unemployment in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's unemployment hovers above 8 percent while many are fleeing unemployment in germany , the agency for employment abroad -lrb- zav -rrb- in bonn has plenty of work on its hands .
job seekers from practically every sector are turning to this branch of the federal employment agency in an effort to try their chances across the border . last year the zav placed 13,000 germans in jobs abroad .
handcraft and gastronomy profession have the highest demand , though chances are also good for engineers . for older job seekers , a position abroad is sometimes the last prospect available .
in switzerland and the netherlands , for example , job experience is valued more than having the most up-to-date specialized knowledge , unlike in germany . nearly 40 percent of the people placed by zav are over the age of 40 , which can be considered " old " on the german job market . over 75 percent of the foreign job placements are in europe .
job seekers who venture off the continent tend to prefer canada and australia . many return sooner or later those germans who decide to pack their suitcases , learn a new language and explore a new culture are n't necessarily gone for good , said zav spokesperson sabine seidler . " the majority of opportunities involve temporary job contracts for a longer period of time .
there are some that say , i 'll stay .
but , in general , coming back is part of the deal , " added seidler . for many , a major motivation to emigrate is to improve their chances of finding a better job when they return .
that was the case for architect daniel lambart , who took a position with the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- in togo , despite original plans to stay in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty percent of job placements abroad are for job seekers over 40 " the people around me could n't really understand it , " said lambart .
" but i did n't let myself get misled and took my own path .
especially since the contract was only for one year and i saw it as an opportunity , not as some kind of challenge with lots of risks attached . " flexibility is key making the decision to go was only the first step .
then lambart had to arrange for insurance , get vaccinated and study up on his new country .
he had the advantage that he already spoke french , togo 's official language . " on the one hand , you have to be ambitious , but you also have to like the challenge and feel a sense of adventure , " said lambart .
zav 's seidler agreed that it 's most important to approach the move with the right attitude and to transition into the new culture with as much flexibility as possible . lambart settled into life in togo so well that he extended his contract with the german development service for another year , and then again for two additional years in chad in central africa . " most people give positive feedback and are glad that they did it , simply because it 's such an exciting time .

many return , some stay on for good . this year alone , some 145,000 germans packed up and left home , the highest number in 50 years .
two thirds of the émigrés went abroad for career reasons and most of these because their options were slim on the job market at home .

handcraft and gastronomy profession have the highest demand , though chances are also good for engineers . for older job seekers , a position abroad is sometimes the last prospect available .
in switzerland and the netherlands , for example , job experience is valued more than having the most up-to-date specialized knowledge , unlike in germany . nearly 40 percent of the people placed by zav are over the age of 40 , which can be considered " old " on the german job market . over 75 percent of the foreign job placements are in europe .

then lambart had to arrange for insurance , get vaccinated and study up on his new country .
he had the advantage that he already spoke french , togo 's official language . " on the one hand , you have to be ambitious , but you also have to like the challenge and feel a sense of adventure , " said lambart .
zav 's seidler agreed that it 's most important to approach the move with the right attitude and to transition into the new culture with as much flexibility as possible . lambart settled into life in togo so well that he extended his contract with the german development service for another year , and then again for two additional years in chad in central africa .

the publication , by tim berners-lee , began the spread of computer interaction that has lead to the web as we know it .
there are now 882 million people around the world online reading more than 100 million websites , and with each website offering potentially millions of pages of content .
to mark the birthday we 've drawn together a panel of web-users from across the world , to give us their thoughts on the birth , the worst , and the future of the web .
today 's question to the panel : what do you not like about the internet and the online world ?
joe annapolis , usa " i do not think anything is wrong with the web " karen prague , czech rep " websites out there have no thought for aesthetics ! "
david tehran , iran " the restriction or blocking of seemingly uncontroversial sites " gabriel lusaka , zambia " internet fraud , which has hit innocent people " elson campinas , brazil " the negative points are too small and insignificant " gail seoul , south korea " the lack of credibility that information has " click here to read the panel 's response to friday 's question click here to read the panel 's response to saturday 's question have your say : how has the internet changed your life ?
joe dynamo , annapolis , usa joe used to live in a school bus , now he 's an it consultant what is wrong with the internet is websites limiting people 's expression .
i do not think anything is wrong with the " web " actually .
the web is a place where people are communicating so it will exhibit the same behaviour that any community will .
you have all kinds out there , just as we do in the world .
i think many times people forget to look at the " web " and try to place blame for the bad things that occur there .
the things that happen on the web are just the same things that happen in societies .
people somehow try to remove personal responsibility from things by blaming them on some force of nature , in this case the " web " .
if there is a pervert in a town attacking women in parks do you make it impossible for people to use the parks , or do you try to catch the criminal ?
is it the parks fault ?
click here to return gabriel kalonde chingwe , lusaka , zambia gabriel is a fan of bbc africa have your say due to certain techniques and failures , i do not like the way anyone can access sites which are designed to corrupt morals or gambling sites which are able to bankrupt you within seconds , remotely .
the internet has also condoned a lot of fraud which has hit the most innocent of people and deprived them of their hard earned savings .
and unsolicited mail , popularly known as spam , is just so upsetting !
even with high firewalls and other security measures , the spammer is always a step ahead .
thus we have to live with it .
scammers on the net sending fake messages , swindling people all over the world and claiming they have won millions of dollars if they give out personal details , are very vexing .
some advice : just delete it .
do n't waste time even contemplating if it 's genuine .
the bbc recently had a discussion on scammers which was very interesting and educative -lrb- please check the archives for you to listen free at your own time -rrb- , get busy , get online !
click here to return karen inda , prague , czech republic karen and her husband run their business from laptops obviously , junk e-mail is a major problem .
when we are travelling with the business , we depend on internet cafes to check on sales and answer customer queries .
since we get about five hundred junk e-mail messages per day , it is absolutely necessary to use our own laptop , which has multiple filters and junk folders .
if the internet café wo n't allow us to hook up our own laptop , we have to either find another café or sift through piles of junk to find the legitimate messages .
we 've tried using our isp 's filtration system , but it tends to inadvertently block legitimate e-mails , which is bad for business .
aside from junk e-mail , the main things i dislike about the internet are pop-up ads and banner ads that move or flash .
i find them incredibly distracting when i 'm trying to read or work .
people all over the world expect instantaneous responses !
also , many websites out there are so ugly !
there is often no thought given to the aesthetics of the site , and some even take the windows " look " -lrb- which is hideous enough -rrb- and add it to their own sites .
mac users cringe when they see this !
having an on-line business means that people all over the world expect instantaneous responses .
combine this with living and travelling in many different time zones and our " office hours " never end !
click here to return elson silva , phd , campinas , brazil elson researches hydro- and thermo-dynamics online likes and dislikes are part of the way that all humans have to learn to see the world .
everything and everyone has a good side and a bad side .
happiness always develops higher when people learn to enjoy the good side and stand the bad side in the best way possible .
tolerance and understanding is the best recipe to endure the bad side that always should bother less and less .
all the negative points of the internet are too small and insignificant to bother my mood and let me enjoy the huge advantage i can have on the good side .
a few strokes to delete a spam or removing the ad-ware occasionally is like a common routine of washing my car to keep it clean or dusting off my shoes .
so few people need to hate their tasks of keeping their cars and shoes in good shape .
it 's all part of a necessary routine .
click here to return david mohammad yaghoobi , tehran , iran david runs a blog and a business from tehran the things i dislike about the web , though not necessarily in this order , are : 1 .

the publication , by tim berners-lee , began the spread of computer interaction that has lead to the web as we know it .
there are now 882 million people around the world online reading more than 100 million websites , and with each website offering potentially millions of pages of content .
to mark the birthday we 've drawn together a panel of web-users from across the world , to give us their thoughts on the birth , the worst , and the future of the web .
today 's question to the panel : what do you not like about the internet and the online world ?
joe annapolis , usa " i do not think anything is wrong with the web " karen prague , czech rep " websites out there have no thought for aesthetics ! "
david tehran , iran " the restriction or blocking of seemingly uncontroversial sites " gabriel lusaka , zambia " internet fraud , which has hit innocent people " elson campinas , brazil " the negative points are too small and insignificant " gail seoul , south korea " the lack of credibility that information has " click here to read the panel 's response to friday 's question click here to read the panel 's response to saturday 's question have your say : how has the internet changed your life ?
joe dynamo , annapolis , usa joe used to live in a school bus , now he 's an it consultant what is wrong with the internet is websites limiting people 's expression .
i do not think anything is wrong with the " web " actually .
the web is a place where people are communicating so it will exhibit the same behaviour that any community will .
you have all kinds out there , just as we do in the world .
i think many times people forget to look at the " web " and try to place blame for the bad things that occur there .
the things that happen on the web are just the same things that happen in societies .
people somehow try to remove personal responsibility from things by blaming them on some force of nature , in this case the " web " .

the internet has also condoned a lot of fraud which has hit the most innocent of people and deprived them of their hard earned savings .
and unsolicited mail , popularly known as spam , is just so upsetting !
even with high firewalls and other security measures , the spammer is always a step ahead .
thus we have to live with it .
scammers on the net sending fake messages , swindling people all over the world and claiming they have won millions of dollars if they give out personal details , are very vexing .
some advice : just delete it .
do n't waste time even contemplating if it 's genuine .

click here to return karen inda , prague , czech republic karen and her husband run their business from laptops obviously , junk e-mail is a major problem .
when we are travelling with the business , we depend on internet cafes to check on sales and answer customer queries .
since we get about five hundred junk e-mail messages per day , it is absolutely necessary to use our own laptop , which has multiple filters and junk folders .
if the internet café wo n't allow us to hook up our own laptop , we have to either find another café or sift through piles of junk to find the legitimate messages .
we 've tried using our isp 's filtration system , but it tends to inadvertently block legitimate e-mails , which is bad for business .
aside from junk e-mail , the main things i dislike about the internet are pop-up ads and banner ads that move or flash .
i find them incredibly distracting when i 'm trying to read or work .
people all over the world expect instantaneous responses !
also , many websites out there are so ugly !
there is often no thought given to the aesthetics of the site , and some even take the windows " look " -lrb- which is hideous enough -rrb- and add it to their own sites .
mac users cringe when they see this !
having an on-line business means that people all over the world expect instantaneous responses .

a few strokes to delete a spam or removing the ad-ware occasionally is like a common routine of washing my car to keep it clean or dusting off my shoes .

the publication , by tim berners-lee , began the spread of computer interaction that has lead to the web as we know it .
there are now 882 million people around the world online reading more than 100 million websites , and with each website offering potentially millions of pages of content .
to mark the birthday we 've drawn together a panel of web-users from across the world , to give us their thoughts on the birth , the worst , and the future of the web .
today 's question to the panel : what do you not like about the internet and the online world ?
joe annapolis , usa " i do not think anything is wrong with the web " karen prague , czech rep " websites out there have no thought for aesthetics ! "
david tehran , iran " the restriction or blocking of seemingly uncontroversial sites " gabriel lusaka , zambia " internet fraud , which has hit innocent people " elson campinas , brazil " the negative points are too small and insignificant " gail seoul , south korea " the lack of credibility that information has " click here to read the panel 's response to friday 's question click here to read the panel 's response to saturday 's question have your say : how has the internet changed your life ?
joe dynamo , annapolis , usa joe used to live in a school bus , now he 's an it consultant what is wrong with the internet is websites limiting people 's expression .
i do not think anything is wrong with the " web " actually .
the web is a place where people are communicating so it will exhibit the same behaviour that any community will .
you have all kinds out there , just as we do in the world .
i think many times people forget to look at the " web " and try to place blame for the bad things that occur there .
the things that happen on the web are just the same things that happen in societies .
people somehow try to remove personal responsibility from things by blaming them on some force of nature , in this case the " web " .
if there is a pervert in a town attacking women in parks do you make it impossible for people to use the parks , or do you try to catch the criminal ?
is it the parks fault ?
click here to return gabriel kalonde chingwe , lusaka , zambia gabriel is a fan of bbc africa have your say due to certain techniques and failures , i do not like the way anyone can access sites which are designed to corrupt morals or gambling sites which are able to bankrupt you within seconds , remotely .
the internet has also condoned a lot of fraud which has hit the most innocent of people and deprived them of their hard earned savings .
and unsolicited mail , popularly known as spam , is just so upsetting !
even with high firewalls and other security measures , the spammer is always a step ahead .
thus we have to live with it .
scammers on the net sending fake messages , swindling people all over the world and claiming they have won millions of dollars if they give out personal details , are very vexing .
some advice : just delete it .
do n't waste time even contemplating if it 's genuine .
the bbc recently had a discussion on scammers which was very interesting and educative -lrb- please check the archives for you to listen free at your own time -rrb- , get busy , get online !
click here to return karen inda , prague , czech republic karen and her husband run their business from laptops obviously , junk e-mail is a major problem .
when we are travelling with the business , we depend on internet cafes to check on sales and answer customer queries .
since we get about five hundred junk e-mail messages per day , it is absolutely necessary to use our own laptop , which has multiple filters and junk folders .
if the internet café wo n't allow us to hook up our own laptop , we have to either find another café or sift through piles of junk to find the legitimate messages .
we 've tried using our isp 's filtration system , but it tends to inadvertently block legitimate e-mails , which is bad for business .
aside from junk e-mail , the main things i dislike about the internet are pop-up ads and banner ads that move or flash .
i find them incredibly distracting when i 'm trying to read or work .
people all over the world expect instantaneous responses !
also , many websites out there are so ugly !
there is often no thought given to the aesthetics of the site , and some even take the windows " look " -lrb- which is hideous enough -rrb- and add it to their own sites .
mac users cringe when they see this !
having an on-line business means that people all over the world expect instantaneous responses .
combine this with living and travelling in many different time zones and our " office hours " never end !

everything and everyone has a good side and a bad side .
happiness always develops higher when people learn to enjoy the good side and stand the bad side in the best way possible .
tolerance and understanding is the best recipe to endure the bad side that always should bother less and less .
all the negative points of the internet are too small and insignificant to bother my mood and let me enjoy the huge advantage i can have on the good side .
a few strokes to delete a spam or removing the ad-ware occasionally is like a common routine of washing my car to keep it clean or dusting off my shoes .
so few people need to hate their tasks of keeping their cars and shoes in good shape .
it 's all part of a necessary routine .
click here to return david mohammad yaghoobi , tehran , iran david runs a blog and a business from tehran the things i dislike about the web , though not necessarily in this order , are : 1 .
deleting dozens of spam e-mails each day from around 10 e-mail accounts is a tedious affair that consumes far too much time .
having to decipher from the title as to whether i am being sold " viagra " or offered dubious investment opportunities is a daily pain .
2 .
as an occasional designer of websites i detest having to build around internet explorer 's backward display methods .
it is ever so tiring to make so many exceptions for this dominant browser .
3 .
having recently regressed back to not quite 56kps in a not-to-recent move from the uk to iran , i have been frustrated with the additional time now needed to access sites and e-mails .
coupled with the restriction and / or blocking of seemingly uncontroversial sites with the american-made , iranian filtering system my browsing experience is stunted - dare i go on ?
thankfully , i have once again regained adsl -lrb- at no small expense -rrb- and thus the threshold of available media has increased where not restricted .
click here to return gail , seoul , south korea gail is a lifestyle and travel writer , based in seoul i dislike the lack of credibility that a lot of information on the internet has .
anyone can publish anything and make it look kosher - ethics , editorial integrity and accuracy are not highly prized features of the world wide web and there is an awful lot of nonsense out there .
but i think the internet mirrors every walk of life , where marketing is so strong now that you have to be extremely selective in what you choose to trust as the real thing .
to balance this , i like the way that you can check things with people very quickly by e-mail and look on other sites to verify what you find .
editorial integrity and accuracy are not highly prized features of the web my top three scary thoughts about the internet are : 1 .
the creeps that lurk there preying on young kids -lrb- often making it into the virtual environment of their bedrooms -rrb- .
2 .
i am worried that one day someone will steal my identity and ruin my life .
3 .
i hate spyware .
i am certain that all big corporations are stealing information on my decisions and i do not think that this is their information to take .

when we are travelling with the business , we depend on internet cafes to check on sales and answer customer queries .
since we get about five hundred junk e-mail messages per day , it is absolutely necessary to use our own laptop , which has multiple filters and junk folders .
if the internet café wo n't allow us to hook up our own laptop , we have to either find another café or sift through piles of junk to find the legitimate messages .
we 've tried using our isp 's filtration system , but it tends to inadvertently block legitimate e-mails , which is bad for business .
aside from junk e-mail , the main things i dislike about the internet are pop-up ads and banner ads that move or flash .
i find them incredibly distracting when i 'm trying to read or work .
people all over the world expect instantaneous responses !
also , many websites out there are so ugly !
there is often no thought given to the aesthetics of the site , and some even take the windows " look " -lrb- which is hideous enough -rrb- and add it to their own sites .
mac users cringe when they see this !
having an on-line business means that people all over the world expect instantaneous responses .
combine this with living and travelling in many different time zones and our " office hours " never end !

everything and everyone has a good side and a bad side .
happiness always develops higher when people learn to enjoy the good side and stand the bad side in the best way possible .
tolerance and understanding is the best recipe to endure the bad side that always should bother less and less .
all the negative points of the internet are too small and insignificant to bother my mood and let me enjoy the huge advantage i can have on the good side .
a few strokes to delete a spam or removing the ad-ware occasionally is like a common routine of washing my car to keep it clean or dusting off my shoes .

the publication , by tim berners-lee , began the spread of computer interaction that has lead to the web as we know it .
there are now 882 million people around the world online reading more than 100 million websites , and with each website offering potentially millions of pages of content .
to mark the birthday we 've drawn together a panel of web-users from across the world , to give us their thoughts on the birth , the worst , and the future of the web .
today 's question to the panel : what do you not like about the internet and the online world ?

joe dynamo , annapolis , usa joe used to live in a school bus , now he 's an it consultant what is wrong with the internet is websites limiting people 's expression .
i do not think anything is wrong with the " web " actually .
the web is a place where people are communicating so it will exhibit the same behaviour that any community will .
you have all kinds out there , just as we do in the world .
i think many times people forget to look at the " web " and try to place blame for the bad things that occur there .
the things that happen on the web are just the same things that happen in societies .
people somehow try to remove personal responsibility from things by blaming them on some force of nature , in this case the " web " .

and unsolicited mail , popularly known as spam , is just so upsetting !
even with high firewalls and other security measures , the spammer is always a step ahead .
thus we have to live with it .
scammers on the net sending fake messages , swindling people all over the world and claiming they have won millions of dollars if they give out personal details , are very vexing .
some advice : just delete it .
do n't waste time even contemplating if it 's genuine .

bbc news -pipe- have your say -pipe- readers ' panel : web anniversary bbc news / have your say graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- sunday , 6 august 2006 , 07:04 gmt 08:04 uk readers ' panel : web anniversary sunday 6 august marks the 15th anniversary of the publication of computer files credited as the start of the world wide web .
the publication , by tim berners-lee , began the spread of computer interaction that has lead to the web as we know it .
there are now 882 million people around the world online reading more than 100 million websites , and with each website offering potentially millions of pages of content .
to mark the birthday we 've drawn together a panel of web-users from across the world , to give us their thoughts on the birth , the worst , and the future of the web .
today 's question to the panel : what do you not like about the internet and the online world ?
joe annapolis , usa karen prague , czech rep david tehran , iran gabriel lusaka , zambia elson campinas , brazil gail seoul , south korea click here to read the panel 's response to friday 's question click here to read the panel 's response to saturday 's question have your say : how has the internet changed your life ?
joe dynamo , annapolis , usa " what is wrong with the internet is websites limiting people 's expression .
i do not think anything is wrong with the " web " actually .
the web is a place where people are communicating so it will exhibit the same behaviour that any community will .
you have all kinds out there , just as we do in the world .
i think many times people forget to look at the " web " and try to place blame for the bad things that occur there .
the things that happen on the web are just the same things that happen in societies .
people somehow try to remove personal responsibility from things by blaming them on some force of nature , in this case the " web " .
if there is a pervert in a town attacking women in parks do you make it impossible for people to use the parks , or do you try to catch the criminal ?
is it the parks fault ? "
gabriel kalonde chingwe , lusaka , zambia " due to certain techniques and failures , i do not like the way anyone can access sites which are designed to corrupt morals or gambling sites which are able to bankrupt you within seconds , remotely .
the internet has also condoned a lot of fraud which has hit the most innocent of people and deprived them of their hard earned savings .
and unsolicited mail , popularly known as spam , is just so upsetting !
even with high firewalls and other security measures , the spammer is always a step ahead .
thus we have to live with it .
scammers on the net sending fake messages , swindling people all over the world and claiming they have won millions of dollars if they give out personal details , are very vexing .
some advice : just delete it .
do n't waste time even contemplating if it 's genuine .
the bbc recently had a discussion on scammers which was very interesting and educative -lrb- please check the archives for you to listen free at your own time -rrb- , get busy , get online ! "
karen inda , prague , czech republic " obviously , junk e-mail is a major problem .
when we are travelling with the business , we depend on internet cafes to check on sales and answer customer queries .
since we get about five hundred junk e-mail messages per day , it is absolutely necessary to use our own laptop , which has multiple filters and junk folders .
if the internet café wo n't allow us to hook up our own laptop , we have to either find another café or sift through piles of junk to find the legitimate messages .
we 've tried using our isp 's filtration system , but it tends to inadvertently block legitimate e-mails , which is bad for business .
aside from junk e-mail , the main things i dislike about the internet are pop-up ads and banner ads that move or flash .
i find them incredibly distracting when i 'm trying to read or work . "
people all over the world expect instantaneous responses ! "
also , many websites out there are so ugly !
there is often no thought given to the aesthetics of the site , and some even take the windows " look " -lrb- which is hideous enough -rrb- and add it to their own sites .
mac users cringe when they see this !
having an on-line business means that people all over the world expect instantaneous responses .
combine this with living and travelling in many different time zones and our " office hours " never end ! "
elson silva , phd , campinas , brazil " likes and dislikes are part of the way that all humans have to learn to see the world .
everything and everyone has a good side and a bad side .
happiness always develops higher when people learn to enjoy the good side and stand the bad side in the best way possible .
tolerance and understanding is the best recipe to endure the bad side that always should bother less and less .
all the negative points of the internet are too small and insignificant to bother my mood and let me enjoy the huge advantage i can have on the good side .
a few strokes to delete a spam or removing the ad-ware occasionally is like a common routine of washing my car to keep it clean or dusting off my shoes .
so few people need to hate their tasks of keeping their cars and shoes in good shape .
it 's all part of a necessary routine . "
david mohammad yaghoobi , tehran , iran " the things i dislike about the web , though not necessarily in this order , are : 1 .
deleting dozens of spam e-mails each day from around 10 e-mail accounts is a tedious affair that consumes far too much time .
having to decipher from the title as to whether i am being sold " viagra " or offered dubious investment opportunities is a daily pain .
2 .
as an occasional designer of websites i detest having to build around internet explorer 's backward display methods .
it is ever so tiring to make so many exceptions for this dominant browser .
3 .
having recently regressed back to not quite 56kps in a not-to-recent move from the uk to iran , i have been frustrated with the additional time now needed to access sites and e-mails .
coupled with the restriction and / or blocking of seemingly uncontroversial sites with the american-made , iranian filtering system my browsing experience is stunted - dare i go on ?
thankfully , i have once again regained adsl -lrb- at no small expense -rrb- and thus the threshold of available media has increased where not restricted . "
gail , seoul , south korea " i dislike the lack of credibility that a lot of information on the internet has .
anyone can publish anything and make it look kosher - ethics , editorial integrity and accuracy are not highly prized features of the world wide web and there is an awful lot of nonsense out there .
but i think the internet mirrors every walk of life , where marketing is so strong now that you have to be extremely selective in what you choose to trust as the real thing .
to balance this , i like the way that you can check things with people very quickly by e-mail and look on other sites to verify what you find . "
editorial integrity and accuracy are not highly prized features of the web " my top three scary thoughts about the internet are : 1 .

2 .
i am worried that one day someone will steal my identity and ruin my life .
3 .
i hate spyware .
i am certain that all big corporations are stealing information on my decisions and i do not think that this is their information to take . "

the wwf is looking to train up to 14 volunteers to help monitor dormice numbers in woods in the wye valley .
rosie cliffe , who is running the programme , said they may not be fierce but can be quick : " handling dormice can be a pretty nerve-wracking experience .
" if you 're lucky you 'll find them in their sleepy phase when they 're a doddle to handle . "
" but in the summer , when there 's plenty to eat , they 're far from asleep and can be a real challenge . "
ms cliffe added " they 're very small and can be very active , shooting out of the nest box when you least expect it . "
strict protection laws apply to the mammal , which require anyone handling them to be trained under licence .
the volunteers will be trained in time to start monthly checks of 300 nest boxes placed in seven woods in monmouthshire , herefordshire and gloucestershire from next spring .
it is part of the £ 1.3m ravine woodlife project .
" this will help us build up a really good picture of the population , " said ms cliffe .
" you have to open the boxes very carefully and if there 's a dormouse inside , you take the box off the tree and put it all in an enormous bag .
" you can usually tell if there 's a nest with babies because it tends to be crammed to the brim with nest material and , instead of trying to shoot out of the box , the female will burrow down to the bottom . "

romany life boasts " a superb collection " of gypsy wagons , carts and trailers , the cranbrook centre said .
spokesman henry stanford said the exhibition has set out to show the contribution made by gypsies to kent 's agricultural history .
in july , a film made by romany children about their culture as part of a school project was premiered in cranbrook .
mr stanford said gypsies had contributed enormously to the local economy , many working yearly on hop-picking in the county , and playing an " essential part " of the industry .
he said : " living in or visiting kent , you are constantly reminded of its agricultural past .
" this is particularly seen in the many oast houses , oast huts and the small number of hop gardens still remaining . "
the centre in whitewell lane opened to visitors on 1 august .

the national farmers ' union -lrb- nfu -rrb- says the government has " reacted incredibly quickly " in asking for the money back .
but it complains some farmers are still owed money due last december .
the government says the overpayments are due to administrative blunders .
it says its " main task " is to pay out money still owed as soon as possible .
i want them to show the same speed and commitment to getting the rest of the farmers ' money out peter kendle nfu the rural payments agency -lrb- rpa -rrb- has paid about 500 farmers £ 30,000 each too much , while about 800 have been overpaid by £ 7,000 .
the agency was set up to administer a new european subsidy scheme to make sure british farmers get the support they are entitled to .
the rpa has also been tasked with digitally mapping all of the uk 's fields 2.5 million fields .
nfu president peter kendle told bbc news that the union wanted swift action on money still owed .
" they 've put enormous amounts of resources into remedying the overpayments and they have reacted incredibly quickly , once they realised what had gone on , " he said .
" i want them to show the same speed and commitment to getting the rest of the farmers ' money out .
" now , we 've got another year coming round and the rest of europe will be receiving their money in about four months time .
we 're not on track to meet those targets either . "
we regret this , it is eu money - originally british taxpayers ' money - and the auditors will require that we get it back geoff rooker farming minister geoff rooker said overpayments had been made to about 1 % of the uk 's 110,000 farmers .
he said he could not " explain which key was pressed to send an overpayment " .
" we regret this , it is eu money - originally british taxpayers ' money - and the auditors will require that we get it back , " he added .
" but out main task , at the present time , is to make sure we pay the rest of the money we owe to farmers this year . "
single sum up to 6,000 farmers were still owed amounts under 1,000 euros -lrb- about £ 700 -rrb- , mr rooker said .
" we 've still got about 200 farmers that we owe over 1,000 euros to , some of which are quite complicated cases , because of either liquidation or probate , so there 's a complicated issue at the end . "
a change in the way farmers were paid subsidies had caused problems , he said .
the new subsidy gives farmers a single sum irrespective of how much food they produce .
" the rural payments agency is doing a hell of a good job .
it pays out 42 different subsidy schemes .
" and the single farm payment replaced 11 separate payments to farmers when we paid them to produce food . "

the agency was set up to administer a new european subsidy scheme to make sure british farmers get the support they are entitled to .
the rpa has also been tasked with digitally mapping all of the uk 's fields 2.5 million fields .
nfu president peter kendle told bbc news that the union wanted swift action on money still owed .

the national farmers ' union -lrb- nfu -rrb- says the government has " reacted incredibly quickly " in asking for the money back .
but it complains some farmers are still owed money due last december .
the government says the overpayments are due to administrative blunders .
it says its " main task " is to pay out money still owed as soon as possible .
i want them to show the same speed and commitment to getting the rest of the farmers ' money out peter kendle nfu the rural payments agency -lrb- rpa -rrb- has paid about 500 farmers £ 30,000 each too much , while about 800 have been overpaid by £ 7,000 .
the agency was set up to administer a new european subsidy scheme to make sure british farmers get the support they are entitled to .
the rpa has also been tasked with digitally mapping all of the uk 's fields 2.5 million fields .
nfu president peter kendle told bbc news that the union wanted swift action on money still owed .
" they 've put enormous amounts of resources into remedying the overpayments and they have reacted incredibly quickly , once they realised what had gone on , " he said .
" i want them to show the same speed and commitment to getting the rest of the farmers ' money out .
" now , we 've got another year coming round and the rest of europe will be receiving their money in about four months time .
we 're not on track to meet those targets either . "
we regret this , it is eu money - originally british taxpayers ' money - and the auditors will require that we get it back geoff rooker farming minister geoff rooker said overpayments had been made to about 1 % of the uk 's 110,000 farmers .
he said he could not " explain which key was pressed to send an overpayment " .
" we regret this , it is eu money - originally british taxpayers ' money - and the auditors will require that we get it back , " he added .
" but out main task , at the present time , is to make sure we pay the rest of the money we owe to farmers this year . "
single sum up to 6,000 farmers were still owed amounts under 1,000 euros -lrb- about £ 700 -rrb- , mr rooker said .
" we 've still got about 200 farmers that we owe over 1,000 euros to , some of which are quite complicated cases , because of either liquidation or probate , so there 's a complicated issue at the end . "
a change in the way farmers were paid subsidies had caused problems , he said .
the new subsidy gives farmers a single sum irrespective of how much food they produce .
" the rural payments agency is doing a hell of a good job .
it pays out 42 different subsidy schemes .
" and the single farm payment replaced 11 separate payments to farmers when we paid them to produce food . "

police said they were arrested just before 0100 bst on sunday .
