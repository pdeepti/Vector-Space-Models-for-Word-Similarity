" it was totally forgotten .
local farmers never reclaimed the land , so gradually the bushes and thickets took it over .
only if you looked could you see a rough outline of the fortifications , " said local deputy jean-marc lefranc . traces of history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gary sterne posing with rusty german ammunition from world war ii after extensive research in european archives , sterne found contemporary maps that pinpointed the site of the complex , on high ground above omaha beach at the western end of the d-day frontline .
he then set about buying the land plot by plot from local owners . after several months of clearing work , a dozen buildings in stone and concrete have been discovered linked by 1,500 meters of tunnels .
different areas have been identified as a sick bay , officers ' quarters , radio room and kitchens . the position appeared to have been looted after it was abandoned by the germans , and even the floor tiles had disappeared .
but sterne found some personal belongings including boots , spectacles and small bottles of medicine . on one wall was the inscription : " bill fornia - ohio " . a trap for the allies according to sterne , " discovery of the maisy battery answers some of the questions surrounding the high mortality rate among americans on omaha beach . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 3,500 americans and 700 germans died on omaha beach omaha saw the worst casualties of june 6 , 1944 , as american soldiers found themselves trapped on the narrow beach beneath high cliffs of sand and stone .
in a renowned operation us rangers stormed a german position at the pointe du hoc , only to find that the guns they were looking for were not there . " the big cannons supposedly installed at the pointe du hoc were a german war ruse aimed at drawing allied fire .
but all the time this neighboring battery was totally invisible and continued pounding the beaches till june 9 , " said sterne . a future tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the complex at grandcamp-maisy will soon be open to public the complex is believed to have contained four batteries of 155 millimeter cannon , with two others positioned in nearby fields , as well as four 105 millimeter guns .
twelve 88 millimeter guns ensured anti-aircraft defense , and there were several machine-gun nests and two renault tanks . some local historians , however , are more cautious . " the discovery of the site is interesting but not vitally important .
it is not one of the biggest complexes along the atlantic wall , " said marc pottier , a historian at the war memorial at the norman city of caen . the site will be opened to the public in march . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coming to terms with vichy for years , france preferred to remember those who resisted the nazis , rather than those who collaborated with them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons europe -pipe- 03.02.2006 analysis : arab protests are calculated political response großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the furor over the mohammed cartoon could be part of a political agenda mass protests , threats of violence and boycotts in the arab world are exaggerated reactions to the mohammed cartoon and an example of how governments instrumentalize hatred against the west for political purposes . the publication of a mohammed cartoon in the danish newspaper jyllands-posten has deeply offended the religious sentiments of the muslim community , who regard it as a western affront to their beliefs .
not only does islam forbid the illustration of the prophet , it sharply condemns any form of blasphemy .
many muslims see in the cartoon a demeaning connection between their religion and terrorism and have responded with angry protests . in more than 25 countries , enraged muslims took to the streets to protest the caricature .
they burned danish flags and called for a boycott of danish products .
there were even numerous threats , including bomb threats targeting western citizens and diplomatic missions .
some , such as the kuwaiti islam scholar sheik nasem almisbah , even called for the death of the cartoonist . the majority of arab governments only made matters worse by adding fuel to the fire of angry protestors rather than seeking to calm them .
saudi arabia , kuwait and libya , for instance , recalled their ambassadors to denmark and demanded a severe punishment for those responsible as well as an official apology from the danish government . no separation of church and state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims feel personally offended by the caricatures and the attitudes behind printing them .
such demands show that arab governments are incapable of understanding the relationship between the state and freedom of expression as it is practiced in europe .
while the right to free speech is anchored in european constitutions and a clear separation between church and state defines daily life , islam dominates daily life in the arab world .
as a result many muslims can not comprehend the differentiation in europe .
they feel personally offended as soon as their religion is presented in a hurtful manner .
they also do not understand that politicians in the western world have no direct influence over the media , as is commonly the case in the arab world . calculated reactions however , the harsh reactions to the cartoon overstep the boundaries of acceptable protests .
even though the mohammed caricature provokes , it by no means justifies an incitement to murder or a call for boycotts .
it is also not reason enough for the arab world to instrumentalize the protests for political purposes . in the arab world , particularly in iraq , hundred of people are killed and mosques and churches attacked weekly .
but neither politicians nor mass demonstrations criticize the situation .
thus , one could presume political rather than religious motives are behind the exaggerated reactions to the mohammed cartoon . islamist groups are attempting to channel the hatred against the west to bolster their own political influence .
through their apparent solidarity with the wave of protest arab governments can detract from domestic failure and discredit western calls for reform .
most likely they will also take advantage of the situation to cut back on freedom of the press in their countries . the escalation of events in the palestinian territories on thursday is a good example of how political groups have instrumentalized the raging sentiments .
it was n't hamas or jihad that fueled the violent protests , but rather the militant arm of the secular fatah party , which lost last week 's parliamentary election .
for them , the protests offered the perfect opportunity to express frustration over the lost ballot . one-sided reporting in arab media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar based tv channel al jazeera led with the story ... and protests .
up until now , the arab media has taken a differentiated approach to covering the dispute .
while well-known media groups such as al jazeera addressed the topic in the most prominent manner , even the renowned , trans-arabic newspaper alhayat placed the topic in the second and third most visible positions .
media close to the government as well as relatively independent media quickly showed solidarity with their readers that the illustration of the prophet was both deeming and offensive .
critical voices remained the exception . the editorialist for the jordanian newspaper al-shihan was one of the exceptions .
in an opinion piece , he provoked readers by asking : " what damages islam the most : these drawings or pictures showing hostage takers decapitating their victims in front of running cameras , or a suicide bomber who decides to detonate himself at a wedding in amman ? " difficult dialogue europe - and germany in particular - have gone to great extents in recent years to intensify their dialogue with the arab and islamic world .
but now the dispute over the cartoon threatens to reverse any progress in bringing the two sides together .
it is the view of many arab commentators that such publications only help the extremist groups who are not interested in interacting with the west .
according to abd albari atwan , editor-in-chief of the pan-arabic newspaper al quds al-arabi , targeted offenses such as the caricature only serve to poison the relationship between islam and the west .
further publications in other european countries will only widen the rift between the two sides . ibrahim mohamad -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mohammed cartoon conflict gets even hotter the controversy over danish editorial cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed has widened , escalating into an armed standoff in the gaza strip .

" that 's not the way of having a dialogue , a conversation , " said the journalist , who has reported for arab media from denmark for more than 20 years . while the cartoon row has exploded in a wave of protests across the middle east and opened a debate around the world , danish analysts say closer to home , they represent the problems denmark has regarding immigration , particularly of its muslim community . he is one of the co-initiators of a so-called " alternative network , " a group of danish muslims who started to meet recently to provide journalists and others a wider spectrum of views from the muslim community . " some call us moderate muslims , some call us secular muslims , we call ourselves muslims , " said al-habahbeh .
" we do n't go to mosques .
we are european muslims and do n't want to be represented by the imams .
our aim is to offer an islamic voice in the dialogue . "
denmark in crisis when it comes to muslims , denmark is in the midst of a crisis , which has been provoked by the danish government , according to al-habahbeh .
the populist anti-immigrant danish people 's party has played a prominent role in antagonizing danish muslims . leading members of the party have openly said islam is not a religion but a terrorist organization .
and without the far-right party 's support , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's minority coalition of liberals and conservatives would neither have been able to come to power nor to stay there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen could have prevented the conflict , al-habahbeh said an opinion poll carried out between monday and wednesday this week , when the controversy reached a climax with riots in the gaza strip , showed that the people 's party has profited .
danish support for the party increased from 12.1 percent to 14.5 percent , greens polling group said .
both of the governing parties ' standings remained stable . on the opposite side from people 's party , the centrist det radikale venstre - whose most vocal personality in the current conflict , parliamentarian naser khader , is also a co-initiator of the alternative network of muslims - saw its support increase from 9.2 to 10.7 percent . " the mohammed drawings go straight back to the immigrant debate , " political scientist lars bille of copenhagen university told boersen newspaper .
" the fronts are becoming sharper .
and here people are looking towards -lrb- det radikale venstre -rrb- and the people 's party , which each make up a pole in the debate . "
fodder for the taking in such an inflamed atmosphere , the offending cartoons themselves were n't the real issue , al-habahbeh said .
instead they merely offered fodder to muslim extremists as well as to the danish right-wing . " the cartoons are being misused both by muslim extremists and the right wing here in denmark , " said al-habahbeh .
" the islamists and the extremists -lrb- are using them -rrb- to further their aims , saying that they attack islam to further the clash of civilizations .
" the right-wing groups are using them to say that a muslim can never be a democrat , " he added .
" the actions taken by those in some arab countries , like flag-burning , are also being used to strengthen racist arguments here in denmark . "

" if you reject hamas , it would be perceived in the region as rejection of democratic principles , " she told a conference in the european parliament in brussels , according to online news site euobserver .
" the eu must not allow the result of the election to conceal the fantastic performance that the election was .

not only does islam forbid the illustration of the prophet , it sharply condemns any form of blasphemy .
many muslims see in the cartoon a demeaning connection between their religion and terrorism and have responded with angry protests . in more than 25 countries , enraged muslims took to the streets to protest the caricature .
they burned danish flags and called for a boycott of danish products .
there were even numerous threats , including bomb threats targeting western citizens and diplomatic missions .
some , such as the kuwaiti islam scholar sheik nasem almisbah , even called for the death of the cartoonist . the majority of arab governments only made matters worse by adding fuel to the fire of angry protestors rather than seeking to calm them .
saudi arabia , kuwait and libya , for instance , recalled their ambassadors to denmark and demanded a severe punishment for those responsible as well as an official apology from the danish government . no separation of church and state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims feel personally offended by the caricatures and the attitudes behind printing them .
such demands show that arab governments are incapable of understanding the relationship between the state and freedom of expression as it is practiced in europe .
while the right to free speech is anchored in european constitutions and a clear separation between church and state defines daily life , islam dominates daily life in the arab world .
as a result many muslims can not comprehend the differentiation in europe .
they feel personally offended as soon as their religion is presented in a hurtful manner .
they also do not understand that politicians in the western world have no direct influence over the media , as is commonly the case in the arab world . calculated reactions however , the harsh reactions to the cartoon overstep the boundaries of acceptable protests .
even though the mohammed caricature provokes , it by no means justifies an incitement to murder or a call for boycotts .
it is also not reason enough for the arab world to instrumentalize the protests for political purposes . in the arab world , particularly in iraq , hundred of people are killed and mosques and churches attacked weekly .
but neither politicians nor mass demonstrations criticize the situation .
thus , one could presume political rather than religious motives are behind the exaggerated reactions to the mohammed cartoon . islamist groups are attempting to channel the hatred against the west to bolster their own political influence .
through their apparent solidarity with the wave of protest arab governments can detract from domestic failure and discredit western calls for reform .
most likely they will also take advantage of the situation to cut back on freedom of the press in their countries . the escalation of events in the palestinian territories on thursday is a good example of how political groups have instrumentalized the raging sentiments .
it was n't hamas or jihad that fueled the violent protests , but rather the militant arm of the secular fatah party , which lost last week 's parliamentary election .
for them , the protests offered the perfect opportunity to express frustration over the lost ballot . one-sided reporting in arab media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar based tv channel al jazeera led with the story ... and protests .
up until now , the arab media has taken a differentiated approach to covering the dispute .
while well-known media groups such as al jazeera addressed the topic in the most prominent manner , even the renowned , trans-arabic newspaper alhayat placed the topic in the second and third most visible positions .
media close to the government as well as relatively independent media quickly showed solidarity with their readers that the illustration of the prophet was both deeming and offensive .
critical voices remained the exception . the editorialist for the jordanian newspaper al-shihan was one of the exceptions .
in an opinion piece , he provoked readers by asking : " what damages islam the most : these drawings or pictures showing hostage takers decapitating their victims in front of running cameras , or a suicide bomber who decides to detonate himself at a wedding in amman ? " difficult dialogue europe - and germany in particular - have gone to great extents in recent years to intensify their dialogue with the arab and islamic world .
but now the dispute over the cartoon threatens to reverse any progress in bringing the two sides together .
it is the view of many arab commentators that such publications only help the extremist groups who are not interested in interacting with the west .
according to abd albari atwan , editor-in-chief of the pan-arabic newspaper al quds al-arabi , targeted offenses such as the caricature only serve to poison the relationship between islam and the west .
further publications in other european countries will only widen the rift between the two sides . ibrahim mohamad -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mohammed cartoon conflict gets even hotter the controversy over danish editorial cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed has widened , escalating into an armed standoff in the gaza strip .

" it was totally forgotten .
local farmers never reclaimed the land , so gradually the bushes and thickets took it over .
only if you looked could you see a rough outline of the fortifications , " said local deputy jean-marc lefranc . traces of history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gary sterne posing with rusty german ammunition from world war ii after extensive research in european archives , sterne found contemporary maps that pinpointed the site of the complex , on high ground above omaha beach at the western end of the d-day frontline .
he then set about buying the land plot by plot from local owners . after several months of clearing work , a dozen buildings in stone and concrete have been discovered linked by 1,500 meters of tunnels .
different areas have been identified as a sick bay , officers ' quarters , radio room and kitchens . the position appeared to have been looted after it was abandoned by the germans , and even the floor tiles had disappeared .
but sterne found some personal belongings including boots , spectacles and small bottles of medicine . on one wall was the inscription : " bill fornia - ohio " . a trap for the allies according to sterne , " discovery of the maisy battery answers some of the questions surrounding the high mortality rate among americans on omaha beach . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 3,500 americans and 700 germans died on omaha beach omaha saw the worst casualties of june 6 , 1944 , as american soldiers found themselves trapped on the narrow beach beneath high cliffs of sand and stone .
in a renowned operation us rangers stormed a german position at the pointe du hoc , only to find that the guns they were looking for were not there . " the big cannons supposedly installed at the pointe du hoc were a german war ruse aimed at drawing allied fire .
but all the time this neighboring battery was totally invisible and continued pounding the beaches till june 9 , " said sterne . a future tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the complex at grandcamp-maisy will soon be open to public the complex is believed to have contained four batteries of 155 millimeter cannon , with two others positioned in nearby fields , as well as four 105 millimeter guns .
twelve 88 millimeter guns ensured anti-aircraft defense , and there were several machine-gun nests and two renault tanks . some local historians , however , are more cautious . " the discovery of the site is interesting but not vitally important .
it is not one of the biggest complexes along the atlantic wall , " said marc pottier , a historian at the war memorial at the norman city of caen . the site will be opened to the public in march . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coming to terms with vichy for years , france preferred to remember those who resisted the nazis , rather than those who collaborated with them .

" it was totally forgotten .
local farmers never reclaimed the land , so gradually the bushes and thickets took it over .
only if you looked could you see a rough outline of the fortifications , " said local deputy jean-marc lefranc . traces of history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gary sterne posing with rusty german ammunition from world war ii after extensive research in european archives , sterne found contemporary maps that pinpointed the site of the complex , on high ground above omaha beach at the western end of the d-day frontline .
he then set about buying the land plot by plot from local owners . after several months of clearing work , a dozen buildings in stone and concrete have been discovered linked by 1,500 meters of tunnels .
different areas have been identified as a sick bay , officers ' quarters , radio room and kitchens . the position appeared to have been looted after it was abandoned by the germans , and even the floor tiles had disappeared .
but sterne found some personal belongings including boots , spectacles and small bottles of medicine . on one wall was the inscription : " bill fornia - ohio " . a trap for the allies according to sterne , " discovery of the maisy battery answers some of the questions surrounding the high mortality rate among americans on omaha beach . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 3,500 americans and 700 germans died on omaha beach omaha saw the worst casualties of june 6 , 1944 , as american soldiers found themselves trapped on the narrow beach beneath high cliffs of sand and stone .
in a renowned operation us rangers stormed a german position at the pointe du hoc , only to find that the guns they were looking for were not there . " the big cannons supposedly installed at the pointe du hoc were a german war ruse aimed at drawing allied fire .
but all the time this neighboring battery was totally invisible and continued pounding the beaches till june 9 , " said sterne . a future tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the complex at grandcamp-maisy will soon be open to public the complex is believed to have contained four batteries of 155 millimeter cannon , with two others positioned in nearby fields , as well as four 105 millimeter guns .
twelve 88 millimeter guns ensured anti-aircraft defense , and there were several machine-gun nests and two renault tanks . some local historians , however , are more cautious . " the discovery of the site is interesting but not vitally important .
it is not one of the biggest complexes along the atlantic wall , " said marc pottier , a historian at the war memorial at the norman city of caen . the site will be opened to the public in march . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coming to terms with vichy for years , france preferred to remember those who resisted the nazis , rather than those who collaborated with them .

experts are taken by surprise . the trial of the disgraced german athletics coach thomas springstein , who has been accused of giving performance-enhancing drugs to minors , took an eerie turn this week when the court in the eastern german town of magdeburg was presented with evidence pointing to springstein 's involvement in genetic doping . e-mails sent and received by springstein , a one-time coach of the german athletics association -lrb- dlv -rrb- , which were seized by the police during a raid on springstein 's home , brought up references to repoxygen - a banned substance meant to be used in gene therapy to treat patients with anemia . repoxygen helps to induce a controlled release of erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- , a substance that stimulates the production of red blood cells , thereby increasing the amount of oxygen the blood can deliver to the muscles . in one email , springstein wrote that " new repoxygen is hard to get .
please give me new instructions soon so that i can order the product before christmas . " difficult to detect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetic doping is more difficult to trace than traditional performance-enhancing drugs the international olympic committee and world anti-doping agency have already banned the use of synthetic epo among athletes , but are yet to design a test for repoxygen , which teaches human cells to produce epo on their own . the difficulty of producing such a test lies in the fact that repoxygen allows the body to switch the gene on in response to law oxygen levels and switch it off after the levels have been raised . repoxygen was prototyped in 2002 by the british pharmaceutical company oxford biomedica but never went into production since the company did n't believe it could compete with the availability of synthetic epo on the market .
the product , nonetheless , caught the attention of the anti-doping agencies at the time . " you can turn it on and off , " said larry bowers , the managing director of the us anti-doping agency after a meeting in atlanta in oct .
2002 . " it acts more or less like the body , " bowers said . playing with fire how repoxygen could have made it to the black market is still not known .
professor alan kingsman , oxford biomedica 's chief executive , claims that his company maintains strict controls over its products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some like it big and are willing to pop as many pills as they can " i 'd be extremely surprised if anything we made got on to the black market , " said kingsman . according to kingsman , only a fairly advanced lab could reproduce repoxygen based on the information which was made available by oxford biomedica . " but if would be very irresponsible for a number of reasons , " kingsman said .
" for a start , we only went as far as testing it on mice .
to use it in the human body would be playing with fire . " a bad omen for the olympics most experts were taken by surprise by the revelations of the springstein case , since the general opinion was that genetic doping was not practiced and that it would not become an actual threat before the 2008 beijing olympics .
the news of genetic doping will now unavoidably loom over the turin winter games , which start next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the xx winter olympic games is scheduled for feb .
10 in turin " we have been expecting gene doping , but not so soon .
i do n't know how they have it , but they do , " said werner franke , a german cell biologist who has studied numerous doping cases in the former east germany . " this is worse than in the gdr and more brutal than the balco scandal , " franke said . the founder of the us balco labs was sentenced to four months in a minimum security prison and four months of home confinement last year for masterminding the distribution of illegal steroids among elite athletes . a criminal act the german athletics association -lrb- dlv -rrb- has urged the lawmakers to explicitly outlaw genetic doping , citing the difficulty which various sports bodies would have in monitoring the practice . " we need tighter laws , " said dlv president clemens prokop . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will grit breuer 's gold medals for germany be tarnished ?
the 47-year-old springstein faces a stiff jail sentence if found guilty of supplying drugs to minors back in 2003 , especially if the accusations of genetic doping are confirmed . springstein has also been accused of giving several injections to one of his female athletes to treat an injury despite not having a viable medical permit . before the doping scandal came to light , springstein worked with some of germany 's top athletes , including east german track stars katrin krabbe and grit breuer , who were both suspended for two years for using the banned steroid clenbuterol in 1992 . krabbe won the 100m and 200m world titles in 1991 while breuer , who is springstein 's partner , won the 1990 european title at 400 meters . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conflicting evidence masks the bald facts in doping case nemanja vucicevic , striker for bundesliga team 1860 munich , failed a drugs test after a game earlier this month , soccer authorities revealed monday .

" that 's not the way of having a dialogue , a conversation , " said the journalist , who has reported for arab media from denmark for more than 20 years . while the cartoon row has exploded in a wave of protests across the middle east and opened a debate around the world , danish analysts say closer to home , they represent the problems denmark has regarding immigration , particularly of its muslim community . he is one of the co-initiators of a so-called " alternative network , " a group of danish muslims who started to meet recently to provide journalists and others a wider spectrum of views from the muslim community . " some call us moderate muslims , some call us secular muslims , we call ourselves muslims , " said al-habahbeh .
" we do n't go to mosques .
we are european muslims and do n't want to be represented by the imams .
our aim is to offer an islamic voice in the dialogue . "
denmark in crisis when it comes to muslims , denmark is in the midst of a crisis , which has been provoked by the danish government , according to al-habahbeh .
the populist anti-immigrant danish people 's party has played a prominent role in antagonizing danish muslims . leading members of the party have openly said islam is not a religion but a terrorist organization .
and without the far-right party 's support , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's minority coalition of liberals and conservatives would neither have been able to come to power nor to stay there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen could have prevented the conflict , al-habahbeh said an opinion poll carried out between monday and wednesday this week , when the controversy reached a climax with riots in the gaza strip , showed that the people 's party has profited .
danish support for the party increased from 12.1 percent to 14.5 percent , greens polling group said .
both of the governing parties ' standings remained stable . on the opposite side from people 's party , the centrist det radikale venstre - whose most vocal personality in the current conflict , parliamentarian naser khader , is also a co-initiator of the alternative network of muslims - saw its support increase from 9.2 to 10.7 percent . " the mohammed drawings go straight back to the immigrant debate , " political scientist lars bille of copenhagen university told boersen newspaper .
" the fronts are becoming sharper .
and here people are looking towards -lrb- det radikale venstre -rrb- and the people 's party , which each make up a pole in the debate . "
fodder for the taking in such an inflamed atmosphere , the offending cartoons themselves were n't the real issue , al-habahbeh said .
instead they merely offered fodder to muslim extremists as well as to the danish right-wing . " the cartoons are being misused both by muslim extremists and the right wing here in denmark , " said al-habahbeh .
" the islamists and the extremists -lrb- are using them -rrb- to further their aims , saying that they attack islam to further the clash of civilizations .
" the right-wing groups are using them to say that a muslim can never be a democrat , " he added .
" the actions taken by those in some arab countries , like flag-burning , are also being used to strengthen racist arguments here in denmark . "

" that 's not the way of having a dialogue , a conversation , " said the journalist , who has reported for arab media from denmark for more than 20 years . while the cartoon row has exploded in a wave of protests across the middle east and opened a debate around the world , danish analysts say closer to home , they represent the problems denmark has regarding immigration , particularly of its muslim community . he is one of the co-initiators of a so-called " alternative network , " a group of danish muslims who started to meet recently to provide journalists and others a wider spectrum of views from the muslim community . " some call us moderate muslims , some call us secular muslims , we call ourselves muslims , " said al-habahbeh .
" we do n't go to mosques .
we are european muslims and do n't want to be represented by the imams .
our aim is to offer an islamic voice in the dialogue . "
denmark in crisis when it comes to muslims , denmark is in the midst of a crisis , which has been provoked by the danish government , according to al-habahbeh .
the populist anti-immigrant danish people 's party has played a prominent role in antagonizing danish muslims . leading members of the party have openly said islam is not a religion but a terrorist organization .
and without the far-right party 's support , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's minority coalition of liberals and conservatives would neither have been able to come to power nor to stay there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen could have prevented the conflict , al-habahbeh said an opinion poll carried out between monday and wednesday this week , when the controversy reached a climax with riots in the gaza strip , showed that the people 's party has profited .
danish support for the party increased from 12.1 percent to 14.5 percent , greens polling group said .
both of the governing parties ' standings remained stable . on the opposite side from people 's party , the centrist det radikale venstre - whose most vocal personality in the current conflict , parliamentarian naser khader , is also a co-initiator of the alternative network of muslims - saw its support increase from 9.2 to 10.7 percent . " the mohammed drawings go straight back to the immigrant debate , " political scientist lars bille of copenhagen university told boersen newspaper .
" the fronts are becoming sharper .
and here people are looking towards -lrb- det radikale venstre -rrb- and the people 's party , which each make up a pole in the debate . "
fodder for the taking in such an inflamed atmosphere , the offending cartoons themselves were n't the real issue , al-habahbeh said .
instead they merely offered fodder to muslim extremists as well as to the danish right-wing . " the cartoons are being misused both by muslim extremists and the right wing here in denmark , " said al-habahbeh .
" the islamists and the extremists -lrb- are using them -rrb- to further their aims , saying that they attack islam to further the clash of civilizations .
" the right-wing groups are using them to say that a muslim can never be a democrat , " he added .
" the actions taken by those in some arab countries , like flag-burning , are also being used to strengthen racist arguments here in denmark . "
message to the danes the journalist said the government could have prevented the whole conflict from escalating three months ago when 11 arab ambassadors asked to see him concerning the cartoons .
instead rasmussen sent a message to the danes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian muslims protest in jakarta on friday " when the prime minister said ' no ' to meeting the ambassadors he was not talking to the ambassadors ; he was talking to the voters . " though the current conflict may eventually be overcome , al-habahbeh said , he does n't have high hopes that the deeper crisis will be resolved anytime soon . " even though the paper apologized , it wo n't make a difference .
because muslims in europe demand some respect as human beings , as danes , " he said .
" without fulfilling these demands i do n't think the crisis will stop . " nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de analysis : arab protests are calculated political response mass protests , threats of violence and boycotts in the arab world are exaggerated reactions to the mohammed cartoon and an example of how governments instrumentalize hatred against the west for political purposes .

not only does islam forbid the illustration of the prophet , it sharply condemns any form of blasphemy .
many muslims see in the cartoon a demeaning connection between their religion and terrorism and have responded with angry protests . in more than 25 countries , enraged muslims took to the streets to protest the caricature .
they burned danish flags and called for a boycott of danish products .
there were even numerous threats , including bomb threats targeting western citizens and diplomatic missions .
some , such as the kuwaiti islam scholar sheik nasem almisbah , even called for the death of the cartoonist . the majority of arab governments only made matters worse by adding fuel to the fire of angry protestors rather than seeking to calm them .
saudi arabia , kuwait and libya , for instance , recalled their ambassadors to denmark and demanded a severe punishment for those responsible as well as an official apology from the danish government . no separation of church and state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims feel personally offended by the caricatures and the attitudes behind printing them .
such demands show that arab governments are incapable of understanding the relationship between the state and freedom of expression as it is practiced in europe .
while the right to free speech is anchored in european constitutions and a clear separation between church and state defines daily life , islam dominates daily life in the arab world .
as a result many muslims can not comprehend the differentiation in europe .
they feel personally offended as soon as their religion is presented in a hurtful manner .
they also do not understand that politicians in the western world have no direct influence over the media , as is commonly the case in the arab world . calculated reactions however , the harsh reactions to the cartoon overstep the boundaries of acceptable protests .
even though the mohammed caricature provokes , it by no means justifies an incitement to murder or a call for boycotts .
it is also not reason enough for the arab world to instrumentalize the protests for political purposes . in the arab world , particularly in iraq , hundred of people are killed and mosques and churches attacked weekly .
but neither politicians nor mass demonstrations criticize the situation .
thus , one could presume political rather than religious motives are behind the exaggerated reactions to the mohammed cartoon . islamist groups are attempting to channel the hatred against the west to bolster their own political influence .
through their apparent solidarity with the wave of protest arab governments can detract from domestic failure and discredit western calls for reform .
most likely they will also take advantage of the situation to cut back on freedom of the press in their countries . the escalation of events in the palestinian territories on thursday is a good example of how political groups have instrumentalized the raging sentiments .
it was n't hamas or jihad that fueled the violent protests , but rather the militant arm of the secular fatah party , which lost last week 's parliamentary election .
for them , the protests offered the perfect opportunity to express frustration over the lost ballot . one-sided reporting in arab media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar based tv channel al jazeera led with the story ... and protests .
up until now , the arab media has taken a differentiated approach to covering the dispute .
while well-known media groups such as al jazeera addressed the topic in the most prominent manner , even the renowned , trans-arabic newspaper alhayat placed the topic in the second and third most visible positions .
media close to the government as well as relatively independent media quickly showed solidarity with their readers that the illustration of the prophet was both deeming and offensive .
critical voices remained the exception . the editorialist for the jordanian newspaper al-shihan was one of the exceptions .
in an opinion piece , he provoked readers by asking : " what damages islam the most : these drawings or pictures showing hostage takers decapitating their victims in front of running cameras , or a suicide bomber who decides to detonate himself at a wedding in amman ? " difficult dialogue europe - and germany in particular - have gone to great extents in recent years to intensify their dialogue with the arab and islamic world .
but now the dispute over the cartoon threatens to reverse any progress in bringing the two sides together .
it is the view of many arab commentators that such publications only help the extremist groups who are not interested in interacting with the west .
according to abd albari atwan , editor-in-chief of the pan-arabic newspaper al quds al-arabi , targeted offenses such as the caricature only serve to poison the relationship between islam and the west .

even though the mohammed caricature provokes , it by no means justifies an incitement to murder or a call for boycotts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons europe -pipe- 03.02.2006 analysis : arab protests are calculated political response großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the furor over the mohammed cartoon could be part of a political agenda mass protests , threats of violence and boycotts in the arab world are exaggerated reactions to the mohammed cartoon and an example of how governments instrumentalize hatred against the west for political purposes . the publication of a mohammed cartoon in the danish newspaper jyllands-posten has deeply offended the religious sentiments of the muslim community , who regard it as a western affront to their beliefs .
not only does islam forbid the illustration of the prophet , it sharply condemns any form of blasphemy .
many muslims see in the cartoon a demeaning connection between their religion and terrorism and have responded with angry protests . in more than 25 countries , enraged muslims took to the streets to protest the caricature .
they burned danish flags and called for a boycott of danish products .
there were even numerous threats , including bomb threats targeting western citizens and diplomatic missions .
some , such as the kuwaiti islam scholar sheik nasem almisbah , even called for the death of the cartoonist . the majority of arab governments only made matters worse by adding fuel to the fire of angry protestors rather than seeking to calm them .
saudi arabia , kuwait and libya , for instance , recalled their ambassadors to denmark and demanded a severe punishment for those responsible as well as an official apology from the danish government . no separation of church and state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims feel personally offended by the caricatures and the attitudes behind printing them .
such demands show that arab governments are incapable of understanding the relationship between the state and freedom of expression as it is practiced in europe .
while the right to free speech is anchored in european constitutions and a clear separation between church and state defines daily life , islam dominates daily life in the arab world .
as a result many muslims can not comprehend the differentiation in europe .
they feel personally offended as soon as their religion is presented in a hurtful manner .
they also do not understand that politicians in the western world have no direct influence over the media , as is commonly the case in the arab world . calculated reactions however , the harsh reactions to the cartoon overstep the boundaries of acceptable protests .
even though the mohammed caricature provokes , it by no means justifies an incitement to murder or a call for boycotts .

experts are taken by surprise . the trial of the disgraced german athletics coach thomas springstein , who has been accused of giving performance-enhancing drugs to minors , took an eerie turn this week when the court in the eastern german town of magdeburg was presented with evidence pointing to springstein 's involvement in genetic doping . e-mails sent and received by springstein , a one-time coach of the german athletics association -lrb- dlv -rrb- , which were seized by the police during a raid on springstein 's home , brought up references to repoxygen - a banned substance meant to be used in gene therapy to treat patients with anemia . repoxygen helps to induce a controlled release of erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- , a substance that stimulates the production of red blood cells , thereby increasing the amount of oxygen the blood can deliver to the muscles . in one email , springstein wrote that " new repoxygen is hard to get .

hoping to attract tourists to his hometown , a stuttgart businessman has given an early renoir painting to a museum .
but not everyone is convinced that displaying the " swabian mona lisa " will kick off a visitor boom . deyhle started out working for the internal revenue service and later made billions as a real estate developer and musical producer .
in the late 1990s , he lost most of his fortune and sold large parts of his massive art collection that included works by georg baselitz , otto dix and käthe kollwitz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staatsgalerie director christian von holst -lrb- left -rrb- thanked deyhle for the painting one painting he did keep , however , was by the young pierre auguste renoir .
it depicts an anonymous woman in a coat with fur trim .
her facial expression is hard to determine - she seems on the verge of smiling , prompting deyhle to dub her the " swabian mona lisa . " deyhle has owned the painting from 1866 for a quarter century , but he 's only now decided to share it with the public by loaning it permanently to stuttgart 's renowned staatsgalerie museum . museum officials more cautious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an outside view of stuttgart 's staatsgalerie but while the 67-year-old reportedly hopes that the painting will serve as a magnet for tourists , staatsgalerie officials seem a little less enthusiastic . " when i first saw the painting , i could hardly believe that it was really a painting by this artist , " christofer conrad , a curator at the museum , told the dpa news service .
renoir was only 25 when he created " lady in fur , " which is much darker than many of his later works . bildunterschrift : renoir " lying nude " from 1902 looks quite different the painting has since been checked by experts and deemed authentic , but conrad nevertheless told reporters that he does n't believe the portrait will single-handedly turn stuttgart into a tourist destination . deyhle 's decision to hand over the painting and boost its significance has brought some to believe that he 's trying to create enough hype to boost the work 's value - a charge deyhle emphatically denies . " in that case , i would have given the picture to a museum much earlier , " he told dpa . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart stuttgart may owe a lot to gottlieb daimler , whose auto empire holds court in the city , but the city is more than the home of the mercedes star .

european parliamentarians have also voted to keep aid going . on thursday , about a dozen gunmen connected to palestinian leader mahmoud abbas ' fatah party surrounded the eu commission 's office in gaza city .
they demanded that the governments of denmark , france , germany and norway apologize for cartoons of mohammed published in newspapers in those countries . armed palestinians also threatened a " tough response " for further reprints of the cartoons in front of the french cultural center . despite the threats , eu officials said they were not going to suspend aid - at least for now . " if the situation gets more complicated then obviously for us it will not be easy to deal with it , " european commission spokeswoman emma udwin said , according to ap news service . parliame n taria n s vote for aid u n der co n ditio n s european lawmakers meanwhile voted on thursday to continue aid payments to palestinians as long as a future government led by radical islamist group hamas , the winner of last month 's parliamentary elections , renounces violence and seeks peace with israel . bildunterschrift : general view of the european parliament in strasbourg in a resolution , members of the european parliament , who have to approve any aid payments , said the eu should remain the biggest donor to the palestinian territories .
the bloc currently donates 500 million euros -lrb- $ 605 million -rrb- annually . parliamentarians agreed that future aid " will be dependent on the new government 's clarification on denouncing violence and recognizing israel , " an approach mirrored by the bloc 's foreign ministers , who adopted a similar policy at a meeting on monday . according to reuters news service , deputies also urged the middle east quartet - the united nations , united states , european union and russia - to take a " strong and urgent initiative " to promote negotiations between palestinians and israelis . hamas has been placed on an eu list of banned terrorist groups ; it has carried out almost 60 suicide bombings over the last six years . palesti n ia n calls to work with hamas eu parliamentarians also said that the faction 's election victory was the result of a desire for reforms and dissatisfaction among the palestinian population with the previous government . the palestinian authority 's representative to the eu , leila shahid , meanwhile told parliamentarians on wednesday that the western world would make a mistake if it did not recognize a hamas-led government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the eu cooperate with hamas leader ismail haniyeh ?
" if you reject hamas , it would be perceived in the region as rejection of democratic principles , " she told a conference in the european parliament in brussels , according to online news site euobserver .
" the eu must not allow the result of the election to conceal the fantastic performance that the election was .
it was transparent and in respect of pluralism , and that in a society where pluralism has been condemned .

" that 's not the way of having a dialogue , a conversation , " said the journalist , who has reported for arab media from denmark for more than 20 years . while the cartoon row has exploded in a wave of protests across the middle east and opened a debate around the world , danish analysts say closer to home , they represent the problems denmark has regarding immigration , particularly of its muslim community . he is one of the co-initiators of a so-called " alternative network , " a group of danish muslims who started to meet recently to provide journalists and others a wider spectrum of views from the muslim community . " some call us moderate muslims , some call us secular muslims , we call ourselves muslims , " said al-habahbeh .
" we do n't go to mosques .
we are european muslims and do n't want to be represented by the imams .
our aim is to offer an islamic voice in the dialogue . "
denmark in crisis when it comes to muslims , denmark is in the midst of a crisis , which has been provoked by the danish government , according to al-habahbeh .
the populist anti-immigrant danish people 's party has played a prominent role in antagonizing danish muslims . leading members of the party have openly said islam is not a religion but a terrorist organization .
and without the far-right party 's support , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's minority coalition of liberals and conservatives would neither have been able to come to power nor to stay there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen could have prevented the conflict , al-habahbeh said an opinion poll carried out between monday and wednesday this week , when the controversy reached a climax with riots in the gaza strip , showed that the people 's party has profited .
danish support for the party increased from 12.1 percent to 14.5 percent , greens polling group said .
both of the governing parties ' standings remained stable . on the opposite side from people 's party , the centrist det radikale venstre - whose most vocal personality in the current conflict , parliamentarian naser khader , is also a co-initiator of the alternative network of muslims - saw its support increase from 9.2 to 10.7 percent . " the mohammed drawings go straight back to the immigrant debate , " political scientist lars bille of copenhagen university told boersen newspaper .
" the fronts are becoming sharper .
and here people are looking towards -lrb- det radikale venstre -rrb- and the people 's party , which each make up a pole in the debate . "
fodder for the taking in such an inflamed atmosphere , the offending cartoons themselves were n't the real issue , al-habahbeh said .
instead they merely offered fodder to muslim extremists as well as to the danish right-wing . " the cartoons are being misused both by muslim extremists and the right wing here in denmark , " said al-habahbeh .
" the islamists and the extremists -lrb- are using them -rrb- to further their aims , saying that they attack islam to further the clash of civilizations .
" the right-wing groups are using them to say that a muslim can never be a democrat , " he added .
" the actions taken by those in some arab countries , like flag-burning , are also being used to strengthen racist arguments here in denmark . "
message to the danes the journalist said the government could have prevented the whole conflict from escalating three months ago when 11 arab ambassadors asked to see him concerning the cartoons .
instead rasmussen sent a message to the danes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian muslims protest in jakarta on friday " when the prime minister said ' no ' to meeting the ambassadors he was not talking to the ambassadors ; he was talking to the voters . " though the current conflict may eventually be overcome , al-habahbeh said , he does n't have high hopes that the deeper crisis will be resolved anytime soon . " even though the paper apologized , it wo n't make a difference .
because muslims in europe demand some respect as human beings , as danes , " he said .
" without fulfilling these demands i do n't think the crisis will stop .

not only does islam forbid the illustration of the prophet , it sharply condemns any form of blasphemy .
many muslims see in the cartoon a demeaning connection between their religion and terrorism and have responded with angry protests . in more than 25 countries , enraged muslims took to the streets to protest the caricature .
they burned danish flags and called for a boycott of danish products .
there were even numerous threats , including bomb threats targeting western citizens and diplomatic missions .
some , such as the kuwaiti islam scholar sheik nasem almisbah , even called for the death of the cartoonist . the majority of arab governments only made matters worse by adding fuel to the fire of angry protestors rather than seeking to calm them .
saudi arabia , kuwait and libya , for instance , recalled their ambassadors to denmark and demanded a severe punishment for those responsible as well as an official apology from the danish government . no separation of church and state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims feel personally offended by the caricatures and the attitudes behind printing them .
such demands show that arab governments are incapable of understanding the relationship between the state and freedom of expression as it is practiced in europe .
while the right to free speech is anchored in european constitutions and a clear separation between church and state defines daily life , islam dominates daily life in the arab world .
as a result many muslims can not comprehend the differentiation in europe .
they feel personally offended as soon as their religion is presented in a hurtful manner .
they also do not understand that politicians in the western world have no direct influence over the media , as is commonly the case in the arab world . calculated reactions however , the harsh reactions to the cartoon overstep the boundaries of acceptable protests .
even though the mohammed caricature provokes , it by no means justifies an incitement to murder or a call for boycotts .
it is also not reason enough for the arab world to instrumentalize the protests for political purposes . in the arab world , particularly in iraq , hundred of people are killed and mosques and churches attacked weekly .
but neither politicians nor mass demonstrations criticize the situation .
thus , one could presume political rather than religious motives are behind the exaggerated reactions to the mohammed cartoon . islamist groups are attempting to channel the hatred against the west to bolster their own political influence .
through their apparent solidarity with the wave of protest arab governments can detract from domestic failure and discredit western calls for reform .
most likely they will also take advantage of the situation to cut back on freedom of the press in their countries . the escalation of events in the palestinian territories on thursday is a good example of how political groups have instrumentalized the raging sentiments .
it was n't hamas or jihad that fueled the violent protests , but rather the militant arm of the secular fatah party , which lost last week 's parliamentary election .
for them , the protests offered the perfect opportunity to express frustration over the lost ballot . one-sided reporting in arab media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar based tv channel al jazeera led with the story ... and protests .
up until now , the arab media has taken a differentiated approach to covering the dispute .
while well-known media groups such as al jazeera addressed the topic in the most prominent manner , even the renowned , trans-arabic newspaper alhayat placed the topic in the second and third most visible positions .
media close to the government as well as relatively independent media quickly showed solidarity with their readers that the illustration of the prophet was both deeming and offensive .
critical voices remained the exception . the editorialist for the jordanian newspaper al-shihan was one of the exceptions .
in an opinion piece , he provoked readers by asking : " what damages islam the most : these drawings or pictures showing hostage takers decapitating their victims in front of running cameras , or a suicide bomber who decides to detonate himself at a wedding in amman ? " difficult dialogue europe - and germany in particular - have gone to great extents in recent years to intensify their dialogue with the arab and islamic world .
but now the dispute over the cartoon threatens to reverse any progress in bringing the two sides together .
it is the view of many arab commentators that such publications only help the extremist groups who are not interested in interacting with the west .
according to abd albari atwan , editor-in-chief of the pan-arabic newspaper al quds al-arabi , targeted offenses such as the caricature only serve to poison the relationship between islam and the west .
further publications in other european countries will only widen the rift between the two sides . ibrahim mohamad -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mohammed cartoon conflict gets even hotter the controversy over danish editorial cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed has widened , escalating into an armed standoff in the gaza strip .

" that 's not the way of having a dialogue , a conversation , " said the journalist , who has reported for arab media from denmark for more than 20 years . while the cartoon row has exploded in a wave of protests across the middle east and opened a debate around the world , danish analysts say closer to home , they represent the problems denmark has regarding immigration , particularly of its muslim community . he is one of the co-initiators of a so-called " alternative network , " a group of danish muslims who started to meet recently to provide journalists and others a wider spectrum of views from the muslim community . " some call us moderate muslims , some call us secular muslims , we call ourselves muslims , " said al-habahbeh .
" we do n't go to mosques .
we are european muslims and do n't want to be represented by the imams .
our aim is to offer an islamic voice in the dialogue . "
denmark in crisis when it comes to muslims , denmark is in the midst of a crisis , which has been provoked by the danish government , according to al-habahbeh .
the populist anti-immigrant danish people 's party has played a prominent role in antagonizing danish muslims . leading members of the party have openly said islam is not a religion but a terrorist organization .
and without the far-right party 's support , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's minority coalition of liberals and conservatives would neither have been able to come to power nor to stay there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen could have prevented the conflict , al-habahbeh said an opinion poll carried out between monday and wednesday this week , when the controversy reached a climax with riots in the gaza strip , showed that the people 's party has profited .
danish support for the party increased from 12.1 percent to 14.5 percent , greens polling group said .
both of the governing parties ' standings remained stable . on the opposite side from people 's party , the centrist det radikale venstre - whose most vocal personality in the current conflict , parliamentarian naser khader , is also a co-initiator of the alternative network of muslims - saw its support increase from 9.2 to 10.7 percent . " the mohammed drawings go straight back to the immigrant debate , " political scientist lars bille of copenhagen university told boersen newspaper .
" the fronts are becoming sharper .
and here people are looking towards -lrb- det radikale venstre -rrb- and the people 's party , which each make up a pole in the debate . "
fodder for the taking in such an inflamed atmosphere , the offending cartoons themselves were n't the real issue , al-habahbeh said .
instead they merely offered fodder to muslim extremists as well as to the danish right-wing . " the cartoons are being misused both by muslim extremists and the right wing here in denmark , " said al-habahbeh .
" the islamists and the extremists -lrb- are using them -rrb- to further their aims , saying that they attack islam to further the clash of civilizations .
" the right-wing groups are using them to say that a muslim can never be a democrat , " he added .
" the actions taken by those in some arab countries , like flag-burning , are also being used to strengthen racist arguments here in denmark . "
message to the danes the journalist said the government could have prevented the whole conflict from escalating three months ago when 11 arab ambassadors asked to see him concerning the cartoons .
instead rasmussen sent a message to the danes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian muslims protest in jakarta on friday " when the prime minister said ' no ' to meeting the ambassadors he was not talking to the ambassadors ; he was talking to the voters . " though the current conflict may eventually be overcome , al-habahbeh said , he does n't have high hopes that the deeper crisis will be resolved anytime soon . " even though the paper apologized , it wo n't make a difference .
because muslims in europe demand some respect as human beings , as danes , " he said .
" without fulfilling these demands i do n't think the crisis will stop .

" that 's not the way of having a dialogue , a conversation , " said the journalist , who has reported for arab media from denmark for more than 20 years . while the cartoon row has exploded in a wave of protests across the middle east and opened a debate around the world , danish analysts say closer to home , they represent the problems denmark has regarding immigration , particularly of its muslim community . he is one of the co-initiators of a so-called " alternative network , " a group of danish muslims who started to meet recently to provide journalists and others a wider spectrum of views from the muslim community . " some call us moderate muslims , some call us secular muslims , we call ourselves muslims , " said al-habahbeh .
" we do n't go to mosques .
we are european muslims and do n't want to be represented by the imams .
our aim is to offer an islamic voice in the dialogue . "
denmark in crisis when it comes to muslims , denmark is in the midst of a crisis , which has been provoked by the danish government , according to al-habahbeh .
the populist anti-immigrant danish people 's party has played a prominent role in antagonizing danish muslims . leading members of the party have openly said islam is not a religion but a terrorist organization .
and without the far-right party 's support , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's minority coalition of liberals and conservatives would neither have been able to come to power nor to stay there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen could have prevented the conflict , al-habahbeh said an opinion poll carried out between monday and wednesday this week , when the controversy reached a climax with riots in the gaza strip , showed that the people 's party has profited .
danish support for the party increased from 12.1 percent to 14.5 percent , greens polling group said .
both of the governing parties ' standings remained stable . on the opposite side from people 's party , the centrist det radikale venstre - whose most vocal personality in the current conflict , parliamentarian naser khader , is also a co-initiator of the alternative network of muslims - saw its support increase from 9.2 to 10.7 percent . " the mohammed drawings go straight back to the immigrant debate , " political scientist lars bille of copenhagen university told boersen newspaper .
" the fronts are becoming sharper .
and here people are looking towards -lrb- det radikale venstre -rrb- and the people 's party , which each make up a pole in the debate . "
fodder for the taking in such an inflamed atmosphere , the offending cartoons themselves were n't the real issue , al-habahbeh said .
instead they merely offered fodder to muslim extremists as well as to the danish right-wing . " the cartoons are being misused both by muslim extremists and the right wing here in denmark , " said al-habahbeh .
" the islamists and the extremists -lrb- are using them -rrb- to further their aims , saying that they attack islam to further the clash of civilizations .
" the right-wing groups are using them to say that a muslim can never be a democrat , " he added .
" the actions taken by those in some arab countries , like flag-burning , are also being used to strengthen racist arguments here in denmark . "
message to the danes the journalist said the government could have prevented the whole conflict from escalating three months ago when 11 arab ambassadors asked to see him concerning the cartoons .
instead rasmussen sent a message to the danes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian muslims protest in jakarta on friday " when the prime minister said ' no ' to meeting the ambassadors he was not talking to the ambassadors ; he was talking to the voters . " though the current conflict may eventually be overcome , al-habahbeh said , he does n't have high hopes that the deeper crisis will be resolved anytime soon . " even though the paper apologized , it wo n't make a difference .
because muslims in europe demand some respect as human beings , as danes , " he said .
" without fulfilling these demands i do n't think the crisis will stop .

" it was totally forgotten .
local farmers never reclaimed the land , so gradually the bushes and thickets took it over .
only if you looked could you see a rough outline of the fortifications , " said local deputy jean-marc lefranc . traces of history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gary sterne posing with rusty german ammunition from world war ii after extensive research in european archives , sterne found contemporary maps that pinpointed the site of the complex , on high ground above omaha beach at the western end of the d-day frontline .
he then set about buying the land plot by plot from local owners . after several months of clearing work , a dozen buildings in stone and concrete have been discovered linked by 1,500 meters of tunnels .
different areas have been identified as a sick bay , officers ' quarters , radio room and kitchens . the position appeared to have been looted after it was abandoned by the germans , and even the floor tiles had disappeared .
but sterne found some personal belongings including boots , spectacles and small bottles of medicine . on one wall was the inscription : " bill fornia - ohio " . a trap for the allies according to sterne , " discovery of the maisy battery answers some of the questions surrounding the high mortality rate among americans on omaha beach .

in a renowned operation us rangers stormed a german position at the pointe du hoc , only to find that the guns they were looking for were not there . " the big cannons supposedly installed at the pointe du hoc were a german war ruse aimed at drawing allied fire .
but all the time this neighboring battery was totally invisible and continued pounding the beaches till june 9 , " said sterne . a future tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the complex at grandcamp-maisy will soon be open to public the complex is believed to have contained four batteries of 155 millimeter cannon , with two others positioned in nearby fields , as well as four 105 millimeter guns .
twelve 88 millimeter guns ensured anti-aircraft defense , and there were several machine-gun nests and two renault tanks . some local historians , however , are more cautious . " the discovery of the site is interesting but not vitally important .
it is not one of the biggest complexes along the atlantic wall , " said marc pottier , a historian at the war memorial at the norman city of caen . the site will be opened to the public in march . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coming to terms with vichy for years , france preferred to remember those who resisted the nazis , rather than those who collaborated with them .

" it was totally forgotten .
local farmers never reclaimed the land , so gradually the bushes and thickets took it over .

he then set about buying the land plot by plot from local owners . after several months of clearing work , a dozen buildings in stone and concrete have been discovered linked by 1,500 meters of tunnels .
different areas have been identified as a sick bay , officers ' quarters , radio room and kitchens . the position appeared to have been looted after it was abandoned by the germans , and even the floor tiles had disappeared .
but sterne found some personal belongings including boots , spectacles and small bottles of medicine . on one wall was the inscription : " bill fornia - ohio " . a trap for the allies according to sterne , " discovery of the maisy battery answers some of the questions surrounding the high mortality rate among americans on omaha beach .

in a renowned operation us rangers stormed a german position at the pointe du hoc , only to find that the guns they were looking for were not there . " the big cannons supposedly installed at the pointe du hoc were a german war ruse aimed at drawing allied fire .
but all the time this neighboring battery was totally invisible and continued pounding the beaches till june 9 , " said sterne . a future tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the complex at grandcamp-maisy will soon be open to public the complex is believed to have contained four batteries of 155 millimeter cannon , with two others positioned in nearby fields , as well as four 105 millimeter guns .
twelve 88 millimeter guns ensured anti-aircraft defense , and there were several machine-gun nests and two renault tanks . some local historians , however , are more cautious . " the discovery of the site is interesting but not vitally important .
it is not one of the biggest complexes along the atlantic wall , " said marc pottier , a historian at the war memorial at the norman city of caen . the site will be opened to the public in march . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coming to terms with vichy for years , france preferred to remember those who resisted the nazis , rather than those who collaborated with them .

european parliamentarians have also voted to keep aid going . on thursday , about a dozen gunmen connected to palestinian leader mahmoud abbas ' fatah party surrounded the eu commission 's office in gaza city .
they demanded that the governments of denmark , france , germany and norway apologize for cartoons of mohammed published in newspapers in those countries . armed palestinians also threatened a " tough response " for further reprints of the cartoons in front of the french cultural center . despite the threats , eu officials said they were not going to suspend aid - at least for now . " if the situation gets more complicated then obviously for us it will not be easy to deal with it , " european commission spokeswoman emma udwin said , according to ap news service . parliame n taria n s vote for aid u n der co n ditio n s european lawmakers meanwhile voted on thursday to continue aid payments to palestinians as long as a future government led by radical islamist group hamas , the winner of last month 's parliamentary elections , renounces violence and seeks peace with israel . bildunterschrift : general view of the european parliament in strasbourg in a resolution , members of the european parliament , who have to approve any aid payments , said the eu should remain the biggest donor to the palestinian territories .
the bloc currently donates 500 million euros -lrb- $ 605 million -rrb- annually . parliamentarians agreed that future aid " will be dependent on the new government 's clarification on denouncing violence and recognizing israel , " an approach mirrored by the bloc 's foreign ministers , who adopted a similar policy at a meeting on monday . according to reuters news service , deputies also urged the middle east quartet - the united nations , united states , european union and russia - to take a " strong and urgent initiative " to promote negotiations between palestinians and israelis . hamas has been placed on an eu list of banned terrorist groups ; it has carried out almost 60 suicide bombings over the last six years . palesti n ia n calls to work with hamas eu parliamentarians also said that the faction 's election victory was the result of a desire for reforms and dissatisfaction among the palestinian population with the previous government . the palestinian authority 's representative to the eu , leila shahid , meanwhile told parliamentarians on wednesday that the western world would make a mistake if it did not recognize a hamas-led government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the eu cooperate with hamas leader ismail haniyeh ?
" if you reject hamas , it would be perceived in the region as rejection of democratic principles , " she told a conference in the european parliament in brussels , according to online news site euobserver .
" the eu must not allow the result of the election to conceal the fantastic performance that the election was .
it was transparent and in respect of pluralism , and that in a society where pluralism has been condemned .
if you create unity with hamas - not against - this can be positive .

" it was totally forgotten .
local farmers never reclaimed the land , so gradually the bushes and thickets took it over .
only if you looked could you see a rough outline of the fortifications , " said local deputy jean-marc lefranc . traces of history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gary sterne posing with rusty german ammunition from world war ii after extensive research in european archives , sterne found contemporary maps that pinpointed the site of the complex , on high ground above omaha beach at the western end of the d-day frontline .
he then set about buying the land plot by plot from local owners . after several months of clearing work , a dozen buildings in stone and concrete have been discovered linked by 1,500 meters of tunnels .
different areas have been identified as a sick bay , officers ' quarters , radio room and kitchens . the position appeared to have been looted after it was abandoned by the germans , and even the floor tiles had disappeared .
but sterne found some personal belongings including boots , spectacles and small bottles of medicine . on one wall was the inscription : " bill fornia - ohio " . a trap for the allies according to sterne , " discovery of the maisy battery answers some of the questions surrounding the high mortality rate among americans on omaha beach .

in a renowned operation us rangers stormed a german position at the pointe du hoc , only to find that the guns they were looking for were not there . " the big cannons supposedly installed at the pointe du hoc were a german war ruse aimed at drawing allied fire .
but all the time this neighboring battery was totally invisible and continued pounding the beaches till june 9 , " said sterne . a future tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the complex at grandcamp-maisy will soon be open to public the complex is believed to have contained four batteries of 155 millimeter cannon , with two others positioned in nearby fields , as well as four 105 millimeter guns .
twelve 88 millimeter guns ensured anti-aircraft defense , and there were several machine-gun nests and two renault tanks . some local historians , however , are more cautious . " the discovery of the site is interesting but not vitally important .
it is not one of the biggest complexes along the atlantic wall , " said marc pottier , a historian at the war memorial at the norman city of caen . the site will be opened to the public in march . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coming to terms with vichy for years , france preferred to remember those who resisted the nazis , rather than those who collaborated with them .

" difficult to detect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetic doping is more difficult to trace than traditional performance-enhancing drugs the international olympic committee and world anti-doping agency have already banned the use of synthetic epo among athletes , but are yet to design a test for repoxygen , which teaches human cells to produce epo on their own . the difficulty of producing such a test lies in the fact that repoxygen allows the body to switch the gene on in response to law oxygen levels and switch it off after the levels have been raised . repoxygen was prototyped in 2002 by the british pharmaceutical company oxford biomedica but never went into production since the company did n't believe it could compete with the availability of synthetic epo on the market .
the product , nonetheless , caught the attention of the anti-doping agencies at the time . " you can turn it on and off , " said larry bowers , the managing director of the us anti-doping agency after a meeting in atlanta in oct .
2002 . " it acts more or less like the body , " bowers said . playing with fire how repoxygen could have made it to the black market is still not known .
professor alan kingsman , oxford biomedica 's chief executive , claims that his company maintains strict controls over its products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some like it big and are willing to pop as many pills as they can " i 'd be extremely surprised if anything we made got on to the black market , " said kingsman . according to kingsman , only a fairly advanced lab could reproduce repoxygen based on the information which was made available by oxford biomedica . " but if would be very irresponsible for a number of reasons , " kingsman said .
" for a start , we only went as far as testing it on mice .
to use it in the human body would be playing with fire . " a bad omen for the olympics most experts were taken by surprise by the revelations of the springstein case , since the general opinion was that genetic doping was not practiced and that it would not become an actual threat before the 2008 beijing olympics .
the news of genetic doping will now unavoidably loom over the turin winter games , which start next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the xx winter olympic games is scheduled for feb .
10 in turin " we have been expecting gene doping , but not so soon .
i do n't know how they have it , but they do , " said werner franke , a german cell biologist who has studied numerous doping cases in the former east germany . " this is worse than in the gdr and more brutal than the balco scandal , " franke said . the founder of the us balco labs was sentenced to four months in a minimum security prison and four months of home confinement last year for masterminding the distribution of illegal steroids among elite athletes . a criminal act the german athletics association -lrb- dlv -rrb- has urged the lawmakers to explicitly outlaw genetic doping , citing the difficulty which various sports bodies would have in monitoring the practice . " we need tighter laws , " said dlv president clemens prokop . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will grit breuer 's gold medals for germany be tarnished ?
the 47-year-old springstein faces a stiff jail sentence if found guilty of supplying drugs to minors back in 2003 , especially if the accusations of genetic doping are confirmed . springstein has also been accused of giving several injections to one of his female athletes to treat an injury despite not having a viable medical permit . before the doping scandal came to light , springstein worked with some of germany 's top athletes , including east german track stars katrin krabbe and grit breuer , who were both suspended for two years for using the banned steroid clenbuterol in 1992 . krabbe won the 100m and 200m world titles in 1991 while breuer , who is springstein 's partner , won the 1990 european title at 400 meters . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conflicting evidence masks the bald facts in doping case nemanja vucicevic , striker for bundesliga team 1860 munich , failed a drugs test after a game earlier this month , soccer authorities revealed monday .

" that 's not the way of having a dialogue , a conversation , " said the journalist , who has reported for arab media from denmark for more than 20 years . while the cartoon row has exploded in a wave of protests across the middle east and opened a debate around the world , danish analysts say closer to home , they represent the problems denmark has regarding immigration , particularly of its muslim community . he is one of the co-initiators of a so-called " alternative network , " a group of danish muslims who started to meet recently to provide journalists and others a wider spectrum of views from the muslim community . " some call us moderate muslims , some call us secular muslims , we call ourselves muslims , " said al-habahbeh .
" we do n't go to mosques .
we are european muslims and do n't want to be represented by the imams .
our aim is to offer an islamic voice in the dialogue . "
denmark in crisis when it comes to muslims , denmark is in the midst of a crisis , which has been provoked by the danish government , according to al-habahbeh .
the populist anti-immigrant danish people 's party has played a prominent role in antagonizing danish muslims . leading members of the party have openly said islam is not a religion but a terrorist organization .
and without the far-right party 's support , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's minority coalition of liberals and conservatives would neither have been able to come to power nor to stay there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen could have prevented the conflict , al-habahbeh said an opinion poll carried out between monday and wednesday this week , when the controversy reached a climax with riots in the gaza strip , showed that the people 's party has profited .
danish support for the party increased from 12.1 percent to 14.5 percent , greens polling group said .
both of the governing parties ' standings remained stable . on the opposite side from people 's party , the centrist det radikale venstre - whose most vocal personality in the current conflict , parliamentarian naser khader , is also a co-initiator of the alternative network of muslims - saw its support increase from 9.2 to 10.7 percent . " the mohammed drawings go straight back to the immigrant debate , " political scientist lars bille of copenhagen university told boersen newspaper .
" the fronts are becoming sharper .
and here people are looking towards -lrb- det radikale venstre -rrb- and the people 's party , which each make up a pole in the debate . "
fodder for the taking in such an inflamed atmosphere , the offending cartoons themselves were n't the real issue , al-habahbeh said .
instead they merely offered fodder to muslim extremists as well as to the danish right-wing . " the cartoons are being misused both by muslim extremists and the right wing here in denmark , " said al-habahbeh .
" the islamists and the extremists -lrb- are using them -rrb- to further their aims , saying that they attack islam to further the clash of civilizations .
" the right-wing groups are using them to say that a muslim can never be a democrat , " he added .
" the actions taken by those in some arab countries , like flag-burning , are also being used to strengthen racist arguments here in denmark . "
message to the danes the journalist said the government could have prevented the whole conflict from escalating three months ago when 11 arab ambassadors asked to see him concerning the cartoons .
instead rasmussen sent a message to the danes .

" though the current conflict may eventually be overcome , al-habahbeh said , he does n't have high hopes that the deeper crisis will be resolved anytime soon . " even though the paper apologized , it wo n't make a difference .

he then set about buying the land plot by plot from local owners . after several months of clearing work , a dozen buildings in stone and concrete have been discovered linked by 1,500 meters of tunnels .
different areas have been identified as a sick bay , officers ' quarters , radio room and kitchens . the position appeared to have been looted after it was abandoned by the germans , and even the floor tiles had disappeared .
but sterne found some personal belongings including boots , spectacles and small bottles of medicine . on one wall was the inscription : " bill fornia - ohio " . a trap for the allies according to sterne , " discovery of the maisy battery answers some of the questions surrounding the high mortality rate among americans on omaha beach .

not only does islam forbid the illustration of the prophet , it sharply condemns any form of blasphemy .
many muslims see in the cartoon a demeaning connection between their religion and terrorism and have responded with angry protests . in more than 25 countries , enraged muslims took to the streets to protest the caricature .
they burned danish flags and called for a boycott of danish products .
there were even numerous threats , including bomb threats targeting western citizens and diplomatic missions .
some , such as the kuwaiti islam scholar sheik nasem almisbah , even called for the death of the cartoonist . the majority of arab governments only made matters worse by adding fuel to the fire of angry protestors rather than seeking to calm them .
saudi arabia , kuwait and libya , for instance , recalled their ambassadors to denmark and demanded a severe punishment for those responsible as well as an official apology from the danish government . no separation of church and state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims feel personally offended by the caricatures and the attitudes behind printing them .
such demands show that arab governments are incapable of understanding the relationship between the state and freedom of expression as it is practiced in europe .
while the right to free speech is anchored in european constitutions and a clear separation between church and state defines daily life , islam dominates daily life in the arab world .
as a result many muslims can not comprehend the differentiation in europe .
they feel personally offended as soon as their religion is presented in a hurtful manner .
they also do not understand that politicians in the western world have no direct influence over the media , as is commonly the case in the arab world . calculated reactions however , the harsh reactions to the cartoon overstep the boundaries of acceptable protests .
even though the mohammed caricature provokes , it by no means justifies an incitement to murder or a call for boycotts .
it is also not reason enough for the arab world to instrumentalize the protests for political purposes . in the arab world , particularly in iraq , hundred of people are killed and mosques and churches attacked weekly .
but neither politicians nor mass demonstrations criticize the situation .
thus , one could presume political rather than religious motives are behind the exaggerated reactions to the mohammed cartoon . islamist groups are attempting to channel the hatred against the west to bolster their own political influence .
through their apparent solidarity with the wave of protest arab governments can detract from domestic failure and discredit western calls for reform .
most likely they will also take advantage of the situation to cut back on freedom of the press in their countries . the escalation of events in the palestinian territories on thursday is a good example of how political groups have instrumentalized the raging sentiments .
it was n't hamas or jihad that fueled the violent protests , but rather the militant arm of the secular fatah party , which lost last week 's parliamentary election .
for them , the protests offered the perfect opportunity to express frustration over the lost ballot . one-sided reporting in arab media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar based tv channel al jazeera led with the story ... and protests .
up until now , the arab media has taken a differentiated approach to covering the dispute .
while well-known media groups such as al jazeera addressed the topic in the most prominent manner , even the renowned , trans-arabic newspaper alhayat placed the topic in the second and third most visible positions .

not only does islam forbid the illustration of the prophet , it sharply condemns any form of blasphemy .
many muslims see in the cartoon a demeaning connection between their religion and terrorism and have responded with angry protests . in more than 25 countries , enraged muslims took to the streets to protest the caricature .
they burned danish flags and called for a boycott of danish products .
there were even numerous threats , including bomb threats targeting western citizens and diplomatic missions .
some , such as the kuwaiti islam scholar sheik nasem almisbah , even called for the death of the cartoonist . the majority of arab governments only made matters worse by adding fuel to the fire of angry protestors rather than seeking to calm them .

such demands show that arab governments are incapable of understanding the relationship between the state and freedom of expression as it is practiced in europe .
while the right to free speech is anchored in european constitutions and a clear separation between church and state defines daily life , islam dominates daily life in the arab world .
as a result many muslims can not comprehend the differentiation in europe .
they feel personally offended as soon as their religion is presented in a hurtful manner .
they also do not understand that politicians in the western world have no direct influence over the media , as is commonly the case in the arab world . calculated reactions however , the harsh reactions to the cartoon overstep the boundaries of acceptable protests .
even though the mohammed caricature provokes , it by no means justifies an incitement to murder or a call for boycotts .
it is also not reason enough for the arab world to instrumentalize the protests for political purposes . in the arab world , particularly in iraq , hundred of people are killed and mosques and churches attacked weekly .
but neither politicians nor mass demonstrations criticize the situation .
thus , one could presume political rather than religious motives are behind the exaggerated reactions to the mohammed cartoon . islamist groups are attempting to channel the hatred against the west to bolster their own political influence .
through their apparent solidarity with the wave of protest arab governments can detract from domestic failure and discredit western calls for reform .
most likely they will also take advantage of the situation to cut back on freedom of the press in their countries . the escalation of events in the palestinian territories on thursday is a good example of how political groups have instrumentalized the raging sentiments .
it was n't hamas or jihad that fueled the violent protests , but rather the militant arm of the secular fatah party , which lost last week 's parliamentary election .

european parliamentarians have also voted to keep aid going . on thursday , about a dozen gunmen connected to palestinian leader mahmoud abbas ' fatah party surrounded the eu commission 's office in gaza city .
they demanded that the governments of denmark , france , germany and norway apologize for cartoons of mohammed published in newspapers in those countries . armed palestinians also threatened a " tough response " for further reprints of the cartoons in front of the french cultural center . despite the threats , eu officials said they were not going to suspend aid - at least for now . " if the situation gets more complicated then obviously for us it will not be easy to deal with it , " european commission spokeswoman emma udwin said , according to ap news service . parliame n taria n s vote for aid u n der co n ditio n s european lawmakers meanwhile voted on thursday to continue aid payments to palestinians as long as a future government led by radical islamist group hamas , the winner of last month 's parliamentary elections , renounces violence and seeks peace with israel . bildunterschrift : general view of the european parliament in strasbourg in a resolution , members of the european parliament , who have to approve any aid payments , said the eu should remain the biggest donor to the palestinian territories .
the bloc currently donates 500 million euros -lrb- $ 605 million -rrb- annually . parliamentarians agreed that future aid " will be dependent on the new government 's clarification on denouncing violence and recognizing israel , " an approach mirrored by the bloc 's foreign ministers , who adopted a similar policy at a meeting on monday . according to reuters news service , deputies also urged the middle east quartet - the united nations , united states , european union and russia - to take a " strong and urgent initiative " to promote negotiations between palestinians and israelis . hamas has been placed on an eu list of banned terrorist groups ; it has carried out almost 60 suicide bombings over the last six years . palesti n ia n calls to work with hamas eu parliamentarians also said that the faction 's election victory was the result of a desire for reforms and dissatisfaction among the palestinian population with the previous government . the palestinian authority 's representative to the eu , leila shahid , meanwhile told parliamentarians on wednesday that the western world would make a mistake if it did not recognize a hamas-led government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the eu cooperate with hamas leader ismail haniyeh ?
" if you reject hamas , it would be perceived in the region as rejection of democratic principles , " she told a conference in the european parliament in brussels , according to online news site euobserver .
" the eu must not allow the result of the election to conceal the fantastic performance that the election was .
it was transparent and in respect of pluralism , and that in a society where pluralism has been condemned .
if you create unity with hamas - not against - this can be positive .
the eu can impose conditionality in such a relationship .

" that 's not the way of having a dialogue , a conversation , " said the journalist , who has reported for arab media from denmark for more than 20 years . while the cartoon row has exploded in a wave of protests across the middle east and opened a debate around the world , danish analysts say closer to home , they represent the problems denmark has regarding immigration , particularly of its muslim community . he is one of the co-initiators of a so-called " alternative network , " a group of danish muslims who started to meet recently to provide journalists and others a wider spectrum of views from the muslim community . " some call us moderate muslims , some call us secular muslims , we call ourselves muslims , " said al-habahbeh .
" we do n't go to mosques .
we are european muslims and do n't want to be represented by the imams .
our aim is to offer an islamic voice in the dialogue . "
denmark in crisis when it comes to muslims , denmark is in the midst of a crisis , which has been provoked by the danish government , according to al-habahbeh .
the populist anti-immigrant danish people 's party has played a prominent role in antagonizing danish muslims . leading members of the party have openly said islam is not a religion but a terrorist organization .
and without the far-right party 's support , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's minority coalition of liberals and conservatives would neither have been able to come to power nor to stay there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen could have prevented the conflict , al-habahbeh said an opinion poll carried out between monday and wednesday this week , when the controversy reached a climax with riots in the gaza strip , showed that the people 's party has profited .
danish support for the party increased from 12.1 percent to 14.5 percent , greens polling group said .
both of the governing parties ' standings remained stable . on the opposite side from people 's party , the centrist det radikale venstre - whose most vocal personality in the current conflict , parliamentarian naser khader , is also a co-initiator of the alternative network of muslims - saw its support increase from 9.2 to 10.7 percent . " the mohammed drawings go straight back to the immigrant debate , " political scientist lars bille of copenhagen university told boersen newspaper .
" the fronts are becoming sharper .
and here people are looking towards -lrb- det radikale venstre -rrb- and the people 's party , which each make up a pole in the debate . "
fodder for the taking in such an inflamed atmosphere , the offending cartoons themselves were n't the real issue , al-habahbeh said .
instead they merely offered fodder to muslim extremists as well as to the danish right-wing . " the cartoons are being misused both by muslim extremists and the right wing here in denmark , " said al-habahbeh .
" the islamists and the extremists -lrb- are using them -rrb- to further their aims , saying that they attack islam to further the clash of civilizations .
" the right-wing groups are using them to say that a muslim can never be a democrat , " he added .
" the actions taken by those in some arab countries , like flag-burning , are also being used to strengthen racist arguments here in denmark . "
message to the danes the journalist said the government could have prevented the whole conflict from escalating three months ago when 11 arab ambassadors asked to see him concerning the cartoons .
instead rasmussen sent a message to the danes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian muslims protest in jakarta on friday " when the prime minister said ' no ' to meeting the ambassadors he was not talking to the ambassadors ; he was talking to the voters . " though the current conflict may eventually be overcome , al-habahbeh said , he does n't have high hopes that the deeper crisis will be resolved anytime soon . " even though the paper apologized , it wo n't make a difference .
because muslims in europe demand some respect as human beings , as danes , " he said .

" that 's not the way of having a dialogue , a conversation , " said the journalist , who has reported for arab media from denmark for more than 20 years . while the cartoon row has exploded in a wave of protests across the middle east and opened a debate around the world , danish analysts say closer to home , they represent the problems denmark has regarding immigration , particularly of its muslim community . he is one of the co-initiators of a so-called " alternative network , " a group of danish muslims who started to meet recently to provide journalists and others a wider spectrum of views from the muslim community .

denmark in crisis when it comes to muslims , denmark is in the midst of a crisis , which has been provoked by the danish government , according to al-habahbeh .
the populist anti-immigrant danish people 's party has played a prominent role in antagonizing danish muslims . leading members of the party have openly said islam is not a religion but a terrorist organization .
and without the far-right party 's support , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's minority coalition of liberals and conservatives would neither have been able to come to power nor to stay there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen could have prevented the conflict , al-habahbeh said an opinion poll carried out between monday and wednesday this week , when the controversy reached a climax with riots in the gaza strip , showed that the people 's party has profited .
danish support for the party increased from 12.1 percent to 14.5 percent , greens polling group said .
both of the governing parties ' standings remained stable . on the opposite side from people 's party , the centrist det radikale venstre - whose most vocal personality in the current conflict , parliamentarian naser khader , is also a co-initiator of the alternative network of muslims - saw its support increase from 9.2 to 10.7 percent . " the mohammed drawings go straight back to the immigrant debate , " political scientist lars bille of copenhagen university told boersen newspaper .
" the fronts are becoming sharper .
and here people are looking towards -lrb- det radikale venstre -rrb- and the people 's party , which each make up a pole in the debate . "
fodder for the taking in such an inflamed atmosphere , the offending cartoons themselves were n't the real issue , al-habahbeh said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.02.2006 german coach suspected of genetic doping großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former coach thomas springstein has a lot to worry about these days a german athletics coach is believed to have used genetic doping - the practice of manipulating the human genetic code to increase muscle mass , blood production , or endurance .
experts are taken by surprise . the trial of the disgraced german athletics coach thomas springstein , who has been accused of giving performance-enhancing drugs to minors , took an eerie turn this week when the court in the eastern german town of magdeburg was presented with evidence pointing to springstein 's involvement in genetic doping . e-mails sent and received by springstein , a one-time coach of the german athletics association -lrb- dlv -rrb- , which were seized by the police during a raid on springstein 's home , brought up references to repoxygen - a banned substance meant to be used in gene therapy to treat patients with anemia . repoxygen helps to induce a controlled release of erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- , a substance that stimulates the production of red blood cells , thereby increasing the amount of oxygen the blood can deliver to the muscles . in one email , springstein wrote that " new repoxygen is hard to get .
please give me new instructions soon so that i can order the product before christmas . " difficult to detect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetic doping is more difficult to trace than traditional performance-enhancing drugs the international olympic committee and world anti-doping agency have already banned the use of synthetic epo among athletes , but are yet to design a test for repoxygen , which teaches human cells to produce epo on their own . the difficulty of producing such a test lies in the fact that repoxygen allows the body to switch the gene on in response to law oxygen levels and switch it off after the levels have been raised . repoxygen was prototyped in 2002 by the british pharmaceutical company oxford biomedica but never went into production since the company did n't believe it could compete with the availability of synthetic epo on the market .
the product , nonetheless , caught the attention of the anti-doping agencies at the time . " you can turn it on and off , " said larry bowers , the managing director of the us anti-doping agency after a meeting in atlanta in oct .
2002 . " it acts more or less like the body , " bowers said . playing with fire how repoxygen could have made it to the black market is still not known .
professor alan kingsman , oxford biomedica 's chief executive , claims that his company maintains strict controls over its products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some like it big and are willing to pop as many pills as they can " i 'd be extremely surprised if anything we made got on to the black market , " said kingsman . according to kingsman , only a fairly advanced lab could reproduce repoxygen based on the information which was made available by oxford biomedica . " but if would be very irresponsible for a number of reasons , " kingsman said .
" for a start , we only went as far as testing it on mice .
to use it in the human body would be playing with fire . " a bad omen for the olympics most experts were taken by surprise by the revelations of the springstein case , since the general opinion was that genetic doping was not practiced and that it would not become an actual threat before the 2008 beijing olympics .
the news of genetic doping will now unavoidably loom over the turin winter games , which start next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the xx winter olympic games is scheduled for feb .
10 in turin " we have been expecting gene doping , but not so soon .
i do n't know how they have it , but they do , " said werner franke , a german cell biologist who has studied numerous doping cases in the former east germany . " this is worse than in the gdr and more brutal than the balco scandal , " franke said . the founder of the us balco labs was sentenced to four months in a minimum security prison and four months of home confinement last year for masterminding the distribution of illegal steroids among elite athletes . a criminal act the german athletics association -lrb- dlv -rrb- has urged the lawmakers to explicitly outlaw genetic doping , citing the difficulty which various sports bodies would have in monitoring the practice . " we need tighter laws , " said dlv president clemens prokop . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will grit breuer 's gold medals for germany be tarnished ?
the 47-year-old springstein faces a stiff jail sentence if found guilty of supplying drugs to minors back in 2003 , especially if the accusations of genetic doping are confirmed . springstein has also been accused of giving several injections to one of his female athletes to treat an injury despite not having a viable medical permit . before the doping scandal came to light , springstein worked with some of germany 's top athletes , including east german track stars katrin krabbe and grit breuer , who were both suspended for two years for using the banned steroid clenbuterol in 1992 . krabbe won the 100m and 200m world titles in 1991 while breuer , who is springstein 's partner , won the 1990 european title at 400 meters . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conflicting evidence masks the bald facts in doping case nemanja vucicevic , striker for bundesliga team 1860 munich , failed a drugs test after a game earlier this month , soccer authorities revealed monday .

not only does islam forbid the illustration of the prophet , it sharply condemns any form of blasphemy .
many muslims see in the cartoon a demeaning connection between their religion and terrorism and have responded with angry protests . in more than 25 countries , enraged muslims took to the streets to protest the caricature .
they burned danish flags and called for a boycott of danish products .
there were even numerous threats , including bomb threats targeting western citizens and diplomatic missions .
some , such as the kuwaiti islam scholar sheik nasem almisbah , even called for the death of the cartoonist . the majority of arab governments only made matters worse by adding fuel to the fire of angry protestors rather than seeking to calm them .
saudi arabia , kuwait and libya , for instance , recalled their ambassadors to denmark and demanded a severe punishment for those responsible as well as an official apology from the danish government . no separation of church and state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims feel personally offended by the caricatures and the attitudes behind printing them .
such demands show that arab governments are incapable of understanding the relationship between the state and freedom of expression as it is practiced in europe .
while the right to free speech is anchored in european constitutions and a clear separation between church and state defines daily life , islam dominates daily life in the arab world .
as a result many muslims can not comprehend the differentiation in europe .
they feel personally offended as soon as their religion is presented in a hurtful manner .
they also do not understand that politicians in the western world have no direct influence over the media , as is commonly the case in the arab world . calculated reactions however , the harsh reactions to the cartoon overstep the boundaries of acceptable protests .
even though the mohammed caricature provokes , it by no means justifies an incitement to murder or a call for boycotts .
it is also not reason enough for the arab world to instrumentalize the protests for political purposes . in the arab world , particularly in iraq , hundred of people are killed and mosques and churches attacked weekly .
but neither politicians nor mass demonstrations criticize the situation .
thus , one could presume political rather than religious motives are behind the exaggerated reactions to the mohammed cartoon . islamist groups are attempting to channel the hatred against the west to bolster their own political influence .
through their apparent solidarity with the wave of protest arab governments can detract from domestic failure and discredit western calls for reform .
most likely they will also take advantage of the situation to cut back on freedom of the press in their countries . the escalation of events in the palestinian territories on thursday is a good example of how political groups have instrumentalized the raging sentiments .
it was n't hamas or jihad that fueled the violent protests , but rather the militant arm of the secular fatah party , which lost last week 's parliamentary election .
for them , the protests offered the perfect opportunity to express frustration over the lost ballot . one-sided reporting in arab media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar based tv channel al jazeera led with the story ... and protests .
up until now , the arab media has taken a differentiated approach to covering the dispute .
while well-known media groups such as al jazeera addressed the topic in the most prominent manner , even the renowned , trans-arabic newspaper alhayat placed the topic in the second and third most visible positions .
media close to the government as well as relatively independent media quickly showed solidarity with their readers that the illustration of the prophet was both deeming and offensive .
critical voices remained the exception . the editorialist for the jordanian newspaper al-shihan was one of the exceptions .
in an opinion piece , he provoked readers by asking : " what damages islam the most : these drawings or pictures showing hostage takers decapitating their victims in front of running cameras , or a suicide bomber who decides to detonate himself at a wedding in amman ? " difficult dialogue europe - and germany in particular - have gone to great extents in recent years to intensify their dialogue with the arab and islamic world .
but now the dispute over the cartoon threatens to reverse any progress in bringing the two sides together .
it is the view of many arab commentators that such publications only help the extremist groups who are not interested in interacting with the west .
according to abd albari atwan , editor-in-chief of the pan-arabic newspaper al quds al-arabi , targeted offenses such as the caricature only serve to poison the relationship between islam and the west .

not only does islam forbid the illustration of the prophet , it sharply condemns any form of blasphemy .
many muslims see in the cartoon a demeaning connection between their religion and terrorism and have responded with angry protests . in more than 25 countries , enraged muslims took to the streets to protest the caricature .
they burned danish flags and called for a boycott of danish products .
there were even numerous threats , including bomb threats targeting western citizens and diplomatic missions .
some , such as the kuwaiti islam scholar sheik nasem almisbah , even called for the death of the cartoonist . the majority of arab governments only made matters worse by adding fuel to the fire of angry protestors rather than seeking to calm them .
saudi arabia , kuwait and libya , for instance , recalled their ambassadors to denmark and demanded a severe punishment for those responsible as well as an official apology from the danish government . no separation of church and state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims feel personally offended by the caricatures and the attitudes behind printing them .
such demands show that arab governments are incapable of understanding the relationship between the state and freedom of expression as it is practiced in europe .
while the right to free speech is anchored in european constitutions and a clear separation between church and state defines daily life , islam dominates daily life in the arab world .
as a result many muslims can not comprehend the differentiation in europe .
they feel personally offended as soon as their religion is presented in a hurtful manner .
they also do not understand that politicians in the western world have no direct influence over the media , as is commonly the case in the arab world . calculated reactions however , the harsh reactions to the cartoon overstep the boundaries of acceptable protests .
even though the mohammed caricature provokes , it by no means justifies an incitement to murder or a call for boycotts .
it is also not reason enough for the arab world to instrumentalize the protests for political purposes . in the arab world , particularly in iraq , hundred of people are killed and mosques and churches attacked weekly .
but neither politicians nor mass demonstrations criticize the situation .
thus , one could presume political rather than religious motives are behind the exaggerated reactions to the mohammed cartoon . islamist groups are attempting to channel the hatred against the west to bolster their own political influence .
through their apparent solidarity with the wave of protest arab governments can detract from domestic failure and discredit western calls for reform .
most likely they will also take advantage of the situation to cut back on freedom of the press in their countries . the escalation of events in the palestinian territories on thursday is a good example of how political groups have instrumentalized the raging sentiments .
it was n't hamas or jihad that fueled the violent protests , but rather the militant arm of the secular fatah party , which lost last week 's parliamentary election .
for them , the protests offered the perfect opportunity to express frustration over the lost ballot . one-sided reporting in arab media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar based tv channel al jazeera led with the story ... and protests .
up until now , the arab media has taken a differentiated approach to covering the dispute .
while well-known media groups such as al jazeera addressed the topic in the most prominent manner , even the renowned , trans-arabic newspaper alhayat placed the topic in the second and third most visible positions .
media close to the government as well as relatively independent media quickly showed solidarity with their readers that the illustration of the prophet was both deeming and offensive .
critical voices remained the exception . the editorialist for the jordanian newspaper al-shihan was one of the exceptions .
in an opinion piece , he provoked readers by asking : " what damages islam the most : these drawings or pictures showing hostage takers decapitating their victims in front of running cameras , or a suicide bomber who decides to detonate himself at a wedding in amman ? " difficult dialogue europe - and germany in particular - have gone to great extents in recent years to intensify their dialogue with the arab and islamic world .
but now the dispute over the cartoon threatens to reverse any progress in bringing the two sides together .
it is the view of many arab commentators that such publications only help the extremist groups who are not interested in interacting with the west .
according to abd albari atwan , editor-in-chief of the pan-arabic newspaper al quds al-arabi , targeted offenses such as the caricature only serve to poison the relationship between islam and the west .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons europe -pipe- 03.02.2006 analysis : arab protests are calculated political response großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the furor over the mohammed cartoon could be part of a political agenda mass protests , threats of violence and boycotts in the arab world are exaggerated reactions to the mohammed cartoon and an example of how governments instrumentalize hatred against the west for political purposes . the publication of a mohammed cartoon in the danish newspaper jyllands-posten has deeply offended the religious sentiments of the muslim community , who regard it as a western affront to their beliefs .
not only does islam forbid the illustration of the prophet , it sharply condemns any form of blasphemy .
many muslims see in the cartoon a demeaning connection between their religion and terrorism and have responded with angry protests . in more than 25 countries , enraged muslims took to the streets to protest the caricature .
they burned danish flags and called for a boycott of danish products .
there were even numerous threats , including bomb threats targeting western citizens and diplomatic missions .
some , such as the kuwaiti islam scholar sheik nasem almisbah , even called for the death of the cartoonist . the majority of arab governments only made matters worse by adding fuel to the fire of angry protestors rather than seeking to calm them .
saudi arabia , kuwait and libya , for instance , recalled their ambassadors to denmark and demanded a severe punishment for those responsible as well as an official apology from the danish government . no separation of church and state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims feel personally offended by the caricatures and the attitudes behind printing them .
such demands show that arab governments are incapable of understanding the relationship between the state and freedom of expression as it is practiced in europe .
while the right to free speech is anchored in european constitutions and a clear separation between church and state defines daily life , islam dominates daily life in the arab world .
as a result many muslims can not comprehend the differentiation in europe .
they feel personally offended as soon as their religion is presented in a hurtful manner .
they also do not understand that politicians in the western world have no direct influence over the media , as is commonly the case in the arab world . calculated reactions however , the harsh reactions to the cartoon overstep the boundaries of acceptable protests .
even though the mohammed caricature provokes , it by no means justifies an incitement to murder or a call for boycotts .
it is also not reason enough for the arab world to instrumentalize the protests for political purposes . in the arab world , particularly in iraq , hundred of people are killed and mosques and churches attacked weekly .
but neither politicians nor mass demonstrations criticize the situation .
thus , one could presume political rather than religious motives are behind the exaggerated reactions to the mohammed cartoon . islamist groups are attempting to channel the hatred against the west to bolster their own political influence .
through their apparent solidarity with the wave of protest arab governments can detract from domestic failure and discredit western calls for reform .
most likely they will also take advantage of the situation to cut back on freedom of the press in their countries . the escalation of events in the palestinian territories on thursday is a good example of how political groups have instrumentalized the raging sentiments .
it was n't hamas or jihad that fueled the violent protests , but rather the militant arm of the secular fatah party , which lost last week 's parliamentary election .
for them , the protests offered the perfect opportunity to express frustration over the lost ballot . one-sided reporting in arab media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar based tv channel al jazeera led with the story ... and protests .
up until now , the arab media has taken a differentiated approach to covering the dispute .
while well-known media groups such as al jazeera addressed the topic in the most prominent manner , even the renowned , trans-arabic newspaper alhayat placed the topic in the second and third most visible positions .
media close to the government as well as relatively independent media quickly showed solidarity with their readers that the illustration of the prophet was both deeming and offensive .
critical voices remained the exception . the editorialist for the jordanian newspaper al-shihan was one of the exceptions .
in an opinion piece , he provoked readers by asking : " what damages islam the most : these drawings or pictures showing hostage takers decapitating their victims in front of running cameras , or a suicide bomber who decides to detonate himself at a wedding in amman ? " difficult dialogue europe - and germany in particular - have gone to great extents in recent years to intensify their dialogue with the arab and islamic world .
but now the dispute over the cartoon threatens to reverse any progress in bringing the two sides together .
it is the view of many arab commentators that such publications only help the extremist groups who are not interested in interacting with the west .
according to abd albari atwan , editor-in-chief of the pan-arabic newspaper al quds al-arabi , targeted offenses such as the caricature only serve to poison the relationship between islam and the west .
further publications in other european countries will only widen the rift between the two sides . ibrahim mohamad -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mohammed cartoon conflict gets even hotter the controversy over danish editorial cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed has widened , escalating into an armed standoff in the gaza strip .

" that 's not the way of having a dialogue , a conversation , " said the journalist , who has reported for arab media from denmark for more than 20 years . while the cartoon row has exploded in a wave of protests across the middle east and opened a debate around the world , danish analysts say closer to home , they represent the problems denmark has regarding immigration , particularly of its muslim community . he is one of the co-initiators of a so-called " alternative network , " a group of danish muslims who started to meet recently to provide journalists and others a wider spectrum of views from the muslim community . " some call us moderate muslims , some call us secular muslims , we call ourselves muslims , " said al-habahbeh .
" we do n't go to mosques .
we are european muslims and do n't want to be represented by the imams .
our aim is to offer an islamic voice in the dialogue . "
denmark in crisis when it comes to muslims , denmark is in the midst of a crisis , which has been provoked by the danish government , according to al-habahbeh .
the populist anti-immigrant danish people 's party has played a prominent role in antagonizing danish muslims . leading members of the party have openly said islam is not a religion but a terrorist organization .
and without the far-right party 's support , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's minority coalition of liberals and conservatives would neither have been able to come to power nor to stay there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen could have prevented the conflict , al-habahbeh said an opinion poll carried out between monday and wednesday this week , when the controversy reached a climax with riots in the gaza strip , showed that the people 's party has profited .
danish support for the party increased from 12.1 percent to 14.5 percent , greens polling group said .
both of the governing parties ' standings remained stable . on the opposite side from people 's party , the centrist det radikale venstre - whose most vocal personality in the current conflict , parliamentarian naser khader , is also a co-initiator of the alternative network of muslims - saw its support increase from 9.2 to 10.7 percent . " the mohammed drawings go straight back to the immigrant debate , " political scientist lars bille of copenhagen university told boersen newspaper .
" the fronts are becoming sharper .
and here people are looking towards -lrb- det radikale venstre -rrb- and the people 's party , which each make up a pole in the debate . "
fodder for the taking in such an inflamed atmosphere , the offending cartoons themselves were n't the real issue , al-habahbeh said .
instead they merely offered fodder to muslim extremists as well as to the danish right-wing . " the cartoons are being misused both by muslim extremists and the right wing here in denmark , " said al-habahbeh .
" the islamists and the extremists -lrb- are using them -rrb- to further their aims , saying that they attack islam to further the clash of civilizations .
" the right-wing groups are using them to say that a muslim can never be a democrat , " he added .
" the actions taken by those in some arab countries , like flag-burning , are also being used to strengthen racist arguments here in denmark . "
message to the danes the journalist said the government could have prevented the whole conflict from escalating three months ago when 11 arab ambassadors asked to see him concerning the cartoons .
instead rasmussen sent a message to the danes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian muslims protest in jakarta on friday " when the prime minister said ' no ' to meeting the ambassadors he was not talking to the ambassadors ; he was talking to the voters . " though the current conflict may eventually be overcome , al-habahbeh said , he does n't have high hopes that the deeper crisis will be resolved anytime soon . " even though the paper apologized , it wo n't make a difference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons europe -pipe- 03.02.2006 cartoon controversy reflects deeper problems in denmark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoon controversy comes in the midst of a greater crisis in denmark osama al-habahbeh has been in the thick of the controversy over the cartoons published in danish newspaper " jyllands-posten " that have enraged muslims worldwide - both as a reporter and as a danish muslim . osama al-habahbeh said he understood the offense the drawings had provoked but he condemned the extreme reactions to the cartoons from the muslim world as being " over the top " and denounced the violence and the flag-burnings . " that 's not the way of having a dialogue , a conversation , " said the journalist , who has reported for arab media from denmark for more than 20 years . while the cartoon row has exploded in a wave of protests across the middle east and opened a debate around the world , danish analysts say closer to home , they represent the problems denmark has regarding immigration , particularly of its muslim community . he is one of the co-initiators of a so-called " alternative network , " a group of danish muslims who started to meet recently to provide journalists and others a wider spectrum of views from the muslim community . " some call us moderate muslims , some call us secular muslims , we call ourselves muslims , " said al-habahbeh .
" we do n't go to mosques .
we are european muslims and do n't want to be represented by the imams .
our aim is to offer an islamic voice in the dialogue . "
denmark in crisis when it comes to muslims , denmark is in the midst of a crisis , which has been provoked by the danish government , according to al-habahbeh .
the populist anti-immigrant danish people 's party has played a prominent role in antagonizing danish muslims . leading members of the party have openly said islam is not a religion but a terrorist organization .
and without the far-right party 's support , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's minority coalition of liberals and conservatives would neither have been able to come to power nor to stay there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen could have prevented the conflict , al-habahbeh said an opinion poll carried out between monday and wednesday this week , when the controversy reached a climax with riots in the gaza strip , showed that the people 's party has profited .
danish support for the party increased from 12.1 percent to 14.5 percent , greens polling group said .
both of the governing parties ' standings remained stable . on the opposite side from people 's party , the centrist det radikale venstre - whose most vocal personality in the current conflict , parliamentarian naser khader , is also a co-initiator of the alternative network of muslims - saw its support increase from 9.2 to 10.7 percent . " the mohammed drawings go straight back to the immigrant debate , " political scientist lars bille of copenhagen university told boersen newspaper .
" the fronts are becoming sharper .
and here people are looking towards -lrb- det radikale venstre -rrb- and the people 's party , which each make up a pole in the debate . "
fodder for the taking in such an inflamed atmosphere , the offending cartoons themselves were n't the real issue , al-habahbeh said .
instead they merely offered fodder to muslim extremists as well as to the danish right-wing . " the cartoons are being misused both by muslim extremists and the right wing here in denmark , " said al-habahbeh .
" the islamists and the extremists -lrb- are using them -rrb- to further their aims , saying that they attack islam to further the clash of civilizations .
" the right-wing groups are using them to say that a muslim can never be a democrat , " he added .
" the actions taken by those in some arab countries , like flag-burning , are also being used to strengthen racist arguments here in denmark . "
message to the danes the journalist said the government could have prevented the whole conflict from escalating three months ago when 11 arab ambassadors asked to see him concerning the cartoons .
instead rasmussen sent a message to the danes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian muslims protest in jakarta on friday " when the prime minister said ' no ' to meeting the ambassadors he was not talking to the ambassadors ; he was talking to the voters . " though the current conflict may eventually be overcome , al-habahbeh said , he does n't have high hopes that the deeper crisis will be resolved anytime soon . " even though the paper apologized , it wo n't make a difference .
because muslims in europe demand some respect as human beings , as danes , " he said .
" without fulfilling these demands i do n't think the crisis will stop .

european parliamentarians have also voted to keep aid going . on thursday , about a dozen gunmen connected to palestinian leader mahmoud abbas ' fatah party surrounded the eu commission 's office in gaza city .
they demanded that the governments of denmark , france , germany and norway apologize for cartoons of mohammed published in newspapers in those countries . armed palestinians also threatened a " tough response " for further reprints of the cartoons in front of the french cultural center . despite the threats , eu officials said they were not going to suspend aid - at least for now . " if the situation gets more complicated then obviously for us it will not be easy to deal with it , " european commission spokeswoman emma udwin said , according to ap news service . parliame n taria n s vote for aid u n der co n ditio n s european lawmakers meanwhile voted on thursday to continue aid payments to palestinians as long as a future government led by radical islamist group hamas , the winner of last month 's parliamentary elections , renounces violence and seeks peace with israel . bildunterschrift : general view of the european parliament in strasbourg in a resolution , members of the european parliament , who have to approve any aid payments , said the eu should remain the biggest donor to the palestinian territories .
the bloc currently donates 500 million euros -lrb- $ 605 million -rrb- annually . parliamentarians agreed that future aid " will be dependent on the new government 's clarification on denouncing violence and recognizing israel , " an approach mirrored by the bloc 's foreign ministers , who adopted a similar policy at a meeting on monday . according to reuters news service , deputies also urged the middle east quartet - the united nations , united states , european union and russia - to take a " strong and urgent initiative " to promote negotiations between palestinians and israelis . hamas has been placed on an eu list of banned terrorist groups ; it has carried out almost 60 suicide bombings over the last six years . palesti n ia n calls to work with hamas eu parliamentarians also said that the faction 's election victory was the result of a desire for reforms and dissatisfaction among the palestinian population with the previous government . the palestinian authority 's representative to the eu , leila shahid , meanwhile told parliamentarians on wednesday that the western world would make a mistake if it did not recognize a hamas-led government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the eu cooperate with hamas leader ismail haniyeh ?
" if you reject hamas , it would be perceived in the region as rejection of democratic principles , " she told a conference in the european parliament in brussels , according to online news site euobserver .
" the eu must not allow the result of the election to conceal the fantastic performance that the election was .
it was transparent and in respect of pluralism , and that in a society where pluralism has been condemned .
if you create unity with hamas - not against - this can be positive .
the eu can impose conditionality in such a relationship .

" it was totally forgotten .
local farmers never reclaimed the land , so gradually the bushes and thickets took it over .
only if you looked could you see a rough outline of the fortifications , " said local deputy jean-marc lefranc . traces of history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gary sterne posing with rusty german ammunition from world war ii after extensive research in european archives , sterne found contemporary maps that pinpointed the site of the complex , on high ground above omaha beach at the western end of the d-day frontline .
he then set about buying the land plot by plot from local owners . after several months of clearing work , a dozen buildings in stone and concrete have been discovered linked by 1,500 meters of tunnels .
different areas have been identified as a sick bay , officers ' quarters , radio room and kitchens . the position appeared to have been looted after it was abandoned by the germans , and even the floor tiles had disappeared .

not only does islam forbid the illustration of the prophet , it sharply condemns any form of blasphemy .
many muslims see in the cartoon a demeaning connection between their religion and terrorism and have responded with angry protests . in more than 25 countries , enraged muslims took to the streets to protest the caricature .
they burned danish flags and called for a boycott of danish products .
there were even numerous threats , including bomb threats targeting western citizens and diplomatic missions .
some , such as the kuwaiti islam scholar sheik nasem almisbah , even called for the death of the cartoonist . the majority of arab governments only made matters worse by adding fuel to the fire of angry protestors rather than seeking to calm them .
saudi arabia , kuwait and libya , for instance , recalled their ambassadors to denmark and demanded a severe punishment for those responsible as well as an official apology from the danish government . no separation of church and state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims feel personally offended by the caricatures and the attitudes behind printing them .
such demands show that arab governments are incapable of understanding the relationship between the state and freedom of expression as it is practiced in europe .
while the right to free speech is anchored in european constitutions and a clear separation between church and state defines daily life , islam dominates daily life in the arab world .
as a result many muslims can not comprehend the differentiation in europe .
they feel personally offended as soon as their religion is presented in a hurtful manner .
they also do not understand that politicians in the western world have no direct influence over the media , as is commonly the case in the arab world . calculated reactions however , the harsh reactions to the cartoon overstep the boundaries of acceptable protests .
even though the mohammed caricature provokes , it by no means justifies an incitement to murder or a call for boycotts .
it is also not reason enough for the arab world to instrumentalize the protests for political purposes . in the arab world , particularly in iraq , hundred of people are killed and mosques and churches attacked weekly .
but neither politicians nor mass demonstrations criticize the situation .
thus , one could presume political rather than religious motives are behind the exaggerated reactions to the mohammed cartoon . islamist groups are attempting to channel the hatred against the west to bolster their own political influence .
through their apparent solidarity with the wave of protest arab governments can detract from domestic failure and discredit western calls for reform .
most likely they will also take advantage of the situation to cut back on freedom of the press in their countries . the escalation of events in the palestinian territories on thursday is a good example of how political groups have instrumentalized the raging sentiments .
it was n't hamas or jihad that fueled the violent protests , but rather the militant arm of the secular fatah party , which lost last week 's parliamentary election .
for them , the protests offered the perfect opportunity to express frustration over the lost ballot . one-sided reporting in arab media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar based tv channel al jazeera led with the story ... and protests .
up until now , the arab media has taken a differentiated approach to covering the dispute .
while well-known media groups such as al jazeera addressed the topic in the most prominent manner , even the renowned , trans-arabic newspaper alhayat placed the topic in the second and third most visible positions .
media close to the government as well as relatively independent media quickly showed solidarity with their readers that the illustration of the prophet was both deeming and offensive .
critical voices remained the exception . the editorialist for the jordanian newspaper al-shihan was one of the exceptions .
in an opinion piece , he provoked readers by asking : " what damages islam the most : these drawings or pictures showing hostage takers decapitating their victims in front of running cameras , or a suicide bomber who decides to detonate himself at a wedding in amman ? " difficult dialogue europe - and germany in particular - have gone to great extents in recent years to intensify their dialogue with the arab and islamic world .
but now the dispute over the cartoon threatens to reverse any progress in bringing the two sides together .
it is the view of many arab commentators that such publications only help the extremist groups who are not interested in interacting with the west .
according to abd albari atwan , editor-in-chief of the pan-arabic newspaper al quds al-arabi , targeted offenses such as the caricature only serve to poison the relationship between islam and the west .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.02.2006 german coach suspected of genetic doping großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former coach thomas springstein has a lot to worry about these days a german athletics coach is believed to have used genetic doping - the practice of manipulating the human genetic code to increase muscle mass , blood production , or endurance .
experts are taken by surprise . the trial of the disgraced german athletics coach thomas springstein , who has been accused of giving performance-enhancing drugs to minors , took an eerie turn this week when the court in the eastern german town of magdeburg was presented with evidence pointing to springstein 's involvement in genetic doping . e-mails sent and received by springstein , a one-time coach of the german athletics association -lrb- dlv -rrb- , which were seized by the police during a raid on springstein 's home , brought up references to repoxygen - a banned substance meant to be used in gene therapy to treat patients with anemia . repoxygen helps to induce a controlled release of erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- , a substance that stimulates the production of red blood cells , thereby increasing the amount of oxygen the blood can deliver to the muscles . in one email , springstein wrote that " new repoxygen is hard to get .
please give me new instructions soon so that i can order the product before christmas . " difficult to detect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetic doping is more difficult to trace than traditional performance-enhancing drugs the international olympic committee and world anti-doping agency have already banned the use of synthetic epo among athletes , but are yet to design a test for repoxygen , which teaches human cells to produce epo on their own . the difficulty of producing such a test lies in the fact that repoxygen allows the body to switch the gene on in response to law oxygen levels and switch it off after the levels have been raised . repoxygen was prototyped in 2002 by the british pharmaceutical company oxford biomedica but never went into production since the company did n't believe it could compete with the availability of synthetic epo on the market .
the product , nonetheless , caught the attention of the anti-doping agencies at the time . " you can turn it on and off , " said larry bowers , the managing director of the us anti-doping agency after a meeting in atlanta in oct .
2002 . " it acts more or less like the body , " bowers said . playing with fire how repoxygen could have made it to the black market is still not known .
professor alan kingsman , oxford biomedica 's chief executive , claims that his company maintains strict controls over its products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some like it big and are willing to pop as many pills as they can " i 'd be extremely surprised if anything we made got on to the black market , " said kingsman . according to kingsman , only a fairly advanced lab could reproduce repoxygen based on the information which was made available by oxford biomedica . " but if would be very irresponsible for a number of reasons , " kingsman said .
" for a start , we only went as far as testing it on mice .
to use it in the human body would be playing with fire . " a bad omen for the olympics most experts were taken by surprise by the revelations of the springstein case , since the general opinion was that genetic doping was not practiced and that it would not become an actual threat before the 2008 beijing olympics .
the news of genetic doping will now unavoidably loom over the turin winter games , which start next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the xx winter olympic games is scheduled for feb .
10 in turin " we have been expecting gene doping , but not so soon .
i do n't know how they have it , but they do , " said werner franke , a german cell biologist who has studied numerous doping cases in the former east germany . " this is worse than in the gdr and more brutal than the balco scandal , " franke said . the founder of the us balco labs was sentenced to four months in a minimum security prison and four months of home confinement last year for masterminding the distribution of illegal steroids among elite athletes . a criminal act the german athletics association -lrb- dlv -rrb- has urged the lawmakers to explicitly outlaw genetic doping , citing the difficulty which various sports bodies would have in monitoring the practice . " we need tighter laws , " said dlv president clemens prokop . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will grit breuer 's gold medals for germany be tarnished ?
the 47-year-old springstein faces a stiff jail sentence if found guilty of supplying drugs to minors back in 2003 , especially if the accusations of genetic doping are confirmed . springstein has also been accused of giving several injections to one of his female athletes to treat an injury despite not having a viable medical permit . before the doping scandal came to light , springstein worked with some of germany 's top athletes , including east german track stars katrin krabbe and grit breuer , who were both suspended for two years for using the banned steroid clenbuterol in 1992 . krabbe won the 100m and 200m world titles in 1991 while breuer , who is springstein 's partner , won the 1990 european title at 400 meters . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conflicting evidence masks the bald facts in doping case nemanja vucicevic , striker for bundesliga team 1860 munich , failed a drugs test after a game earlier this month , soccer authorities revealed monday .

experts are taken by surprise . the trial of the disgraced german athletics coach thomas springstein , who has been accused of giving performance-enhancing drugs to minors , took an eerie turn this week when the court in the eastern german town of magdeburg was presented with evidence pointing to springstein 's involvement in genetic doping . e-mails sent and received by springstein , a one-time coach of the german athletics association -lrb- dlv -rrb- , which were seized by the police during a raid on springstein 's home , brought up references to repoxygen - a banned substance meant to be used in gene therapy to treat patients with anemia . repoxygen helps to induce a controlled release of erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- , a substance that stimulates the production of red blood cells , thereby increasing the amount of oxygen the blood can deliver to the muscles . in one email , springstein wrote that " new repoxygen is hard to get .
please give me new instructions soon so that i can order the product before christmas . " difficult to detect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetic doping is more difficult to trace than traditional performance-enhancing drugs the international olympic committee and world anti-doping agency have already banned the use of synthetic epo among athletes , but are yet to design a test for repoxygen , which teaches human cells to produce epo on their own . the difficulty of producing such a test lies in the fact that repoxygen allows the body to switch the gene on in response to law oxygen levels and switch it off after the levels have been raised . repoxygen was prototyped in 2002 by the british pharmaceutical company oxford biomedica but never went into production since the company did n't believe it could compete with the availability of synthetic epo on the market .
the product , nonetheless , caught the attention of the anti-doping agencies at the time . " you can turn it on and off , " said larry bowers , the managing director of the us anti-doping agency after a meeting in atlanta in oct .
2002 . " it acts more or less like the body , " bowers said . playing with fire how repoxygen could have made it to the black market is still not known .
professor alan kingsman , oxford biomedica 's chief executive , claims that his company maintains strict controls over its products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some like it big and are willing to pop as many pills as they can " i 'd be extremely surprised if anything we made got on to the black market , " said kingsman . according to kingsman , only a fairly advanced lab could reproduce repoxygen based on the information which was made available by oxford biomedica . " but if would be very irresponsible for a number of reasons , " kingsman said .
" for a start , we only went as far as testing it on mice .
to use it in the human body would be playing with fire . " a bad omen for the olympics most experts were taken by surprise by the revelations of the springstein case , since the general opinion was that genetic doping was not practiced and that it would not become an actual threat before the 2008 beijing olympics .
the news of genetic doping will now unavoidably loom over the turin winter games , which start next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the xx winter olympic games is scheduled for feb .
10 in turin " we have been expecting gene doping , but not so soon .
i do n't know how they have it , but they do , " said werner franke , a german cell biologist who has studied numerous doping cases in the former east germany . " this is worse than in the gdr and more brutal than the balco scandal , " franke said . the founder of the us balco labs was sentenced to four months in a minimum security prison and four months of home confinement last year for masterminding the distribution of illegal steroids among elite athletes . a criminal act the german athletics association -lrb- dlv -rrb- has urged the lawmakers to explicitly outlaw genetic doping , citing the difficulty which various sports bodies would have in monitoring the practice . " we need tighter laws , " said dlv president clemens prokop . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will grit breuer 's gold medals for germany be tarnished ?
the 47-year-old springstein faces a stiff jail sentence if found guilty of supplying drugs to minors back in 2003 , especially if the accusations of genetic doping are confirmed . springstein has also been accused of giving several injections to one of his female athletes to treat an injury despite not having a viable medical permit . before the doping scandal came to light , springstein worked with some of germany 's top athletes , including east german track stars katrin krabbe and grit breuer , who were both suspended for two years for using the banned steroid clenbuterol in 1992 . krabbe won the 100m and 200m world titles in 1991 while breuer , who is springstein 's partner , won the 1990 european title at 400 meters . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conflicting evidence masks the bald facts in doping case nemanja vucicevic , striker for bundesliga team 1860 munich , failed a drugs test after a game earlier this month , soccer authorities revealed monday .

hoping to attract tourists to his hometown , a stuttgart businessman has given an early renoir painting to a museum .
but not everyone is convinced that displaying the " swabian mona lisa " will kick off a visitor boom . deyhle started out working for the internal revenue service and later made billions as a real estate developer and musical producer .
in the late 1990s , he lost most of his fortune and sold large parts of his massive art collection that included works by georg baselitz , otto dix and käthe kollwitz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staatsgalerie director christian von holst -lrb- left -rrb- thanked deyhle for the painting one painting he did keep , however , was by the young pierre auguste renoir .
it depicts an anonymous woman in a coat with fur trim .
her facial expression is hard to determine - she seems on the verge of smiling , prompting deyhle to dub her the " swabian mona lisa . " deyhle has owned the painting from 1866 for a quarter century , but he 's only now decided to share it with the public by loaning it permanently to stuttgart 's renowned staatsgalerie museum . museum officials more cautious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an outside view of stuttgart 's staatsgalerie but while the 67-year-old reportedly hopes that the painting will serve as a magnet for tourists , staatsgalerie officials seem a little less enthusiastic . " when i first saw the painting , i could hardly believe that it was really a painting by this artist , " christofer conrad , a curator at the museum , told the dpa news service .
renoir was only 25 when he created " lady in fur , " which is much darker than many of his later works . bildunterschrift : renoir " lying nude " from 1902 looks quite different the painting has since been checked by experts and deemed authentic , but conrad nevertheless told reporters that he does n't believe the portrait will single-handedly turn stuttgart into a tourist destination . deyhle 's decision to hand over the painting and boost its significance has brought some to believe that he 's trying to create enough hype to boost the work 's value - a charge deyhle emphatically denies . " in that case , i would have given the picture to a museum much earlier , " he told dpa . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart stuttgart may owe a lot to gottlieb daimler , whose auto empire holds court in the city , but the city is more than the home of the mercedes star .

european parliamentarians have also voted to keep aid going . on thursday , about a dozen gunmen connected to palestinian leader mahmoud abbas ' fatah party surrounded the eu commission 's office in gaza city .
they demanded that the governments of denmark , france , germany and norway apologize for cartoons of mohammed published in newspapers in those countries . armed palestinians also threatened a " tough response " for further reprints of the cartoons in front of the french cultural center . despite the threats , eu officials said they were not going to suspend aid - at least for now . " if the situation gets more complicated then obviously for us it will not be easy to deal with it , " european commission spokeswoman emma udwin said , according to ap news service . parliame n taria n s vote for aid u n der co n ditio n s european lawmakers meanwhile voted on thursday to continue aid payments to palestinians as long as a future government led by radical islamist group hamas , the winner of last month 's parliamentary elections , renounces violence and seeks peace with israel . bildunterschrift : general view of the european parliament in strasbourg in a resolution , members of the european parliament , who have to approve any aid payments , said the eu should remain the biggest donor to the palestinian territories .
the bloc currently donates 500 million euros -lrb- $ 605 million -rrb- annually . parliamentarians agreed that future aid " will be dependent on the new government 's clarification on denouncing violence and recognizing israel , " an approach mirrored by the bloc 's foreign ministers , who adopted a similar policy at a meeting on monday . according to reuters news service , deputies also urged the middle east quartet - the united nations , united states , european union and russia - to take a " strong and urgent initiative " to promote negotiations between palestinians and israelis . hamas has been placed on an eu list of banned terrorist groups ; it has carried out almost 60 suicide bombings over the last six years . palesti n ia n calls to work with hamas eu parliamentarians also said that the faction 's election victory was the result of a desire for reforms and dissatisfaction among the palestinian population with the previous government . the palestinian authority 's representative to the eu , leila shahid , meanwhile told parliamentarians on wednesday that the western world would make a mistake if it did not recognize a hamas-led government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the eu cooperate with hamas leader ismail haniyeh ?
" if you reject hamas , it would be perceived in the region as rejection of democratic principles , " she told a conference in the european parliament in brussels , according to online news site euobserver .
" the eu must not allow the result of the election to conceal the fantastic performance that the election was .
it was transparent and in respect of pluralism , and that in a society where pluralism has been condemned .
if you create unity with hamas - not against - this can be positive .
the eu can impose conditionality in such a relationship .

" that 's not the way of having a dialogue , a conversation , " said the journalist , who has reported for arab media from denmark for more than 20 years . while the cartoon row has exploded in a wave of protests across the middle east and opened a debate around the world , danish analysts say closer to home , they represent the problems denmark has regarding immigration , particularly of its muslim community . he is one of the co-initiators of a so-called " alternative network , " a group of danish muslims who started to meet recently to provide journalists and others a wider spectrum of views from the muslim community .

" we do n't go to mosques .
we are european muslims and do n't want to be represented by the imams .
our aim is to offer an islamic voice in the dialogue . "
denmark in crisis when it comes to muslims , denmark is in the midst of a crisis , which has been provoked by the danish government , according to al-habahbeh .
the populist anti-immigrant danish people 's party has played a prominent role in antagonizing danish muslims . leading members of the party have openly said islam is not a religion but a terrorist organization .
and without the far-right party 's support , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's minority coalition of liberals and conservatives would neither have been able to come to power nor to stay there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen could have prevented the conflict , al-habahbeh said an opinion poll carried out between monday and wednesday this week , when the controversy reached a climax with riots in the gaza strip , showed that the people 's party has profited .
danish support for the party increased from 12.1 percent to 14.5 percent , greens polling group said .
both of the governing parties ' standings remained stable . on the opposite side from people 's party , the centrist det radikale venstre - whose most vocal personality in the current conflict , parliamentarian naser khader , is also a co-initiator of the alternative network of muslims - saw its support increase from 9.2 to 10.7 percent . " the mohammed drawings go straight back to the immigrant debate , " political scientist lars bille of copenhagen university told boersen newspaper .
" the fronts are becoming sharper .
and here people are looking towards -lrb- det radikale venstre -rrb- and the people 's party , which each make up a pole in the debate . "
fodder for the taking in such an inflamed atmosphere , the offending cartoons themselves were n't the real issue , al-habahbeh said .
instead they merely offered fodder to muslim extremists as well as to the danish right-wing . " the cartoons are being misused both by muslim extremists and the right wing here in denmark , " said al-habahbeh .
" the islamists and the extremists -lrb- are using them -rrb- to further their aims , saying that they attack islam to further the clash of civilizations .
" the right-wing groups are using them to say that a muslim can never be a democrat , " he added .
" the actions taken by those in some arab countries , like flag-burning , are also being used to strengthen racist arguments here in denmark . "

instead rasmussen sent a message to the danes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian muslims protest in jakarta on friday " when the prime minister said ' no ' to meeting the ambassadors he was not talking to the ambassadors ; he was talking to the voters . " though the current conflict may eventually be overcome , al-habahbeh said , he does n't have high hopes that the deeper crisis will be resolved anytime soon . " even though the paper apologized , it wo n't make a difference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons europe -pipe- 03.02.2006 analysis : arab protests are calculated political response großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the furor over the mohammed cartoon could be part of a political agenda mass protests , threats of violence and boycotts in the arab world are exaggerated reactions to the mohammed cartoon and an example of how governments instrumentalize hatred against the west for political purposes . the publication of a mohammed cartoon in the danish newspaper jyllands-posten has deeply offended the religious sentiments of the muslim community , who regard it as a western affront to their beliefs .
not only does islam forbid the illustration of the prophet , it sharply condemns any form of blasphemy .
many muslims see in the cartoon a demeaning connection between their religion and terrorism and have responded with angry protests . in more than 25 countries , enraged muslims took to the streets to protest the caricature .
they burned danish flags and called for a boycott of danish products .
there were even numerous threats , including bomb threats targeting western citizens and diplomatic missions .
some , such as the kuwaiti islam scholar sheik nasem almisbah , even called for the death of the cartoonist . the majority of arab governments only made matters worse by adding fuel to the fire of angry protestors rather than seeking to calm them .
saudi arabia , kuwait and libya , for instance , recalled their ambassadors to denmark and demanded a severe punishment for those responsible as well as an official apology from the danish government . no separation of church and state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims feel personally offended by the caricatures and the attitudes behind printing them .
such demands show that arab governments are incapable of understanding the relationship between the state and freedom of expression as it is practiced in europe .
while the right to free speech is anchored in european constitutions and a clear separation between church and state defines daily life , islam dominates daily life in the arab world .
as a result many muslims can not comprehend the differentiation in europe .
they feel personally offended as soon as their religion is presented in a hurtful manner .
they also do not understand that politicians in the western world have no direct influence over the media , as is commonly the case in the arab world . calculated reactions however , the harsh reactions to the cartoon overstep the boundaries of acceptable protests .
even though the mohammed caricature provokes , it by no means justifies an incitement to murder or a call for boycotts .
it is also not reason enough for the arab world to instrumentalize the protests for political purposes . in the arab world , particularly in iraq , hundred of people are killed and mosques and churches attacked weekly .
but neither politicians nor mass demonstrations criticize the situation .
thus , one could presume political rather than religious motives are behind the exaggerated reactions to the mohammed cartoon . islamist groups are attempting to channel the hatred against the west to bolster their own political influence .
through their apparent solidarity with the wave of protest arab governments can detract from domestic failure and discredit western calls for reform .
most likely they will also take advantage of the situation to cut back on freedom of the press in their countries . the escalation of events in the palestinian territories on thursday is a good example of how political groups have instrumentalized the raging sentiments .
it was n't hamas or jihad that fueled the violent protests , but rather the militant arm of the secular fatah party , which lost last week 's parliamentary election .
for them , the protests offered the perfect opportunity to express frustration over the lost ballot . one-sided reporting in arab media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar based tv channel al jazeera led with the story ... and protests .
up until now , the arab media has taken a differentiated approach to covering the dispute .
while well-known media groups such as al jazeera addressed the topic in the most prominent manner , even the renowned , trans-arabic newspaper alhayat placed the topic in the second and third most visible positions .

european parliamentarians have also voted to keep aid going . on thursday , about a dozen gunmen connected to palestinian leader mahmoud abbas ' fatah party surrounded the eu commission 's office in gaza city .
they demanded that the governments of denmark , france , germany and norway apologize for cartoons of mohammed published in newspapers in those countries . armed palestinians also threatened a " tough response " for further reprints of the cartoons in front of the french cultural center . despite the threats , eu officials said they were not going to suspend aid - at least for now . " if the situation gets more complicated then obviously for us it will not be easy to deal with it , " european commission spokeswoman emma udwin said , according to ap news service . parliame n taria n s vote for aid u n der co n ditio n s european lawmakers meanwhile voted on thursday to continue aid payments to palestinians as long as a future government led by radical islamist group hamas , the winner of last month 's parliamentary elections , renounces violence and seeks peace with israel . bildunterschrift : general view of the european parliament in strasbourg in a resolution , members of the european parliament , who have to approve any aid payments , said the eu should remain the biggest donor to the palestinian territories .
the bloc currently donates 500 million euros -lrb- $ 605 million -rrb- annually . parliamentarians agreed that future aid " will be dependent on the new government 's clarification on denouncing violence and recognizing israel , " an approach mirrored by the bloc 's foreign ministers , who adopted a similar policy at a meeting on monday . according to reuters news service , deputies also urged the middle east quartet - the united nations , united states , european union and russia - to take a " strong and urgent initiative " to promote negotiations between palestinians and israelis . hamas has been placed on an eu list of banned terrorist groups ; it has carried out almost 60 suicide bombings over the last six years . palesti n ia n calls to work with hamas eu parliamentarians also said that the faction 's election victory was the result of a desire for reforms and dissatisfaction among the palestinian population with the previous government . the palestinian authority 's representative to the eu , leila shahid , meanwhile told parliamentarians on wednesday that the western world would make a mistake if it did not recognize a hamas-led government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the eu cooperate with hamas leader ismail haniyeh ?
" if you reject hamas , it would be perceived in the region as rejection of democratic principles , " she told a conference in the european parliament in brussels , according to online news site euobserver .
" the eu must not allow the result of the election to conceal the fantastic performance that the election was .
it was transparent and in respect of pluralism , and that in a society where pluralism has been condemned .
if you create unity with hamas - not against - this can be positive .
the eu can impose conditionality in such a relationship .

european parliamentarians have also voted to keep aid going . on thursday , about a dozen gunmen connected to palestinian leader mahmoud abbas ' fatah party surrounded the eu commission 's office in gaza city .
they demanded that the governments of denmark , france , germany and norway apologize for cartoons of mohammed published in newspapers in those countries . armed palestinians also threatened a " tough response " for further reprints of the cartoons in front of the french cultural center . despite the threats , eu officials said they were not going to suspend aid - at least for now . " if the situation gets more complicated then obviously for us it will not be easy to deal with it , " european commission spokeswoman emma udwin said , according to ap news service . parliame n taria n s vote for aid u n der co n ditio n s european lawmakers meanwhile voted on thursday to continue aid payments to palestinians as long as a future government led by radical islamist group hamas , the winner of last month 's parliamentary elections , renounces violence and seeks peace with israel . bildunterschrift : general view of the european parliament in strasbourg in a resolution , members of the european parliament , who have to approve any aid payments , said the eu should remain the biggest donor to the palestinian territories .
the bloc currently donates 500 million euros -lrb- $ 605 million -rrb- annually . parliamentarians agreed that future aid " will be dependent on the new government 's clarification on denouncing violence and recognizing israel , " an approach mirrored by the bloc 's foreign ministers , who adopted a similar policy at a meeting on monday . according to reuters news service , deputies also urged the middle east quartet - the united nations , united states , european union and russia - to take a " strong and urgent initiative " to promote negotiations between palestinians and israelis . hamas has been placed on an eu list of banned terrorist groups ; it has carried out almost 60 suicide bombings over the last six years . palesti n ia n calls to work with hamas eu parliamentarians also said that the faction 's election victory was the result of a desire for reforms and dissatisfaction among the palestinian population with the previous government . the palestinian authority 's representative to the eu , leila shahid , meanwhile told parliamentarians on wednesday that the western world would make a mistake if it did not recognize a hamas-led government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the eu cooperate with hamas leader ismail haniyeh ?
" if you reject hamas , it would be perceived in the region as rejection of democratic principles , " she told a conference in the european parliament in brussels , according to online news site euobserver .
" the eu must not allow the result of the election to conceal the fantastic performance that the election was .
it was transparent and in respect of pluralism , and that in a society where pluralism has been condemned .
if you create unity with hamas - not against - this can be positive .
the eu can impose conditionality in such a relationship .

not only does islam forbid the illustration of the prophet , it sharply condemns any form of blasphemy .
many muslims see in the cartoon a demeaning connection between their religion and terrorism and have responded with angry protests . in more than 25 countries , enraged muslims took to the streets to protest the caricature .
they burned danish flags and called for a boycott of danish products .
there were even numerous threats , including bomb threats targeting western citizens and diplomatic missions .
some , such as the kuwaiti islam scholar sheik nasem almisbah , even called for the death of the cartoonist . the majority of arab governments only made matters worse by adding fuel to the fire of angry protestors rather than seeking to calm them .
saudi arabia , kuwait and libya , for instance , recalled their ambassadors to denmark and demanded a severe punishment for those responsible as well as an official apology from the danish government . no separation of church and state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims feel personally offended by the caricatures and the attitudes behind printing them .
such demands show that arab governments are incapable of understanding the relationship between the state and freedom of expression as it is practiced in europe .
while the right to free speech is anchored in european constitutions and a clear separation between church and state defines daily life , islam dominates daily life in the arab world .
as a result many muslims can not comprehend the differentiation in europe .
they feel personally offended as soon as their religion is presented in a hurtful manner .
they also do not understand that politicians in the western world have no direct influence over the media , as is commonly the case in the arab world . calculated reactions however , the harsh reactions to the cartoon overstep the boundaries of acceptable protests .
even though the mohammed caricature provokes , it by no means justifies an incitement to murder or a call for boycotts .
it is also not reason enough for the arab world to instrumentalize the protests for political purposes . in the arab world , particularly in iraq , hundred of people are killed and mosques and churches attacked weekly .
but neither politicians nor mass demonstrations criticize the situation .
thus , one could presume political rather than religious motives are behind the exaggerated reactions to the mohammed cartoon . islamist groups are attempting to channel the hatred against the west to bolster their own political influence .
through their apparent solidarity with the wave of protest arab governments can detract from domestic failure and discredit western calls for reform .
most likely they will also take advantage of the situation to cut back on freedom of the press in their countries . the escalation of events in the palestinian territories on thursday is a good example of how political groups have instrumentalized the raging sentiments .
it was n't hamas or jihad that fueled the violent protests , but rather the militant arm of the secular fatah party , which lost last week 's parliamentary election .
for them , the protests offered the perfect opportunity to express frustration over the lost ballot . one-sided reporting in arab media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar based tv channel al jazeera led with the story ... and protests .
up until now , the arab media has taken a differentiated approach to covering the dispute .
while well-known media groups such as al jazeera addressed the topic in the most prominent manner , even the renowned , trans-arabic newspaper alhayat placed the topic in the second and third most visible positions .
media close to the government as well as relatively independent media quickly showed solidarity with their readers that the illustration of the prophet was both deeming and offensive .
critical voices remained the exception . the editorialist for the jordanian newspaper al-shihan was one of the exceptions .
in an opinion piece , he provoked readers by asking : " what damages islam the most : these drawings or pictures showing hostage takers decapitating their victims in front of running cameras , or a suicide bomber who decides to detonate himself at a wedding in amman ? " difficult dialogue europe - and germany in particular - have gone to great extents in recent years to intensify their dialogue with the arab and islamic world .
but now the dispute over the cartoon threatens to reverse any progress in bringing the two sides together .
it is the view of many arab commentators that such publications only help the extremist groups who are not interested in interacting with the west .
according to abd albari atwan , editor-in-chief of the pan-arabic newspaper al quds al-arabi , targeted offenses such as the caricature only serve to poison the relationship between islam and the west .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons europe -pipe- 03.02.2006 analysis : arab protests are calculated political response großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the furor over the mohammed cartoon could be part of a political agenda mass protests , threats of violence and boycotts in the arab world are exaggerated reactions to the mohammed cartoon and an example of how governments instrumentalize hatred against the west for political purposes . the publication of a mohammed cartoon in the danish newspaper jyllands-posten has deeply offended the religious sentiments of the muslim community , who regard it as a western affront to their beliefs .
not only does islam forbid the illustration of the prophet , it sharply condemns any form of blasphemy .
many muslims see in the cartoon a demeaning connection between their religion and terrorism and have responded with angry protests . in more than 25 countries , enraged muslims took to the streets to protest the caricature .
they burned danish flags and called for a boycott of danish products .
there were even numerous threats , including bomb threats targeting western citizens and diplomatic missions .
some , such as the kuwaiti islam scholar sheik nasem almisbah , even called for the death of the cartoonist . the majority of arab governments only made matters worse by adding fuel to the fire of angry protestors rather than seeking to calm them .
saudi arabia , kuwait and libya , for instance , recalled their ambassadors to denmark and demanded a severe punishment for those responsible as well as an official apology from the danish government . no separation of church and state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims feel personally offended by the caricatures and the attitudes behind printing them .
such demands show that arab governments are incapable of understanding the relationship between the state and freedom of expression as it is practiced in europe .
while the right to free speech is anchored in european constitutions and a clear separation between church and state defines daily life , islam dominates daily life in the arab world .
as a result many muslims can not comprehend the differentiation in europe .
they feel personally offended as soon as their religion is presented in a hurtful manner .
they also do not understand that politicians in the western world have no direct influence over the media , as is commonly the case in the arab world . calculated reactions however , the harsh reactions to the cartoon overstep the boundaries of acceptable protests .
even though the mohammed caricature provokes , it by no means justifies an incitement to murder or a call for boycotts .
it is also not reason enough for the arab world to instrumentalize the protests for political purposes . in the arab world , particularly in iraq , hundred of people are killed and mosques and churches attacked weekly .
but neither politicians nor mass demonstrations criticize the situation .
thus , one could presume political rather than religious motives are behind the exaggerated reactions to the mohammed cartoon . islamist groups are attempting to channel the hatred against the west to bolster their own political influence .
through their apparent solidarity with the wave of protest arab governments can detract from domestic failure and discredit western calls for reform .
most likely they will also take advantage of the situation to cut back on freedom of the press in their countries . the escalation of events in the palestinian territories on thursday is a good example of how political groups have instrumentalized the raging sentiments .
it was n't hamas or jihad that fueled the violent protests , but rather the militant arm of the secular fatah party , which lost last week 's parliamentary election .
for them , the protests offered the perfect opportunity to express frustration over the lost ballot . one-sided reporting in arab media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar based tv channel al jazeera led with the story ... and protests .
up until now , the arab media has taken a differentiated approach to covering the dispute .
while well-known media groups such as al jazeera addressed the topic in the most prominent manner , even the renowned , trans-arabic newspaper alhayat placed the topic in the second and third most visible positions .
media close to the government as well as relatively independent media quickly showed solidarity with their readers that the illustration of the prophet was both deeming and offensive .
critical voices remained the exception . the editorialist for the jordanian newspaper al-shihan was one of the exceptions .
in an opinion piece , he provoked readers by asking : " what damages islam the most : these drawings or pictures showing hostage takers decapitating their victims in front of running cameras , or a suicide bomber who decides to detonate himself at a wedding in amman ? " difficult dialogue europe - and germany in particular - have gone to great extents in recent years to intensify their dialogue with the arab and islamic world .
but now the dispute over the cartoon threatens to reverse any progress in bringing the two sides together .
it is the view of many arab commentators that such publications only help the extremist groups who are not interested in interacting with the west .
according to abd albari atwan , editor-in-chief of the pan-arabic newspaper al quds al-arabi , targeted offenses such as the caricature only serve to poison the relationship between islam and the west .
further publications in other european countries will only widen the rift between the two sides . ibrahim mohamad -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mohammed cartoon conflict gets even hotter the controversy over danish editorial cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed has widened , escalating into an armed standoff in the gaza strip .

" that 's not the way of having a dialogue , a conversation , " said the journalist , who has reported for arab media from denmark for more than 20 years . while the cartoon row has exploded in a wave of protests across the middle east and opened a debate around the world , danish analysts say closer to home , they represent the problems denmark has regarding immigration , particularly of its muslim community . he is one of the co-initiators of a so-called " alternative network , " a group of danish muslims who started to meet recently to provide journalists and others a wider spectrum of views from the muslim community . " some call us moderate muslims , some call us secular muslims , we call ourselves muslims , " said al-habahbeh .
" we do n't go to mosques .
we are european muslims and do n't want to be represented by the imams .
our aim is to offer an islamic voice in the dialogue . "
denmark in crisis when it comes to muslims , denmark is in the midst of a crisis , which has been provoked by the danish government , according to al-habahbeh .
the populist anti-immigrant danish people 's party has played a prominent role in antagonizing danish muslims . leading members of the party have openly said islam is not a religion but a terrorist organization .
and without the far-right party 's support , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's minority coalition of liberals and conservatives would neither have been able to come to power nor to stay there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen could have prevented the conflict , al-habahbeh said an opinion poll carried out between monday and wednesday this week , when the controversy reached a climax with riots in the gaza strip , showed that the people 's party has profited .
danish support for the party increased from 12.1 percent to 14.5 percent , greens polling group said .
both of the governing parties ' standings remained stable . on the opposite side from people 's party , the centrist det radikale venstre - whose most vocal personality in the current conflict , parliamentarian naser khader , is also a co-initiator of the alternative network of muslims - saw its support increase from 9.2 to 10.7 percent . " the mohammed drawings go straight back to the immigrant debate , " political scientist lars bille of copenhagen university told boersen newspaper .
" the fronts are becoming sharper .
and here people are looking towards -lrb- det radikale venstre -rrb- and the people 's party , which each make up a pole in the debate . "
fodder for the taking in such an inflamed atmosphere , the offending cartoons themselves were n't the real issue , al-habahbeh said .
instead they merely offered fodder to muslim extremists as well as to the danish right-wing . " the cartoons are being misused both by muslim extremists and the right wing here in denmark , " said al-habahbeh .
" the islamists and the extremists -lrb- are using them -rrb- to further their aims , saying that they attack islam to further the clash of civilizations .
" the right-wing groups are using them to say that a muslim can never be a democrat , " he added .
" the actions taken by those in some arab countries , like flag-burning , are also being used to strengthen racist arguments here in denmark . "
message to the danes the journalist said the government could have prevented the whole conflict from escalating three months ago when 11 arab ambassadors asked to see him concerning the cartoons .
instead rasmussen sent a message to the danes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian muslims protest in jakarta on friday " when the prime minister said ' no ' to meeting the ambassadors he was not talking to the ambassadors ; he was talking to the voters . " though the current conflict may eventually be overcome , al-habahbeh said , he does n't have high hopes that the deeper crisis will be resolved anytime soon . " even though the paper apologized , it wo n't make a difference .
because muslims in europe demand some respect as human beings , as danes , " he said .
" without fulfilling these demands i do n't think the crisis will stop . " nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de analysis : arab protests are calculated political response mass protests , threats of violence and boycotts in the arab world are exaggerated reactions to the mohammed cartoon and an example of how governments instrumentalize hatred against the west for political purposes .

" that 's not the way of having a dialogue , a conversation , " said the journalist , who has reported for arab media from denmark for more than 20 years . while the cartoon row has exploded in a wave of protests across the middle east and opened a debate around the world , danish analysts say closer to home , they represent the problems denmark has regarding immigration , particularly of its muslim community . he is one of the co-initiators of a so-called " alternative network , " a group of danish muslims who started to meet recently to provide journalists and others a wider spectrum of views from the muslim community . " some call us moderate muslims , some call us secular muslims , we call ourselves muslims , " said al-habahbeh .
" we do n't go to mosques .
we are european muslims and do n't want to be represented by the imams .
our aim is to offer an islamic voice in the dialogue . "
denmark in crisis when it comes to muslims , denmark is in the midst of a crisis , which has been provoked by the danish government , according to al-habahbeh .
the populist anti-immigrant danish people 's party has played a prominent role in antagonizing danish muslims . leading members of the party have openly said islam is not a religion but a terrorist organization .
and without the far-right party 's support , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's minority coalition of liberals and conservatives would neither have been able to come to power nor to stay there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen could have prevented the conflict , al-habahbeh said an opinion poll carried out between monday and wednesday this week , when the controversy reached a climax with riots in the gaza strip , showed that the people 's party has profited .
danish support for the party increased from 12.1 percent to 14.5 percent , greens polling group said .
both of the governing parties ' standings remained stable . on the opposite side from people 's party , the centrist det radikale venstre - whose most vocal personality in the current conflict , parliamentarian naser khader , is also a co-initiator of the alternative network of muslims - saw its support increase from 9.2 to 10.7 percent . " the mohammed drawings go straight back to the immigrant debate , " political scientist lars bille of copenhagen university told boersen newspaper .
" the fronts are becoming sharper .
and here people are looking towards -lrb- det radikale venstre -rrb- and the people 's party , which each make up a pole in the debate . "
fodder for the taking in such an inflamed atmosphere , the offending cartoons themselves were n't the real issue , al-habahbeh said .
instead they merely offered fodder to muslim extremists as well as to the danish right-wing . " the cartoons are being misused both by muslim extremists and the right wing here in denmark , " said al-habahbeh .
" the islamists and the extremists -lrb- are using them -rrb- to further their aims , saying that they attack islam to further the clash of civilizations .
" the right-wing groups are using them to say that a muslim can never be a democrat , " he added .

european parliamentarians have also voted to keep aid going . on thursday , about a dozen gunmen connected to palestinian leader mahmoud abbas ' fatah party surrounded the eu commission 's office in gaza city .
they demanded that the governments of denmark , france , germany and norway apologize for cartoons of mohammed published in newspapers in those countries . armed palestinians also threatened a " tough response " for further reprints of the cartoons in front of the french cultural center . despite the threats , eu officials said they were not going to suspend aid - at least for now . " if the situation gets more complicated then obviously for us it will not be easy to deal with it , " european commission spokeswoman emma udwin said , according to ap news service . parliame n taria n s vote for aid u n der co n ditio n s european lawmakers meanwhile voted on thursday to continue aid payments to palestinians as long as a future government led by radical islamist group hamas , the winner of last month 's parliamentary elections , renounces violence and seeks peace with israel . bildunterschrift : general view of the european parliament in strasbourg in a resolution , members of the european parliament , who have to approve any aid payments , said the eu should remain the biggest donor to the palestinian territories .
the bloc currently donates 500 million euros -lrb- $ 605 million -rrb- annually . parliamentarians agreed that future aid " will be dependent on the new government 's clarification on denouncing violence and recognizing israel , " an approach mirrored by the bloc 's foreign ministers , who adopted a similar policy at a meeting on monday . according to reuters news service , deputies also urged the middle east quartet - the united nations , united states , european union and russia - to take a " strong and urgent initiative " to promote negotiations between palestinians and israelis . hamas has been placed on an eu list of banned terrorist groups ; it has carried out almost 60 suicide bombings over the last six years . palesti n ia n calls to work with hamas eu parliamentarians also said that the faction 's election victory was the result of a desire for reforms and dissatisfaction among the palestinian population with the previous government . the palestinian authority 's representative to the eu , leila shahid , meanwhile told parliamentarians on wednesday that the western world would make a mistake if it did not recognize a hamas-led government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the eu cooperate with hamas leader ismail haniyeh ?
" if you reject hamas , it would be perceived in the region as rejection of democratic principles , " she told a conference in the european parliament in brussels , according to online news site euobserver .
" the eu must not allow the result of the election to conceal the fantastic performance that the election was .
it was transparent and in respect of pluralism , and that in a society where pluralism has been condemned .
if you create unity with hamas - not against - this can be positive .
the eu can impose conditionality in such a relationship .

he then set about buying the land plot by plot from local owners . after several months of clearing work , a dozen buildings in stone and concrete have been discovered linked by 1,500 meters of tunnels .
different areas have been identified as a sick bay , officers ' quarters , radio room and kitchens . the position appeared to have been looted after it was abandoned by the germans , and even the floor tiles had disappeared .
but sterne found some personal belongings including boots , spectacles and small bottles of medicine . on one wall was the inscription : " bill fornia - ohio " . a trap for the allies according to sterne , " discovery of the maisy battery answers some of the questions surrounding the high mortality rate among americans on omaha beach .

twelve 88 millimeter guns ensured anti-aircraft defense , and there were several machine-gun nests and two renault tanks . some local historians , however , are more cautious . " the discovery of the site is interesting but not vitally important .

useful checklists and information handy tools contact numbers and internet links plan your budget it is always a good idea to keep track of your money especially if you are struggling to make ends meet .
if you have n't done so already , you should take the time to work out where all your money comes from and where it goes - using an online budget calculator might help you do this .
try to make time to review your budget regularly .
and remember to look at it again if your circumstances change or your debts start building up .
and do n't just think about the present - thinking early on about how your needs might change in the future can help to prevent problems occurring later on .
you could use some of the calculators mentioned below to do this .
sort out your debts if you are having problems with debts , it is better to sort things out sooner rather than later - or your situation could easily get worse .
how big is the problem ?
make a list of all your debts - remember to include any borrowing , such as your mortgage and any credit or store cards , and other debts , such as any unpaid bills for example .
check what could happen if you do n't repay your debts - some will be a higher priority than others because the consequences of not paying them are so severe .
for example , if you do n't keep up payments on your mortgage there is a real risk that you could lose your home ; if you do n't pay court fines , you could be sent to prison .
then you can start thinking about which debts are the top priority for repayment and how much you can afford to pay off each week or month .
contact all the people you owe money to as soon as possible and do n't ignore their letters or phone calls .
explain the problem and how you intend to pay .
offer to pay off the debt at an amount you can afford , even if it 's only a small amount per week or month .
and think carefully before you borrow any money to repay your debts .
you can review your borrowing in more detail and get more information on how to tackle any debt problems by taking our debt test .
boost your income make sure you claim any benefits or tax credits you are entitled to .
you can find out how to do this by looking at the directgov website .
and make sure you are n't paying any more tax than you need to - on your savings for example .
you can also check this by looking at the directgov website .
you could consider switching any savings or investments to get a better return - but remember to check whether you will pay a penalty for switching .
information comparing the different products on offer is widely available on bbc 2 ceefax , the internet and in newspapers and magazines .
reduce your spending if you need to cut back on your spending , look for areas where you are confident you can really make savings .
set yourself targets and stick to them .
but remember to be realistic .
you could consider switching to a cheaper supplier for basic services , such as gas and electricity , or for other major items of expenditure .
you might be able to save money by reviewing any loans or other borrowing .
you could think about switching to a cheaper credit card or to a different mortgage for example .
again , you can find information on what 's available both on bbc 2 ceefax , the internet - eg the fsa 's mortgage tables - and in the press .
get help if you are having real problems with your money or would like some help with sorting things out , you could think about speaking to an adviser .

sort out your debts if you are having problems with debts , it is better to sort things out sooner rather than later - or your situation could easily get worse .
how big is the problem ?
make a list of all your debts - remember to include any borrowing , such as your mortgage and any credit or store cards , and other debts , such as any unpaid bills for example .
check what could happen if you do n't repay your debts - some will be a higher priority than others because the consequences of not paying them are so severe .
for example , if you do n't keep up payments on your mortgage there is a real risk that you could lose your home ; if you do n't pay court fines , you could be sent to prison .
then you can start thinking about which debts are the top priority for repayment and how much you can afford to pay off each week or month .
contact all the people you owe money to as soon as possible and do n't ignore their letters or phone calls .
explain the problem and how you intend to pay .
offer to pay off the debt at an amount you can afford , even if it 's only a small amount per week or month .
and think carefully before you borrow any money to repay your debts .

information comparing the different products on offer is widely available on bbc 2 ceefax , the internet and in newspapers and magazines .
reduce your spending if you need to cut back on your spending , look for areas where you are confident you can really make savings .
set yourself targets and stick to them .
but remember to be realistic .
you could consider switching to a cheaper supplier for basic services , such as gas and electricity , or for other major items of expenditure .
you might be able to save money by reviewing any loans or other borrowing .
you could think about switching to a cheaper credit card or to a different mortgage for example .

contact numbers and internet links types of adviser a financial adviser can help you to sort out your financial needs and recommend products and services to meet them .
you do not have to buy any financial products to use a financial adviser different advisers have different areas of expertise and they are not all specialists in every area .
depending on the areas they cover , they may need to be authorised by the fsa .
some will recommend products from the whole market - others may only recommend products from a limited range or from a single company .
some will charge you directly for their services - whether you buy any products through them or not .
others will be paid by the companies whose products they recommend - so what they earn will depend to some extent on what products you buy , if any .
individual financial firms , such as banks and building societies , will be able to offer you some financial advice - but remember they want you to buy their products .
some solicitors and accountants may also be able to offer some limited financial advice , usually in connection with other work they are doing for you .
advice agencies , such as citizens advice bureaux and debt counselling agencies , offer advice on money matters .
their services are usually free .
but they usually concentrate on helping people with serious problems , such as debt , rather than giving more general money advice .
things to think about with any adviser , you should find out : what kind of advice do they offer ?
what qualifies them to give that advice ?
are they authorised by the fsa or do they have some other kind of accreditation ?
will they charge you for the advice ?
if so , how much will they charge ?
if not , how are they paid ?
other sources of information you can also get information on money matters from : the financial services authority ; government departments ; trade associations ; other websites ; libraries ; and newspapers and magazines .

types of adviser a financial adviser can help you to sort out your financial needs and recommend products and services to meet them .
you do not have to buy any financial products to use a financial adviser different advisers have different areas of expertise and they are not all specialists in every area .
depending on the areas they cover , they may need to be authorised by the fsa .
some will recommend products from the whole market - others may only recommend products from a limited range or from a single company .
some will charge you directly for their services - whether you buy any products through them or not .
others will be paid by the companies whose products they recommend - so what they earn will depend to some extent on what products you buy , if any .
individual financial firms , such as banks and building societies , will be able to offer you some financial advice - but remember they want you to buy their products .
some solicitors and accountants may also be able to offer some limited financial advice , usually in connection with other work they are doing for you .
advice agencies , such as citizens advice bureaux and debt counselling agencies , offer advice on money matters .
their services are usually free .
but they usually concentrate on helping people with serious problems , such as debt , rather than giving more general money advice .
things to think about with any adviser , you should find out : what kind of advice do they offer ?
what qualifies them to give that advice ?
are they authorised by the fsa or do they have some other kind of accreditation ?
will they charge you for the advice ?
if so , how much will they charge ?
if not , how are they paid ?
other sources of information you can also get information on money matters from : the financial services authority ; government departments ; trade associations ; other websites ; libraries ; and newspapers and magazines .
contact numbers and internet links citizens advice bureau free confidential and independent advice to those with money problems .

equally , heath ledger has stunned movie-goers with his chameleon-like transformation into the character of ennis del mar .
for my money ledger 's performance deserves to win because philip seymour hoffman was impersonating a real historical character ... and there was plenty of archive film footage and recorded material for him to base the characterisation .
nevertheless whoever wins in this category can be satisfied they were up against the toughest competitors delivering the finest of performances .
aside from the lead actor award which is a close race , brokeback mountain will sweep the awards in all its nominated categories .

both were equally as impressive and pivotal to the films plot , and both shared virtually the same screen time , though i will admit heath ledger did shine in this film .
again , for me , crash is not quite worthy of an oscar nomination .
i think this movie has been a bit over-hyped due to it 's extreme message of racial tension in la which , evidently , played well to the members of the academy .

it recently became the highest grossing show in broadway history .
idina menzel originated the role of elphaba on broadway the musical comes hot on the heels of andrew lloyd webber 's recent announcement that evita is returning to the west end .
it is hoped by many who work in the industry that such productions will boost london 's theatre scene .
last year 's terror attacks on the capital saw the cancellation of many west end shows and a subsequent drop-off in box office takings .
despite this , figures released in january revealed that theatre attendance in the capital was up 3.4 % last year , compared with 2004 .
however , as lord lloyd-webber pointed out in a tv interview this week , those statistics do not take into account the large number of discounted tickets sold to theatregoers in 2005 .
the composer 's most recent production , the woman in white , is to close later this month , while the queen musical we will rock you ends in october .
but the imminent arrival of big-budget productions that have already proved their credentials on broadway sounds a more positive note .
new productions include the monty python musical spamalot and the billy joel-inspired movin ' out .
they will be followed in 2007 by a musical version of the lord of the rings , due to begin previewing on saturday in toronto .
' phenomenon ' set in the emerald city before the arrival of dorothy and toto , wicked tells how the good witch glinda first met elphaba , the green-skinned wicked witch of the west .
the new york production which opened at the gershwin theatre in october 2003 has been seen by 1.75m people .
eden espinosa is currently playing the role in new york at a presentation held in london on thursday , producer david stone described it as " smart , passionate and original " .
" wicked truly is a phenomenon , " he said , adding that he hoped the west end version - rumoured to cost between £ 6m and £ 10m - would run for " many , many years " .
that may depend in part on whom director joe mantello casts in the lead roles .
no cast members have been announced yet , though stone said the role of the wizard of oz , played by oscar-winning cabaret star joel grey in the original broadway production , would be filled by an established name .
he also said some changes would be made to tailor the show to a british audience , whom he hoped would be responsive to its political subtext .
author gregory maguire , he said , was inspired to write his novel wicked : the life and times of the wicked witch of the west by the demonisation of saddam hussein in the run-up to the first gulf war .
the central message of wicked , he added , was not to judge people on appearance alone .
' dangerous ' whoever plays the role of elphaba - taken from the initials of oz creator l frank baum - will need to don the same green face-paint actress shoshana bean wore during her 18 months with the new york production as understudy and lead .
the show 's book will be adapted slightly for british audiences " it did take a month or so for my skin to adjust , " she told the bbc news website .
" there were a couple of break-outs at the beginning , and also when i left the show .
" if i sat still it took 20 minutes to apply - though i did it in seven minutes once , because the actress i was understudying for had broken a rib . "
indeed , this was not the only accident that befell the ensemble during her tenure .
" i fell in the orchestra pit once and i caught my foot in a trap door , " she said .
" it 's the most dangerous thing i 've ever done . "
bean and kate reinders - glinda in wicked 's chicago production - performed two numbers from the show on thursday that were enthusiastically received by an audience made up of west end tour operators and ticket agents .
they were also shown what mr stone called an " ooh-aah video " featuring endorsements from audience members and hollywood actor dennis quaid .
wicked opens at the apollo victoria theatre in london on 7 september .

the composer 's most recent production , the woman in white , is to close later this month , while the queen musical we will rock you ends in october .
but the imminent arrival of big-budget productions that have already proved their credentials on broadway sounds a more positive note .
new productions include the monty python musical spamalot and the billy joel-inspired movin ' out .
they will be followed in 2007 by a musical version of the lord of the rings , due to begin previewing on saturday in toronto .
' phenomenon ' set in the emerald city before the arrival of dorothy and toto , wicked tells how the good witch glinda first met elphaba , the green-skinned wicked witch of the west .
the new york production which opened at the gershwin theatre in october 2003 has been seen by 1.75m people .
eden espinosa is currently playing the role in new york at a presentation held in london on thursday , producer david stone described it as " smart , passionate and original " .
" wicked truly is a phenomenon , " he said , adding that he hoped the west end version - rumoured to cost between £ 6m and £ 10m - would run for " many , many years " .
that may depend in part on whom director joe mantello casts in the lead roles .
no cast members have been announced yet , though stone said the role of the wizard of oz , played by oscar-winning cabaret star joel grey in the original broadway production , would be filled by an established name .
he also said some changes would be made to tailor the show to a british audience , whom he hoped would be responsive to its political subtext .
author gregory maguire , he said , was inspired to write his novel wicked : the life and times of the wicked witch of the west by the demonisation of saddam hussein in the run-up to the first gulf war .
the central message of wicked , he added , was not to judge people on appearance alone .
' dangerous ' whoever plays the role of elphaba - taken from the initials of oz creator l frank baum - will need to don the same green face-paint actress shoshana bean wore during her 18 months with the new york production as understudy and lead .
the show 's book will be adapted slightly for british audiences " it did take a month or so for my skin to adjust , " she told the bbc news website .
" there were a couple of break-outs at the beginning , and also when i left the show .
" if i sat still it took 20 minutes to apply - though i did it in seven minutes once , because the actress i was understudying for had broken a rib . "
indeed , this was not the only accident that befell the ensemble during her tenure .
" i fell in the orchestra pit once and i caught my foot in a trap door , " she said .
" it 's the most dangerous thing i 've ever done . "
bean and kate reinders - glinda in wicked 's chicago production - performed two numbers from the show on thursday that were enthusiastically received by an audience made up of west end tour operators and ticket agents .
they were also shown what mr stone called an " ooh-aah video " featuring endorsements from audience members and hollywood actor dennis quaid .
wicked opens at the apollo victoria theatre in london on 7 september .

a keen gamer , mr kinnaird has packed in life as a pro-tennis player to try to make it in the world of professional computer gaming .
he has become one of the latest recruits to the quake iv squad of the uk 's leading pro-game team four-kings .
explaining the decision , mr kinnaird said the rewards for pro-gamers were far better than those available to pro-tennis players .
think fast as a tennis player mr kinnaird , from bearsden , near glasgow , made it into scotland 's national youth side and regularly trained alongside hot prospect andy murray .
the worlds of pro-tennis and pro-gaming are close , said mr kinnaird , because both require players to live and breathe their discipline .
the excellent hand-eye co-ordination that helped him to become a good tennis player would make him a better gamer too , he said .
while many pro-gaming tournaments have contests for teams , most matches revolve around one-on-one shoot-outs in which players employ a variety of outlandish weaponry to try and kill or " frag " each other .
mr kinnaird said he now spends about four hours every day training on quake iv getting to know the different " maps " that tournaments use , studying the playing styles of regular opponents and watching replays of key matches .
he added that despite quake iv 's reputation as a fast and furious shooter it does have its cerebral element too .
winning a match is not just about shooting first and faster , he said , instead playing quake iv can be very tactical as players try to work each other into areas of the " map " where they can be deprived of weapons and more easily " fragged " .
" it requires the same sort of ideas as tennis , " he said , " though the physical side is not as much you are still using your head . "
game gear despite his solid start as a pro-tennis player mr kinnaird , now 21 , believes it will be easier to make a living on the pro-gaming circuit .
" because there are so many sponsors involved , pro-gaming is bigger than tennis in a way , " he said .
mr kinnaird is spending four hours a day in the quake iv world certainly the rewards for top pro-gamers can be huge .
jonathan wendel -lrb- aka fatal1ty -rrb- won the final of the cyberathlete professional league world tour event and walked away with a cheque for $ 150,000 -lrb- £ 84,000 -rrb- .
interestingly , mr wendel is also a keen tennis player and mr kinnaird is planning on challenging him to a few sets .
the cpl world tour is only one among many tournaments that hand out big cash prizes to top players .
in 2005 the tour handed out $ 1m in prize money .
the details of the 2006 world tour are still being finalised .
mr kinnaird took part in the cpl winter event , came in at a respectable eighth place taking home $ 600 for his time .
other events he is slated to attend include the cpl summer event and the e-sports world cup .
the four-kings clan has several players in its quake iv squad one of which is david treacy -lrb- aka zaccubus -rrb- who put in a solid performance in last year 's cpl world tour .
four-kings has several sponsors , including chip giant intel and pc maker shuttle , which helps players travel the world to tournaments .
by contrast , said mr kinnaird , only tennis players who rank in the top 200 in the world are likely to get sponsors , and those ranked lower than that will spend a lot of their own money travelling to tournaments to improve their standing .
few pro-tennis players manage to make a living at their chosen sport .
" but , " said mr kinnaird , " if you are a top 20 gamer you can make a living at it more or less . "

a keen gamer , mr kinnaird has packed in life as a pro-tennis player to try to make it in the world of professional computer gaming .
he has become one of the latest recruits to the quake iv squad of the uk 's leading pro-game team four-kings .
explaining the decision , mr kinnaird said the rewards for pro-gamers were far better than those available to pro-tennis players .
think fast as a tennis player mr kinnaird , from bearsden , near glasgow , made it into scotland 's national youth side and regularly trained alongside hot prospect andy murray .
the worlds of pro-tennis and pro-gaming are close , said mr kinnaird , because both require players to live and breathe their discipline .
the excellent hand-eye co-ordination that helped him to become a good tennis player would make him a better gamer too , he said .

mr kinnaird said he now spends about four hours every day training on quake iv getting to know the different " maps " that tournaments use , studying the playing styles of regular opponents and watching replays of key matches .
he added that despite quake iv 's reputation as a fast and furious shooter it does have its cerebral element too .
winning a match is not just about shooting first and faster , he said , instead playing quake iv can be very tactical as players try to work each other into areas of the " map " where they can be deprived of weapons and more easily " fragged " .
" it requires the same sort of ideas as tennis , " he said , " though the physical side is not as much you are still using your head . "

the four-kings clan has several players in its quake iv squad one of which is david treacy -lrb- aka zaccubus -rrb- who put in a solid performance in last year 's cpl world tour .

by contrast , said mr kinnaird , only tennis players who rank in the top 200 in the world are likely to get sponsors , and those ranked lower than that will spend a lot of their own money travelling to tournaments to improve their standing .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- politics show -pipe- london : transport in the limelight home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it politics show archive contact us faqs interviews meet the team related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : friday , 3 february 2006 , 09:22 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version london : transport in the limelight tim donovan political editor bbc london peter hendy - london transport commissioner it is the biggest hands-on job in transport , and a new man is in charge .
peter hendy became london 's new transport commissioner on 1 february 2006 .
he takes over from the american , bob kiley .
the network he oversees is enormous and complex .
the tube alone accounts for half the total train journeys made in the uk .
there are 600 underground trains running over 250 miles .
more than 8,000 buses carry 6m passengers each day .
the commissioner also regulates london 's taxis , and controls its main roads and traffic lights .
but he does not manage the overground railways and that could be a key issue over the next few years .
he believes the national rail network is key to easing transport problems in the capital .
" in my view the largest piece of transport in london with underexploited capacity is the rail network . " , he said .
transport for london has a £ 5bn annual budget and it has been given been given unprecedented powers by government to borrow £ 3bn over the next five years .
the money would be invested in major projects like extending the docklands light railway and completing the east london line .
peter hendy himself made a fortune from bus privatisation , but moved back to the public sector in 2001 accepting a job as london 's director of surface transport .
he put 1500 more buses on the streets , and he helped sort out problems with the congestion charge .
he now has the challenge of extending the scheme westwards .
but much bigger will be the task of improving the tube - the last few years have been plagued by difficulties with the private consortia locked into contracts to upgrade the network .
he has the opportunity to re-negotiate these contracts next year , and to try and get a better deal for londoners .
and hanging over everything he does are the olympics - he has to put in place a raft of improvements to the transport system in time for the games only six years away .
we bring you the first in-depth broadcast interview with new transport commissioner peter hendy who started his job on wednesday 1 february 2006 .
zia trench reports on what is making londoners hot under the collar on the tubes , buses and trains , looking at issues of fare increases , overcrowding , safety , subsidy from the government and oyster cards on national trains .

peter hendy became london 's new transport commissioner on 1 february 2006 .
he takes over from the american , bob kiley .
the network he oversees is enormous and complex .
the tube alone accounts for half the total train journeys made in the uk .
there are 600 underground trains running over 250 miles .
more than 8,000 buses carry 6m passengers each day .
the commissioner also regulates london 's taxis , and controls its main roads and traffic lights .
but he does not manage the overground railways and that could be a key issue over the next few years .
he believes the national rail network is key to easing transport problems in the capital .
" in my view the largest piece of transport in london with underexploited capacity is the rail network . " , he said .
transport for london has a £ 5bn annual budget and it has been given been given unprecedented powers by government to borrow £ 3bn over the next five years .
the money would be invested in major projects like extending the docklands light railway and completing the east london line .
peter hendy himself made a fortune from bus privatisation , but moved back to the public sector in 2001 accepting a job as london 's director of surface transport .
he put 1500 more buses on the streets , and he helped sort out problems with the congestion charge .
he now has the challenge of extending the scheme westwards .
but much bigger will be the task of improving the tube - the last few years have been plagued by difficulties with the private consortia locked into contracts to upgrade the network .
he has the opportunity to re-negotiate these contracts next year , and to try and get a better deal for londoners .
and hanging over everything he does are the olympics - he has to put in place a raft of improvements to the transport system in time for the games only six years away .
we bring you the first in-depth broadcast interview with new transport commissioner peter hendy who started his job on wednesday 1 february 2006 .
zia trench reports on what is making londoners hot under the collar on the tubes , buses and trains , looking at issues of fare increases , overcrowding , safety , subsidy from the government and oyster cards on national trains .
