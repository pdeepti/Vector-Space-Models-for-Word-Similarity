officials worry the weather could result in more accidents . a day after the roof of an ice skating rink in bad reichenhall collapsed under a heavy load of wet snow , officials in surrounding towns and across the border in austria fret that continued snowfall could cause more rooftops to cave in .
many building authorities are calling for inspections of public places . throughout austria , fire fighters , army soldiers and civilian experts checked snow-laden rooftops over sports centers , train stations , exhibition halls and other buildings with flat roofs to determine if they were in imminent danger of collapse .
in the province of salzburg , which is just across the border from bad reichenhall , authorities shut down several sports centers citing too much wet , heavy snow .
meanwhile , emergency rescue crews reviewed their readiness plans for responding quickly in the event of a roof collapse , salzburg mayor heinz schaden told national broadcaster orf . averting disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roof of an ice rink in bad reichenhall collapsed on monday , killing at least 11 people .
worried about another disaster in their region , police in traunstein near bad reichenhall responded quickly to concerns from train authorities that heavy snow was weighing down a roof over a train track .
police spokesman johann bohnert said all train traffic was halted temporarily until the snow could be removed .
otherwise there was a very real risk the roof could collapse , he said , adding that after the disaster in the ice rink " we are now very cautious . " meanwhile , meteorologists predicted more snow for the coming days and warned that up to 20 cm. of new snow could fall , mixing with the already high levels of fallen snow .
streets and train tracks will likely be impassable and trees could break under the weight of the snow .
the german weather service recommended people in the hardest hit regions of southern german along the border of austria avoid travelling by car and stay indoors if possible . wet snow partially to blame to some the high degree of caution may seem exaggerated for a region seasonally prone to heavy snowfall .
but meteorologists are saying the particular combination of moist air brought in by the barometric low " annekathrin " and temperatures hovering around freezing create an especially wet snow .
and wet snow is heavier than fluffy dry fakes . as a comparison , a cubic meter of wet snow weighs between 300 and 500 kilograms , the same amount of dry snow weighs only about 100 to 200 kilograms . manfred spatzierer , a meteorologist from wetterdienst meteomedia , told dpa news agencies that south eastern bavarian had received about 50 liters of wet snow per square meter in just 24 hours .
" that is a big dumping , " he said and added that the cold temperatures meant the snow would stick .
if it were a bit warmer , the snow would begin to melt ; at colder temperatures the snow would be lighter and the wind would carry it away , he said . snowfall at near freezing is always " quite dangerous , " spatzierer said .

the german weather service recommended people in the hardest hit regions of southern german along the border of austria avoid travelling by car and stay indoors if possible . wet snow partially to blame to some the high degree of caution may seem exaggerated for a region seasonally prone to heavy snowfall .
but meteorologists are saying the particular combination of moist air brought in by the barometric low " annekathrin " and temperatures hovering around freezing create an especially wet snow .
and wet snow is heavier than fluffy dry fakes . as a comparison , a cubic meter of wet snow weighs between 300 and 500 kilograms , the same amount of dry snow weighs only about 100 to 200 kilograms . manfred spatzierer , a meteorologist from wetterdienst meteomedia , told dpa news agencies that south eastern bavarian had received about 50 liters of wet snow per square meter in just 24 hours .
" that is a big dumping , " he said and added that the cold temperatures meant the snow would stick .
if it were a bit warmer , the snow would begin to melt ; at colder temperatures the snow would be lighter and the wind would carry it away , he said . snowfall at near freezing is always " quite dangerous , " spatzierer said .
his colleague michael beisenherz agreed : " if it had been normal powder snow , we would have had about a meter of it , but it would not have remained on the roof top .

muslim kids , however , are still waiting for lessons in islam . turkish-born emin alan has been teaching " islamic instruction " at hansa high school in cologne for six years .
he says it 's important that germany 's 800,000 muslim pupils learn about islam in school , since it is part of their identity . " i think it 's also a constitutional mandate for the state to give pupils the chance to learn about their religion , " said alan . the classes are offered at the same time as practical philosophy and catholic and protestant religious education .
they are meant to help students explore their religion .
in contrast to the christian classes , however , they do n't involve actual religious instruction .
the kids learn theory and practical information .
they do n't deal with dogmas or religious truths , as in koran classes or sermons . in addition , non-muslim children also take the classes .
" i take part because i might learn something new here , " said toljan eifler .
" i hardly knew anything about islam beforehand . "
he said he was surprised that the muslims ' creed was quite similar to that of christians .
" i used to think it was totally different . "
divided communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic schools teach kids about their religion the courses are indeed meant to contribute to better understanding between kids with different backgrounds and religions .
but muslim organizations in germany want more .
for years they have been demanding that islamic education be introduced to schools on a par with the catholic and protestant lessons - that is instruction that 's does n't only inform kids about islam , but communicates muslim values and the islamic faith . but that 's easier said than done .
germany 's muslims have so far been unable to agree on one organization to represent their interests and remain divided .
the differences are both religious and political - and often muslim migrants ' countries of origin play a role too .
also , sunnis , shiites and alevis each want their own approach to islam instruction . in the meantime , one german college in münster educates aspiring islamic religious instructors - as well as up-and-coming catholic and protestant teachers which all of the country 's universities train .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public schools could also provide islamic teachings the future of the teachers educated at the university of münster depends on whether any of germany 's muslim organizations succeed in being formally recognized as religious communities , said sven muhammad kalisch , who heads the department that started offering the course of studies last year .
only such recognition would allow german schools to provide regular denominational islamic religious lessons .
and such instruction would have to take place in german , kalisch said . no one islam " in germany there are muslims with entirely different ethnic origins .
there are german converts .
and there are arabic , turkish , pakistani , iranian muslims - muslims from all countries " said kalisch .
" thus , our aim must be to give all muslims who are interested such religious instruction .
and that means it has to be in german . " the first class of islamic teachers will graduate from münster in 2008 .
and kalisch is confident that the legal situation will have changed by then .
after all , germany is interested in regulated and , above all , transparent islamic instruction , said kalisch , adding that complaints arise again and again that too many children learn about their religion in private mosque organizations and islamic schools whose teaching contents are usually unavailable to the public . anne passow -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavaria shuts islamic center , citing dangers amid debate over how best to prevent terrorism while protecting civil liberties , one german state has banned an islamic group , and an official from another state suggested electronically tagging militants .

officials worry the weather could result in more accidents . a day after the roof of an ice skating rink in bad reichenhall collapsed under a heavy load of wet snow , officials in surrounding towns and across the border in austria fret that continued snowfall could cause more rooftops to cave in .
many building authorities are calling for inspections of public places . throughout austria , fire fighters , army soldiers and civilian experts checked snow-laden rooftops over sports centers , train stations , exhibition halls and other buildings with flat roofs to determine if they were in imminent danger of collapse .
in the province of salzburg , which is just across the border from bad reichenhall , authorities shut down several sports centers citing too much wet , heavy snow .

"
" the gas dispute has already moved beyond the borders of russia and ukraine , " the paper wrote , adding that it will spread to wealthy western european countries and then to poorer nations as well .
the paper does n't regard moscow 's promise to guarantee gas delivery to the eu as stable , writing : " moscow caved in to the pressure from the european union , but warned that it wo n't be able to continue covering for theft by the ukrainians . " the independent , from london , asked why ukraine has been singled out by russia for a price hike in natural gas when other former soviet states also pay less than the going market rates .
the paper concluded that it was a political decision .
" vladimir putin intends to destabilize russia 's western neighbor in the hope of unseating its leader , viktor yushchenko , " the independent wrote .
" the ukrainian president has been a thorn in the kremlin 's side since he was swept to power amid mass demonstrations against russian influence .
with elections looming in ukraine , president putin regards this as the right time to exert pressure . "
the paper said that the crisis has made it clear that europe is urgently in need of a common energy policy . magyar nemzet , from budapest , urged hungarian politicians in charge of energy issues to no longer keep their heads stuck in the sand , as hungary is more dependent on energy imports than its neighbors .
" hungary is to 80 percent dependent on imports , and natural gas makes up more than 40 percent of the energy sector , " the paper wrote .
" it is very regrettable that it is only now , in such a critical situation , that we are weighing the options of having coal and nuclear energy play a bigger part in meeting our energy needs - albeit after the use of more environmentally friendly renewable energy sources .

"
" the gas dispute has already moved beyond the borders of russia and ukraine , " the paper wrote , adding that it will spread to wealthy western european countries and then to poorer nations as well .
the paper does n't regard moscow 's promise to guarantee gas delivery to the eu as stable , writing : " moscow caved in to the pressure from the european union , but warned that it wo n't be able to continue covering for theft by the ukrainians . " the independent , from london , asked why ukraine has been singled out by russia for a price hike in natural gas when other former soviet states also pay less than the going market rates .
the paper concluded that it was a political decision .
" vladimir putin intends to destabilize russia 's western neighbor in the hope of unseating its leader , viktor yushchenko , " the independent wrote .
" the ukrainian president has been a thorn in the kremlin 's side since he was swept to power amid mass demonstrations against russian influence .
with elections looming in ukraine , president putin regards this as the right time to exert pressure . "
the paper said that the crisis has made it clear that europe is urgently in need of a common energy policy . magyar nemzet , from budapest , urged hungarian politicians in charge of energy issues to no longer keep their heads stuck in the sand , as hungary is more dependent on energy imports than its neighbors .
" hungary is to 80 percent dependent on imports , and natural gas makes up more than 40 percent of the energy sector , " the paper wrote .
" it is very regrettable that it is only now , in such a critical situation , that we are weighing the options of having coal and nuclear energy play a bigger part in meeting our energy needs - albeit after the use of more environmentally friendly renewable energy sources . " liberation , from paris , commented that ukraine is now staring the capitalist revolution in the face .
" russia is demanding market prices for its gas , otherwise it will turn off the tap , " the paper wrote .
" with that , russia is using a tried and true strategy of international capitalism - how can this be thrown in russia 's face ? " paris ' le monde labeled the dispute the " first declaration of war in the 21st century . "

the fire department warned that the external walls could collapse , trapping those working in the rubble . local officials said the recovery operation would continue later on tuesday once heavy lifting equipment was in place , but hopes of finding any more survivors from monday 's accident have faded . police on tuesday said rescuers had recovered the bodies of 11 people , including two teenagers and six children between the ages of nine and 12 .

the fire department warned that the external walls could collapse , trapping those working in the rubble . local officials said the recovery operation would continue later on tuesday once heavy lifting equipment was in place , but hopes of finding any more survivors from monday 's accident have faded . police on tuesday said rescuers had recovered the bodies of 11 people , including two teenagers and six children between the ages of nine and 12 .
another 18 people were taken to local hospitals for treatment for serious injury following the accident . asked whether there had been any signs of life from the four people believed to be still under the rubble , chief fire officer rudi zeif said : " no , unfortunately . " a catastrophe " the situation is catastrophic , " a bavarian red cross spokesman said , adding that the recovery operation was extremely difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifty people were thought to have been in the hall when the roof collapsed the area around the rink was evacuated monday , but rescue efforts were complicated by continued snowfall , following a blizzard that began in the early hours of monday and reportedly dumped some 30 centimeters -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- of snow on the region .
emergency personnel had difficulty reaching the hall because traffic had virtually stalled due to the snow . the fire brigade attempted to prop up remaining sections of the roof to allow search operations in the building . " the rescue work is proving very difficult .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : locals had complained for years that the rink was in need of repairs the chairman of the local ice hockey club told german public television that local authorities had warned his team at around 3:30 p.m. that the hall was unsafe for a training session planned in the afternoon .
" ice skating for the public evidently still went on , " thomas rumpeltes told zdf television . however , in a press conference , bad reichenhall mayor wolfgang heitmeier brushed aside accusations that the collapse of the 1970s construction was foreseeable given the weight of new fallen snow .
" the warning levels had n't been reached by monday afternoon , " he said . no answers yet bavarian premier edmund stoiber visited the disaster zone tuesday morning and promised rapid help for the families of the victims .
" we will establish a fund for the victims , " stoiber said .

muslim kids , however , are still waiting for lessons in islam . turkish-born emin alan has been teaching " islamic instruction " at hansa high school in cologne for six years .
he says it 's important that germany 's 800,000 muslim pupils learn about islam in school , since it is part of their identity . " i think it 's also a constitutional mandate for the state to give pupils the chance to learn about their religion , " said alan . the classes are offered at the same time as practical philosophy and catholic and protestant religious education .
they are meant to help students explore their religion .
in contrast to the christian classes , however , they do n't involve actual religious instruction .
the kids learn theory and practical information .
they do n't deal with dogmas or religious truths , as in koran classes or sermons . in addition , non-muslim children also take the classes .
" i take part because i might learn something new here , " said toljan eifler .

the differences are both religious and political - and often muslim migrants ' countries of origin play a role too .
also , sunnis , shiites and alevis each want their own approach to islam instruction . in the meantime , one german college in münster educates aspiring islamic religious instructors - as well as up-and-coming catholic and protestant teachers which all of the country 's universities train .

he said he was surprised that the muslims ' creed was quite similar to that of christians .
" i used to think it was totally different . "
divided communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic schools teach kids about their religion the courses are indeed meant to contribute to better understanding between kids with different backgrounds and religions .
but muslim organizations in germany want more .
for years they have been demanding that islamic education be introduced to schools on a par with the catholic and protestant lessons - that is instruction that 's does n't only inform kids about islam , but communicates muslim values and the islamic faith . but that 's easier said than done .
germany 's muslims have so far been unable to agree on one organization to represent their interests and remain divided .
the differences are both religious and political - and often muslim migrants ' countries of origin play a role too .
also , sunnis , shiites and alevis each want their own approach to islam instruction . in the meantime , one german college in münster educates aspiring islamic religious instructors - as well as up-and-coming catholic and protestant teachers which all of the country 's universities train .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public schools could also provide islamic teachings the future of the teachers educated at the university of münster depends on whether any of germany 's muslim organizations succeed in being formally recognized as religious communities , said sven muhammad kalisch , who heads the department that started offering the course of studies last year .
only such recognition would allow german schools to provide regular denominational islamic religious lessons .
and such instruction would have to take place in german , kalisch said . no one islam " in germany there are muslims with entirely different ethnic origins .
there are german converts .
and there are arabic , turkish , pakistani , iranian muslims - muslims from all countries " said kalisch .
" thus , our aim must be to give all muslims who are interested such religious instruction .
and that means it has to be in german . " the first class of islamic teachers will graduate from münster in 2008 .
and kalisch is confident that the legal situation will have changed by then .
after all , germany is interested in regulated and , above all , transparent islamic instruction , said kalisch , adding that complaints arise again and again that too many children learn about their religion in private mosque organizations and islamic schools whose teaching contents are usually unavailable to the public . anne passow -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavaria shuts islamic center , citing dangers amid debate over how best to prevent terrorism while protecting civil liberties , one german state has banned an islamic group , and an official from another state suggested electronically tagging militants .

"
" the gas dispute has already moved beyond the borders of russia and ukraine , " the paper wrote , adding that it will spread to wealthy western european countries and then to poorer nations as well .
the paper does n't regard moscow 's promise to guarantee gas delivery to the eu as stable , writing : " moscow caved in to the pressure from the european union , but warned that it wo n't be able to continue covering for theft by the ukrainians . " the independent , from london , asked why ukraine has been singled out by russia for a price hike in natural gas when other former soviet states also pay less than the going market rates .
the paper concluded that it was a political decision .
" vladimir putin intends to destabilize russia 's western neighbor in the hope of unseating its leader , viktor yushchenko , " the independent wrote .
" the ukrainian president has been a thorn in the kremlin 's side since he was swept to power amid mass demonstrations against russian influence .
with elections looming in ukraine , president putin regards this as the right time to exert pressure . "
the paper said that the crisis has made it clear that europe is urgently in need of a common energy policy . magyar nemzet , from budapest , urged hungarian politicians in charge of energy issues to no longer keep their heads stuck in the sand , as hungary is more dependent on energy imports than its neighbors .
" hungary is to 80 percent dependent on imports , and natural gas makes up more than 40 percent of the energy sector , " the paper wrote .
" it is very regrettable that it is only now , in such a critical situation , that we are weighing the options of having coal and nuclear energy play a bigger part in meeting our energy needs - albeit after the use of more environmentally friendly renewable energy sources . " liberation , from paris , commented that ukraine is now staring the capitalist revolution in the face .
" russia is demanding market prices for its gas , otherwise it will turn off the tap , " the paper wrote .
" with that , russia is using a tried and true strategy of international capitalism - how can this be thrown in russia 's face ? " paris ' le monde labeled the dispute the " first declaration of war in the 21st century . "
" one country cuts off the energy supply of another because it does n't give into its demands , " the paper wrote .
" russia , the largest natural gas producer in the world , pushed the button on the gas weapon .
with the emergence of consumer giants such as china and india , raw materials have become the economic weapons of deterrence , if not mass destruction . " " of course it 's hardly sensible or fitting that ukraine or other countries of the former soviet union build their economies on the back of extremely cheap russian energy imports , " wrote berlingske tidende from copenhagen .
" but as an energy superpower , russia has a responsibility to raise prices gradually over a number of years , so that it does n't force its clients into a crisis situation .
the current demonstration of power over the ukraine is insupportable , because it so baldly demonstrates the iron fist of the kremlin when it comes to foreign policy .

officials worry the weather could result in more accidents . a day after the roof of an ice skating rink in bad reichenhall collapsed under a heavy load of wet snow , officials in surrounding towns and across the border in austria fret that continued snowfall could cause more rooftops to cave in .
many building authorities are calling for inspections of public places . throughout austria , fire fighters , army soldiers and civilian experts checked snow-laden rooftops over sports centers , train stations , exhibition halls and other buildings with flat roofs to determine if they were in imminent danger of collapse .
in the province of salzburg , which is just across the border from bad reichenhall , authorities shut down several sports centers citing too much wet , heavy snow .
meanwhile , emergency rescue crews reviewed their readiness plans for responding quickly in the event of a roof collapse , salzburg mayor heinz schaden told national broadcaster orf . averting disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roof of an ice rink in bad reichenhall collapsed on monday , killing at least 11 people .
worried about another disaster in their region , police in traunstein near bad reichenhall responded quickly to concerns from train authorities that heavy snow was weighing down a roof over a train track .
police spokesman johann bohnert said all train traffic was halted temporarily until the snow could be removed .
otherwise there was a very real risk the roof could collapse , he said , adding that after the disaster in the ice rink " we are now very cautious . " meanwhile , meteorologists predicted more snow for the coming days and warned that up to 20 cm. of new snow could fall , mixing with the already high levels of fallen snow .
streets and train tracks will likely be impassable and trees could break under the weight of the snow .
the german weather service recommended people in the hardest hit regions of southern german along the border of austria avoid travelling by car and stay indoors if possible . wet snow partially to blame to some the high degree of caution may seem exaggerated for a region seasonally prone to heavy snowfall .
but meteorologists are saying the particular combination of moist air brought in by the barometric low " annekathrin " and temperatures hovering around freezing create an especially wet snow .
and wet snow is heavier than fluffy dry fakes . as a comparison , a cubic meter of wet snow weighs between 300 and 500 kilograms , the same amount of dry snow weighs only about 100 to 200 kilograms . manfred spatzierer , a meteorologist from wetterdienst meteomedia , told dpa news agencies that south eastern bavarian had received about 50 liters of wet snow per square meter in just 24 hours .
" that is a big dumping , " he said and added that the cold temperatures meant the snow would stick .
if it were a bit warmer , the snow would begin to melt ; at colder temperatures the snow would be lighter and the wind would carry it away , he said . snowfall at near freezing is always " quite dangerous , " spatzierer said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 03.01.2006 islamic school lessons face hurdles in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are waiting for the privilege of learning about islam in school catholic and protestant pupils in germany learn about their faiths in special religion classes at school .
muslim kids , however , are still waiting for lessons in islam . turkish-born emin alan has been teaching " islamic instruction " at hansa high school in cologne for six years .
he says it 's important that germany 's 800,000 muslim pupils learn about islam in school , since it is part of their identity . " i think it 's also a constitutional mandate for the state to give pupils the chance to learn about their religion , " said alan . the classes are offered at the same time as practical philosophy and catholic and protestant religious education .
they are meant to help students explore their religion .
in contrast to the christian classes , however , they do n't involve actual religious instruction .
the kids learn theory and practical information .
they do n't deal with dogmas or religious truths , as in koran classes or sermons . in addition , non-muslim children also take the classes .
" i take part because i might learn something new here , " said toljan eifler .
" i hardly knew anything about islam beforehand . "
he said he was surprised that the muslims ' creed was quite similar to that of christians .
" i used to think it was totally different . "
divided communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic schools teach kids about their religion the courses are indeed meant to contribute to better understanding between kids with different backgrounds and religions .
but muslim organizations in germany want more .
for years they have been demanding that islamic education be introduced to schools on a par with the catholic and protestant lessons - that is instruction that 's does n't only inform kids about islam , but communicates muslim values and the islamic faith . but that 's easier said than done .
germany 's muslims have so far been unable to agree on one organization to represent their interests and remain divided .
the differences are both religious and political - and often muslim migrants ' countries of origin play a role too .
also , sunnis , shiites and alevis each want their own approach to islam instruction . in the meantime , one german college in münster educates aspiring islamic religious instructors - as well as up-and-coming catholic and protestant teachers which all of the country 's universities train .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public schools could also provide islamic teachings the future of the teachers educated at the university of münster depends on whether any of germany 's muslim organizations succeed in being formally recognized as religious communities , said sven muhammad kalisch , who heads the department that started offering the course of studies last year .
only such recognition would allow german schools to provide regular denominational islamic religious lessons .
and such instruction would have to take place in german , kalisch said . no one islam " in germany there are muslims with entirely different ethnic origins .
there are german converts .
and there are arabic , turkish , pakistani , iranian muslims - muslims from all countries " said kalisch .
" thus , our aim must be to give all muslims who are interested such religious instruction .
and that means it has to be in german . " the first class of islamic teachers will graduate from münster in 2008 .
and kalisch is confident that the legal situation will have changed by then .
after all , germany is interested in regulated and , above all , transparent islamic instruction , said kalisch , adding that complaints arise again and again that too many children learn about their religion in private mosque organizations and islamic schools whose teaching contents are usually unavailable to the public . anne passow -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavaria shuts islamic center , citing dangers amid debate over how best to prevent terrorism while protecting civil liberties , one german state has banned an islamic group , and an official from another state suggested electronically tagging militants .

muslim kids , however , are still waiting for lessons in islam . turkish-born emin alan has been teaching " islamic instruction " at hansa high school in cologne for six years .
he says it 's important that germany 's 800,000 muslim pupils learn about islam in school , since it is part of their identity . " i think it 's also a constitutional mandate for the state to give pupils the chance to learn about their religion , " said alan . the classes are offered at the same time as practical philosophy and catholic and protestant religious education .
they are meant to help students explore their religion .
in contrast to the christian classes , however , they do n't involve actual religious instruction .
the kids learn theory and practical information .
they do n't deal with dogmas or religious truths , as in koran classes or sermons . in addition , non-muslim children also take the classes .
" i take part because i might learn something new here , " said toljan eifler .
" i hardly knew anything about islam beforehand . "
he said he was surprised that the muslims ' creed was quite similar to that of christians .
" i used to think it was totally different . "
divided communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic schools teach kids about their religion the courses are indeed meant to contribute to better understanding between kids with different backgrounds and religions .
but muslim organizations in germany want more .
for years they have been demanding that islamic education be introduced to schools on a par with the catholic and protestant lessons - that is instruction that 's does n't only inform kids about islam , but communicates muslim values and the islamic faith . but that 's easier said than done .
germany 's muslims have so far been unable to agree on one organization to represent their interests and remain divided .
the differences are both religious and political - and often muslim migrants ' countries of origin play a role too .
also , sunnis , shiites and alevis each want their own approach to islam instruction . in the meantime , one german college in münster educates aspiring islamic religious instructors - as well as up-and-coming catholic and protestant teachers which all of the country 's universities train .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public schools could also provide islamic teachings the future of the teachers educated at the university of münster depends on whether any of germany 's muslim organizations succeed in being formally recognized as religious communities , said sven muhammad kalisch , who heads the department that started offering the course of studies last year .
only such recognition would allow german schools to provide regular denominational islamic religious lessons .
and such instruction would have to take place in german , kalisch said . no one islam " in germany there are muslims with entirely different ethnic origins .
there are german converts .
and there are arabic , turkish , pakistani , iranian muslims - muslims from all countries " said kalisch .
" thus , our aim must be to give all muslims who are interested such religious instruction .
and that means it has to be in german . " the first class of islamic teachers will graduate from münster in 2008 .
and kalisch is confident that the legal situation will have changed by then .
after all , germany is interested in regulated and , above all , transparent islamic instruction , said kalisch , adding that complaints arise again and again that too many children learn about their religion in private mosque organizations and islamic schools whose teaching contents are usually unavailable to the public . anne passow -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavaria shuts islamic center , citing dangers amid debate over how best to prevent terrorism while protecting civil liberties , one german state has banned an islamic group , and an official from another state suggested electronically tagging militants .

muslim kids , however , are still waiting for lessons in islam . turkish-born emin alan has been teaching " islamic instruction " at hansa high school in cologne for six years .
he says it 's important that germany 's 800,000 muslim pupils learn about islam in school , since it is part of their identity . " i think it 's also a constitutional mandate for the state to give pupils the chance to learn about their religion , " said alan . the classes are offered at the same time as practical philosophy and catholic and protestant religious education .
they are meant to help students explore their religion .
in contrast to the christian classes , however , they do n't involve actual religious instruction .
the kids learn theory and practical information .
they do n't deal with dogmas or religious truths , as in koran classes or sermons . in addition , non-muslim children also take the classes .
" i take part because i might learn something new here , " said toljan eifler .
" i hardly knew anything about islam beforehand . "
he said he was surprised that the muslims ' creed was quite similar to that of christians .
" i used to think it was totally different . "
divided communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic schools teach kids about their religion the courses are indeed meant to contribute to better understanding between kids with different backgrounds and religions .
but muslim organizations in germany want more .
for years they have been demanding that islamic education be introduced to schools on a par with the catholic and protestant lessons - that is instruction that 's does n't only inform kids about islam , but communicates muslim values and the islamic faith . but that 's easier said than done .
germany 's muslims have so far been unable to agree on one organization to represent their interests and remain divided .
the differences are both religious and political - and often muslim migrants ' countries of origin play a role too .
also , sunnis , shiites and alevis each want their own approach to islam instruction . in the meantime , one german college in münster educates aspiring islamic religious instructors - as well as up-and-coming catholic and protestant teachers which all of the country 's universities train .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public schools could also provide islamic teachings the future of the teachers educated at the university of münster depends on whether any of germany 's muslim organizations succeed in being formally recognized as religious communities , said sven muhammad kalisch , who heads the department that started offering the course of studies last year .
only such recognition would allow german schools to provide regular denominational islamic religious lessons .
and such instruction would have to take place in german , kalisch said . no one islam " in germany there are muslims with entirely different ethnic origins .
there are german converts .
and there are arabic , turkish , pakistani , iranian muslims - muslims from all countries " said kalisch .
" thus , our aim must be to give all muslims who are interested such religious instruction .
and that means it has to be in german . " the first class of islamic teachers will graduate from münster in 2008 .
and kalisch is confident that the legal situation will have changed by then .
after all , germany is interested in regulated and , above all , transparent islamic instruction , said kalisch , adding that complaints arise again and again that too many children learn about their religion in private mosque organizations and islamic schools whose teaching contents are usually unavailable to the public . anne passow -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavaria shuts islamic center , citing dangers amid debate over how best to prevent terrorism while protecting civil liberties , one german state has banned an islamic group , and an official from another state suggested electronically tagging militants .

he says it 's important that germany 's 800,000 muslim pupils learn about islam in school , since it is part of their identity . " i think it 's also a constitutional mandate for the state to give pupils the chance to learn about their religion , " said alan . the classes are offered at the same time as practical philosophy and catholic and protestant religious education .
they are meant to help students explore their religion .
in contrast to the christian classes , however , they do n't involve actual religious instruction .
the kids learn theory and practical information .
they do n't deal with dogmas or religious truths , as in koran classes or sermons . in addition , non-muslim children also take the classes .
" i take part because i might learn something new here , " said toljan eifler .
" i hardly knew anything about islam beforehand . "
he said he was surprised that the muslims ' creed was quite similar to that of christians .
" i used to think it was totally different . "
divided communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic schools teach kids about their religion the courses are indeed meant to contribute to better understanding between kids with different backgrounds and religions .
but muslim organizations in germany want more .
for years they have been demanding that islamic education be introduced to schools on a par with the catholic and protestant lessons - that is instruction that 's does n't only inform kids about islam , but communicates muslim values and the islamic faith . but that 's easier said than done .
germany 's muslims have so far been unable to agree on one organization to represent their interests and remain divided .
the differences are both religious and political - and often muslim migrants ' countries of origin play a role too .
also , sunnis , shiites and alevis each want their own approach to islam instruction . in the meantime , one german college in münster educates aspiring islamic religious instructors - as well as up-and-coming catholic and protestant teachers which all of the country 's universities train .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public schools could also provide islamic teachings the future of the teachers educated at the university of münster depends on whether any of germany 's muslim organizations succeed in being formally recognized as religious communities , said sven muhammad kalisch , who heads the department that started offering the course of studies last year .
only such recognition would allow german schools to provide regular denominational islamic religious lessons .
and such instruction would have to take place in german , kalisch said . no one islam " in germany there are muslims with entirely different ethnic origins .
there are german converts .
and there are arabic , turkish , pakistani , iranian muslims - muslims from all countries " said kalisch .
" thus , our aim must be to give all muslims who are interested such religious instruction .
and that means it has to be in german . " the first class of islamic teachers will graduate from münster in 2008 .
and kalisch is confident that the legal situation will have changed by then .
after all , germany is interested in regulated and , above all , transparent islamic instruction , said kalisch , adding that complaints arise again and again that too many children learn about their religion in private mosque organizations and islamic schools whose teaching contents are usually unavailable to the public . anne passow -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavaria shuts islamic center , citing dangers amid debate over how best to prevent terrorism while protecting civil liberties , one german state has banned an islamic group , and an official from another state suggested electronically tagging militants .

the fire department warned that the external walls could collapse , trapping those working in the rubble . local officials said the recovery operation would continue later on tuesday once heavy lifting equipment was in place , but hopes of finding any more survivors from monday 's accident have faded . police on tuesday said rescuers had recovered the bodies of 11 people , including two teenagers and six children between the ages of nine and 12 .

officials worry the weather could result in more accidents . a day after the roof of an ice skating rink in bad reichenhall collapsed under a heavy load of wet snow , officials in surrounding towns and across the border in austria fret that continued snowfall could cause more rooftops to cave in .
many building authorities are calling for inspections of public places . throughout austria , fire fighters , army soldiers and civilian experts checked snow-laden rooftops over sports centers , train stations , exhibition halls and other buildings with flat roofs to determine if they were in imminent danger of collapse .
in the province of salzburg , which is just across the border from bad reichenhall , authorities shut down several sports centers citing too much wet , heavy snow .
meanwhile , emergency rescue crews reviewed their readiness plans for responding quickly in the event of a roof collapse , salzburg mayor heinz schaden told national broadcaster orf . averting disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roof of an ice rink in bad reichenhall collapsed on monday , killing at least 11 people .
worried about another disaster in their region , police in traunstein near bad reichenhall responded quickly to concerns from train authorities that heavy snow was weighing down a roof over a train track .
police spokesman johann bohnert said all train traffic was halted temporarily until the snow could be removed .
otherwise there was a very real risk the roof could collapse , he said , adding that after the disaster in the ice rink " we are now very cautious . " meanwhile , meteorologists predicted more snow for the coming days and warned that up to 20 cm. of new snow could fall , mixing with the already high levels of fallen snow .
streets and train tracks will likely be impassable and trees could break under the weight of the snow .
the german weather service recommended people in the hardest hit regions of southern german along the border of austria avoid travelling by car and stay indoors if possible . wet snow partially to blame to some the high degree of caution may seem exaggerated for a region seasonally prone to heavy snowfall .
but meteorologists are saying the particular combination of moist air brought in by the barometric low " annekathrin " and temperatures hovering around freezing create an especially wet snow .
and wet snow is heavier than fluffy dry fakes . as a comparison , a cubic meter of wet snow weighs between 300 and 500 kilograms , the same amount of dry snow weighs only about 100 to 200 kilograms . manfred spatzierer , a meteorologist from wetterdienst meteomedia , told dpa news agencies that south eastern bavarian had received about 50 liters of wet snow per square meter in just 24 hours .
" that is a big dumping , " he said and added that the cold temperatures meant the snow would stick .
if it were a bit warmer , the snow would begin to melt ; at colder temperatures the snow would be lighter and the wind would carry it away , he said . snowfall at near freezing is always " quite dangerous , " spatzierer said .

officials worry the weather could result in more accidents . a day after the roof of an ice skating rink in bad reichenhall collapsed under a heavy load of wet snow , officials in surrounding towns and across the border in austria fret that continued snowfall could cause more rooftops to cave in .
many building authorities are calling for inspections of public places . throughout austria , fire fighters , army soldiers and civilian experts checked snow-laden rooftops over sports centers , train stations , exhibition halls and other buildings with flat roofs to determine if they were in imminent danger of collapse .
in the province of salzburg , which is just across the border from bad reichenhall , authorities shut down several sports centers citing too much wet , heavy snow .
meanwhile , emergency rescue crews reviewed their readiness plans for responding quickly in the event of a roof collapse , salzburg mayor heinz schaden told national broadcaster orf . averting disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roof of an ice rink in bad reichenhall collapsed on monday , killing at least 11 people .
worried about another disaster in their region , police in traunstein near bad reichenhall responded quickly to concerns from train authorities that heavy snow was weighing down a roof over a train track .
police spokesman johann bohnert said all train traffic was halted temporarily until the snow could be removed .
otherwise there was a very real risk the roof could collapse , he said , adding that after the disaster in the ice rink " we are now very cautious . " meanwhile , meteorologists predicted more snow for the coming days and warned that up to 20 cm. of new snow could fall , mixing with the already high levels of fallen snow .
streets and train tracks will likely be impassable and trees could break under the weight of the snow .
the german weather service recommended people in the hardest hit regions of southern german along the border of austria avoid travelling by car and stay indoors if possible . wet snow partially to blame to some the high degree of caution may seem exaggerated for a region seasonally prone to heavy snowfall .
but meteorologists are saying the particular combination of moist air brought in by the barometric low " annekathrin " and temperatures hovering around freezing create an especially wet snow .
and wet snow is heavier than fluffy dry fakes . as a comparison , a cubic meter of wet snow weighs between 300 and 500 kilograms , the same amount of dry snow weighs only about 100 to 200 kilograms . manfred spatzierer , a meteorologist from wetterdienst meteomedia , told dpa news agencies that south eastern bavarian had received about 50 liters of wet snow per square meter in just 24 hours .
" that is a big dumping , " he said and added that the cold temperatures meant the snow would stick .
if it were a bit warmer , the snow would begin to melt ; at colder temperatures the snow would be lighter and the wind would carry it away , he said . snowfall at near freezing is always " quite dangerous , " spatzierer said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 03.01.2006 islamic school lessons face hurdles in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are waiting for the privilege of learning about islam in school catholic and protestant pupils in germany learn about their faiths in special religion classes at school .
muslim kids , however , are still waiting for lessons in islam . turkish-born emin alan has been teaching " islamic instruction " at hansa high school in cologne for six years .
he says it 's important that germany 's 800,000 muslim pupils learn about islam in school , since it is part of their identity . " i think it 's also a constitutional mandate for the state to give pupils the chance to learn about their religion , " said alan . the classes are offered at the same time as practical philosophy and catholic and protestant religious education .
they are meant to help students explore their religion .
in contrast to the christian classes , however , they do n't involve actual religious instruction .
the kids learn theory and practical information .
they do n't deal with dogmas or religious truths , as in koran classes or sermons . in addition , non-muslim children also take the classes .
" i take part because i might learn something new here , " said toljan eifler .
" i hardly knew anything about islam beforehand . "
he said he was surprised that the muslims ' creed was quite similar to that of christians .
" i used to think it was totally different . "
divided communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic schools teach kids about their religion the courses are indeed meant to contribute to better understanding between kids with different backgrounds and religions .
but muslim organizations in germany want more .
for years they have been demanding that islamic education be introduced to schools on a par with the catholic and protestant lessons - that is instruction that 's does n't only inform kids about islam , but communicates muslim values and the islamic faith . but that 's easier said than done .
germany 's muslims have so far been unable to agree on one organization to represent their interests and remain divided .
the differences are both religious and political - and often muslim migrants ' countries of origin play a role too .
also , sunnis , shiites and alevis each want their own approach to islam instruction . in the meantime , one german college in münster educates aspiring islamic religious instructors - as well as up-and-coming catholic and protestant teachers which all of the country 's universities train .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public schools could also provide islamic teachings the future of the teachers educated at the university of münster depends on whether any of germany 's muslim organizations succeed in being formally recognized as religious communities , said sven muhammad kalisch , who heads the department that started offering the course of studies last year .
only such recognition would allow german schools to provide regular denominational islamic religious lessons .
and such instruction would have to take place in german , kalisch said . no one islam " in germany there are muslims with entirely different ethnic origins .
there are german converts .
and there are arabic , turkish , pakistani , iranian muslims - muslims from all countries " said kalisch .
" thus , our aim must be to give all muslims who are interested such religious instruction .

supplying europe with gas , however , is not gazprom 's only ambition . russia 's increasingly powerful energy giant gazprom , which has taken to the front lines in what european media described as a " gas war " with ukraine , controls a third of global natural gas reserves and is the main supplier to western europe . russian president vladimir putin intervened twice in the bitter row , offering compromise proposals that were rejected by kiev , but it is gazprom executives and spokesmen who have dominated russian media , with numerous news conferences and interviews attacking ukraine 's position . once considered a " state within a state , " gazprom came under stronger kremlin control after alexei miller took over as chairman in 2001 .
then in 2005 , the russian state took a majority stake in the company . the russian behemoth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexei miller has been gazprom chairman since 2001 gazprom , which accounts for seven percent of russia 's gross domestic product and eight percent of the country 's budget , has made no secret of the fact that it wants to expand into russia 's lucrative oil sector . the firm bought russia 's fifth largest oil group sibneft for $ 13 billion -lrb- 11 billion euros -rrb- in oct .
2005 - a deal seen as a key step in moves by the russian state to retake of control of the country 's abundant natural resources . gazprom has also formed an extensive media empire , including national television channels ntv and tnt , numerous radio stations and the popular izvestia daily and news weekly itogi . gazprom 's customers gazprom extracts 550 billion cubic metres of natural gas per year and exports around 150 billion cubic metres to 28 countries in europe and the former soviet union .
the energy giant is the main supplier to western europe , accounting for around a quarter of europe 's imports . germany , gazprom 's biggest customer , imported almost 36 billion cubic metres of natural gas from russia in 2004 , or around a third of annual consumption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is gazprom 's largest customer italy imported 21.6 billion cubic metres , also roughly a third of national consumption , and france depends on gazprom for a quarter of its natural gas , or around 13 billion cubic meters . in central europe , the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia are the main russian gas importers . gazprom also exports to austria , bosnia-hercegovina , bulgaria , croatia , finland , greece , macedonia , netherlands , romania , slovenia , switzerland and the three baltic states -lrb- estonia , latvia and lithuania -rrb- , which depend completely on russian gas . around 90 percent of russian gas exports to europe transit through ukraine . turkey is also a major consumer of russian gas , with 14.5 billion cubic metres of imports in 2004 , or 63.7 percent of national consumption .
the gas is delivered partly through the blue stream pipeline between russia and turkey , which runs under the black sea . several former soviet republics , including armenia , belarus , georgia , moldova and ukraine , also depend heavily on russia for their gas supplies . double standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president putin and former german chancellor schröder brokered a german-russian pipeline deal ukraine , which had its supplies from gazprom cut off on jan .
1 after talks to resolve a politically-charged price dispute failed , imports between 25 and 34 billion cubic meters of russian gas per year , or around a third of its needs . moldova , which received 1.75 billion cubic metres in 2004 , also reported monday it was not receiving any russian gas because it had failed to agree on a price for the imports . gazprom will , however , deliver gas to ex-soviet belarus , which is considered an ally by moscow , amounting to 21 billion cubic meters in 2006 at the preferential rate of $ 47 per 1,000 cubic meters in 2006 . gazprom is seeking to diversify its transport routes to western europe and struck a deal with germany in 2005 to build a natural gas pipeline under the baltic sea that is set to be completed by 2010 . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany not affected by russian gas dispute even though russia is the largest supplier of natural gas to germany , consumers here have no reason to worry that their supplies will suffer as a consequence of the russian-ukrainian dispute .

muslim kids , however , are still waiting for lessons in islam . turkish-born emin alan has been teaching " islamic instruction " at hansa high school in cologne for six years .
he says it 's important that germany 's 800,000 muslim pupils learn about islam in school , since it is part of their identity . " i think it 's also a constitutional mandate for the state to give pupils the chance to learn about their religion , " said alan . the classes are offered at the same time as practical philosophy and catholic and protestant religious education .
they are meant to help students explore their religion .
in contrast to the christian classes , however , they do n't involve actual religious instruction .
the kids learn theory and practical information .
they do n't deal with dogmas or religious truths , as in koran classes or sermons . in addition , non-muslim children also take the classes .
" i take part because i might learn something new here , " said toljan eifler .
" i hardly knew anything about islam beforehand . "
he said he was surprised that the muslims ' creed was quite similar to that of christians .
" i used to think it was totally different . "
divided communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic schools teach kids about their religion the courses are indeed meant to contribute to better understanding between kids with different backgrounds and religions .
but muslim organizations in germany want more .
for years they have been demanding that islamic education be introduced to schools on a par with the catholic and protestant lessons - that is instruction that 's does n't only inform kids about islam , but communicates muslim values and the islamic faith . but that 's easier said than done .
germany 's muslims have so far been unable to agree on one organization to represent their interests and remain divided .
the differences are both religious and political - and often muslim migrants ' countries of origin play a role too .
also , sunnis , shiites and alevis each want their own approach to islam instruction . in the meantime , one german college in münster educates aspiring islamic religious instructors - as well as up-and-coming catholic and protestant teachers which all of the country 's universities train .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public schools could also provide islamic teachings the future of the teachers educated at the university of münster depends on whether any of germany 's muslim organizations succeed in being formally recognized as religious communities , said sven muhammad kalisch , who heads the department that started offering the course of studies last year .
only such recognition would allow german schools to provide regular denominational islamic religious lessons .
and such instruction would have to take place in german , kalisch said . no one islam " in germany there are muslims with entirely different ethnic origins .
there are german converts .
and there are arabic , turkish , pakistani , iranian muslims - muslims from all countries " said kalisch .
" thus , our aim must be to give all muslims who are interested such religious instruction .
and that means it has to be in german . " the first class of islamic teachers will graduate from münster in 2008 .
and kalisch is confident that the legal situation will have changed by then .
after all , germany is interested in regulated and , above all , transparent islamic instruction , said kalisch , adding that complaints arise again and again that too many children learn about their religion in private mosque organizations and islamic schools whose teaching contents are usually unavailable to the public . anne passow -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavaria shuts islamic center , citing dangers amid debate over how best to prevent terrorism while protecting civil liberties , one german state has banned an islamic group , and an official from another state suggested electronically tagging militants .

muslim kids , however , are still waiting for lessons in islam . turkish-born emin alan has been teaching " islamic instruction " at hansa high school in cologne for six years .
he says it 's important that germany 's 800,000 muslim pupils learn about islam in school , since it is part of their identity . " i think it 's also a constitutional mandate for the state to give pupils the chance to learn about their religion , " said alan . the classes are offered at the same time as practical philosophy and catholic and protestant religious education .
they are meant to help students explore their religion .
in contrast to the christian classes , however , they do n't involve actual religious instruction .
the kids learn theory and practical information .
they do n't deal with dogmas or religious truths , as in koran classes or sermons . in addition , non-muslim children also take the classes .
" i take part because i might learn something new here , " said toljan eifler .
" i hardly knew anything about islam beforehand . "
he said he was surprised that the muslims ' creed was quite similar to that of christians .
" i used to think it was totally different . "
divided communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic schools teach kids about their religion the courses are indeed meant to contribute to better understanding between kids with different backgrounds and religions .
but muslim organizations in germany want more .
for years they have been demanding that islamic education be introduced to schools on a par with the catholic and protestant lessons - that is instruction that 's does n't only inform kids about islam , but communicates muslim values and the islamic faith . but that 's easier said than done .
germany 's muslims have so far been unable to agree on one organization to represent their interests and remain divided .
the differences are both religious and political - and often muslim migrants ' countries of origin play a role too .
also , sunnis , shiites and alevis each want their own approach to islam instruction . in the meantime , one german college in münster educates aspiring islamic religious instructors - as well as up-and-coming catholic and protestant teachers which all of the country 's universities train .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public schools could also provide islamic teachings the future of the teachers educated at the university of münster depends on whether any of germany 's muslim organizations succeed in being formally recognized as religious communities , said sven muhammad kalisch , who heads the department that started offering the course of studies last year .
only such recognition would allow german schools to provide regular denominational islamic religious lessons .
and such instruction would have to take place in german , kalisch said . no one islam " in germany there are muslims with entirely different ethnic origins .
there are german converts .
and there are arabic , turkish , pakistani , iranian muslims - muslims from all countries " said kalisch .
" thus , our aim must be to give all muslims who are interested such religious instruction .
and that means it has to be in german . " the first class of islamic teachers will graduate from münster in 2008 .
and kalisch is confident that the legal situation will have changed by then .
after all , germany is interested in regulated and , above all , transparent islamic instruction , said kalisch , adding that complaints arise again and again that too many children learn about their religion in private mosque organizations and islamic schools whose teaching contents are usually unavailable to the public . anne passow -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavaria shuts islamic center , citing dangers amid debate over how best to prevent terrorism while protecting civil liberties , one german state has banned an islamic group , and an official from another state suggested electronically tagging militants .

"
" the gas dispute has already moved beyond the borders of russia and ukraine , " the paper wrote , adding that it will spread to wealthy western european countries and then to poorer nations as well .
the paper does n't regard moscow 's promise to guarantee gas delivery to the eu as stable , writing : " moscow caved in to the pressure from the european union , but warned that it wo n't be able to continue covering for theft by the ukrainians . " the independent , from london , asked why ukraine has been singled out by russia for a price hike in natural gas when other former soviet states also pay less than the going market rates .
the paper concluded that it was a political decision .
" vladimir putin intends to destabilize russia 's western neighbor in the hope of unseating its leader , viktor yushchenko , " the independent wrote .
" the ukrainian president has been a thorn in the kremlin 's side since he was swept to power amid mass demonstrations against russian influence .
with elections looming in ukraine , president putin regards this as the right time to exert pressure . "
the paper said that the crisis has made it clear that europe is urgently in need of a common energy policy . magyar nemzet , from budapest , urged hungarian politicians in charge of energy issues to no longer keep their heads stuck in the sand , as hungary is more dependent on energy imports than its neighbors .
" hungary is to 80 percent dependent on imports , and natural gas makes up more than 40 percent of the energy sector , " the paper wrote .
" it is very regrettable that it is only now , in such a critical situation , that we are weighing the options of having coal and nuclear energy play a bigger part in meeting our energy needs - albeit after the use of more environmentally friendly renewable energy sources . " liberation , from paris , commented that ukraine is now staring the capitalist revolution in the face .
" russia is demanding market prices for its gas , otherwise it will turn off the tap , " the paper wrote .
" with that , russia is using a tried and true strategy of international capitalism - how can this be thrown in russia 's face ? " paris ' le monde labeled the dispute the " first declaration of war in the 21st century . "
" one country cuts off the energy supply of another because it does n't give into its demands , " the paper wrote .
" russia , the largest natural gas producer in the world , pushed the button on the gas weapon .
with the emergence of consumer giants such as china and india , raw materials have become the economic weapons of deterrence , if not mass destruction . " " of course it 's hardly sensible or fitting that ukraine or other countries of the former soviet union build their economies on the back of extremely cheap russian energy imports , " wrote berlingske tidende from copenhagen .
" but as an energy superpower , russia has a responsibility to raise prices gradually over a number of years , so that it does n't force its clients into a crisis situation .

muslim kids , however , are still waiting for lessons in islam . turkish-born emin alan has been teaching " islamic instruction " at hansa high school in cologne for six years .
he says it 's important that germany 's 800,000 muslim pupils learn about islam in school , since it is part of their identity . " i think it 's also a constitutional mandate for the state to give pupils the chance to learn about their religion , " said alan . the classes are offered at the same time as practical philosophy and catholic and protestant religious education .
they are meant to help students explore their religion .
in contrast to the christian classes , however , they do n't involve actual religious instruction .
the kids learn theory and practical information .
they do n't deal with dogmas or religious truths , as in koran classes or sermons . in addition , non-muslim children also take the classes .
" i take part because i might learn something new here , " said toljan eifler .
" i hardly knew anything about islam beforehand . "
he said he was surprised that the muslims ' creed was quite similar to that of christians .
" i used to think it was totally different . "
divided communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic schools teach kids about their religion the courses are indeed meant to contribute to better understanding between kids with different backgrounds and religions .
but muslim organizations in germany want more .
for years they have been demanding that islamic education be introduced to schools on a par with the catholic and protestant lessons - that is instruction that 's does n't only inform kids about islam , but communicates muslim values and the islamic faith . but that 's easier said than done .
germany 's muslims have so far been unable to agree on one organization to represent their interests and remain divided .
the differences are both religious and political - and often muslim migrants ' countries of origin play a role too .
also , sunnis , shiites and alevis each want their own approach to islam instruction . in the meantime , one german college in münster educates aspiring islamic religious instructors - as well as up-and-coming catholic and protestant teachers which all of the country 's universities train .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public schools could also provide islamic teachings the future of the teachers educated at the university of münster depends on whether any of germany 's muslim organizations succeed in being formally recognized as religious communities , said sven muhammad kalisch , who heads the department that started offering the course of studies last year .
only such recognition would allow german schools to provide regular denominational islamic religious lessons .
and such instruction would have to take place in german , kalisch said . no one islam " in germany there are muslims with entirely different ethnic origins .
there are german converts .
and there are arabic , turkish , pakistani , iranian muslims - muslims from all countries " said kalisch .
" thus , our aim must be to give all muslims who are interested such religious instruction .
and that means it has to be in german . " the first class of islamic teachers will graduate from münster in 2008 .
and kalisch is confident that the legal situation will have changed by then .
after all , germany is interested in regulated and , above all , transparent islamic instruction , said kalisch , adding that complaints arise again and again that too many children learn about their religion in private mosque organizations and islamic schools whose teaching contents are usually unavailable to the public . anne passow -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavaria shuts islamic center , citing dangers amid debate over how best to prevent terrorism while protecting civil liberties , one german state has banned an islamic group , and an official from another state suggested electronically tagging militants .

the fire department warned that the external walls could collapse , trapping those working in the rubble . local officials said the recovery operation would continue later on tuesday once heavy lifting equipment was in place , but hopes of finding any more survivors from monday 's accident have faded . police on tuesday said rescuers had recovered the bodies of 11 people , including two teenagers and six children between the ages of nine and 12 .
another 18 people were taken to local hospitals for treatment for serious injury following the accident . asked whether there had been any signs of life from the four people believed to be still under the rubble , chief fire officer rudi zeif said : " no , unfortunately .

1 , german consumers had no reason to fear that their apartments would not be heated or that their stoves would remain cold this winter . germany relies heavily on russian gas supplies , but it gets it via two supply routes , one going through ukraine , the other , through belarus and poland .
furthermore , to avoid possible shortages , germany could in case of an emergency increase gas imports from other countries such as norway and the netherlands . germany also maintains sufficient amounts of gas in storage . " the gas reserves are almost full and could supply germany for almost 75 days with gas , " said sabine maas of the german ministry of economy . gas war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is gazprom 's largest customer on monday , a day after gazprom cut the flow of gas to ukraine , germany 's largest gas company eon reported a drop in pressure .
on tuesday , the company said it had registered a reduction of 30 percent pressure in gas coming in from ukraine , which reflected a 10 percent drop in the daily import .
levels are expected to return to normal by tuesday evening . german energy suppliers have assured the 17 million german households that use gas for heating that they will not be affected , but that industrial usage may have to be reduced , should the dispute not get resolved . germany , gazprom 's biggest customer , imported almost 36 billion cubic meters of natural gas from russia in 2004 , or 35 percent of german gas consumption .
that is why chancellor angela merkel is so keen on seeing the dispute between russia and ukraine resolved amicably . " the german government expects from russia and ukraine that the bilateral negotiations between the two countries about gas deliveries to ukraine should not lead to the curtailing of gas provisions in europe , " said government spokesperson thomas steg . the german government is in talks with both the russian and the ukrainian governments , but it does not foresee " playing the role of negotiator " or taking sides in the dispute .
it is much more interested in synchronizing its line of action with other eu members . press reactions the german press was , nonetheless , critical of russia 's " new cold war , " which uses its massive supplies of natural gas as the main weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private customers in germany should see no interruption of gas flow the center-left suddeutsche zeitung commented that " long before petrol and gas stocks are used up , shortages are already translated into higher prices and that 's an instrument of political and economic power . " " today ukraine is the victim , but no one can say that it will not also affect western europe .
while the importance of russian gas to the european union may wane over time that does not change the kremlin 's potential power , " the paper said . the conservative daily die welt urged germany to develop other sources of energy in order to become less dependent on moscow . it cited " bio-gas " and other renewable energy sources , but also recommended that the nuclear option be reconsidered , a suggestion german economics minister michael glos has also made . " that 's the only way to reduce dependence on the russian gazprom monopoly , which fixes the so-called market prices almost at will , " the paper argued . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas dispute reignites atomic energy debate economics minister michael glos suggested germany could backtrack on its decision to stop using nuclear power as natural gas companies reported disruptions in supplies from russia due to the moscow-kiev gas dispute . -lrb- jan .

in the province of salzburg , which is just across the border from bad reichenhall , authorities shut down several sports centers citing too much wet , heavy snow .

supplying europe with gas , however , is not gazprom 's only ambition . russia 's increasingly powerful energy giant gazprom , which has taken to the front lines in what european media described as a " gas war " with ukraine , controls a third of global natural gas reserves and is the main supplier to western europe . russian president vladimir putin intervened twice in the bitter row , offering compromise proposals that were rejected by kiev , but it is gazprom executives and spokesmen who have dominated russian media , with numerous news conferences and interviews attacking ukraine 's position . once considered a " state within a state , " gazprom came under stronger kremlin control after alexei miller took over as chairman in 2001 .
then in 2005 , the russian state took a majority stake in the company . the russian behemoth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexei miller has been gazprom chairman since 2001 gazprom , which accounts for seven percent of russia 's gross domestic product and eight percent of the country 's budget , has made no secret of the fact that it wants to expand into russia 's lucrative oil sector . the firm bought russia 's fifth largest oil group sibneft for $ 13 billion -lrb- 11 billion euros -rrb- in oct .
2005 - a deal seen as a key step in moves by the russian state to retake of control of the country 's abundant natural resources . gazprom has also formed an extensive media empire , including national television channels ntv and tnt , numerous radio stations and the popular izvestia daily and news weekly itogi . gazprom 's customers gazprom extracts 550 billion cubic metres of natural gas per year and exports around 150 billion cubic metres to 28 countries in europe and the former soviet union .
the energy giant is the main supplier to western europe , accounting for around a quarter of europe 's imports . germany , gazprom 's biggest customer , imported almost 36 billion cubic metres of natural gas from russia in 2004 , or around a third of annual consumption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is gazprom 's largest customer italy imported 21.6 billion cubic metres , also roughly a third of national consumption , and france depends on gazprom for a quarter of its natural gas , or around 13 billion cubic meters . in central europe , the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia are the main russian gas importers . gazprom also exports to austria , bosnia-hercegovina , bulgaria , croatia , finland , greece , macedonia , netherlands , romania , slovenia , switzerland and the three baltic states -lrb- estonia , latvia and lithuania -rrb- , which depend completely on russian gas . around 90 percent of russian gas exports to europe transit through ukraine . turkey is also a major consumer of russian gas , with 14.5 billion cubic metres of imports in 2004 , or 63.7 percent of national consumption .
the gas is delivered partly through the blue stream pipeline between russia and turkey , which runs under the black sea . several former soviet republics , including armenia , belarus , georgia , moldova and ukraine , also depend heavily on russia for their gas supplies . double standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president putin and former german chancellor schröder brokered a german-russian pipeline deal ukraine , which had its supplies from gazprom cut off on jan .

"
" the gas dispute has already moved beyond the borders of russia and ukraine , " the paper wrote , adding that it will spread to wealthy western european countries and then to poorer nations as well .
the paper does n't regard moscow 's promise to guarantee gas delivery to the eu as stable , writing : " moscow caved in to the pressure from the european union , but warned that it wo n't be able to continue covering for theft by the ukrainians . " the independent , from london , asked why ukraine has been singled out by russia for a price hike in natural gas when other former soviet states also pay less than the going market rates .
the paper concluded that it was a political decision .
" vladimir putin intends to destabilize russia 's western neighbor in the hope of unseating its leader , viktor yushchenko , " the independent wrote .
" the ukrainian president has been a thorn in the kremlin 's side since he was swept to power amid mass demonstrations against russian influence .
with elections looming in ukraine , president putin regards this as the right time to exert pressure . "
the paper said that the crisis has made it clear that europe is urgently in need of a common energy policy . magyar nemzet , from budapest , urged hungarian politicians in charge of energy issues to no longer keep their heads stuck in the sand , as hungary is more dependent on energy imports than its neighbors .
" hungary is to 80 percent dependent on imports , and natural gas makes up more than 40 percent of the energy sector , " the paper wrote .
" it is very regrettable that it is only now , in such a critical situation , that we are weighing the options of having coal and nuclear energy play a bigger part in meeting our energy needs - albeit after the use of more environmentally friendly renewable energy sources . " liberation , from paris , commented that ukraine is now staring the capitalist revolution in the face .
" russia is demanding market prices for its gas , otherwise it will turn off the tap , " the paper wrote .
" with that , russia is using a tried and true strategy of international capitalism - how can this be thrown in russia 's face ? " paris ' le monde labeled the dispute the " first declaration of war in the 21st century . "
" one country cuts off the energy supply of another because it does n't give into its demands , " the paper wrote .
" russia , the largest natural gas producer in the world , pushed the button on the gas weapon .
with the emergence of consumer giants such as china and india , raw materials have become the economic weapons of deterrence , if not mass destruction . " " of course it 's hardly sensible or fitting that ukraine or other countries of the former soviet union build their economies on the back of extremely cheap russian energy imports , " wrote berlingske tidende from copenhagen .
" but as an energy superpower , russia has a responsibility to raise prices gradually over a number of years , so that it does n't force its clients into a crisis situation .
the current demonstration of power over the ukraine is insupportable , because it so baldly demonstrates the iron fist of the kremlin when it comes to foreign policy .

1 , german consumers had no reason to fear that their apartments would not be heated or that their stoves would remain cold this winter . germany relies heavily on russian gas supplies , but it gets it via two supply routes , one going through ukraine , the other , through belarus and poland .
furthermore , to avoid possible shortages , germany could in case of an emergency increase gas imports from other countries such as norway and the netherlands . germany also maintains sufficient amounts of gas in storage . " the gas reserves are almost full and could supply germany for almost 75 days with gas , " said sabine maas of the german ministry of economy . gas war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is gazprom 's largest customer on monday , a day after gazprom cut the flow of gas to ukraine , germany 's largest gas company eon reported a drop in pressure .
on tuesday , the company said it had registered a reduction of 30 percent pressure in gas coming in from ukraine , which reflected a 10 percent drop in the daily import .
levels are expected to return to normal by tuesday evening . german energy suppliers have assured the 17 million german households that use gas for heating that they will not be affected , but that industrial usage may have to be reduced , should the dispute not get resolved . germany , gazprom 's biggest customer , imported almost 36 billion cubic meters of natural gas from russia in 2004 , or 35 percent of german gas consumption .
that is why chancellor angela merkel is so keen on seeing the dispute between russia and ukraine resolved amicably . " the german government expects from russia and ukraine that the bilateral negotiations between the two countries about gas deliveries to ukraine should not lead to the curtailing of gas provisions in europe , " said government spokesperson thomas steg . the german government is in talks with both the russian and the ukrainian governments , but it does not foresee " playing the role of negotiator " or taking sides in the dispute .
it is much more interested in synchronizing its line of action with other eu members . press reactions the german press was , nonetheless , critical of russia 's " new cold war , " which uses its massive supplies of natural gas as the main weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private customers in germany should see no interruption of gas flow the center-left suddeutsche zeitung commented that " long before petrol and gas stocks are used up , shortages are already translated into higher prices and that 's an instrument of political and economic power . " " today ukraine is the victim , but no one can say that it will not also affect western europe .

1 , german consumers had no reason to fear that their apartments would not be heated or that their stoves would remain cold this winter . germany relies heavily on russian gas supplies , but it gets it via two supply routes , one going through ukraine , the other , through belarus and poland .
furthermore , to avoid possible shortages , germany could in case of an emergency increase gas imports from other countries such as norway and the netherlands . germany also maintains sufficient amounts of gas in storage . " the gas reserves are almost full and could supply germany for almost 75 days with gas , " said sabine maas of the german ministry of economy . gas war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is gazprom 's largest customer on monday , a day after gazprom cut the flow of gas to ukraine , germany 's largest gas company eon reported a drop in pressure .
on tuesday , the company said it had registered a reduction of 30 percent pressure in gas coming in from ukraine , which reflected a 10 percent drop in the daily import .
levels are expected to return to normal by tuesday evening . german energy suppliers have assured the 17 million german households that use gas for heating that they will not be affected , but that industrial usage may have to be reduced , should the dispute not get resolved . germany , gazprom 's biggest customer , imported almost 36 billion cubic meters of natural gas from russia in 2004 , or 35 percent of german gas consumption .
that is why chancellor angela merkel is so keen on seeing the dispute between russia and ukraine resolved amicably . " the german government expects from russia and ukraine that the bilateral negotiations between the two countries about gas deliveries to ukraine should not lead to the curtailing of gas provisions in europe , " said government spokesperson thomas steg . the german government is in talks with both the russian and the ukrainian governments , but it does not foresee " playing the role of negotiator " or taking sides in the dispute .
it is much more interested in synchronizing its line of action with other eu members . press reactions the german press was , nonetheless , critical of russia 's " new cold war , " which uses its massive supplies of natural gas as the main weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private customers in germany should see no interruption of gas flow the center-left suddeutsche zeitung commented that " long before petrol and gas stocks are used up , shortages are already translated into higher prices and that 's an instrument of political and economic power . " " today ukraine is the victim , but no one can say that it will not also affect western europe .
while the importance of russian gas to the european union may wane over time that does not change the kremlin 's potential power , " the paper said . the conservative daily die welt urged germany to develop other sources of energy in order to become less dependent on moscow . it cited " bio-gas " and other renewable energy sources , but also recommended that the nuclear option be reconsidered , a suggestion german economics minister michael glos has also made .

supplying europe with gas , however , is not gazprom 's only ambition . russia 's increasingly powerful energy giant gazprom , which has taken to the front lines in what european media described as a " gas war " with ukraine , controls a third of global natural gas reserves and is the main supplier to western europe . russian president vladimir putin intervened twice in the bitter row , offering compromise proposals that were rejected by kiev , but it is gazprom executives and spokesmen who have dominated russian media , with numerous news conferences and interviews attacking ukraine 's position . once considered a " state within a state , " gazprom came under stronger kremlin control after alexei miller took over as chairman in 2001 .

muslim kids , however , are still waiting for lessons in islam . turkish-born emin alan has been teaching " islamic instruction " at hansa high school in cologne for six years .
he says it 's important that germany 's 800,000 muslim pupils learn about islam in school , since it is part of their identity . " i think it 's also a constitutional mandate for the state to give pupils the chance to learn about their religion , " said alan . the classes are offered at the same time as practical philosophy and catholic and protestant religious education .
they are meant to help students explore their religion .
in contrast to the christian classes , however , they do n't involve actual religious instruction .
the kids learn theory and practical information .
they do n't deal with dogmas or religious truths , as in koran classes or sermons . in addition , non-muslim children also take the classes .
" i take part because i might learn something new here , " said toljan eifler .
" i hardly knew anything about islam beforehand . "
he said he was surprised that the muslims ' creed was quite similar to that of christians .

divided communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic schools teach kids about their religion the courses are indeed meant to contribute to better understanding between kids with different backgrounds and religions .
but muslim organizations in germany want more .
for years they have been demanding that islamic education be introduced to schools on a par with the catholic and protestant lessons - that is instruction that 's does n't only inform kids about islam , but communicates muslim values and the islamic faith . but that 's easier said than done .
germany 's muslims have so far been unable to agree on one organization to represent their interests and remain divided .
the differences are both religious and political - and often muslim migrants ' countries of origin play a role too .
also , sunnis , shiites and alevis each want their own approach to islam instruction . in the meantime , one german college in münster educates aspiring islamic religious instructors - as well as up-and-coming catholic and protestant teachers which all of the country 's universities train .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public schools could also provide islamic teachings the future of the teachers educated at the university of münster depends on whether any of germany 's muslim organizations succeed in being formally recognized as religious communities , said sven muhammad kalisch , who heads the department that started offering the course of studies last year .
only such recognition would allow german schools to provide regular denominational islamic religious lessons .
and such instruction would have to take place in german , kalisch said . no one islam " in germany there are muslims with entirely different ethnic origins .
there are german converts .
and there are arabic , turkish , pakistani , iranian muslims - muslims from all countries " said kalisch .
" thus , our aim must be to give all muslims who are interested such religious instruction .
and that means it has to be in german . " the first class of islamic teachers will graduate from münster in 2008 .
and kalisch is confident that the legal situation will have changed by then .
after all , germany is interested in regulated and , above all , transparent islamic instruction , said kalisch , adding that complaints arise again and again that too many children learn about their religion in private mosque organizations and islamic schools whose teaching contents are usually unavailable to the public . anne passow -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavaria shuts islamic center , citing dangers amid debate over how best to prevent terrorism while protecting civil liberties , one german state has banned an islamic group , and an official from another state suggested electronically tagging militants .

" i think it 's also a constitutional mandate for the state to give pupils the chance to learn about their religion , " said alan . the classes are offered at the same time as practical philosophy and catholic and protestant religious education .
they are meant to help students explore their religion .
in contrast to the christian classes , however , they do n't involve actual religious instruction .
the kids learn theory and practical information .
they do n't deal with dogmas or religious truths , as in koran classes or sermons . in addition , non-muslim children also take the classes .
" i take part because i might learn something new here , " said toljan eifler .
" i hardly knew anything about islam beforehand . "
he said he was surprised that the muslims ' creed was quite similar to that of christians .
" i used to think it was totally different . "
divided communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic schools teach kids about their religion the courses are indeed meant to contribute to better understanding between kids with different backgrounds and religions .
but muslim organizations in germany want more .
for years they have been demanding that islamic education be introduced to schools on a par with the catholic and protestant lessons - that is instruction that 's does n't only inform kids about islam , but communicates muslim values and the islamic faith . but that 's easier said than done .
germany 's muslims have so far been unable to agree on one organization to represent their interests and remain divided .
the differences are both religious and political - and often muslim migrants ' countries of origin play a role too .
also , sunnis , shiites and alevis each want their own approach to islam instruction . in the meantime , one german college in münster educates aspiring islamic religious instructors - as well as up-and-coming catholic and protestant teachers which all of the country 's universities train .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public schools could also provide islamic teachings the future of the teachers educated at the university of münster depends on whether any of germany 's muslim organizations succeed in being formally recognized as religious communities , said sven muhammad kalisch , who heads the department that started offering the course of studies last year .
only such recognition would allow german schools to provide regular denominational islamic religious lessons .
and such instruction would have to take place in german , kalisch said . no one islam " in germany there are muslims with entirely different ethnic origins .
there are german converts .
and there are arabic , turkish , pakistani , iranian muslims - muslims from all countries " said kalisch .
" thus , our aim must be to give all muslims who are interested such religious instruction .
and that means it has to be in german . " the first class of islamic teachers will graduate from münster in 2008 .
and kalisch is confident that the legal situation will have changed by then .
after all , germany is interested in regulated and , above all , transparent islamic instruction , said kalisch , adding that complaints arise again and again that too many children learn about their religion in private mosque organizations and islamic schools whose teaching contents are usually unavailable to the public . anne passow -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavaria shuts islamic center , citing dangers amid debate over how best to prevent terrorism while protecting civil liberties , one german state has banned an islamic group , and an official from another state suggested electronically tagging militants .

officials worry the weather could result in more accidents . a day after the roof of an ice skating rink in bad reichenhall collapsed under a heavy load of wet snow , officials in surrounding towns and across the border in austria fret that continued snowfall could cause more rooftops to cave in .
many building authorities are calling for inspections of public places . throughout austria , fire fighters , army soldiers and civilian experts checked snow-laden rooftops over sports centers , train stations , exhibition halls and other buildings with flat roofs to determine if they were in imminent danger of collapse .
in the province of salzburg , which is just across the border from bad reichenhall , authorities shut down several sports centers citing too much wet , heavy snow .
meanwhile , emergency rescue crews reviewed their readiness plans for responding quickly in the event of a roof collapse , salzburg mayor heinz schaden told national broadcaster orf . averting disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roof of an ice rink in bad reichenhall collapsed on monday , killing at least 11 people .
worried about another disaster in their region , police in traunstein near bad reichenhall responded quickly to concerns from train authorities that heavy snow was weighing down a roof over a train track .
police spokesman johann bohnert said all train traffic was halted temporarily until the snow could be removed .
otherwise there was a very real risk the roof could collapse , he said , adding that after the disaster in the ice rink " we are now very cautious . " meanwhile , meteorologists predicted more snow for the coming days and warned that up to 20 cm. of new snow could fall , mixing with the already high levels of fallen snow .
streets and train tracks will likely be impassable and trees could break under the weight of the snow .
the german weather service recommended people in the hardest hit regions of southern german along the border of austria avoid travelling by car and stay indoors if possible . wet snow partially to blame to some the high degree of caution may seem exaggerated for a region seasonally prone to heavy snowfall .
but meteorologists are saying the particular combination of moist air brought in by the barometric low " annekathrin " and temperatures hovering around freezing create an especially wet snow .
and wet snow is heavier than fluffy dry fakes . as a comparison , a cubic meter of wet snow weighs between 300 and 500 kilograms , the same amount of dry snow weighs only about 100 to 200 kilograms . manfred spatzierer , a meteorologist from wetterdienst meteomedia , told dpa news agencies that south eastern bavarian had received about 50 liters of wet snow per square meter in just 24 hours .
" that is a big dumping , " he said and added that the cold temperatures meant the snow would stick .
if it were a bit warmer , the snow would begin to melt ; at colder temperatures the snow would be lighter and the wind would carry it away , he said . snowfall at near freezing is always " quite dangerous , " spatzierer said .
his colleague michael beisenherz agreed : " if it had been normal powder snow , we would have had about a meter of it , but it would not have remained on the roof top .

many building authorities are calling for inspections of public places . throughout austria , fire fighters , army soldiers and civilian experts checked snow-laden rooftops over sports centers , train stations , exhibition halls and other buildings with flat roofs to determine if they were in imminent danger of collapse .
in the province of salzburg , which is just across the border from bad reichenhall , authorities shut down several sports centers citing too much wet , heavy snow .
meanwhile , emergency rescue crews reviewed their readiness plans for responding quickly in the event of a roof collapse , salzburg mayor heinz schaden told national broadcaster orf . averting disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roof of an ice rink in bad reichenhall collapsed on monday , killing at least 11 people .
worried about another disaster in their region , police in traunstein near bad reichenhall responded quickly to concerns from train authorities that heavy snow was weighing down a roof over a train track .
police spokesman johann bohnert said all train traffic was halted temporarily until the snow could be removed .
otherwise there was a very real risk the roof could collapse , he said , adding that after the disaster in the ice rink " we are now very cautious . " meanwhile , meteorologists predicted more snow for the coming days and warned that up to 20 cm. of new snow could fall , mixing with the already high levels of fallen snow .

supplying europe with gas , however , is not gazprom 's only ambition . russia 's increasingly powerful energy giant gazprom , which has taken to the front lines in what european media described as a " gas war " with ukraine , controls a third of global natural gas reserves and is the main supplier to western europe . russian president vladimir putin intervened twice in the bitter row , offering compromise proposals that were rejected by kiev , but it is gazprom executives and spokesmen who have dominated russian media , with numerous news conferences and interviews attacking ukraine 's position . once considered a " state within a state , " gazprom came under stronger kremlin control after alexei miller took over as chairman in 2001 .
then in 2005 , the russian state took a majority stake in the company . the russian behemoth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexei miller has been gazprom chairman since 2001 gazprom , which accounts for seven percent of russia 's gross domestic product and eight percent of the country 's budget , has made no secret of the fact that it wants to expand into russia 's lucrative oil sector . the firm bought russia 's fifth largest oil group sibneft for $ 13 billion -lrb- 11 billion euros -rrb- in oct .
2005 - a deal seen as a key step in moves by the russian state to retake of control of the country 's abundant natural resources . gazprom has also formed an extensive media empire , including national television channels ntv and tnt , numerous radio stations and the popular izvestia daily and news weekly itogi . gazprom 's customers gazprom extracts 550 billion cubic metres of natural gas per year and exports around 150 billion cubic metres to 28 countries in europe and the former soviet union .

that does n't mean that the costa ricans or the germans face an easy task .
on the contrary , both germany and costa rica will have a tough time winning the game .
the opening match is a test of nerves , a unique situation .
the most difficult part of the world cup is the beginning .
during the first match the pressure is enormous ; during the opening match it 's even greater .
of course , luck also plays a role . what do you know about costa rica and ecuador ? not much , almost nothing .
both of these teams ' ways of playing are virtually unknown in germany .
we did n't have a chance to watch their qualification .
we do n't get as much information about them as we do about argentina or brazil , for instance .
we still have time to inquire , to learn what kind of soccer they play , what their strengths and weaknesses are .
there 's no doubt that we 'll know everything we need to know in time for the world cup .
we 'll know them both inside and out . germany is the favorite in its group .
who do you think will take second place : costa rica , ecuador or poland ?
there 's no first , second or third for me - not so far anyway .
we all have to win our games regardless of who we 're playing .
we have to beat costa rica , beat ecuador , beat poland .
it 's only really about making it to the next round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-world reporter daniel martinez met kahn in a munich bar are costa rica and ecuador capable of beating germany ? anything 's possible in the world cup . will germany become world champion in 2006 ?
it 's entirely possible .
the enthusiasm of 80 million germans is a very important factor .
in the national team you sense that such a goal is doable .
i believe we can win the title .
i have a lot of confidence in us .
who will be number one in the german goal at the world cup ?
i have no reason to doubt i will be number one and stand in the goal at the world cup .
jürgen klinsmann has said it clearly .
i am number one ; there 's nothing there to discuss .
why are you so sure ?
i know what the pressure 's like and how it is to play in the world cup .
i know what 's needed to successfully play in a tournament .
such a situation is n't foreign to me , i 've already experienced it with the national team and with bayern munich .
the training staff knows exactly what my contribution is .

supplying europe with gas , however , is not gazprom 's only ambition . russia 's increasingly powerful energy giant gazprom , which has taken to the front lines in what european media described as a " gas war " with ukraine , controls a third of global natural gas reserves and is the main supplier to western europe . russian president vladimir putin intervened twice in the bitter row , offering compromise proposals that were rejected by kiev , but it is gazprom executives and spokesmen who have dominated russian media , with numerous news conferences and interviews attacking ukraine 's position . once considered a " state within a state , " gazprom came under stronger kremlin control after alexei miller took over as chairman in 2001 .
then in 2005 , the russian state took a majority stake in the company . the russian behemoth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexei miller has been gazprom chairman since 2001 gazprom , which accounts for seven percent of russia 's gross domestic product and eight percent of the country 's budget , has made no secret of the fact that it wants to expand into russia 's lucrative oil sector . the firm bought russia 's fifth largest oil group sibneft for $ 13 billion -lrb- 11 billion euros -rrb- in oct .
2005 - a deal seen as a key step in moves by the russian state to retake of control of the country 's abundant natural resources . gazprom has also formed an extensive media empire , including national television channels ntv and tnt , numerous radio stations and the popular izvestia daily and news weekly itogi . gazprom 's customers gazprom extracts 550 billion cubic metres of natural gas per year and exports around 150 billion cubic metres to 28 countries in europe and the former soviet union .
the energy giant is the main supplier to western europe , accounting for around a quarter of europe 's imports . germany , gazprom 's biggest customer , imported almost 36 billion cubic metres of natural gas from russia in 2004 , or around a third of annual consumption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is gazprom 's largest customer italy imported 21.6 billion cubic metres , also roughly a third of national consumption , and france depends on gazprom for a quarter of its natural gas , or around 13 billion cubic meters . in central europe , the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia are the main russian gas importers . gazprom also exports to austria , bosnia-hercegovina , bulgaria , croatia , finland , greece , macedonia , netherlands , romania , slovenia , switzerland and the three baltic states -lrb- estonia , latvia and lithuania -rrb- , which depend completely on russian gas . around 90 percent of russian gas exports to europe transit through ukraine . turkey is also a major consumer of russian gas , with 14.5 billion cubic metres of imports in 2004 , or 63.7 percent of national consumption .
the gas is delivered partly through the blue stream pipeline between russia and turkey , which runs under the black sea . several former soviet republics , including armenia , belarus , georgia , moldova and ukraine , also depend heavily on russia for their gas supplies . double standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president putin and former german chancellor schröder brokered a german-russian pipeline deal ukraine , which had its supplies from gazprom cut off on jan .

the fire department warned that the external walls could collapse , trapping those working in the rubble . local officials said the recovery operation would continue later on tuesday once heavy lifting equipment was in place , but hopes of finding any more survivors from monday 's accident have faded . police on tuesday said rescuers had recovered the bodies of 11 people , including two teenagers and six children between the ages of nine and 12 .
another 18 people were taken to local hospitals for treatment for serious injury following the accident . asked whether there had been any signs of life from the four people believed to be still under the rubble , chief fire officer rudi zeif said : " no , unfortunately . " a catastrophe " the situation is catastrophic , " a bavarian red cross spokesman said , adding that the recovery operation was extremely difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifty people were thought to have been in the hall when the roof collapsed the area around the rink was evacuated monday , but rescue efforts were complicated by continued snowfall , following a blizzard that began in the early hours of monday and reportedly dumped some 30 centimeters -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- of snow on the region .
emergency personnel had difficulty reaching the hall because traffic had virtually stalled due to the snow . the fire brigade attempted to prop up remaining sections of the roof to allow search operations in the building . " the rescue work is proving very difficult .
it is very difficult to get into the building .
the roof which has collapsed can only be lifted with heavy equipment , " police spokesman fritz braun told n-tv television .
he declined to comment on the possible causes of the collapse , which happened at around 4 p.m. local time , when the rink was open for public skating .
at the time , some 50 people were in the hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : locals had complained for years that the rink was in need of repairs the chairman of the local ice hockey club told german public television that local authorities had warned his team at around 3:30 p.m. that the hall was unsafe for a training session planned in the afternoon .
" ice skating for the public evidently still went on , " thomas rumpeltes told zdf television . however , in a press conference , bad reichenhall mayor wolfgang heitmeier brushed aside accusations that the collapse of the 1970s construction was foreseeable given the weight of new fallen snow .
" the warning levels had n't been reached by monday afternoon , " he said . no answers yet bavarian premier edmund stoiber visited the disaster zone tuesday morning and promised rapid help for the families of the victims .
" we will establish a fund for the victims , " stoiber said .
he also called on all of germany to contribute to the fund . meanwhile chancellor angela merkel expressed her condolences to the families of the victims , and said germany had been moved by the " terrible fate that particularly children and young people have suffered .

1 , german consumers had no reason to fear that their apartments would not be heated or that their stoves would remain cold this winter . germany relies heavily on russian gas supplies , but it gets it via two supply routes , one going through ukraine , the other , through belarus and poland .
furthermore , to avoid possible shortages , germany could in case of an emergency increase gas imports from other countries such as norway and the netherlands . germany also maintains sufficient amounts of gas in storage . " the gas reserves are almost full and could supply germany for almost 75 days with gas , " said sabine maas of the german ministry of economy . gas war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is gazprom 's largest customer on monday , a day after gazprom cut the flow of gas to ukraine , germany 's largest gas company eon reported a drop in pressure .
on tuesday , the company said it had registered a reduction of 30 percent pressure in gas coming in from ukraine , which reflected a 10 percent drop in the daily import .
levels are expected to return to normal by tuesday evening . german energy suppliers have assured the 17 million german households that use gas for heating that they will not be affected , but that industrial usage may have to be reduced , should the dispute not get resolved . germany , gazprom 's biggest customer , imported almost 36 billion cubic meters of natural gas from russia in 2004 , or 35 percent of german gas consumption .

1 , german consumers had no reason to fear that their apartments would not be heated or that their stoves would remain cold this winter . germany relies heavily on russian gas supplies , but it gets it via two supply routes , one going through ukraine , the other , through belarus and poland .
furthermore , to avoid possible shortages , germany could in case of an emergency increase gas imports from other countries such as norway and the netherlands . germany also maintains sufficient amounts of gas in storage . " the gas reserves are almost full and could supply germany for almost 75 days with gas , " said sabine maas of the german ministry of economy . gas war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is gazprom 's largest customer on monday , a day after gazprom cut the flow of gas to ukraine , germany 's largest gas company eon reported a drop in pressure .
on tuesday , the company said it had registered a reduction of 30 percent pressure in gas coming in from ukraine , which reflected a 10 percent drop in the daily import .
levels are expected to return to normal by tuesday evening . german energy suppliers have assured the 17 million german households that use gas for heating that they will not be affected , but that industrial usage may have to be reduced , should the dispute not get resolved . germany , gazprom 's biggest customer , imported almost 36 billion cubic meters of natural gas from russia in 2004 , or 35 percent of german gas consumption .
that is why chancellor angela merkel is so keen on seeing the dispute between russia and ukraine resolved amicably . " the german government expects from russia and ukraine that the bilateral negotiations between the two countries about gas deliveries to ukraine should not lead to the curtailing of gas provisions in europe , " said government spokesperson thomas steg . the german government is in talks with both the russian and the ukrainian governments , but it does not foresee " playing the role of negotiator " or taking sides in the dispute .

the fire department warned that the external walls could collapse , trapping those working in the rubble . local officials said the recovery operation would continue later on tuesday once heavy lifting equipment was in place , but hopes of finding any more survivors from monday 's accident have faded . police on tuesday said rescuers had recovered the bodies of 11 people , including two teenagers and six children between the ages of nine and 12 .
another 18 people were taken to local hospitals for treatment for serious injury following the accident . asked whether there had been any signs of life from the four people believed to be still under the rubble , chief fire officer rudi zeif said : " no , unfortunately .

he declined to comment on the possible causes of the collapse , which happened at around 4 p.m. local time , when the rink was open for public skating .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : fueling europe with russian gas moscow , kiev reach breakthrough in gas pricing row gas delivery dispute hits eu opinion : gas dispute undermines russian foreign policy gas dispute reignites atomic energy debate europe -pipe- 03.01.2006 press review : " the 21st century 's first declaration of war " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european editorial writers are keeping an eye on the gas dispute between russia and ukraine , which has been likened to an energy policy earthquake , the effects of which are being felt across europe . rome 's la repubblica called the dispute a " threat to the entire region . "
" the gas dispute has already moved beyond the borders of russia and ukraine , " the paper wrote , adding that it will spread to wealthy western european countries and then to poorer nations as well .
the paper does n't regard moscow 's promise to guarantee gas delivery to the eu as stable , writing : " moscow caved in to the pressure from the european union , but warned that it wo n't be able to continue covering for theft by the ukrainians . " the independent , from london , asked why ukraine has been singled out by russia for a price hike in natural gas when other former soviet states also pay less than the going market rates .
the paper concluded that it was a political decision .
" vladimir putin intends to destabilize russia 's western neighbor in the hope of unseating its leader , viktor yushchenko , " the independent wrote .
" the ukrainian president has been a thorn in the kremlin 's side since he was swept to power amid mass demonstrations against russian influence .
with elections looming in ukraine , president putin regards this as the right time to exert pressure . "
the paper said that the crisis has made it clear that europe is urgently in need of a common energy policy . magyar nemzet , from budapest , urged hungarian politicians in charge of energy issues to no longer keep their heads stuck in the sand , as hungary is more dependent on energy imports than its neighbors .
" hungary is to 80 percent dependent on imports , and natural gas makes up more than 40 percent of the energy sector , " the paper wrote .
" it is very regrettable that it is only now , in such a critical situation , that we are weighing the options of having coal and nuclear energy play a bigger part in meeting our energy needs - albeit after the use of more environmentally friendly renewable energy sources . " liberation , from paris , commented that ukraine is now staring the capitalist revolution in the face .
" russia is demanding market prices for its gas , otherwise it will turn off the tap , " the paper wrote .
" with that , russia is using a tried and true strategy of international capitalism - how can this be thrown in russia 's face ? " paris ' le monde labeled the dispute the " first declaration of war in the 21st century . "
" one country cuts off the energy supply of another because it does n't give into its demands , " the paper wrote .
" russia , the largest natural gas producer in the world , pushed the button on the gas weapon .
with the emergence of consumer giants such as china and india , raw materials have become the economic weapons of deterrence , if not mass destruction . " " of course it 's hardly sensible or fitting that ukraine or other countries of the former soviet union build their economies on the back of extremely cheap russian energy imports , " wrote berlingske tidende from copenhagen .
" but as an energy superpower , russia has a responsibility to raise prices gradually over a number of years , so that it does n't force its clients into a crisis situation .
the current demonstration of power over the ukraine is insupportable , because it so baldly demonstrates the iron fist of the kremlin when it comes to foreign policy .

the most difficult part of the world cup is the beginning .

the enthusiasm of 80 million germans is a very important factor .
in the national team you sense that such a goal is doable .
i believe we can win the title .
i have a lot of confidence in us .

i have no reason to doubt i will be number one and stand in the goal at the world cup .
jürgen klinsmann has said it clearly .
i am number one ; there 's nothing there to discuss .
why are you so sure ?
i know what the pressure 's like and how it is to play in the world cup .
i know what 's needed to successfully play in a tournament .
such a situation is n't foreign to me , i 've already experienced it with the national team and with bayern munich .

muslim kids , however , are still waiting for lessons in islam . turkish-born emin alan has been teaching " islamic instruction " at hansa high school in cologne for six years .
he says it 's important that germany 's 800,000 muslim pupils learn about islam in school , since it is part of their identity . " i think it 's also a constitutional mandate for the state to give pupils the chance to learn about their religion , " said alan . the classes are offered at the same time as practical philosophy and catholic and protestant religious education .
they are meant to help students explore their religion .
in contrast to the christian classes , however , they do n't involve actual religious instruction .
the kids learn theory and practical information .
they do n't deal with dogmas or religious truths , as in koran classes or sermons . in addition , non-muslim children also take the classes .
" i take part because i might learn something new here , " said toljan eifler .
" i hardly knew anything about islam beforehand . "
he said he was surprised that the muslims ' creed was quite similar to that of christians .
" i used to think it was totally different . "
divided communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic schools teach kids about their religion the courses are indeed meant to contribute to better understanding between kids with different backgrounds and religions .
but muslim organizations in germany want more .
for years they have been demanding that islamic education be introduced to schools on a par with the catholic and protestant lessons - that is instruction that 's does n't only inform kids about islam , but communicates muslim values and the islamic faith . but that 's easier said than done .
germany 's muslims have so far been unable to agree on one organization to represent their interests and remain divided .
the differences are both religious and political - and often muslim migrants ' countries of origin play a role too .
also , sunnis , shiites and alevis each want their own approach to islam instruction . in the meantime , one german college in münster educates aspiring islamic religious instructors - as well as up-and-coming catholic and protestant teachers which all of the country 's universities train .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public schools could also provide islamic teachings the future of the teachers educated at the university of münster depends on whether any of germany 's muslim organizations succeed in being formally recognized as religious communities , said sven muhammad kalisch , who heads the department that started offering the course of studies last year .
only such recognition would allow german schools to provide regular denominational islamic religious lessons .
and such instruction would have to take place in german , kalisch said . no one islam " in germany there are muslims with entirely different ethnic origins .
there are german converts .
and there are arabic , turkish , pakistani , iranian muslims - muslims from all countries " said kalisch .
" thus , our aim must be to give all muslims who are interested such religious instruction .
and that means it has to be in german . " the first class of islamic teachers will graduate from münster in 2008 .
and kalisch is confident that the legal situation will have changed by then .
after all , germany is interested in regulated and , above all , transparent islamic instruction , said kalisch , adding that complaints arise again and again that too many children learn about their religion in private mosque organizations and islamic schools whose teaching contents are usually unavailable to the public . anne passow -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavaria shuts islamic center , citing dangers amid debate over how best to prevent terrorism while protecting civil liberties , one german state has banned an islamic group , and an official from another state suggested electronically tagging militants .

many building authorities are calling for inspections of public places . throughout austria , fire fighters , army soldiers and civilian experts checked snow-laden rooftops over sports centers , train stations , exhibition halls and other buildings with flat roofs to determine if they were in imminent danger of collapse .
in the province of salzburg , which is just across the border from bad reichenhall , authorities shut down several sports centers citing too much wet , heavy snow .

officials worry the weather could result in more accidents . a day after the roof of an ice skating rink in bad reichenhall collapsed under a heavy load of wet snow , officials in surrounding towns and across the border in austria fret that continued snowfall could cause more rooftops to cave in .
many building authorities are calling for inspections of public places . throughout austria , fire fighters , army soldiers and civilian experts checked snow-laden rooftops over sports centers , train stations , exhibition halls and other buildings with flat roofs to determine if they were in imminent danger of collapse .
in the province of salzburg , which is just across the border from bad reichenhall , authorities shut down several sports centers citing too much wet , heavy snow .
meanwhile , emergency rescue crews reviewed their readiness plans for responding quickly in the event of a roof collapse , salzburg mayor heinz schaden told national broadcaster orf . averting disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roof of an ice rink in bad reichenhall collapsed on monday , killing at least 11 people .
worried about another disaster in their region , police in traunstein near bad reichenhall responded quickly to concerns from train authorities that heavy snow was weighing down a roof over a train track .
police spokesman johann bohnert said all train traffic was halted temporarily until the snow could be removed .
otherwise there was a very real risk the roof could collapse , he said , adding that after the disaster in the ice rink " we are now very cautious . " meanwhile , meteorologists predicted more snow for the coming days and warned that up to 20 cm. of new snow could fall , mixing with the already high levels of fallen snow .
streets and train tracks will likely be impassable and trees could break under the weight of the snow .
the german weather service recommended people in the hardest hit regions of southern german along the border of austria avoid travelling by car and stay indoors if possible . wet snow partially to blame to some the high degree of caution may seem exaggerated for a region seasonally prone to heavy snowfall .
but meteorologists are saying the particular combination of moist air brought in by the barometric low " annekathrin " and temperatures hovering around freezing create an especially wet snow .
and wet snow is heavier than fluffy dry fakes . as a comparison , a cubic meter of wet snow weighs between 300 and 500 kilograms , the same amount of dry snow weighs only about 100 to 200 kilograms . manfred spatzierer , a meteorologist from wetterdienst meteomedia , told dpa news agencies that south eastern bavarian had received about 50 liters of wet snow per square meter in just 24 hours .
" that is a big dumping , " he said and added that the cold temperatures meant the snow would stick .
if it were a bit warmer , the snow would begin to melt ; at colder temperatures the snow would be lighter and the wind would carry it away , he said . snowfall at near freezing is always " quite dangerous , " spatzierer said .
his colleague michael beisenherz agreed : " if it had been normal powder snow , we would have had about a meter of it , but it would not have remained on the roof top .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.01.2006 meteorologists warn more snow coming großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy wet snow is to blame for chaos in southern germany as the town of bad reichenhall struggles to recover from its ice rink disaster , much of southern germany and austria braces for continued snow .
officials worry the weather could result in more accidents . a day after the roof of an ice skating rink in bad reichenhall collapsed under a heavy load of wet snow , officials in surrounding towns and across the border in austria fret that continued snowfall could cause more rooftops to cave in .
many building authorities are calling for inspections of public places . throughout austria , fire fighters , army soldiers and civilian experts checked snow-laden rooftops over sports centers , train stations , exhibition halls and other buildings with flat roofs to determine if they were in imminent danger of collapse .
in the province of salzburg , which is just across the border from bad reichenhall , authorities shut down several sports centers citing too much wet , heavy snow .
meanwhile , emergency rescue crews reviewed their readiness plans for responding quickly in the event of a roof collapse , salzburg mayor heinz schaden told national broadcaster orf . averting disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roof of an ice rink in bad reichenhall collapsed on monday , killing at least 11 people .
worried about another disaster in their region , police in traunstein near bad reichenhall responded quickly to concerns from train authorities that heavy snow was weighing down a roof over a train track .
police spokesman johann bohnert said all train traffic was halted temporarily until the snow could be removed .
otherwise there was a very real risk the roof could collapse , he said , adding that after the disaster in the ice rink " we are now very cautious . " meanwhile , meteorologists predicted more snow for the coming days and warned that up to 20 cm. of new snow could fall , mixing with the already high levels of fallen snow .
streets and train tracks will likely be impassable and trees could break under the weight of the snow .
the german weather service recommended people in the hardest hit regions of southern german along the border of austria avoid travelling by car and stay indoors if possible . wet snow partially to blame to some the high degree of caution may seem exaggerated for a region seasonally prone to heavy snowfall .
but meteorologists are saying the particular combination of moist air brought in by the barometric low " annekathrin " and temperatures hovering around freezing create an especially wet snow .
and wet snow is heavier than fluffy dry fakes . as a comparison , a cubic meter of wet snow weighs between 300 and 500 kilograms , the same amount of dry snow weighs only about 100 to 200 kilograms . manfred spatzierer , a meteorologist from wetterdienst meteomedia , told dpa news agencies that south eastern bavarian had received about 50 liters of wet snow per square meter in just 24 hours .
" that is a big dumping , " he said and added that the cold temperatures meant the snow would stick .
if it were a bit warmer , the snow would begin to melt ; at colder temperatures the snow would be lighter and the wind would carry it away , he said . snowfall at near freezing is always " quite dangerous , " spatzierer said .
his colleague michael beisenherz agreed : " if it had been normal powder snow , we would have had about a meter of it , but it would not have remained on the roof top .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : fueling europe with russian gas moscow , kiev reach breakthrough in gas pricing row opinion : gas dispute undermines russian foreign policy press review : " the 21st century 's first declaration of war " gas delivery dispute hits eu germany -pipe- 03.01.2006 germany not affected by russian gas dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german stoves should stay warm this winter even though russia is the largest supplier of natural gas to germany , consumers here have no reason to worry that their supplies will suffer as a consequence of the russian-ukrainian dispute . even though gas systems across europe reported sharp drops in their gas flows after russian state-controlled natural gas monopoly gazprom cut gas supplies to ukraine on jan .
1 , german consumers had no reason to fear that their apartments would not be heated or that their stoves would remain cold this winter . germany relies heavily on russian gas supplies , but it gets it via two supply routes , one going through ukraine , the other , through belarus and poland .
furthermore , to avoid possible shortages , germany could in case of an emergency increase gas imports from other countries such as norway and the netherlands . germany also maintains sufficient amounts of gas in storage . " the gas reserves are almost full and could supply germany for almost 75 days with gas , " said sabine maas of the german ministry of economy . gas war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is gazprom 's largest customer on monday , a day after gazprom cut the flow of gas to ukraine , germany 's largest gas company eon reported a drop in pressure .
on tuesday , the company said it had registered a reduction of 30 percent pressure in gas coming in from ukraine , which reflected a 10 percent drop in the daily import .
levels are expected to return to normal by tuesday evening . german energy suppliers have assured the 17 million german households that use gas for heating that they will not be affected , but that industrial usage may have to be reduced , should the dispute not get resolved . germany , gazprom 's biggest customer , imported almost 36 billion cubic meters of natural gas from russia in 2004 , or 35 percent of german gas consumption .

that is why chancellor angela merkel is so keen on seeing the dispute between russia and ukraine resolved amicably . " the german government expects from russia and ukraine that the bilateral negotiations between the two countries about gas deliveries to ukraine should not lead to the curtailing of gas provisions in europe , " said government spokesperson thomas steg . the german government is in talks with both the russian and the ukrainian governments , but it does not foresee " playing the role of negotiator " or taking sides in the dispute .
it is much more interested in synchronizing its line of action with other eu members . press reactions the german press was , nonetheless , critical of russia 's " new cold war , " which uses its massive supplies of natural gas as the main weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private customers in germany should see no interruption of gas flow the center-left suddeutsche zeitung commented that " long before petrol and gas stocks are used up , shortages are already translated into higher prices and that 's an instrument of political and economic power . " " today ukraine is the victim , but no one can say that it will not also affect western europe .
while the importance of russian gas to the european union may wane over time that does not change the kremlin 's potential power , " the paper said . the conservative daily die welt urged germany to develop other sources of energy in order to become less dependent on moscow . it cited " bio-gas " and other renewable energy sources , but also recommended that the nuclear option be reconsidered , a suggestion german economics minister michael glos has also made . " that 's the only way to reduce dependence on the russian gazprom monopoly , which fixes the so-called market prices almost at will , " the paper argued . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas dispute reignites atomic energy debate economics minister michael glos suggested germany could backtrack on its decision to stop using nuclear power as natural gas companies reported disruptions in supplies from russia due to the moscow-kiev gas dispute . -lrb- jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 03.01.2006 islamic school lessons face hurdles in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are waiting for the privilege of learning about islam in school catholic and protestant pupils in germany learn about their faiths in special religion classes at school .
muslim kids , however , are still waiting for lessons in islam . turkish-born emin alan has been teaching " islamic instruction " at hansa high school in cologne for six years .
he says it 's important that germany 's 800,000 muslim pupils learn about islam in school , since it is part of their identity . " i think it 's also a constitutional mandate for the state to give pupils the chance to learn about their religion , " said alan . the classes are offered at the same time as practical philosophy and catholic and protestant religious education .
they are meant to help students explore their religion .
in contrast to the christian classes , however , they do n't involve actual religious instruction .
the kids learn theory and practical information .
they do n't deal with dogmas or religious truths , as in koran classes or sermons . in addition , non-muslim children also take the classes .
" i take part because i might learn something new here , " said toljan eifler .
" i hardly knew anything about islam beforehand . "
he said he was surprised that the muslims ' creed was quite similar to that of christians .
" i used to think it was totally different . "
divided communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic schools teach kids about their religion the courses are indeed meant to contribute to better understanding between kids with different backgrounds and religions .
but muslim organizations in germany want more .
for years they have been demanding that islamic education be introduced to schools on a par with the catholic and protestant lessons - that is instruction that 's does n't only inform kids about islam , but communicates muslim values and the islamic faith . but that 's easier said than done .
germany 's muslims have so far been unable to agree on one organization to represent their interests and remain divided .
the differences are both religious and political - and often muslim migrants ' countries of origin play a role too .
also , sunnis , shiites and alevis each want their own approach to islam instruction . in the meantime , one german college in münster educates aspiring islamic religious instructors - as well as up-and-coming catholic and protestant teachers which all of the country 's universities train .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public schools could also provide islamic teachings the future of the teachers educated at the university of münster depends on whether any of germany 's muslim organizations succeed in being formally recognized as religious communities , said sven muhammad kalisch , who heads the department that started offering the course of studies last year .
only such recognition would allow german schools to provide regular denominational islamic religious lessons .
and such instruction would have to take place in german , kalisch said . no one islam " in germany there are muslims with entirely different ethnic origins .
there are german converts .
and there are arabic , turkish , pakistani , iranian muslims - muslims from all countries " said kalisch .
" thus , our aim must be to give all muslims who are interested such religious instruction .
and that means it has to be in german . " the first class of islamic teachers will graduate from münster in 2008 .
and kalisch is confident that the legal situation will have changed by then .
after all , germany is interested in regulated and , above all , transparent islamic instruction , said kalisch , adding that complaints arise again and again that too many children learn about their religion in private mosque organizations and islamic schools whose teaching contents are usually unavailable to the public . anne passow -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavaria shuts islamic center , citing dangers amid debate over how best to prevent terrorism while protecting civil liberties , one german state has banned an islamic group , and an official from another state suggested electronically tagging militants .

muslim kids , however , are still waiting for lessons in islam . turkish-born emin alan has been teaching " islamic instruction " at hansa high school in cologne for six years .
he says it 's important that germany 's 800,000 muslim pupils learn about islam in school , since it is part of their identity . " i think it 's also a constitutional mandate for the state to give pupils the chance to learn about their religion , " said alan . the classes are offered at the same time as practical philosophy and catholic and protestant religious education .
they are meant to help students explore their religion .
in contrast to the christian classes , however , they do n't involve actual religious instruction .
the kids learn theory and practical information .
they do n't deal with dogmas or religious truths , as in koran classes or sermons . in addition , non-muslim children also take the classes .
" i take part because i might learn something new here , " said toljan eifler .
" i hardly knew anything about islam beforehand . "

divided communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic schools teach kids about their religion the courses are indeed meant to contribute to better understanding between kids with different backgrounds and religions .
but muslim organizations in germany want more .
for years they have been demanding that islamic education be introduced to schools on a par with the catholic and protestant lessons - that is instruction that 's does n't only inform kids about islam , but communicates muslim values and the islamic faith . but that 's easier said than done .
germany 's muslims have so far been unable to agree on one organization to represent their interests and remain divided .
the differences are both religious and political - and often muslim migrants ' countries of origin play a role too .
also , sunnis , shiites and alevis each want their own approach to islam instruction . in the meantime , one german college in münster educates aspiring islamic religious instructors - as well as up-and-coming catholic and protestant teachers which all of the country 's universities train .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public schools could also provide islamic teachings the future of the teachers educated at the university of münster depends on whether any of germany 's muslim organizations succeed in being formally recognized as religious communities , said sven muhammad kalisch , who heads the department that started offering the course of studies last year .
only such recognition would allow german schools to provide regular denominational islamic religious lessons .

" thus , our aim must be to give all muslims who are interested such religious instruction .
and that means it has to be in german . " the first class of islamic teachers will graduate from münster in 2008 .
and kalisch is confident that the legal situation will have changed by then .

muslim kids , however , are still waiting for lessons in islam . turkish-born emin alan has been teaching " islamic instruction " at hansa high school in cologne for six years .
he says it 's important that germany 's 800,000 muslim pupils learn about islam in school , since it is part of their identity . " i think it 's also a constitutional mandate for the state to give pupils the chance to learn about their religion , " said alan . the classes are offered at the same time as practical philosophy and catholic and protestant religious education .
they are meant to help students explore their religion .
in contrast to the christian classes , however , they do n't involve actual religious instruction .
the kids learn theory and practical information .
they do n't deal with dogmas or religious truths , as in koran classes or sermons . in addition , non-muslim children also take the classes .
" i take part because i might learn something new here , " said toljan eifler .
" i hardly knew anything about islam beforehand . "
he said he was surprised that the muslims ' creed was quite similar to that of christians .
" i used to think it was totally different . "
divided communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic schools teach kids about their religion the courses are indeed meant to contribute to better understanding between kids with different backgrounds and religions .
but muslim organizations in germany want more .
for years they have been demanding that islamic education be introduced to schools on a par with the catholic and protestant lessons - that is instruction that 's does n't only inform kids about islam , but communicates muslim values and the islamic faith . but that 's easier said than done .
germany 's muslims have so far been unable to agree on one organization to represent their interests and remain divided .
the differences are both religious and political - and often muslim migrants ' countries of origin play a role too .
also , sunnis , shiites and alevis each want their own approach to islam instruction . in the meantime , one german college in münster educates aspiring islamic religious instructors - as well as up-and-coming catholic and protestant teachers which all of the country 's universities train .

officials worry the weather could result in more accidents . a day after the roof of an ice skating rink in bad reichenhall collapsed under a heavy load of wet snow , officials in surrounding towns and across the border in austria fret that continued snowfall could cause more rooftops to cave in .
many building authorities are calling for inspections of public places . throughout austria , fire fighters , army soldiers and civilian experts checked snow-laden rooftops over sports centers , train stations , exhibition halls and other buildings with flat roofs to determine if they were in imminent danger of collapse .
in the province of salzburg , which is just across the border from bad reichenhall , authorities shut down several sports centers citing too much wet , heavy snow .
meanwhile , emergency rescue crews reviewed their readiness plans for responding quickly in the event of a roof collapse , salzburg mayor heinz schaden told national broadcaster orf . averting disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roof of an ice rink in bad reichenhall collapsed on monday , killing at least 11 people .
worried about another disaster in their region , police in traunstein near bad reichenhall responded quickly to concerns from train authorities that heavy snow was weighing down a roof over a train track .
police spokesman johann bohnert said all train traffic was halted temporarily until the snow could be removed .
otherwise there was a very real risk the roof could collapse , he said , adding that after the disaster in the ice rink " we are now very cautious . " meanwhile , meteorologists predicted more snow for the coming days and warned that up to 20 cm. of new snow could fall , mixing with the already high levels of fallen snow .
streets and train tracks will likely be impassable and trees could break under the weight of the snow .
the german weather service recommended people in the hardest hit regions of southern german along the border of austria avoid travelling by car and stay indoors if possible . wet snow partially to blame to some the high degree of caution may seem exaggerated for a region seasonally prone to heavy snowfall .
but meteorologists are saying the particular combination of moist air brought in by the barometric low " annekathrin " and temperatures hovering around freezing create an especially wet snow .
and wet snow is heavier than fluffy dry fakes . as a comparison , a cubic meter of wet snow weighs between 300 and 500 kilograms , the same amount of dry snow weighs only about 100 to 200 kilograms . manfred spatzierer , a meteorologist from wetterdienst meteomedia , told dpa news agencies that south eastern bavarian had received about 50 liters of wet snow per square meter in just 24 hours .
" that is a big dumping , " he said and added that the cold temperatures meant the snow would stick .
if it were a bit warmer , the snow would begin to melt ; at colder temperatures the snow would be lighter and the wind would carry it away , he said . snowfall at near freezing is always " quite dangerous , " spatzierer said .
his colleague michael beisenherz agreed : " if it had been normal powder snow , we would have had about a meter of it , but it would not have remained on the roof top .

officials worry the weather could result in more accidents . a day after the roof of an ice skating rink in bad reichenhall collapsed under a heavy load of wet snow , officials in surrounding towns and across the border in austria fret that continued snowfall could cause more rooftops to cave in .
many building authorities are calling for inspections of public places . throughout austria , fire fighters , army soldiers and civilian experts checked snow-laden rooftops over sports centers , train stations , exhibition halls and other buildings with flat roofs to determine if they were in imminent danger of collapse .
in the province of salzburg , which is just across the border from bad reichenhall , authorities shut down several sports centers citing too much wet , heavy snow .
meanwhile , emergency rescue crews reviewed their readiness plans for responding quickly in the event of a roof collapse , salzburg mayor heinz schaden told national broadcaster orf . averting disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roof of an ice rink in bad reichenhall collapsed on monday , killing at least 11 people .
worried about another disaster in their region , police in traunstein near bad reichenhall responded quickly to concerns from train authorities that heavy snow was weighing down a roof over a train track .
police spokesman johann bohnert said all train traffic was halted temporarily until the snow could be removed .
otherwise there was a very real risk the roof could collapse , he said , adding that after the disaster in the ice rink " we are now very cautious . " meanwhile , meteorologists predicted more snow for the coming days and warned that up to 20 cm. of new snow could fall , mixing with the already high levels of fallen snow .
streets and train tracks will likely be impassable and trees could break under the weight of the snow .
the german weather service recommended people in the hardest hit regions of southern german along the border of austria avoid travelling by car and stay indoors if possible . wet snow partially to blame to some the high degree of caution may seem exaggerated for a region seasonally prone to heavy snowfall .

in the national team you sense that such a goal is doable .
i believe we can win the title .
i have a lot of confidence in us .

i have no reason to doubt i will be number one and stand in the goal at the world cup .
jürgen klinsmann has said it clearly .
i am number one ; there 's nothing there to discuss .
why are you so sure ?
i know what the pressure 's like and how it is to play in the world cup .
i know what 's needed to successfully play in a tournament .
such a situation is n't foreign to me , i 've already experienced it with the national team and with bayern munich .

the fire department warned that the external walls could collapse , trapping those working in the rubble . local officials said the recovery operation would continue later on tuesday once heavy lifting equipment was in place , but hopes of finding any more survivors from monday 's accident have faded . police on tuesday said rescuers had recovered the bodies of 11 people , including two teenagers and six children between the ages of nine and 12 .
another 18 people were taken to local hospitals for treatment for serious injury following the accident . asked whether there had been any signs of life from the four people believed to be still under the rubble , chief fire officer rudi zeif said : " no , unfortunately . " a catastrophe " the situation is catastrophic , " a bavarian red cross spokesman said , adding that the recovery operation was extremely difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifty people were thought to have been in the hall when the roof collapsed the area around the rink was evacuated monday , but rescue efforts were complicated by continued snowfall , following a blizzard that began in the early hours of monday and reportedly dumped some 30 centimeters -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- of snow on the region .
emergency personnel had difficulty reaching the hall because traffic had virtually stalled due to the snow . the fire brigade attempted to prop up remaining sections of the roof to allow search operations in the building . " the rescue work is proving very difficult .
it is very difficult to get into the building .
the roof which has collapsed can only be lifted with heavy equipment , " police spokesman fritz braun told n-tv television .
he declined to comment on the possible causes of the collapse , which happened at around 4 p.m. local time , when the rink was open for public skating .
at the time , some 50 people were in the hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : locals had complained for years that the rink was in need of repairs the chairman of the local ice hockey club told german public television that local authorities had warned his team at around 3:30 p.m. that the hall was unsafe for a training session planned in the afternoon .
" ice skating for the public evidently still went on , " thomas rumpeltes told zdf television . however , in a press conference , bad reichenhall mayor wolfgang heitmeier brushed aside accusations that the collapse of the 1970s construction was foreseeable given the weight of new fallen snow .
" the warning levels had n't been reached by monday afternoon , " he said . no answers yet bavarian premier edmund stoiber visited the disaster zone tuesday morning and promised rapid help for the families of the victims .
" we will establish a fund for the victims , " stoiber said .

1 , german consumers had no reason to fear that their apartments would not be heated or that their stoves would remain cold this winter . germany relies heavily on russian gas supplies , but it gets it via two supply routes , one going through ukraine , the other , through belarus and poland .
furthermore , to avoid possible shortages , germany could in case of an emergency increase gas imports from other countries such as norway and the netherlands . germany also maintains sufficient amounts of gas in storage . " the gas reserves are almost full and could supply germany for almost 75 days with gas , " said sabine maas of the german ministry of economy . gas war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is gazprom 's largest customer on monday , a day after gazprom cut the flow of gas to ukraine , germany 's largest gas company eon reported a drop in pressure .
on tuesday , the company said it had registered a reduction of 30 percent pressure in gas coming in from ukraine , which reflected a 10 percent drop in the daily import .
levels are expected to return to normal by tuesday evening . german energy suppliers have assured the 17 million german households that use gas for heating that they will not be affected , but that industrial usage may have to be reduced , should the dispute not get resolved . germany , gazprom 's biggest customer , imported almost 36 billion cubic meters of natural gas from russia in 2004 , or 35 percent of german gas consumption .

" the german government expects from russia and ukraine that the bilateral negotiations between the two countries about gas deliveries to ukraine should not lead to the curtailing of gas provisions in europe , " said government spokesperson thomas steg . the german government is in talks with both the russian and the ukrainian governments , but it does not foresee " playing the role of negotiator " or taking sides in the dispute .
it is much more interested in synchronizing its line of action with other eu members . press reactions the german press was , nonetheless , critical of russia 's " new cold war , " which uses its massive supplies of natural gas as the main weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private customers in germany should see no interruption of gas flow the center-left suddeutsche zeitung commented that " long before petrol and gas stocks are used up , shortages are already translated into higher prices and that 's an instrument of political and economic power .

muslim kids , however , are still waiting for lessons in islam . turkish-born emin alan has been teaching " islamic instruction " at hansa high school in cologne for six years .
he says it 's important that germany 's 800,000 muslim pupils learn about islam in school , since it is part of their identity . " i think it 's also a constitutional mandate for the state to give pupils the chance to learn about their religion , " said alan . the classes are offered at the same time as practical philosophy and catholic and protestant religious education .
they are meant to help students explore their religion .
in contrast to the christian classes , however , they do n't involve actual religious instruction .
the kids learn theory and practical information .
they do n't deal with dogmas or religious truths , as in koran classes or sermons . in addition , non-muslim children also take the classes .
" i take part because i might learn something new here , " said toljan eifler .
" i hardly knew anything about islam beforehand . "
he said he was surprised that the muslims ' creed was quite similar to that of christians .
" i used to think it was totally different . "

muslim kids , however , are still waiting for lessons in islam . turkish-born emin alan has been teaching " islamic instruction " at hansa high school in cologne for six years .
he says it 's important that germany 's 800,000 muslim pupils learn about islam in school , since it is part of their identity . " i think it 's also a constitutional mandate for the state to give pupils the chance to learn about their religion , " said alan . the classes are offered at the same time as practical philosophy and catholic and protestant religious education .
they are meant to help students explore their religion .
in contrast to the christian classes , however , they do n't involve actual religious instruction .
the kids learn theory and practical information .
they do n't deal with dogmas or religious truths , as in koran classes or sermons . in addition , non-muslim children also take the classes .

muslim kids , however , are still waiting for lessons in islam . turkish-born emin alan has been teaching " islamic instruction " at hansa high school in cologne for six years .
he says it 's important that germany 's 800,000 muslim pupils learn about islam in school , since it is part of their identity . " i think it 's also a constitutional mandate for the state to give pupils the chance to learn about their religion , " said alan . the classes are offered at the same time as practical philosophy and catholic and protestant religious education .
they are meant to help students explore their religion .
in contrast to the christian classes , however , they do n't involve actual religious instruction .
the kids learn theory and practical information .
they do n't deal with dogmas or religious truths , as in koran classes or sermons . in addition , non-muslim children also take the classes .
" i take part because i might learn something new here , " said toljan eifler .
" i hardly knew anything about islam beforehand . "
he said he was surprised that the muslims ' creed was quite similar to that of christians .
" i used to think it was totally different . "
divided communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic schools teach kids about their religion the courses are indeed meant to contribute to better understanding between kids with different backgrounds and religions .
but muslim organizations in germany want more .
for years they have been demanding that islamic education be introduced to schools on a par with the catholic and protestant lessons - that is instruction that 's does n't only inform kids about islam , but communicates muslim values and the islamic faith . but that 's easier said than done .
germany 's muslims have so far been unable to agree on one organization to represent their interests and remain divided .
the differences are both religious and political - and often muslim migrants ' countries of origin play a role too .
also , sunnis , shiites and alevis each want their own approach to islam instruction . in the meantime , one german college in münster educates aspiring islamic religious instructors - as well as up-and-coming catholic and protestant teachers which all of the country 's universities train .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public schools could also provide islamic teachings the future of the teachers educated at the university of münster depends on whether any of germany 's muslim organizations succeed in being formally recognized as religious communities , said sven muhammad kalisch , who heads the department that started offering the course of studies last year .
only such recognition would allow german schools to provide regular denominational islamic religious lessons .
and such instruction would have to take place in german , kalisch said . no one islam " in germany there are muslims with entirely different ethnic origins .
there are german converts .
and there are arabic , turkish , pakistani , iranian muslims - muslims from all countries " said kalisch .
" thus , our aim must be to give all muslims who are interested such religious instruction .
and that means it has to be in german . " the first class of islamic teachers will graduate from münster in 2008 .
and kalisch is confident that the legal situation will have changed by then .
after all , germany is interested in regulated and , above all , transparent islamic instruction , said kalisch , adding that complaints arise again and again that too many children learn about their religion in private mosque organizations and islamic schools whose teaching contents are usually unavailable to the public . anne passow -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavaria shuts islamic center , citing dangers amid debate over how best to prevent terrorism while protecting civil liberties , one german state has banned an islamic group , and an official from another state suggested electronically tagging militants .

the enthusiasm of 80 million germans is a very important factor .
in the national team you sense that such a goal is doable .
i believe we can win the title .
i have a lot of confidence in us .
who will be number one in the german goal at the world cup ?
i have no reason to doubt i will be number one and stand in the goal at the world cup .
jürgen klinsmann has said it clearly .
i am number one ; there 's nothing there to discuss .
why are you so sure ?
i know what the pressure 's like and how it is to play in the world cup .
i know what 's needed to successfully play in a tournament .
such a situation is n't foreign to me , i 've already experienced it with the national team and with bayern munich .

officials worry the weather could result in more accidents . a day after the roof of an ice skating rink in bad reichenhall collapsed under a heavy load of wet snow , officials in surrounding towns and across the border in austria fret that continued snowfall could cause more rooftops to cave in .
many building authorities are calling for inspections of public places . throughout austria , fire fighters , army soldiers and civilian experts checked snow-laden rooftops over sports centers , train stations , exhibition halls and other buildings with flat roofs to determine if they were in imminent danger of collapse .
in the province of salzburg , which is just across the border from bad reichenhall , authorities shut down several sports centers citing too much wet , heavy snow .
meanwhile , emergency rescue crews reviewed their readiness plans for responding quickly in the event of a roof collapse , salzburg mayor heinz schaden told national broadcaster orf . averting disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roof of an ice rink in bad reichenhall collapsed on monday , killing at least 11 people .
worried about another disaster in their region , police in traunstein near bad reichenhall responded quickly to concerns from train authorities that heavy snow was weighing down a roof over a train track .
police spokesman johann bohnert said all train traffic was halted temporarily until the snow could be removed .
otherwise there was a very real risk the roof could collapse , he said , adding that after the disaster in the ice rink " we are now very cautious . " meanwhile , meteorologists predicted more snow for the coming days and warned that up to 20 cm. of new snow could fall , mixing with the already high levels of fallen snow .

" that is a big dumping , " he said and added that the cold temperatures meant the snow would stick .
if it were a bit warmer , the snow would begin to melt ; at colder temperatures the snow would be lighter and the wind would carry it away , he said . snowfall at near freezing is always " quite dangerous , " spatzierer said .
his colleague michael beisenherz agreed : " if it had been normal powder snow , we would have had about a meter of it , but it would not have remained on the roof top .

officials worry the weather could result in more accidents . a day after the roof of an ice skating rink in bad reichenhall collapsed under a heavy load of wet snow , officials in surrounding towns and across the border in austria fret that continued snowfall could cause more rooftops to cave in .
many building authorities are calling for inspections of public places . throughout austria , fire fighters , army soldiers and civilian experts checked snow-laden rooftops over sports centers , train stations , exhibition halls and other buildings with flat roofs to determine if they were in imminent danger of collapse .
in the province of salzburg , which is just across the border from bad reichenhall , authorities shut down several sports centers citing too much wet , heavy snow .
meanwhile , emergency rescue crews reviewed their readiness plans for responding quickly in the event of a roof collapse , salzburg mayor heinz schaden told national broadcaster orf . averting disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roof of an ice rink in bad reichenhall collapsed on monday , killing at least 11 people .
worried about another disaster in their region , police in traunstein near bad reichenhall responded quickly to concerns from train authorities that heavy snow was weighing down a roof over a train track .
police spokesman johann bohnert said all train traffic was halted temporarily until the snow could be removed .
otherwise there was a very real risk the roof could collapse , he said , adding that after the disaster in the ice rink " we are now very cautious . " meanwhile , meteorologists predicted more snow for the coming days and warned that up to 20 cm. of new snow could fall , mixing with the already high levels of fallen snow .
streets and train tracks will likely be impassable and trees could break under the weight of the snow .
the german weather service recommended people in the hardest hit regions of southern german along the border of austria avoid travelling by car and stay indoors if possible . wet snow partially to blame to some the high degree of caution may seem exaggerated for a region seasonally prone to heavy snowfall .
but meteorologists are saying the particular combination of moist air brought in by the barometric low " annekathrin " and temperatures hovering around freezing create an especially wet snow .
and wet snow is heavier than fluffy dry fakes . as a comparison , a cubic meter of wet snow weighs between 300 and 500 kilograms , the same amount of dry snow weighs only about 100 to 200 kilograms . manfred spatzierer , a meteorologist from wetterdienst meteomedia , told dpa news agencies that south eastern bavarian had received about 50 liters of wet snow per square meter in just 24 hours .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : fueling europe with russian gas moscow , kiev reach breakthrough in gas pricing row gas delivery dispute hits eu opinion : gas dispute undermines russian foreign policy gas dispute reignites atomic energy debate europe -pipe- 03.01.2006 press review : " the 21st century 's first declaration of war " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european editorial writers are keeping an eye on the gas dispute between russia and ukraine , which has been likened to an energy policy earthquake , the effects of which are being felt across europe . rome 's la repubblica called the dispute a " threat to the entire region . "
" the gas dispute has already moved beyond the borders of russia and ukraine , " the paper wrote , adding that it will spread to wealthy western european countries and then to poorer nations as well .
the paper does n't regard moscow 's promise to guarantee gas delivery to the eu as stable , writing : " moscow caved in to the pressure from the european union , but warned that it wo n't be able to continue covering for theft by the ukrainians . " the independent , from london , asked why ukraine has been singled out by russia for a price hike in natural gas when other former soviet states also pay less than the going market rates .
the paper concluded that it was a political decision .
" vladimir putin intends to destabilize russia 's western neighbor in the hope of unseating its leader , viktor yushchenko , " the independent wrote .
" the ukrainian president has been a thorn in the kremlin 's side since he was swept to power amid mass demonstrations against russian influence .
with elections looming in ukraine , president putin regards this as the right time to exert pressure . "
the paper said that the crisis has made it clear that europe is urgently in need of a common energy policy . magyar nemzet , from budapest , urged hungarian politicians in charge of energy issues to no longer keep their heads stuck in the sand , as hungary is more dependent on energy imports than its neighbors .
" hungary is to 80 percent dependent on imports , and natural gas makes up more than 40 percent of the energy sector , " the paper wrote .
" it is very regrettable that it is only now , in such a critical situation , that we are weighing the options of having coal and nuclear energy play a bigger part in meeting our energy needs - albeit after the use of more environmentally friendly renewable energy sources . " liberation , from paris , commented that ukraine is now staring the capitalist revolution in the face .
" russia is demanding market prices for its gas , otherwise it will turn off the tap , " the paper wrote .
" with that , russia is using a tried and true strategy of international capitalism - how can this be thrown in russia 's face ? " paris ' le monde labeled the dispute the " first declaration of war in the 21st century . "
" one country cuts off the energy supply of another because it does n't give into its demands , " the paper wrote .
" russia , the largest natural gas producer in the world , pushed the button on the gas weapon .
with the emergence of consumer giants such as china and india , raw materials have become the economic weapons of deterrence , if not mass destruction . " " of course it 's hardly sensible or fitting that ukraine or other countries of the former soviet union build their economies on the back of extremely cheap russian energy imports , " wrote berlingske tidende from copenhagen .
" but as an energy superpower , russia has a responsibility to raise prices gradually over a number of years , so that it does n't force its clients into a crisis situation .
the current demonstration of power over the ukraine is insupportable , because it so baldly demonstrates the iron fist of the kremlin when it comes to foreign policy .

the hut , which costs £ 700 a season , has no electricity or water and can only be used from april to september .
" it was definitely worth the long wait , it has been fantastic , " said mrs day .
we were determined to get one this time valerie day couple 's reaction " we have got it for life , that has been the whole point of doing this . "
the couple , who moved to the nearby highcliffe area from london five years ago , have queued every year for a short-term hut and two years ago were " pipped at the post " for one of the long lets .
" we were determined to get one this time , " said mrs day .
" it is very tranquil and pleasant .
we came down here for holidays before we lived here and we loved it so much . "
about 30 people queued up on monday for the two long-term huts and a number of shorter term lets .

the warning comes from james strachan , who is stepping down as chairman of the audit commission later in january .
he says outsourcing significant slices of nhs work will have implications for the remaining services .
somebody within the health service must take responsibility for checking the bigger picture , argues mr strachan .
he also suggests the pace of reorganisation in the nhs should slow down and says it is " nonsense " to say the public sector can not be as cost effective as private firms .
james strachan born 10 november 1953 educated : king 's school , canterbury ; christ 's college , cambridge ; london college of printing ; london business school 1976-77 : chase manhattan bank 1977 joins merrill lynch , made a managing director in 1986 1989-1997works as writer and photographer 1997-present : chief executive then chairman of the royal national institute for the deaf 2002-present : chairman of the audit commission since the interview , mr strachan has said he will not take up the offer of a second term in the post .
but newspaper reports have suggested some of his commission had lost confidence in him after a row with the local government association over a press release criticising councils ' performance .
mr strachan says his departure to pursue other work in the private and voluntary sector is " totally unrelated " to any supposed row .
one audit commission source denied there had been a row within the commission but some commissioners had planned to raise the councils issue at their next meeting .
impact of choice ?
private companies are increasingly being used in state-paid healthcare .
from this month , patients are able choose from at least four hospitals for elective operations .
ministers expect one of these to be a private treatment centre operating at nhs costs .
in a bbc news website interview , mr strachan does not wade into the political arguments .
but he says there is a danger in politics that ideas are " expressed very polemically " .
from a private sector point of view there is not a choice between being " totally centralist " or " almost wash your hands abdication of responsibility " , he says .
instead , firms realise there must be a hierarchy with strong middle levels of control between the top and the bottom .
the same " cascading down " of decision making is needed for running health services or 26,000 state schools , he argues .
in health , the middle management levels must look at how the system is working as a whole when there are independent treatment centres or outsourcing .
mr strachan says there is little issue when the private sector only makes up 5 % of nhs work but when it starts to be 15 % or 20 % " it clearly starts to have implications for the remaining 80 % " .
casualty fears he wants a small group of strategic health authorities or a commissioner - not a regulator from outside the nhs - to keep sight of that larger picture .
" somebody , if those changes are made , should really assume responsibility for making that mixed economy work effectively without in any way , for example , just standing back and watching key parts of a hospital being farmed out such that it makes it very difficult for its a & e department to run itself because it 's lost some of the underpinning surgical divisions which it needs to function . "
mr strachan says it is one thing to move a specialist service 10 miles down the road and quite another to move it 200 miles away . "
would it be a good idea to subtle down the pace of reorganisation ?
probably " james strachan he says there is " not a shadow of doubt " that nhs services have improved substantially .
but he points to the fact in two years ' time health spending will have risen from £ 35bn to £ 100bn .
there are clearly questions about whether the improvements have been in direct proportion to the extra money , he says , arguing that it is difficult to give a precise answer .
mr strachan says he sympathises with the frustration of nhs workers with " i 'm the lucky one syndrome " - where patients praise their treatment but do not think the health service overall has improved .
" clearly there has been very , very dramatic improvement .
could there be more ?
absolutely .
would it be a good idea to subtle down the pace of reorganisation ?
probably . "
payment by results the emphasis of reforms must be as much on changing behaviour - such as ensuring patients are met by a smiling receptionist - as on changing structures so they mimic the mechanisms of the marketplace , he says .
payment by results - where money follows patients around rather than hospitals being paid lump sums - is one of those market mechanisms .
the audit commission loves the idea in principle but says it is too early to gauge its success .
it argues it is not a panacea to performance problems .
mr strachan says the policy is an important first step but says the department of health are looking at its potential consequences - what happens when hospitals ' budget deficits rise ; are new managers brought in , are services closed , are hospitals closed ?
" somebody needs to think through once you have injected some quasi market mechanisms what then happens in the case of this dreaded word ' failure ' , " he argues , saying solutions are possible .
cash holes the government is forecasting a £ 620m deficit for the nhs in england for this financial year and surgeons in some hospitals have been told to delay operations to cut their debts .
so is the payment by results policy the reason for these cash shortfalls ?
" it is part but not whole cause but it is almost totally the reason why we are seeing the deficits so clearly , " says mr strachan .
what he means is that there are other causes of the deficits , including poor financial management .
but also the new system prevents health trusts from smoothing over individual deficits by moving around contracts and debts at the end of the year as has happened in the past .
public vs private ?
all this is the nitty gritty of the work of a public spending watchdog - a life mr strachan is now leaving .
before doing so he delivers a strong defence of the need for regulators , saying they must find ways of replacing the pressure produced in private firms by consumers and shareholders who can take their business and money elsewhere .
in both public sectors there are some people who " can knock the socks off the private sector " .
" the problem is it 's not everybody , " he says .
" it 's arguable that in the public sector compared to the private sector you can have over time the perpetuation of some quite poor performance if you are not careful .
" the reason for that obviously is in the private sector you would have long ago have gone to the wall if you provide that service . "
local councils are among those who complain about the burden of regulation but mr strachan proudly says the amount of audit commission-controlled inspection has fallen 70 % .
" we have actually just shown a burning desire to shrink ourselves , " he says .
now he leaves fanning the flames of that bonfire of regulation to somebody else .

before doing so he delivers a strong defence of the need for regulators , saying they must find ways of replacing the pressure produced in private firms by consumers and shareholders who can take their business and money elsewhere .
in both public sectors there are some people who " can knock the socks off the private sector " .
" the problem is it 's not everybody , " he says .
" it 's arguable that in the public sector compared to the private sector you can have over time the perpetuation of some quite poor performance if you are not careful .
" the reason for that obviously is in the private sector you would have long ago have gone to the wall if you provide that service . "
local councils are among those who complain about the burden of regulation but mr strachan proudly says the amount of audit commission-controlled inspection has fallen 70 % .
" we have actually just shown a burning desire to shrink ourselves , " he says .
now he leaves fanning the flames of that bonfire of regulation to somebody else .

the warning comes from james strachan , who is stepping down as chairman of the audit commission later in january .
he says outsourcing significant slices of nhs work will have implications for the remaining services .
somebody within the health service must take responsibility for checking the bigger picture , argues mr strachan .
he also suggests the pace of reorganisation in the nhs should slow down and says it is " nonsense " to say the public sector can not be as cost effective as private firms .
james strachan born 10 november 1953 educated : king 's school , canterbury ; christ 's college , cambridge ; london college of printing ; london business school 1976-77 : chase manhattan bank 1977 joins merrill lynch , made a managing director in 1986 1989-1997works as writer and photographer 1997-present : chief executive then chairman of the royal national institute for the deaf 2002-present : chairman of the audit commission since the interview , mr strachan has said he will not take up the offer of a second term in the post .
but newspaper reports have suggested some of his commission had lost confidence in him after a row with the local government association over a press release criticising councils ' performance .
mr strachan says his departure to pursue other work in the private and voluntary sector is " totally unrelated " to any supposed row .
one audit commission source denied there had been a row within the commission but some commissioners had planned to raise the councils issue at their next meeting .
impact of choice ?
private companies are increasingly being used in state-paid healthcare .
from this month , patients are able choose from at least four hospitals for elective operations .
ministers expect one of these to be a private treatment centre operating at nhs costs .
in a bbc news website interview , mr strachan does not wade into the political arguments .
the nhs will use more private treatment centres but he says there is a danger in politics that ideas are " expressed very polemically " .
from a private sector point of view there is not a choice between being " totally centralist " or " almost wash your hands abdication of responsibility " , he says .
instead , firms realise there must be a hierarchy with strong middle levels of control between the top and the bottom .
the same " cascading down " of decision making is needed for running health services or 26,000 state schools , he argues .
in health , the middle management levels must look at how the system is working as a whole when there are independent treatment centres or outsourcing .
mr strachan says there is little issue when the private sector only makes up 5 % of nhs work but when it starts to be 15 % or 20 % " it clearly starts to have implications for the remaining 80 % " .
casualty fears he wants a small group of strategic health authorities or a commissioner - not a regulator from outside the nhs - to keep sight of that larger picture .
" somebody , if those changes are made , should really assume responsibility for making that mixed economy work effectively without in any way , for example , just standing back and watching key parts of a hospital being farmed out such that it makes it very difficult for its a & e department to run itself because it 's lost some of the underpinning surgical divisions which it needs to function . "
mr strachan says it is one thing to move a specialist service 10 miles down the road and quite another to move it 200 miles away .
would it be a good idea to subtle down the pace of reorganisation ?
probably james strachan he says there is " not a shadow of doubt " that nhs services have improved substantially .
but he points to the fact in two years ' time health spending will have risen from £ 35bn to £ 100bn .
there are clearly questions about whether the improvements have been in direct proportion to the extra money , he says , arguing that it is difficult to give a precise answer .
mr strachan says he sympathises with the frustration of nhs workers with " i 'm the lucky one syndrome " - where patients praise their treatment but do not think the health service overall has improved .
" clearly there has been very , very dramatic improvement .
could there be more ?
absolutely .
would it be a good idea to subtle down the pace of reorganisation ?
probably . "
payment by results the emphasis of reforms must be as much on changing behaviour - such as ensuring patients are met by a smiling receptionist - as on changing structures so they mimic the mechanisms of the marketplace , he says .
payment by results - where money follows patients around rather than hospitals being paid lump sums - is one of those market mechanisms .
the audit commission loves the idea in principle but says it is too early to gauge its success .
it argues it is not a panacea to performance problems .
mr strachan says the policy is an important first step but says the department of health are looking at its potential consequences - what happens when hospitals ' budget deficits rise ; are new managers brought in , are services closed , are hospitals closed ?
" somebody needs to think through once you have injected some quasi market mechanisms what then happens in the case of this dreaded word ' failure ' , " he argues , saying solutions are possible .
cash holes the government is forecasting a £ 620m deficit for the nhs in england for this financial year and surgeons in some hospitals have been told to delay operations to cut their debts .
so is the payment by results policy the reason for these cash shortfalls ?
" it is part but not whole cause but it is almost totally the reason why we are seeing the deficits so clearly , " says mr strachan .
what he means is that there are other causes of the deficits , including poor financial management .
but also the new system prevents health trusts from smoothing over individual deficits by moving around contracts and debts at the end of the year as has happened in the past .
public vs private ?
all this is the nitty gritty of the work of a public spending watchdog - a life mr strachan is now leaving .
before doing so he delivers a strong defence of the need for regulators , saying they must find ways of replacing the pressure produced in private firms by consumers and shareholders who can take their business and money elsewhere .
in both public sectors there are some people who " can knock the socks off the private sector " .
" the problem is it 's not everybody , " he says .
" it 's arguable that in the public sector compared to the private sector you can have over time the perpetuation of some quite poor performance if you are not careful .
" the reason for that obviously is in the private sector you would have long ago have gone to the wall if you provide that service . "

" we have actually just shown a burning desire to shrink ourselves , " he says .
now he leaves fanning the flames of that bonfire of regulation to somebody else .
