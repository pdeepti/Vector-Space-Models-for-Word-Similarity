that 's down a coach , a hot striker and a new team spirit . armin veh was only hired at stuttgart last february as an " interim solution " for a team that had thoroughly disappointed expectations .
nine months later , he has the swabians two points behind werder bremen at the top of the bundesliga table .
so what are the reasons for stuttgart 's remarkable recovery ? thomas haid , a sports editor who covers the team for the local stuttgarter zeitung , offered his views . " the team was completely revamped with the addition of six new players in the off-season , " haid told dw-world.de.
" and they 've also succeeded in integrating young players from the amateur ranks into the squad . " gone are petulant divas like striker daniel ljuboja - this season 's team features hard-nosed mexican nationals , ricardo osorio and pavel pardo , and youngsters like sami khediri and serdar tasci . they 're currently riding a four-game winning streak , and that has fans dreaming of stuttgart 's first league title since 1992 .
and much of stuttgart 's success is down to a coach who was initially only an emergency replacement . work that body when armin veh assumed the reins from coaching legend giovanni trappatoni last february , stuttgart was mired in mediocrity - languishing in eighth place with an astonishing 12 draws in 21 games .
few observers thought veh would last long in his new job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motivator armin veh is no longer a stop-gap skipper " there was n't much he could do but limit the damage , " haid said .
" he took over a team in catastrophic physical condition . " stuttgart finished ninth , but veh , who is known as a disciplinarian , was given the chance this year to mould the team in his own image .
the squad is back in shape and has remembered how to win games . tuesday 's victory over hamburg thanks to two goals in the last ten minutes , as well as stuttgart 's stunning comeback from two goals down earlier this season in bremen , speak volumes about the team 's condition . stuttgart have the second-best road record in the bundesliga and have scored more goals than any of their rivals except bremen .
that 's quite a reversal for a team that last season could n't even manage home victories against relegation candidates . go-go gomez it 's an old soccer cliché that in order to win games , you have to score more goals than your opponents , and the man doing that for stuttgart has been mario gomez .
with seven goals and four assists thus far , the 21-striker is having the year of his young career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart players point out a major reason for their success - striker mario gomez veh thinks gomez has earned a shot at playing for germany 's national team .
" i do n't see many german strikers with his quality , " veh said recently .
" if i were the national coach , i 'd try him out . " stuttgart still have some problems to address , if they are to stay on top .
they need to become more consistent at home , and their defense has conceded 16 goals - fifth worst in the league . but if veh and his charges can address those issues , a spot in the champions league is hardly beyond reach .
" it 's a young team that can only improve , " said haid .
" i do n't see any reason why they should n't end up under the top three . " jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no changes at the top of the table werder bremen maintain their overall lead with an away win against nuremberg , while stuttgart keep pace by beating hamburg at home .

fewer foreigners have become german citizens in the last five years . while the number of foreigners taking on citizenship across most of germany has fallen in the last half decade , in berlin the number of new citizens started rising again in 2005 due to a citizenship advertising campaign .
unlike other states that are more restrictive , berlin has adopted a quick , straightforward procedure . the city is also using the multicultural atmosphere as a selling point to encourage people to apply for german citizenship . in a bare room of the technical university in berlin , 24-year-old funda gümüsdag is writing math equations on the blackboard and explaining them to a group of youngsters . gümüsdag is a volunteer , giving extra classes twice a week to students with immigrant backgrounds , whilst studying to be a teacher and involving herself in local politics . she also appears on posters all over berlin , together with 14 other non-native germans , trying to convince foreign youngsters of the advantages of taking up german citizenship . naturalization in action gümüsdag said that getting german nationality has given her the chance to become a part of society and also getting the chance to vote . " you are saying to that society : ' hi , i 'm here and i want to go and vote , ' i want to join a party and i want to be able to put my mark on this society , " she said . gümüsdag and her family have been german citizens for 10 years , and she said there were obvious advantages - like not having to worry about visas when traveling and having the opportunity to be involved in political life . the gümüdags had to give up their turkish citizenship , since german law does not allow dual citizenship under normal circumstances . for many people this is seen as rejecting their original citizenship and is like denying their own roots , but for gümüsdag it 's not a problem - she happily celebrates christmas and ramadan . germany : is a ' country of immigration ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : citizenship is seen by some as empowering , for others it means a loss of identity people are only slowly becoming aware of the fact that germany is a country of immigration and that campaigns like the one funda is involved in are a step in the right direction , according to günter piening , berlin 's commissioner for foreigners ' affairs . " the campaign has two aims : berlin wants to increase the number of young people becoming german citizens , but they also want to encourage a debate on the issue of what it means to be german , " piening said . issues of identity are very important for young people , he added . piening has apparently made it easier to become a german by fast-tracking applications .
in other german states , it takes two years for applicants to be granted citizenship , while in berlin all applications have to be dealt with in six months . information about the requirements for naturalization , such as the minimum age and german language skills , are publicized through radio and newspapers ads or visits to schools .
the extra effort berlin puts into promoting naturalization has allowed it to buck the national trend , some say . as germany 's politicians try to encourage foreigners to commit themselves to integration , berlin has shown one way it can be done . michael lawton -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study challenges widely-held notions about islamic headscarf the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 11.11.2006 vfb stuttgart : from mediocre to meteoric großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have sprinted past the competition in their past four matches stuttgart have recovered from last year 's failed experiments and risen to second place in the league .
that 's down a coach , a hot striker and a new team spirit . armin veh was only hired at stuttgart last february as an " interim solution " for a team that had thoroughly disappointed expectations .
nine months later , he has the swabians two points behind werder bremen at the top of the bundesliga table .
so what are the reasons for stuttgart 's remarkable recovery ? thomas haid , a sports editor who covers the team for the local stuttgarter zeitung , offered his views . " the team was completely revamped with the addition of six new players in the off-season , " haid told dw-world.de.
" and they 've also succeeded in integrating young players from the amateur ranks into the squad . " gone are petulant divas like striker daniel ljuboja - this season 's team features hard-nosed mexican nationals , ricardo osorio and pavel pardo , and youngsters like sami khediri and serdar tasci . they 're currently riding a four-game winning streak , and that has fans dreaming of stuttgart 's first league title since 1992 .
and much of stuttgart 's success is down to a coach who was initially only an emergency replacement . work that body when armin veh assumed the reins from coaching legend giovanni trappatoni last february , stuttgart was mired in mediocrity - languishing in eighth place with an astonishing 12 draws in 21 games .
few observers thought veh would last long in his new job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motivator armin veh is no longer a stop-gap skipper " there was n't much he could do but limit the damage , " haid said .
" he took over a team in catastrophic physical condition . " stuttgart finished ninth , but veh , who is known as a disciplinarian , was given the chance this year to mould the team in his own image .
the squad is back in shape and has remembered how to win games . tuesday 's victory over hamburg thanks to two goals in the last ten minutes , as well as stuttgart 's stunning comeback from two goals down earlier this season in bremen , speak volumes about the team 's condition . stuttgart have the second-best road record in the bundesliga and have scored more goals than any of their rivals except bremen .
that 's quite a reversal for a team that last season could n't even manage home victories against relegation candidates . go-go gomez it 's an old soccer cliché that in order to win games , you have to score more goals than your opponents , and the man doing that for stuttgart has been mario gomez .
with seven goals and four assists thus far , the 21-striker is having the year of his young career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart players point out a major reason for their success - striker mario gomez veh thinks gomez has earned a shot at playing for germany 's national team .
" i do n't see many german strikers with his quality , " veh said recently .
" if i were the national coach , i 'd try him out . " stuttgart still have some problems to address , if they are to stay on top .
they need to become more consistent at home , and their defense has conceded 16 goals - fifth worst in the league . but if veh and his charges can address those issues , a spot in the champions league is hardly beyond reach .
" it 's a young team that can only improve , " said haid .
" i do n't see any reason why they should n't end up under the top three .

opponents earlier failed to prevent the npd from using the berlin hall for its party congress this weekend . " we want to show clearly that our society , in its immense majority , does n't want neo-fascism and neo-nazis , " said walter momper , a social democrat and speaker of the regional berlin parliament and a former mayor of the german capital .
jewish leader thanked crowd berlin jewish community leader gideon joffe also thanked the demonstrators for coming out in numbers " to show the npd what we think of them " - even though the rally was far smaller than initially expected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police were prepared for clashes between the neo-nazis and protesters so far , the npd has secured seats in two regional parliaments - including in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania where chancellor angela merkel 's constituency is located .
it captured 7 percent of the vote there in september elections .
but it has no representatives in germany 's bundestag , the lower house of parliament . police turned out in large numbers saturday against possible clashes between npd members and protesters .
demonstrators last year blocked an npd parade around the city to mark the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii . german politicians , however , have so far failed to ban the extremist group . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de right-wing extremists disrupt pogrom memorial right-wing hooligans were arrested thursday night in frankfurt an der oder for causing a disturbance during a memorial ceremony on the 68th anniversary of one of the most massive nazi pogroms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 11.11.2006 vfb stuttgart : from mediocre to meteoric großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have sprinted past the competition in their past four matches stuttgart have recovered from last year 's failed experiments and risen to second place in the league .
that 's down a coach , a hot striker and a new team spirit . armin veh was only hired at stuttgart last february as an " interim solution " for a team that had thoroughly disappointed expectations .
nine months later , he has the swabians two points behind werder bremen at the top of the bundesliga table .
so what are the reasons for stuttgart 's remarkable recovery ? thomas haid , a sports editor who covers the team for the local stuttgarter zeitung , offered his views . " the team was completely revamped with the addition of six new players in the off-season , " haid told dw-world.de.
" and they 've also succeeded in integrating young players from the amateur ranks into the squad . " gone are petulant divas like striker daniel ljuboja - this season 's team features hard-nosed mexican nationals , ricardo osorio and pavel pardo , and youngsters like sami khediri and serdar tasci . they 're currently riding a four-game winning streak , and that has fans dreaming of stuttgart 's first league title since 1992 .
and much of stuttgart 's success is down to a coach who was initially only an emergency replacement . work that body when armin veh assumed the reins from coaching legend giovanni trappatoni last february , stuttgart was mired in mediocrity - languishing in eighth place with an astonishing 12 draws in 21 games .
few observers thought veh would last long in his new job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motivator armin veh is no longer a stop-gap skipper " there was n't much he could do but limit the damage , " haid said .
" he took over a team in catastrophic physical condition . " stuttgart finished ninth , but veh , who is known as a disciplinarian , was given the chance this year to mould the team in his own image .
the squad is back in shape and has remembered how to win games . tuesday 's victory over hamburg thanks to two goals in the last ten minutes , as well as stuttgart 's stunning comeback from two goals down earlier this season in bremen , speak volumes about the team 's condition . stuttgart have the second-best road record in the bundesliga and have scored more goals than any of their rivals except bremen .
that 's quite a reversal for a team that last season could n't even manage home victories against relegation candidates . go-go gomez it 's an old soccer cliché that in order to win games , you have to score more goals than your opponents , and the man doing that for stuttgart has been mario gomez .
with seven goals and four assists thus far , the 21-striker is having the year of his young career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart players point out a major reason for their success - striker mario gomez veh thinks gomez has earned a shot at playing for germany 's national team .
" i do n't see many german strikers with his quality , " veh said recently .
" if i were the national coach , i 'd try him out . " stuttgart still have some problems to address , if they are to stay on top .
they need to become more consistent at home , and their defense has conceded 16 goals - fifth worst in the league . but if veh and his charges can address those issues , a spot in the champions league is hardly beyond reach .
" it 's a young team that can only improve , " said haid .
" i do n't see any reason why they should n't end up under the top three .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 11.11.2006 vfb stuttgart : from mediocre to meteoric großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have sprinted past the competition in their past four matches stuttgart have recovered from last year 's failed experiments and risen to second place in the league .
that 's down a coach , a hot striker and a new team spirit . armin veh was only hired at stuttgart last february as an " interim solution " for a team that had thoroughly disappointed expectations .
nine months later , he has the swabians two points behind werder bremen at the top of the bundesliga table .
so what are the reasons for stuttgart 's remarkable recovery ? thomas haid , a sports editor who covers the team for the local stuttgarter zeitung , offered his views . " the team was completely revamped with the addition of six new players in the off-season , " haid told dw-world.de.
" and they 've also succeeded in integrating young players from the amateur ranks into the squad . " gone are petulant divas like striker daniel ljuboja - this season 's team features hard-nosed mexican nationals , ricardo osorio and pavel pardo , and youngsters like sami khediri and serdar tasci . they 're currently riding a four-game winning streak , and that has fans dreaming of stuttgart 's first league title since 1992 .
and much of stuttgart 's success is down to a coach who was initially only an emergency replacement . work that body when armin veh assumed the reins from coaching legend giovanni trappatoni last february , stuttgart was mired in mediocrity - languishing in eighth place with an astonishing 12 draws in 21 games .
few observers thought veh would last long in his new job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motivator armin veh is no longer a stop-gap skipper " there was n't much he could do but limit the damage , " haid said .
" he took over a team in catastrophic physical condition . " stuttgart finished ninth , but veh , who is known as a disciplinarian , was given the chance this year to mould the team in his own image .
the squad is back in shape and has remembered how to win games . tuesday 's victory over hamburg thanks to two goals in the last ten minutes , as well as stuttgart 's stunning comeback from two goals down earlier this season in bremen , speak volumes about the team 's condition . stuttgart have the second-best road record in the bundesliga and have scored more goals than any of their rivals except bremen .
that 's quite a reversal for a team that last season could n't even manage home victories against relegation candidates . go-go gomez it 's an old soccer cliché that in order to win games , you have to score more goals than your opponents , and the man doing that for stuttgart has been mario gomez .
with seven goals and four assists thus far , the 21-striker is having the year of his young career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart players point out a major reason for their success - striker mario gomez veh thinks gomez has earned a shot at playing for germany 's national team .
" i do n't see many german strikers with his quality , " veh said recently .
" if i were the national coach , i 'd try him out . " stuttgart still have some problems to address , if they are to stay on top .
they need to become more consistent at home , and their defense has conceded 16 goals - fifth worst in the league . but if veh and his charges can address those issues , a spot in the champions league is hardly beyond reach .
" it 's a young team that can only improve , " said haid .
" i do n't see any reason why they should n't end up under the top three . " jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no changes at the top of the table werder bremen maintain their overall lead with an away win against nuremberg , while stuttgart keep pace by beating hamburg at home .
but both teams needed a bit of luck .

" the commission was only able to meet with an aide to prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , an official who coelho noted lacked cabinet status and so was unable to answer all the team 's questions . romania has also found itself in the spotlight over alleged prisons .

fewer foreigners have become german citizens in the last five years . while the number of foreigners taking on citizenship across most of germany has fallen in the last half decade , in berlin the number of new citizens started rising again in 2005 due to a citizenship advertising campaign .
unlike other states that are more restrictive , berlin has adopted a quick , straightforward procedure . the city is also using the multicultural atmosphere as a selling point to encourage people to apply for german citizenship . in a bare room of the technical university in berlin , 24-year-old funda gümüsdag is writing math equations on the blackboard and explaining them to a group of youngsters . gümüsdag is a volunteer , giving extra classes twice a week to students with immigrant backgrounds , whilst studying to be a teacher and involving herself in local politics . she also appears on posters all over berlin , together with 14 other non-native germans , trying to convince foreign youngsters of the advantages of taking up german citizenship . naturalization in action gümüsdag said that getting german nationality has given her the chance to become a part of society and also getting the chance to vote . " you are saying to that society : ' hi , i 'm here and i want to go and vote , ' i want to join a party and i want to be able to put my mark on this society , " she said . gümüsdag and her family have been german citizens for 10 years , and she said there were obvious advantages - like not having to worry about visas when traveling and having the opportunity to be involved in political life . the gümüdags had to give up their turkish citizenship , since german law does not allow dual citizenship under normal circumstances . for many people this is seen as rejecting their original citizenship and is like denying their own roots , but for gümüsdag it 's not a problem - she happily celebrates christmas and ramadan . germany : is a ' country of immigration ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : citizenship is seen by some as empowering , for others it means a loss of identity people are only slowly becoming aware of the fact that germany is a country of immigration and that campaigns like the one funda is involved in are a step in the right direction , according to günter piening , berlin 's commissioner for foreigners ' affairs . " the campaign has two aims : berlin wants to increase the number of young people becoming german citizens , but they also want to encourage a debate on the issue of what it means to be german , " piening said . issues of identity are very important for young people , he added . piening has apparently made it easier to become a german by fast-tracking applications .
in other german states , it takes two years for applicants to be granted citizenship , while in berlin all applications have to be dealt with in six months . information about the requirements for naturalization , such as the minimum age and german language skills , are publicized through radio and newspapers ads or visits to schools .
the extra effort berlin puts into promoting naturalization has allowed it to buck the national trend , some say . as germany 's politicians try to encourage foreigners to commit themselves to integration , berlin has shown one way it can be done . michael lawton -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study challenges widely-held notions about islamic headscarf the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .

so what are the reasons for stuttgart 's remarkable recovery ? thomas haid , a sports editor who covers the team for the local stuttgarter zeitung , offered his views . " the team was completely revamped with the addition of six new players in the off-season , " haid told dw-world.de.

the squad is back in shape and has remembered how to win games . tuesday 's victory over hamburg thanks to two goals in the last ten minutes , as well as stuttgart 's stunning comeback from two goals down earlier this season in bremen , speak volumes about the team 's condition . stuttgart have the second-best road record in the bundesliga and have scored more goals than any of their rivals except bremen .
that 's quite a reversal for a team that last season could n't even manage home victories against relegation candidates . go-go gomez it 's an old soccer cliché that in order to win games , you have to score more goals than your opponents , and the man doing that for stuttgart has been mario gomez .

" if i were the national coach , i 'd try him out . " stuttgart still have some problems to address , if they are to stay on top .
they need to become more consistent at home , and their defense has conceded 16 goals - fifth worst in the league . but if veh and his charges can address those issues , a spot in the champions league is hardly beyond reach .

" nowhere have we seen such a lack of willingness to cooperate as in poland , " said carlos coelho , the portuguese member of the european parliament leading the inquiry commission . the 46-nation council of europe 's team of a dozen lawmakers began a round of hearings in poland on wednesday .
it was part of its efforts to shed light on allegations that poland and other european countries were home to secret cia prisons or helped the united states transfer suspects . poland has consistently denied playing host to secret cia prisons . earlier this week , the commission met with polish journalists who have been looking into the allegations , which first surfaced last year . lack of cooperation and withholding information " sometimes i feel that , when dealing with these matters , members of parliament and journalists are confronted with the same kind of difficulties : lack of cooperation and withholding of information , " said coelho . he noted that the commission had been unable to meet polish lawmakers , something it has done elsewhere . he also criticized the " reluctance of the government to offer full cooperation to our investigation and to receive our delegation at an appropriate political level . " the commission was only able to meet with an aide to prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , an official who coelho noted lacked cabinet status and so was unable to answer all the team 's questions . romania has also found itself in the spotlight over alleged prisons .
like poland , the country has become a key us ally since the collapse of communism . " i feel obliged to highlight the difference between the openness and readiness to cooperate we were offered when we went to romania three weeks ago and what we have experienced during our visit to poland , " said coelho . relations likely to become more strained in june , poland 's then prime minister , kazimierz marcinkiewicz , dismissed as " libel " a report issued by the council of europe alleging that poland may have been involved . romania has also denied the allegations contained in the report by swiss lawmaker dick marty , who conceded that he had no formal evidence . in september , us president george w. bush acknowledged that 14 prisoners who were set to be tried had been detained in secret centers abroad but did not say where exactly they were held . the council of europe report also said that britain , germany , italy , spain and sweden may have at least tacitly violated human rights by allegedly allowing the cia to transfer or detain suspected islamist terrorists on their territory . coelho said that the commission of inquiry was set to produce its own draft report by the end of the month . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspected cia abductors identified journalists from german broadcaster ard said they uncovered the identities of three alleged cia pilots who helped to kidnap german citizen khaled el-masri , who was imprisoned in afghanistan .

fewer foreigners have become german citizens in the last five years . while the number of foreigners taking on citizenship across most of germany has fallen in the last half decade , in berlin the number of new citizens started rising again in 2005 due to a citizenship advertising campaign .
unlike other states that are more restrictive , berlin has adopted a quick , straightforward procedure . the city is also using the multicultural atmosphere as a selling point to encourage people to apply for german citizenship . in a bare room of the technical university in berlin , 24-year-old funda gümüsdag is writing math equations on the blackboard and explaining them to a group of youngsters . gümüsdag is a volunteer , giving extra classes twice a week to students with immigrant backgrounds , whilst studying to be a teacher and involving herself in local politics . she also appears on posters all over berlin , together with 14 other non-native germans , trying to convince foreign youngsters of the advantages of taking up german citizenship . naturalization in action gümüsdag said that getting german nationality has given her the chance to become a part of society and also getting the chance to vote . " you are saying to that society : ' hi , i 'm here and i want to go and vote , ' i want to join a party and i want to be able to put my mark on this society , " she said . gümüsdag and her family have been german citizens for 10 years , and she said there were obvious advantages - like not having to worry about visas when traveling and having the opportunity to be involved in political life . the gümüdags had to give up their turkish citizenship , since german law does not allow dual citizenship under normal circumstances . for many people this is seen as rejecting their original citizenship and is like denying their own roots , but for gümüsdag it 's not a problem - she happily celebrates christmas and ramadan . germany : is a ' country of immigration ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : citizenship is seen by some as empowering , for others it means a loss of identity people are only slowly becoming aware of the fact that germany is a country of immigration and that campaigns like the one funda is involved in are a step in the right direction , according to günter piening , berlin 's commissioner for foreigners ' affairs . " the campaign has two aims : berlin wants to increase the number of young people becoming german citizens , but they also want to encourage a debate on the issue of what it means to be german , " piening said . issues of identity are very important for young people , he added . piening has apparently made it easier to become a german by fast-tracking applications .
in other german states , it takes two years for applicants to be granted citizenship , while in berlin all applications have to be dealt with in six months . information about the requirements for naturalization , such as the minimum age and german language skills , are publicized through radio and newspapers ads or visits to schools .
the extra effort berlin puts into promoting naturalization has allowed it to buck the national trend , some say . as germany 's politicians try to encourage foreigners to commit themselves to integration , berlin has shown one way it can be done . michael lawton -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study challenges widely-held notions about islamic headscarf the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .

unlike other states that are more restrictive , berlin has adopted a quick , straightforward procedure . the city is also using the multicultural atmosphere as a selling point to encourage people to apply for german citizenship . in a bare room of the technical university in berlin , 24-year-old funda gümüsdag is writing math equations on the blackboard and explaining them to a group of youngsters . gümüsdag is a volunteer , giving extra classes twice a week to students with immigrant backgrounds , whilst studying to be a teacher and involving herself in local politics . she also appears on posters all over berlin , together with 14 other non-native germans , trying to convince foreign youngsters of the advantages of taking up german citizenship . naturalization in action gümüsdag said that getting german nationality has given her the chance to become a part of society and also getting the chance to vote . " you are saying to that society : ' hi , i 'm here and i want to go and vote , ' i want to join a party and i want to be able to put my mark on this society , " she said . gümüsdag and her family have been german citizens for 10 years , and she said there were obvious advantages - like not having to worry about visas when traveling and having the opportunity to be involved in political life . the gümüdags had to give up their turkish citizenship , since german law does not allow dual citizenship under normal circumstances . for many people this is seen as rejecting their original citizenship and is like denying their own roots , but for gümüsdag it 's not a problem - she happily celebrates christmas and ramadan . germany : is a ' country of immigration ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : citizenship is seen by some as empowering , for others it means a loss of identity people are only slowly becoming aware of the fact that germany is a country of immigration and that campaigns like the one funda is involved in are a step in the right direction , according to günter piening , berlin 's commissioner for foreigners ' affairs . " the campaign has two aims : berlin wants to increase the number of young people becoming german citizens , but they also want to encourage a debate on the issue of what it means to be german , " piening said . issues of identity are very important for young people , he added . piening has apparently made it easier to become a german by fast-tracking applications .
in other german states , it takes two years for applicants to be granted citizenship , while in berlin all applications have to be dealt with in six months . information about the requirements for naturalization , such as the minimum age and german language skills , are publicized through radio and newspapers ads or visits to schools .
the extra effort berlin puts into promoting naturalization has allowed it to buck the national trend , some say . as germany 's politicians try to encourage foreigners to commit themselves to integration , berlin has shown one way it can be done . michael lawton -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study challenges widely-held notions about islamic headscarf the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .

fewer foreigners have become german citizens in the last five years . while the number of foreigners taking on citizenship across most of germany has fallen in the last half decade , in berlin the number of new citizens started rising again in 2005 due to a citizenship advertising campaign .
unlike other states that are more restrictive , berlin has adopted a quick , straightforward procedure . the city is also using the multicultural atmosphere as a selling point to encourage people to apply for german citizenship . in a bare room of the technical university in berlin , 24-year-old funda gümüsdag is writing math equations on the blackboard and explaining them to a group of youngsters . gümüsdag is a volunteer , giving extra classes twice a week to students with immigrant backgrounds , whilst studying to be a teacher and involving herself in local politics . she also appears on posters all over berlin , together with 14 other non-native germans , trying to convince foreign youngsters of the advantages of taking up german citizenship . naturalization in action gümüsdag said that getting german nationality has given her the chance to become a part of society and also getting the chance to vote . " you are saying to that society : ' hi , i 'm here and i want to go and vote , ' i want to join a party and i want to be able to put my mark on this society , " she said . gümüsdag and her family have been german citizens for 10 years , and she said there were obvious advantages - like not having to worry about visas when traveling and having the opportunity to be involved in political life . the gümüdags had to give up their turkish citizenship , since german law does not allow dual citizenship under normal circumstances . for many people this is seen as rejecting their original citizenship and is like denying their own roots , but for gümüsdag it 's not a problem - she happily celebrates christmas and ramadan . germany : is a ' country of immigration ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : citizenship is seen by some as empowering , for others it means a loss of identity people are only slowly becoming aware of the fact that germany is a country of immigration and that campaigns like the one funda is involved in are a step in the right direction , according to günter piening , berlin 's commissioner for foreigners ' affairs . " the campaign has two aims : berlin wants to increase the number of young people becoming german citizens , but they also want to encourage a debate on the issue of what it means to be german , " piening said . issues of identity are very important for young people , he added . piening has apparently made it easier to become a german by fast-tracking applications .
in other german states , it takes two years for applicants to be granted citizenship , while in berlin all applications have to be dealt with in six months . information about the requirements for naturalization , such as the minimum age and german language skills , are publicized through radio and newspapers ads or visits to schools .
the extra effort berlin puts into promoting naturalization has allowed it to buck the national trend , some say . as germany 's politicians try to encourage foreigners to commit themselves to integration , berlin has shown one way it can be done . michael lawton -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study challenges widely-held notions about islamic headscarf the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .

that 's down a coach , a hot striker and a new team spirit . armin veh was only hired at stuttgart last february as an " interim solution " for a team that had thoroughly disappointed expectations .
nine months later , he has the swabians two points behind werder bremen at the top of the bundesliga table .
so what are the reasons for stuttgart 's remarkable recovery ? thomas haid , a sports editor who covers the team for the local stuttgarter zeitung , offered his views . " the team was completely revamped with the addition of six new players in the off-season , " haid told dw-world.de.
" and they 've also succeeded in integrating young players from the amateur ranks into the squad . " gone are petulant divas like striker daniel ljuboja - this season 's team features hard-nosed mexican nationals , ricardo osorio and pavel pardo , and youngsters like sami khediri and serdar tasci . they 're currently riding a four-game winning streak , and that has fans dreaming of stuttgart 's first league title since 1992 .
and much of stuttgart 's success is down to a coach who was initially only an emergency replacement . work that body when armin veh assumed the reins from coaching legend giovanni trappatoni last february , stuttgart was mired in mediocrity - languishing in eighth place with an astonishing 12 draws in 21 games .
few observers thought veh would last long in his new job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motivator armin veh is no longer a stop-gap skipper " there was n't much he could do but limit the damage , " haid said .
" he took over a team in catastrophic physical condition . " stuttgart finished ninth , but veh , who is known as a disciplinarian , was given the chance this year to mould the team in his own image .
the squad is back in shape and has remembered how to win games . tuesday 's victory over hamburg thanks to two goals in the last ten minutes , as well as stuttgart 's stunning comeback from two goals down earlier this season in bremen , speak volumes about the team 's condition . stuttgart have the second-best road record in the bundesliga and have scored more goals than any of their rivals except bremen .
that 's quite a reversal for a team that last season could n't even manage home victories against relegation candidates . go-go gomez it 's an old soccer cliché that in order to win games , you have to score more goals than your opponents , and the man doing that for stuttgart has been mario gomez .
with seven goals and four assists thus far , the 21-striker is having the year of his young career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart players point out a major reason for their success - striker mario gomez veh thinks gomez has earned a shot at playing for germany 's national team .
" i do n't see many german strikers with his quality , " veh said recently .
" if i were the national coach , i 'd try him out . " stuttgart still have some problems to address , if they are to stay on top .
they need to become more consistent at home , and their defense has conceded 16 goals - fifth worst in the league . but if veh and his charges can address those issues , a spot in the champions league is hardly beyond reach .
" it 's a young team that can only improve , " said haid .
" i do n't see any reason why they should n't end up under the top three .

opponents earlier failed to prevent the npd from using the berlin hall for its party congress this weekend . " we want to show clearly that our society , in its immense majority , does n't want neo-fascism and neo-nazis , " said walter momper , a social democrat and speaker of the regional berlin parliament and a former mayor of the german capital .
jewish leader thanked crowd berlin jewish community leader gideon joffe also thanked the demonstrators for coming out in numbers " to show the npd what we think of them " - even though the rally was far smaller than initially expected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police were prepared for clashes between the neo-nazis and protesters so far , the npd has secured seats in two regional parliaments - including in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania where chancellor angela merkel 's constituency is located .

dw-world.de spoke with erwin wickert , the editor of his diaries . german author and diplomat erwin wickert , the 91-year-old editor of the diaries " john rabe : the good german of nanking , " talked to dw-world.de about rabe , whom he first met in 1936 .
wickert is a novelist , author of numerous books on east asia and a former ambassador to china . dw-world.de : how did you meet john rabe ?
erwin wickert : i was a hobo , a bum looking for adventure , had been a german exchange student at dickinson college in pennsylvania , and wanted to take the pacific route to east asia .
when i arrived in china , i was 21 and broke - it was difficult arranging money transfers from germany in 1936 .
i was hoping to find other germans i could stay with , and was referred to rabe and his wife dora , who generously took me into their home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wickert , now 91 , was rabe 's guest in 1936 rabe had joined the nazi party in 1934 , yet he opened his home to strangers - to you and to hundreds of chinese fleeing japanese soldiers .
what kind of a man was rabe ? in hitler 's time , there were three types of germans : the nazis , the intelligentsia and the decent germans .
it was possible to belong to two of the categories , but not all three .
rabe was clearly honorable and he was a nazi in name .
he had no idea about hitler and had only heard good things .
remember , rabe had spent decades in china .
he had only been in germany briefly in 1928 during a time when the nazis were an unknown entity . still , he read german and english newspapers in china , and there were so many jewish emigrés who suddenly started arriving in shanghai and elsewhere .
he should have given more weight to the testimonies of the jews , but rabe was absolutely not anti-semitic .
not a single anti-semitic reference could be found in his diaries . in nanking , the americans and brits thought he must have been high up , because he boasted about being a nazi member and firing off a telegram to hitler .
he was n't .
to many germans abroad , being a nazi did n't mean anything .
they needed to join the party to further their careers or to achieve certain goals .
rabe had joined in 1934 , because he wanted to open up a german school for the locals . he had certainly used his nazi credentials to shelter the chinese .
the japanese soldiers , many of them very young , went on a rampage , killing civilians in every way imaginable .
why did they suddenly stop at rabe 's door in the international security zone ? he bluffed a lot , and even worried about how long he could continue bluffing .
he showed them his nazi badge .
they must have thought that hitler was around the corner .
one soldier was in the middle of raping a woman and rabe simply shouted , pointed to his swastika , and sent the soldier back over the fence .
he had no weapons , but the japanese knew he was german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you worked for the german foreign service in shanghai during the war , and then you were posted as a radio attaché to tokyo , where you stayed until shortly after the japanese surrender .
having witnessed japanese aggression in china , how did that make you feel about japan ? the japanese are difficult to understand .
many could not admit that their own countrymen committed such atrocities , but they wanted to know about it .
the rabe diaries were published in japan , and the book was enormously successful .
probably because it was a day-to-day account of what happened , and it did not condemn the japanese as a people . there was one chapter of the rabe diaries that appeared in german , but was dropped by the american publisher and never translated into english .
i describe the bestialities that were committed in the name of imperial japan as part of the human condition .
perhaps rabe summed it up best , " there is good and evil in every nation .

dw-world.de spoke with erwin wickert , the editor of his diaries . german author and diplomat erwin wickert , the 91-year-old editor of the diaries " john rabe : the good german of nanking , " talked to dw-world.de about rabe , whom he first met in 1936 .
wickert is a novelist , author of numerous books on east asia and a former ambassador to china . dw-world.de : how did you meet john rabe ?
erwin wickert : i was a hobo , a bum looking for adventure , had been a german exchange student at dickinson college in pennsylvania , and wanted to take the pacific route to east asia .
when i arrived in china , i was 21 and broke - it was difficult arranging money transfers from germany in 1936 .
i was hoping to find other germans i could stay with , and was referred to rabe and his wife dora , who generously took me into their home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wickert , now 91 , was rabe 's guest in 1936 rabe had joined the nazi party in 1934 , yet he opened his home to strangers - to you and to hundreds of chinese fleeing japanese soldiers .
what kind of a man was rabe ? in hitler 's time , there were three types of germans : the nazis , the intelligentsia and the decent germans .
it was possible to belong to two of the categories , but not all three .
rabe was clearly honorable and he was a nazi in name .
he had no idea about hitler and had only heard good things .
remember , rabe had spent decades in china .
he had only been in germany briefly in 1928 during a time when the nazis were an unknown entity . still , he read german and english newspapers in china , and there were so many jewish emigrés who suddenly started arriving in shanghai and elsewhere .
he should have given more weight to the testimonies of the jews , but rabe was absolutely not anti-semitic .
not a single anti-semitic reference could be found in his diaries . in nanking , the americans and brits thought he must have been high up , because he boasted about being a nazi member and firing off a telegram to hitler .
he was n't .
to many germans abroad , being a nazi did n't mean anything .
they needed to join the party to further their careers or to achieve certain goals .
rabe had joined in 1934 , because he wanted to open up a german school for the locals . he had certainly used his nazi credentials to shelter the chinese .
the japanese soldiers , many of them very young , went on a rampage , killing civilians in every way imaginable .
why did they suddenly stop at rabe 's door in the international security zone ? he bluffed a lot , and even worried about how long he could continue bluffing .
he showed them his nazi badge .
they must have thought that hitler was around the corner .
one soldier was in the middle of raping a woman and rabe simply shouted , pointed to his swastika , and sent the soldier back over the fence .
he had no weapons , but the japanese knew he was german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you worked for the german foreign service in shanghai during the war , and then you were posted as a radio attaché to tokyo , where you stayed until shortly after the japanese surrender .
having witnessed japanese aggression in china , how did that make you feel about japan ? the japanese are difficult to understand .
many could not admit that their own countrymen committed such atrocities , but they wanted to know about it .
the rabe diaries were published in japan , and the book was enormously successful .
probably because it was a day-to-day account of what happened , and it did not condemn the japanese as a people . there was one chapter of the rabe diaries that appeared in german , but was dropped by the american publisher and never translated into english .
i describe the bestialities that were committed in the name of imperial japan as part of the human condition .
perhaps rabe summed it up best , " there is good and evil in every nation .

in war unfortunately , criminality always rises to the surface .

" nowhere have we seen such a lack of willingness to cooperate as in poland , " said carlos coelho , the portuguese member of the european parliament leading the inquiry commission . the 46-nation council of europe 's team of a dozen lawmakers began a round of hearings in poland on wednesday .
it was part of its efforts to shed light on allegations that poland and other european countries were home to secret cia prisons or helped the united states transfer suspects . poland has consistently denied playing host to secret cia prisons . earlier this week , the commission met with polish journalists who have been looking into the allegations , which first surfaced last year . lack of cooperation and withholding information " sometimes i feel that , when dealing with these matters , members of parliament and journalists are confronted with the same kind of difficulties : lack of cooperation and withholding of information , " said coelho . he noted that the commission had been unable to meet polish lawmakers , something it has done elsewhere . he also criticized the " reluctance of the government to offer full cooperation to our investigation and to receive our delegation at an appropriate political level . " the commission was only able to meet with an aide to prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , an official who coelho noted lacked cabinet status and so was unable to answer all the team 's questions . romania has also found itself in the spotlight over alleged prisons .
like poland , the country has become a key us ally since the collapse of communism . " i feel obliged to highlight the difference between the openness and readiness to cooperate we were offered when we went to romania three weeks ago and what we have experienced during our visit to poland , " said coelho . relations likely to become more strained in june , poland 's then prime minister , kazimierz marcinkiewicz , dismissed as " libel " a report issued by the council of europe alleging that poland may have been involved . romania has also denied the allegations contained in the report by swiss lawmaker dick marty , who conceded that he had no formal evidence . in september , us president george w. bush acknowledged that 14 prisoners who were set to be tried had been detained in secret centers abroad but did not say where exactly they were held . the council of europe report also said that britain , germany , italy , spain and sweden may have at least tacitly violated human rights by allegedly allowing the cia to transfer or detain suspected islamist terrorists on their territory . coelho said that the commission of inquiry was set to produce its own draft report by the end of the month . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspected cia abductors identified journalists from german broadcaster ard said they uncovered the identities of three alleged cia pilots who helped to kidnap german citizen khaled el-masri , who was imprisoned in afghanistan .

dw-world.de spoke with erwin wickert , the editor of his diaries . german author and diplomat erwin wickert , the 91-year-old editor of the diaries " john rabe : the good german of nanking , " talked to dw-world.de about rabe , whom he first met in 1936 .
wickert is a novelist , author of numerous books on east asia and a former ambassador to china . dw-world.de : how did you meet john rabe ?
erwin wickert : i was a hobo , a bum looking for adventure , had been a german exchange student at dickinson college in pennsylvania , and wanted to take the pacific route to east asia .
when i arrived in china , i was 21 and broke - it was difficult arranging money transfers from germany in 1936 .
i was hoping to find other germans i could stay with , and was referred to rabe and his wife dora , who generously took me into their home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wickert , now 91 , was rabe 's guest in 1936 rabe had joined the nazi party in 1934 , yet he opened his home to strangers - to you and to hundreds of chinese fleeing japanese soldiers .
what kind of a man was rabe ? in hitler 's time , there were three types of germans : the nazis , the intelligentsia and the decent germans .
it was possible to belong to two of the categories , but not all three .
rabe was clearly honorable and he was a nazi in name .
he had no idea about hitler and had only heard good things .
remember , rabe had spent decades in china .
he had only been in germany briefly in 1928 during a time when the nazis were an unknown entity . still , he read german and english newspapers in china , and there were so many jewish emigrés who suddenly started arriving in shanghai and elsewhere .
he should have given more weight to the testimonies of the jews , but rabe was absolutely not anti-semitic .
not a single anti-semitic reference could be found in his diaries . in nanking , the americans and brits thought he must have been high up , because he boasted about being a nazi member and firing off a telegram to hitler .
he was n't .
to many germans abroad , being a nazi did n't mean anything .
they needed to join the party to further their careers or to achieve certain goals .
rabe had joined in 1934 , because he wanted to open up a german school for the locals . he had certainly used his nazi credentials to shelter the chinese .
the japanese soldiers , many of them very young , went on a rampage , killing civilians in every way imaginable .
why did they suddenly stop at rabe 's door in the international security zone ? he bluffed a lot , and even worried about how long he could continue bluffing .
he showed them his nazi badge .
they must have thought that hitler was around the corner .
one soldier was in the middle of raping a woman and rabe simply shouted , pointed to his swastika , and sent the soldier back over the fence .
he had no weapons , but the japanese knew he was german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you worked for the german foreign service in shanghai during the war , and then you were posted as a radio attaché to tokyo , where you stayed until shortly after the japanese surrender .
having witnessed japanese aggression in china , how did that make you feel about japan ? the japanese are difficult to understand .
many could not admit that their own countrymen committed such atrocities , but they wanted to know about it .
the rabe diaries were published in japan , and the book was enormously successful .
probably because it was a day-to-day account of what happened , and it did not condemn the japanese as a people . there was one chapter of the rabe diaries that appeared in german , but was dropped by the american publisher and never translated into english .
i describe the bestialities that were committed in the name of imperial japan as part of the human condition .
perhaps rabe summed it up best , " there is good and evil in every nation .
the brave and the criminal .
in war unfortunately , criminality always rises to the surface .

fewer foreigners have become german citizens in the last five years . while the number of foreigners taking on citizenship across most of germany has fallen in the last half decade , in berlin the number of new citizens started rising again in 2005 due to a citizenship advertising campaign .
unlike other states that are more restrictive , berlin has adopted a quick , straightforward procedure . the city is also using the multicultural atmosphere as a selling point to encourage people to apply for german citizenship . in a bare room of the technical university in berlin , 24-year-old funda gümüsdag is writing math equations on the blackboard and explaining them to a group of youngsters . gümüsdag is a volunteer , giving extra classes twice a week to students with immigrant backgrounds , whilst studying to be a teacher and involving herself in local politics . she also appears on posters all over berlin , together with 14 other non-native germans , trying to convince foreign youngsters of the advantages of taking up german citizenship . naturalization in action gümüsdag said that getting german nationality has given her the chance to become a part of society and also getting the chance to vote . " you are saying to that society : ' hi , i 'm here and i want to go and vote , ' i want to join a party and i want to be able to put my mark on this society , " she said . gümüsdag and her family have been german citizens for 10 years , and she said there were obvious advantages - like not having to worry about visas when traveling and having the opportunity to be involved in political life . the gümüdags had to give up their turkish citizenship , since german law does not allow dual citizenship under normal circumstances . for many people this is seen as rejecting their original citizenship and is like denying their own roots , but for gümüsdag it 's not a problem - she happily celebrates christmas and ramadan . germany : is a ' country of immigration ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : citizenship is seen by some as empowering , for others it means a loss of identity people are only slowly becoming aware of the fact that germany is a country of immigration and that campaigns like the one funda is involved in are a step in the right direction , according to günter piening , berlin 's commissioner for foreigners ' affairs . " the campaign has two aims : berlin wants to increase the number of young people becoming german citizens , but they also want to encourage a debate on the issue of what it means to be german , " piening said . issues of identity are very important for young people , he added . piening has apparently made it easier to become a german by fast-tracking applications .
in other german states , it takes two years for applicants to be granted citizenship , while in berlin all applications have to be dealt with in six months . information about the requirements for naturalization , such as the minimum age and german language skills , are publicized through radio and newspapers ads or visits to schools .
the extra effort berlin puts into promoting naturalization has allowed it to buck the national trend , some say . as germany 's politicians try to encourage foreigners to commit themselves to integration , berlin has shown one way it can be done . michael lawton -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study challenges widely-held notions about islamic headscarf the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .

the squad is back in shape and has remembered how to win games . tuesday 's victory over hamburg thanks to two goals in the last ten minutes , as well as stuttgart 's stunning comeback from two goals down earlier this season in bremen , speak volumes about the team 's condition . stuttgart have the second-best road record in the bundesliga and have scored more goals than any of their rivals except bremen .
that 's quite a reversal for a team that last season could n't even manage home victories against relegation candidates . go-go gomez it 's an old soccer cliché that in order to win games , you have to score more goals than your opponents , and the man doing that for stuttgart has been mario gomez .

that 's down a coach , a hot striker and a new team spirit . armin veh was only hired at stuttgart last february as an " interim solution " for a team that had thoroughly disappointed expectations .
nine months later , he has the swabians two points behind werder bremen at the top of the bundesliga table .
so what are the reasons for stuttgart 's remarkable recovery ? thomas haid , a sports editor who covers the team for the local stuttgarter zeitung , offered his views . " the team was completely revamped with the addition of six new players in the off-season , " haid told dw-world.de.
" and they 've also succeeded in integrating young players from the amateur ranks into the squad . " gone are petulant divas like striker daniel ljuboja - this season 's team features hard-nosed mexican nationals , ricardo osorio and pavel pardo , and youngsters like sami khediri and serdar tasci . they 're currently riding a four-game winning streak , and that has fans dreaming of stuttgart 's first league title since 1992 .
and much of stuttgart 's success is down to a coach who was initially only an emergency replacement . work that body when armin veh assumed the reins from coaching legend giovanni trappatoni last february , stuttgart was mired in mediocrity - languishing in eighth place with an astonishing 12 draws in 21 games .
few observers thought veh would last long in his new job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motivator armin veh is no longer a stop-gap skipper " there was n't much he could do but limit the damage , " haid said .
" he took over a team in catastrophic physical condition . " stuttgart finished ninth , but veh , who is known as a disciplinarian , was given the chance this year to mould the team in his own image .
the squad is back in shape and has remembered how to win games . tuesday 's victory over hamburg thanks to two goals in the last ten minutes , as well as stuttgart 's stunning comeback from two goals down earlier this season in bremen , speak volumes about the team 's condition . stuttgart have the second-best road record in the bundesliga and have scored more goals than any of their rivals except bremen .
that 's quite a reversal for a team that last season could n't even manage home victories against relegation candidates . go-go gomez it 's an old soccer cliché that in order to win games , you have to score more goals than your opponents , and the man doing that for stuttgart has been mario gomez .
with seven goals and four assists thus far , the 21-striker is having the year of his young career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart players point out a major reason for their success - striker mario gomez veh thinks gomez has earned a shot at playing for germany 's national team .
" i do n't see many german strikers with his quality , " veh said recently .
" if i were the national coach , i 'd try him out . " stuttgart still have some problems to address , if they are to stay on top .
they need to become more consistent at home , and their defense has conceded 16 goals - fifth worst in the league . but if veh and his charges can address those issues , a spot in the champions league is hardly beyond reach .
" it 's a young team that can only improve , " said haid .
" i do n't see any reason why they should n't end up under the top three .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 11.11.2006 " there is good and evil in every nation " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though a nazi party member , rabe , third from left , rescued chinese from death john rabe , a german businessman saved thousands of chinese from japanese soldiers during wwii .
dw-world.de spoke with erwin wickert , the editor of his diaries . german author and diplomat erwin wickert , the 91-year-old editor of the diaries " john rabe : the good german of nanking , " talked to dw-world.de about rabe , whom he first met in 1936 .
wickert is a novelist , author of numerous books on east asia and a former ambassador to china . dw-world.de : how did you meet john rabe ?
erwin wickert : i was a hobo , a bum looking for adventure , had been a german exchange student at dickinson college in pennsylvania , and wanted to take the pacific route to east asia .
when i arrived in china , i was 21 and broke - it was difficult arranging money transfers from germany in 1936 .
i was hoping to find other germans i could stay with , and was referred to rabe and his wife dora , who generously took me into their home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wickert , now 91 , was rabe 's guest in 1936 rabe had joined the nazi party in 1934 , yet he opened his home to strangers - to you and to hundreds of chinese fleeing japanese soldiers .
what kind of a man was rabe ? in hitler 's time , there were three types of germans : the nazis , the intelligentsia and the decent germans .
it was possible to belong to two of the categories , but not all three .
rabe was clearly honorable and he was a nazi in name .
he had no idea about hitler and had only heard good things .
remember , rabe had spent decades in china .
he had only been in germany briefly in 1928 during a time when the nazis were an unknown entity . still , he read german and english newspapers in china , and there were so many jewish emigrés who suddenly started arriving in shanghai and elsewhere .
he should have given more weight to the testimonies of the jews , but rabe was absolutely not anti-semitic .
not a single anti-semitic reference could be found in his diaries . in nanking , the americans and brits thought he must have been high up , because he boasted about being a nazi member and firing off a telegram to hitler .
he was n't .
to many germans abroad , being a nazi did n't mean anything .
they needed to join the party to further their careers or to achieve certain goals .
rabe had joined in 1934 , because he wanted to open up a german school for the locals . he had certainly used his nazi credentials to shelter the chinese .
the japanese soldiers , many of them very young , went on a rampage , killing civilians in every way imaginable .
why did they suddenly stop at rabe 's door in the international security zone ? he bluffed a lot , and even worried about how long he could continue bluffing .
he showed them his nazi badge .
they must have thought that hitler was around the corner .
one soldier was in the middle of raping a woman and rabe simply shouted , pointed to his swastika , and sent the soldier back over the fence .
he had no weapons , but the japanese knew he was german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you worked for the german foreign service in shanghai during the war , and then you were posted as a radio attaché to tokyo , where you stayed until shortly after the japanese surrender .
having witnessed japanese aggression in china , how did that make you feel about japan ? the japanese are difficult to understand .
many could not admit that their own countrymen committed such atrocities , but they wanted to know about it .
the rabe diaries were published in japan , and the book was enormously successful .
probably because it was a day-to-day account of what happened , and it did not condemn the japanese as a people . there was one chapter of the rabe diaries that appeared in german , but was dropped by the american publisher and never translated into english .
i describe the bestialities that were committed in the name of imperial japan as part of the human condition .
perhaps rabe summed it up best , " there is good and evil in every nation .
the brave and the criminal .
in war unfortunately , criminality always rises to the surface .

dw-world.de spoke with erwin wickert , the editor of his diaries . german author and diplomat erwin wickert , the 91-year-old editor of the diaries " john rabe : the good german of nanking , " talked to dw-world.de about rabe , whom he first met in 1936 .
wickert is a novelist , author of numerous books on east asia and a former ambassador to china . dw-world.de : how did you meet john rabe ?
erwin wickert : i was a hobo , a bum looking for adventure , had been a german exchange student at dickinson college in pennsylvania , and wanted to take the pacific route to east asia .
when i arrived in china , i was 21 and broke - it was difficult arranging money transfers from germany in 1936 .
i was hoping to find other germans i could stay with , and was referred to rabe and his wife dora , who generously took me into their home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wickert , now 91 , was rabe 's guest in 1936 rabe had joined the nazi party in 1934 , yet he opened his home to strangers - to you and to hundreds of chinese fleeing japanese soldiers .
what kind of a man was rabe ? in hitler 's time , there were three types of germans : the nazis , the intelligentsia and the decent germans .
it was possible to belong to two of the categories , but not all three .
rabe was clearly honorable and he was a nazi in name .
he had no idea about hitler and had only heard good things .
remember , rabe had spent decades in china .
he had only been in germany briefly in 1928 during a time when the nazis were an unknown entity . still , he read german and english newspapers in china , and there were so many jewish emigrés who suddenly started arriving in shanghai and elsewhere .
he should have given more weight to the testimonies of the jews , but rabe was absolutely not anti-semitic .
not a single anti-semitic reference could be found in his diaries . in nanking , the americans and brits thought he must have been high up , because he boasted about being a nazi member and firing off a telegram to hitler .
he was n't .
to many germans abroad , being a nazi did n't mean anything .
they needed to join the party to further their careers or to achieve certain goals .
rabe had joined in 1934 , because he wanted to open up a german school for the locals . he had certainly used his nazi credentials to shelter the chinese .
the japanese soldiers , many of them very young , went on a rampage , killing civilians in every way imaginable .
why did they suddenly stop at rabe 's door in the international security zone ? he bluffed a lot , and even worried about how long he could continue bluffing .
he showed them his nazi badge .
they must have thought that hitler was around the corner .
one soldier was in the middle of raping a woman and rabe simply shouted , pointed to his swastika , and sent the soldier back over the fence .
he had no weapons , but the japanese knew he was german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you worked for the german foreign service in shanghai during the war , and then you were posted as a radio attaché to tokyo , where you stayed until shortly after the japanese surrender .
having witnessed japanese aggression in china , how did that make you feel about japan ? the japanese are difficult to understand .
many could not admit that their own countrymen committed such atrocities , but they wanted to know about it .
the rabe diaries were published in japan , and the book was enormously successful .
probably because it was a day-to-day account of what happened , and it did not condemn the japanese as a people . there was one chapter of the rabe diaries that appeared in german , but was dropped by the american publisher and never translated into english .
i describe the bestialities that were committed in the name of imperial japan as part of the human condition .
perhaps rabe summed it up best , " there is good and evil in every nation .
the brave and the criminal .
in war unfortunately , criminality always rises to the surface .

fewer foreigners have become german citizens in the last five years . while the number of foreigners taking on citizenship across most of germany has fallen in the last half decade , in berlin the number of new citizens started rising again in 2005 due to a citizenship advertising campaign .
unlike other states that are more restrictive , berlin has adopted a quick , straightforward procedure . the city is also using the multicultural atmosphere as a selling point to encourage people to apply for german citizenship . in a bare room of the technical university in berlin , 24-year-old funda gümüsdag is writing math equations on the blackboard and explaining them to a group of youngsters . gümüsdag is a volunteer , giving extra classes twice a week to students with immigrant backgrounds , whilst studying to be a teacher and involving herself in local politics . she also appears on posters all over berlin , together with 14 other non-native germans , trying to convince foreign youngsters of the advantages of taking up german citizenship . naturalization in action gümüsdag said that getting german nationality has given her the chance to become a part of society and also getting the chance to vote . " you are saying to that society : ' hi , i 'm here and i want to go and vote , ' i want to join a party and i want to be able to put my mark on this society , " she said . gümüsdag and her family have been german citizens for 10 years , and she said there were obvious advantages - like not having to worry about visas when traveling and having the opportunity to be involved in political life . the gümüdags had to give up their turkish citizenship , since german law does not allow dual citizenship under normal circumstances . for many people this is seen as rejecting their original citizenship and is like denying their own roots , but for gümüsdag it 's not a problem - she happily celebrates christmas and ramadan . germany : is a ' country of immigration ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : citizenship is seen by some as empowering , for others it means a loss of identity people are only slowly becoming aware of the fact that germany is a country of immigration and that campaigns like the one funda is involved in are a step in the right direction , according to günter piening , berlin 's commissioner for foreigners ' affairs . " the campaign has two aims : berlin wants to increase the number of young people becoming german citizens , but they also want to encourage a debate on the issue of what it means to be german , " piening said . issues of identity are very important for young people , he added . piening has apparently made it easier to become a german by fast-tracking applications .
in other german states , it takes two years for applicants to be granted citizenship , while in berlin all applications have to be dealt with in six months . information about the requirements for naturalization , such as the minimum age and german language skills , are publicized through radio and newspapers ads or visits to schools .
the extra effort berlin puts into promoting naturalization has allowed it to buck the national trend , some say . as germany 's politicians try to encourage foreigners to commit themselves to integration , berlin has shown one way it can be done . michael lawton -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study challenges widely-held notions about islamic headscarf the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .

dw-world.de spoke with erwin wickert , the editor of his diaries . german author and diplomat erwin wickert , the 91-year-old editor of the diaries " john rabe : the good german of nanking , " talked to dw-world.de about rabe , whom he first met in 1936 .
wickert is a novelist , author of numerous books on east asia and a former ambassador to china . dw-world.de : how did you meet john rabe ?
erwin wickert : i was a hobo , a bum looking for adventure , had been a german exchange student at dickinson college in pennsylvania , and wanted to take the pacific route to east asia .
when i arrived in china , i was 21 and broke - it was difficult arranging money transfers from germany in 1936 .
i was hoping to find other germans i could stay with , and was referred to rabe and his wife dora , who generously took me into their home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wickert , now 91 , was rabe 's guest in 1936 rabe had joined the nazi party in 1934 , yet he opened his home to strangers - to you and to hundreds of chinese fleeing japanese soldiers .
what kind of a man was rabe ? in hitler 's time , there were three types of germans : the nazis , the intelligentsia and the decent germans .
it was possible to belong to two of the categories , but not all three .
rabe was clearly honorable and he was a nazi in name .
he had no idea about hitler and had only heard good things .
remember , rabe had spent decades in china .
he had only been in germany briefly in 1928 during a time when the nazis were an unknown entity . still , he read german and english newspapers in china , and there were so many jewish emigrés who suddenly started arriving in shanghai and elsewhere .
he should have given more weight to the testimonies of the jews , but rabe was absolutely not anti-semitic .
not a single anti-semitic reference could be found in his diaries . in nanking , the americans and brits thought he must have been high up , because he boasted about being a nazi member and firing off a telegram to hitler .
he was n't .
to many germans abroad , being a nazi did n't mean anything .
they needed to join the party to further their careers or to achieve certain goals .
rabe had joined in 1934 , because he wanted to open up a german school for the locals . he had certainly used his nazi credentials to shelter the chinese .
the japanese soldiers , many of them very young , went on a rampage , killing civilians in every way imaginable .
why did they suddenly stop at rabe 's door in the international security zone ? he bluffed a lot , and even worried about how long he could continue bluffing .
he showed them his nazi badge .
they must have thought that hitler was around the corner .
one soldier was in the middle of raping a woman and rabe simply shouted , pointed to his swastika , and sent the soldier back over the fence .
he had no weapons , but the japanese knew he was german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you worked for the german foreign service in shanghai during the war , and then you were posted as a radio attaché to tokyo , where you stayed until shortly after the japanese surrender .
having witnessed japanese aggression in china , how did that make you feel about japan ? the japanese are difficult to understand .
many could not admit that their own countrymen committed such atrocities , but they wanted to know about it .
the rabe diaries were published in japan , and the book was enormously successful .
probably because it was a day-to-day account of what happened , and it did not condemn the japanese as a people . there was one chapter of the rabe diaries that appeared in german , but was dropped by the american publisher and never translated into english .
i describe the bestialities that were committed in the name of imperial japan as part of the human condition .

dw-world.de spoke with erwin wickert , the editor of his diaries . german author and diplomat erwin wickert , the 91-year-old editor of the diaries " john rabe : the good german of nanking , " talked to dw-world.de about rabe , whom he first met in 1936 .
wickert is a novelist , author of numerous books on east asia and a former ambassador to china . dw-world.de : how did you meet john rabe ?
erwin wickert : i was a hobo , a bum looking for adventure , had been a german exchange student at dickinson college in pennsylvania , and wanted to take the pacific route to east asia .
when i arrived in china , i was 21 and broke - it was difficult arranging money transfers from germany in 1936 .
i was hoping to find other germans i could stay with , and was referred to rabe and his wife dora , who generously took me into their home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wickert , now 91 , was rabe 's guest in 1936 rabe had joined the nazi party in 1934 , yet he opened his home to strangers - to you and to hundreds of chinese fleeing japanese soldiers .
what kind of a man was rabe ? in hitler 's time , there were three types of germans : the nazis , the intelligentsia and the decent germans .
it was possible to belong to two of the categories , but not all three .
rabe was clearly honorable and he was a nazi in name .
he had no idea about hitler and had only heard good things .
remember , rabe had spent decades in china .
he had only been in germany briefly in 1928 during a time when the nazis were an unknown entity . still , he read german and english newspapers in china , and there were so many jewish emigrés who suddenly started arriving in shanghai and elsewhere .
he should have given more weight to the testimonies of the jews , but rabe was absolutely not anti-semitic .
not a single anti-semitic reference could be found in his diaries . in nanking , the americans and brits thought he must have been high up , because he boasted about being a nazi member and firing off a telegram to hitler .
he was n't .
to many germans abroad , being a nazi did n't mean anything .
they needed to join the party to further their careers or to achieve certain goals .
rabe had joined in 1934 , because he wanted to open up a german school for the locals . he had certainly used his nazi credentials to shelter the chinese .
the japanese soldiers , many of them very young , went on a rampage , killing civilians in every way imaginable .
why did they suddenly stop at rabe 's door in the international security zone ? he bluffed a lot , and even worried about how long he could continue bluffing .
he showed them his nazi badge .
they must have thought that hitler was around the corner .
one soldier was in the middle of raping a woman and rabe simply shouted , pointed to his swastika , and sent the soldier back over the fence .
he had no weapons , but the japanese knew he was german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you worked for the german foreign service in shanghai during the war , and then you were posted as a radio attaché to tokyo , where you stayed until shortly after the japanese surrender .
having witnessed japanese aggression in china , how did that make you feel about japan ? the japanese are difficult to understand .
many could not admit that their own countrymen committed such atrocities , but they wanted to know about it .
the rabe diaries were published in japan , and the book was enormously successful .
probably because it was a day-to-day account of what happened , and it did not condemn the japanese as a people . there was one chapter of the rabe diaries that appeared in german , but was dropped by the american publisher and never translated into english .
i describe the bestialities that were committed in the name of imperial japan as part of the human condition .

that 's down a coach , a hot striker and a new team spirit . armin veh was only hired at stuttgart last february as an " interim solution " for a team that had thoroughly disappointed expectations .
nine months later , he has the swabians two points behind werder bremen at the top of the bundesliga table .
so what are the reasons for stuttgart 's remarkable recovery ? thomas haid , a sports editor who covers the team for the local stuttgarter zeitung , offered his views . " the team was completely revamped with the addition of six new players in the off-season , " haid told dw-world.de.
" and they 've also succeeded in integrating young players from the amateur ranks into the squad .

and much of stuttgart 's success is down to a coach who was initially only an emergency replacement . work that body when armin veh assumed the reins from coaching legend giovanni trappatoni last february , stuttgart was mired in mediocrity - languishing in eighth place with an astonishing 12 draws in 21 games .

" he took over a team in catastrophic physical condition . " stuttgart finished ninth , but veh , who is known as a disciplinarian , was given the chance this year to mould the team in his own image .
the squad is back in shape and has remembered how to win games . tuesday 's victory over hamburg thanks to two goals in the last ten minutes , as well as stuttgart 's stunning comeback from two goals down earlier this season in bremen , speak volumes about the team 's condition . stuttgart have the second-best road record in the bundesliga and have scored more goals than any of their rivals except bremen .
that 's quite a reversal for a team that last season could n't even manage home victories against relegation candidates . go-go gomez it 's an old soccer cliché that in order to win games , you have to score more goals than your opponents , and the man doing that for stuttgart has been mario gomez .

" i do n't see many german strikers with his quality , " veh said recently .
" if i were the national coach , i 'd try him out . " stuttgart still have some problems to address , if they are to stay on top .
they need to become more consistent at home , and their defense has conceded 16 goals - fifth worst in the league . but if veh and his charges can address those issues , a spot in the champions league is hardly beyond reach .

wickert is a novelist , author of numerous books on east asia and a former ambassador to china . dw-world.de : how did you meet john rabe ?
erwin wickert : i was a hobo , a bum looking for adventure , had been a german exchange student at dickinson college in pennsylvania , and wanted to take the pacific route to east asia .
when i arrived in china , i was 21 and broke - it was difficult arranging money transfers from germany in 1936 .
i was hoping to find other germans i could stay with , and was referred to rabe and his wife dora , who generously took me into their home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wickert , now 91 , was rabe 's guest in 1936 rabe had joined the nazi party in 1934 , yet he opened his home to strangers - to you and to hundreds of chinese fleeing japanese soldiers .
what kind of a man was rabe ? in hitler 's time , there were three types of germans : the nazis , the intelligentsia and the decent germans .
it was possible to belong to two of the categories , but not all three .
rabe was clearly honorable and he was a nazi in name .
he had no idea about hitler and had only heard good things .
remember , rabe had spent decades in china .
he had only been in germany briefly in 1928 during a time when the nazis were an unknown entity . still , he read german and english newspapers in china , and there were so many jewish emigrés who suddenly started arriving in shanghai and elsewhere .
he should have given more weight to the testimonies of the jews , but rabe was absolutely not anti-semitic .
not a single anti-semitic reference could be found in his diaries . in nanking , the americans and brits thought he must have been high up , because he boasted about being a nazi member and firing off a telegram to hitler .
he was n't .
to many germans abroad , being a nazi did n't mean anything .
they needed to join the party to further their careers or to achieve certain goals .
rabe had joined in 1934 , because he wanted to open up a german school for the locals . he had certainly used his nazi credentials to shelter the chinese .
the japanese soldiers , many of them very young , went on a rampage , killing civilians in every way imaginable .
why did they suddenly stop at rabe 's door in the international security zone ? he bluffed a lot , and even worried about how long he could continue bluffing .
he showed them his nazi badge .
they must have thought that hitler was around the corner .
one soldier was in the middle of raping a woman and rabe simply shouted , pointed to his swastika , and sent the soldier back over the fence .
he had no weapons , but the japanese knew he was german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you worked for the german foreign service in shanghai during the war , and then you were posted as a radio attaché to tokyo , where you stayed until shortly after the japanese surrender .
having witnessed japanese aggression in china , how did that make you feel about japan ? the japanese are difficult to understand .
many could not admit that their own countrymen committed such atrocities , but they wanted to know about it .
the rabe diaries were published in japan , and the book was enormously successful .
probably because it was a day-to-day account of what happened , and it did not condemn the japanese as a people . there was one chapter of the rabe diaries that appeared in german , but was dropped by the american publisher and never translated into english .
i describe the bestialities that were committed in the name of imperial japan as part of the human condition .
perhaps rabe summed it up best , " there is good and evil in every nation .
the brave and the criminal .
in war unfortunately , criminality always rises to the surface .

fewer foreigners have become german citizens in the last five years . while the number of foreigners taking on citizenship across most of germany has fallen in the last half decade , in berlin the number of new citizens started rising again in 2005 due to a citizenship advertising campaign .
unlike other states that are more restrictive , berlin has adopted a quick , straightforward procedure . the city is also using the multicultural atmosphere as a selling point to encourage people to apply for german citizenship . in a bare room of the technical university in berlin , 24-year-old funda gümüsdag is writing math equations on the blackboard and explaining them to a group of youngsters . gümüsdag is a volunteer , giving extra classes twice a week to students with immigrant backgrounds , whilst studying to be a teacher and involving herself in local politics . she also appears on posters all over berlin , together with 14 other non-native germans , trying to convince foreign youngsters of the advantages of taking up german citizenship . naturalization in action gümüsdag said that getting german nationality has given her the chance to become a part of society and also getting the chance to vote . " you are saying to that society : ' hi , i 'm here and i want to go and vote , ' i want to join a party and i want to be able to put my mark on this society , " she said . gümüsdag and her family have been german citizens for 10 years , and she said there were obvious advantages - like not having to worry about visas when traveling and having the opportunity to be involved in political life . the gümüdags had to give up their turkish citizenship , since german law does not allow dual citizenship under normal circumstances . for many people this is seen as rejecting their original citizenship and is like denying their own roots , but for gümüsdag it 's not a problem - she happily celebrates christmas and ramadan . germany : is a ' country of immigration ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : citizenship is seen by some as empowering , for others it means a loss of identity people are only slowly becoming aware of the fact that germany is a country of immigration and that campaigns like the one funda is involved in are a step in the right direction , according to günter piening , berlin 's commissioner for foreigners ' affairs .

in other german states , it takes two years for applicants to be granted citizenship , while in berlin all applications have to be dealt with in six months . information about the requirements for naturalization , such as the minimum age and german language skills , are publicized through radio and newspapers ads or visits to schools .

that 's down a coach , a hot striker and a new team spirit . armin veh was only hired at stuttgart last february as an " interim solution " for a team that had thoroughly disappointed expectations .
nine months later , he has the swabians two points behind werder bremen at the top of the bundesliga table .
so what are the reasons for stuttgart 's remarkable recovery ? thomas haid , a sports editor who covers the team for the local stuttgarter zeitung , offered his views . " the team was completely revamped with the addition of six new players in the off-season , " haid told dw-world.de.
" and they 've also succeeded in integrating young players from the amateur ranks into the squad . " gone are petulant divas like striker daniel ljuboja - this season 's team features hard-nosed mexican nationals , ricardo osorio and pavel pardo , and youngsters like sami khediri and serdar tasci . they 're currently riding a four-game winning streak , and that has fans dreaming of stuttgart 's first league title since 1992 .
and much of stuttgart 's success is down to a coach who was initially only an emergency replacement . work that body when armin veh assumed the reins from coaching legend giovanni trappatoni last february , stuttgart was mired in mediocrity - languishing in eighth place with an astonishing 12 draws in 21 games .
few observers thought veh would last long in his new job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motivator armin veh is no longer a stop-gap skipper " there was n't much he could do but limit the damage , " haid said .
" he took over a team in catastrophic physical condition . " stuttgart finished ninth , but veh , who is known as a disciplinarian , was given the chance this year to mould the team in his own image .
the squad is back in shape and has remembered how to win games . tuesday 's victory over hamburg thanks to two goals in the last ten minutes , as well as stuttgart 's stunning comeback from two goals down earlier this season in bremen , speak volumes about the team 's condition . stuttgart have the second-best road record in the bundesliga and have scored more goals than any of their rivals except bremen .
that 's quite a reversal for a team that last season could n't even manage home victories against relegation candidates . go-go gomez it 's an old soccer cliché that in order to win games , you have to score more goals than your opponents , and the man doing that for stuttgart has been mario gomez .
with seven goals and four assists thus far , the 21-striker is having the year of his young career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart players point out a major reason for their success - striker mario gomez veh thinks gomez has earned a shot at playing for germany 's national team .
" i do n't see many german strikers with his quality , " veh said recently .
" if i were the national coach , i 'd try him out . " stuttgart still have some problems to address , if they are to stay on top .
they need to become more consistent at home , and their defense has conceded 16 goals - fifth worst in the league . but if veh and his charges can address those issues , a spot in the champions league is hardly beyond reach .
" it 's a young team that can only improve , " said haid .
" i do n't see any reason why they should n't end up under the top three .

fewer foreigners have become german citizens in the last five years . while the number of foreigners taking on citizenship across most of germany has fallen in the last half decade , in berlin the number of new citizens started rising again in 2005 due to a citizenship advertising campaign .
unlike other states that are more restrictive , berlin has adopted a quick , straightforward procedure . the city is also using the multicultural atmosphere as a selling point to encourage people to apply for german citizenship . in a bare room of the technical university in berlin , 24-year-old funda gümüsdag is writing math equations on the blackboard and explaining them to a group of youngsters . gümüsdag is a volunteer , giving extra classes twice a week to students with immigrant backgrounds , whilst studying to be a teacher and involving herself in local politics . she also appears on posters all over berlin , together with 14 other non-native germans , trying to convince foreign youngsters of the advantages of taking up german citizenship . naturalization in action gümüsdag said that getting german nationality has given her the chance to become a part of society and also getting the chance to vote . " you are saying to that society : ' hi , i 'm here and i want to go and vote , ' i want to join a party and i want to be able to put my mark on this society , " she said . gümüsdag and her family have been german citizens for 10 years , and she said there were obvious advantages - like not having to worry about visas when traveling and having the opportunity to be involved in political life . the gümüdags had to give up their turkish citizenship , since german law does not allow dual citizenship under normal circumstances . for many people this is seen as rejecting their original citizenship and is like denying their own roots , but for gümüsdag it 's not a problem - she happily celebrates christmas and ramadan . germany : is a ' country of immigration ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : citizenship is seen by some as empowering , for others it means a loss of identity people are only slowly becoming aware of the fact that germany is a country of immigration and that campaigns like the one funda is involved in are a step in the right direction , according to günter piening , berlin 's commissioner for foreigners ' affairs .

in other german states , it takes two years for applicants to be granted citizenship , while in berlin all applications have to be dealt with in six months . information about the requirements for naturalization , such as the minimum age and german language skills , are publicized through radio and newspapers ads or visits to schools .
the extra effort berlin puts into promoting naturalization has allowed it to buck the national trend , some say . as germany 's politicians try to encourage foreigners to commit themselves to integration , berlin has shown one way it can be done . michael lawton -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study challenges widely-held notions about islamic headscarf the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .

dw-world.de spoke with erwin wickert , the editor of his diaries . german author and diplomat erwin wickert , the 91-year-old editor of the diaries " john rabe : the good german of nanking , " talked to dw-world.de about rabe , whom he first met in 1936 .
wickert is a novelist , author of numerous books on east asia and a former ambassador to china . dw-world.de : how did you meet john rabe ?
erwin wickert : i was a hobo , a bum looking for adventure , had been a german exchange student at dickinson college in pennsylvania , and wanted to take the pacific route to east asia .
when i arrived in china , i was 21 and broke - it was difficult arranging money transfers from germany in 1936 .
i was hoping to find other germans i could stay with , and was referred to rabe and his wife dora , who generously took me into their home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wickert , now 91 , was rabe 's guest in 1936 rabe had joined the nazi party in 1934 , yet he opened his home to strangers - to you and to hundreds of chinese fleeing japanese soldiers .
what kind of a man was rabe ? in hitler 's time , there were three types of germans : the nazis , the intelligentsia and the decent germans .
it was possible to belong to two of the categories , but not all three .
rabe was clearly honorable and he was a nazi in name .
he had no idea about hitler and had only heard good things .
remember , rabe had spent decades in china .
he had only been in germany briefly in 1928 during a time when the nazis were an unknown entity . still , he read german and english newspapers in china , and there were so many jewish emigrés who suddenly started arriving in shanghai and elsewhere .
he should have given more weight to the testimonies of the jews , but rabe was absolutely not anti-semitic .
not a single anti-semitic reference could be found in his diaries . in nanking , the americans and brits thought he must have been high up , because he boasted about being a nazi member and firing off a telegram to hitler .
he was n't .
to many germans abroad , being a nazi did n't mean anything .
they needed to join the party to further their careers or to achieve certain goals .
rabe had joined in 1934 , because he wanted to open up a german school for the locals . he had certainly used his nazi credentials to shelter the chinese .
the japanese soldiers , many of them very young , went on a rampage , killing civilians in every way imaginable .
why did they suddenly stop at rabe 's door in the international security zone ? he bluffed a lot , and even worried about how long he could continue bluffing .
he showed them his nazi badge .
they must have thought that hitler was around the corner .
one soldier was in the middle of raping a woman and rabe simply shouted , pointed to his swastika , and sent the soldier back over the fence .
he had no weapons , but the japanese knew he was german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you worked for the german foreign service in shanghai during the war , and then you were posted as a radio attaché to tokyo , where you stayed until shortly after the japanese surrender .
having witnessed japanese aggression in china , how did that make you feel about japan ? the japanese are difficult to understand .
many could not admit that their own countrymen committed such atrocities , but they wanted to know about it .
the rabe diaries were published in japan , and the book was enormously successful .
probably because it was a day-to-day account of what happened , and it did not condemn the japanese as a people . there was one chapter of the rabe diaries that appeared in german , but was dropped by the american publisher and never translated into english .
i describe the bestialities that were committed in the name of imperial japan as part of the human condition .
perhaps rabe summed it up best , " there is good and evil in every nation .

dw-world.de spoke with erwin wickert , the editor of his diaries . german author and diplomat erwin wickert , the 91-year-old editor of the diaries " john rabe : the good german of nanking , " talked to dw-world.de about rabe , whom he first met in 1936 .
wickert is a novelist , author of numerous books on east asia and a former ambassador to china . dw-world.de : how did you meet john rabe ?
erwin wickert : i was a hobo , a bum looking for adventure , had been a german exchange student at dickinson college in pennsylvania , and wanted to take the pacific route to east asia .
when i arrived in china , i was 21 and broke - it was difficult arranging money transfers from germany in 1936 .
i was hoping to find other germans i could stay with , and was referred to rabe and his wife dora , who generously took me into their home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wickert , now 91 , was rabe 's guest in 1936 rabe had joined the nazi party in 1934 , yet he opened his home to strangers - to you and to hundreds of chinese fleeing japanese soldiers .
what kind of a man was rabe ? in hitler 's time , there were three types of germans : the nazis , the intelligentsia and the decent germans .
it was possible to belong to two of the categories , but not all three .
rabe was clearly honorable and he was a nazi in name .
he had no idea about hitler and had only heard good things .
remember , rabe had spent decades in china .
he had only been in germany briefly in 1928 during a time when the nazis were an unknown entity . still , he read german and english newspapers in china , and there were so many jewish emigrés who suddenly started arriving in shanghai and elsewhere .
he should have given more weight to the testimonies of the jews , but rabe was absolutely not anti-semitic .
not a single anti-semitic reference could be found in his diaries . in nanking , the americans and brits thought he must have been high up , because he boasted about being a nazi member and firing off a telegram to hitler .
he was n't .
to many germans abroad , being a nazi did n't mean anything .
they needed to join the party to further their careers or to achieve certain goals .
rabe had joined in 1934 , because he wanted to open up a german school for the locals . he had certainly used his nazi credentials to shelter the chinese .
the japanese soldiers , many of them very young , went on a rampage , killing civilians in every way imaginable .
why did they suddenly stop at rabe 's door in the international security zone ? he bluffed a lot , and even worried about how long he could continue bluffing .
he showed them his nazi badge .
they must have thought that hitler was around the corner .
one soldier was in the middle of raping a woman and rabe simply shouted , pointed to his swastika , and sent the soldier back over the fence .
he had no weapons , but the japanese knew he was german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you worked for the german foreign service in shanghai during the war , and then you were posted as a radio attaché to tokyo , where you stayed until shortly after the japanese surrender .
having witnessed japanese aggression in china , how did that make you feel about japan ? the japanese are difficult to understand .
many could not admit that their own countrymen committed such atrocities , but they wanted to know about it .
the rabe diaries were published in japan , and the book was enormously successful .
probably because it was a day-to-day account of what happened , and it did not condemn the japanese as a people . there was one chapter of the rabe diaries that appeared in german , but was dropped by the american publisher and never translated into english .
i describe the bestialities that were committed in the name of imperial japan as part of the human condition .
perhaps rabe summed it up best , " there is good and evil in every nation .

dw-world.de spoke with erwin wickert , the editor of his diaries . german author and diplomat erwin wickert , the 91-year-old editor of the diaries " john rabe : the good german of nanking , " talked to dw-world.de about rabe , whom he first met in 1936 .
wickert is a novelist , author of numerous books on east asia and a former ambassador to china . dw-world.de : how did you meet john rabe ?
erwin wickert : i was a hobo , a bum looking for adventure , had been a german exchange student at dickinson college in pennsylvania , and wanted to take the pacific route to east asia .
when i arrived in china , i was 21 and broke - it was difficult arranging money transfers from germany in 1936 .
i was hoping to find other germans i could stay with , and was referred to rabe and his wife dora , who generously took me into their home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wickert , now 91 , was rabe 's guest in 1936 rabe had joined the nazi party in 1934 , yet he opened his home to strangers - to you and to hundreds of chinese fleeing japanese soldiers .
what kind of a man was rabe ? in hitler 's time , there were three types of germans : the nazis , the intelligentsia and the decent germans .
it was possible to belong to two of the categories , but not all three .
rabe was clearly honorable and he was a nazi in name .
he had no idea about hitler and had only heard good things .
remember , rabe had spent decades in china .
he had only been in germany briefly in 1928 during a time when the nazis were an unknown entity . still , he read german and english newspapers in china , and there were so many jewish emigrés who suddenly started arriving in shanghai and elsewhere .
he should have given more weight to the testimonies of the jews , but rabe was absolutely not anti-semitic .
not a single anti-semitic reference could be found in his diaries . in nanking , the americans and brits thought he must have been high up , because he boasted about being a nazi member and firing off a telegram to hitler .
he was n't .
to many germans abroad , being a nazi did n't mean anything .
they needed to join the party to further their careers or to achieve certain goals .
rabe had joined in 1934 , because he wanted to open up a german school for the locals . he had certainly used his nazi credentials to shelter the chinese .
the japanese soldiers , many of them very young , went on a rampage , killing civilians in every way imaginable .
why did they suddenly stop at rabe 's door in the international security zone ? he bluffed a lot , and even worried about how long he could continue bluffing .
he showed them his nazi badge .
they must have thought that hitler was around the corner .
one soldier was in the middle of raping a woman and rabe simply shouted , pointed to his swastika , and sent the soldier back over the fence .
he had no weapons , but the japanese knew he was german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you worked for the german foreign service in shanghai during the war , and then you were posted as a radio attaché to tokyo , where you stayed until shortly after the japanese surrender .
having witnessed japanese aggression in china , how did that make you feel about japan ? the japanese are difficult to understand .
many could not admit that their own countrymen committed such atrocities , but they wanted to know about it .
the rabe diaries were published in japan , and the book was enormously successful .
probably because it was a day-to-day account of what happened , and it did not condemn the japanese as a people . there was one chapter of the rabe diaries that appeared in german , but was dropped by the american publisher and never translated into english .
i describe the bestialities that were committed in the name of imperial japan as part of the human condition .
perhaps rabe summed it up best , " there is good and evil in every nation .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wickert , now 91 , was rabe 's guest in 1936 rabe had joined the nazi party in 1934 , yet he opened his home to strangers - to you and to hundreds of chinese fleeing japanese soldiers .
what kind of a man was rabe ? in hitler 's time , there were three types of germans : the nazis , the intelligentsia and the decent germans .
it was possible to belong to two of the categories , but not all three .
rabe was clearly honorable and he was a nazi in name .
he had no idea about hitler and had only heard good things .
remember , rabe had spent decades in china .
he had only been in germany briefly in 1928 during a time when the nazis were an unknown entity . still , he read german and english newspapers in china , and there were so many jewish emigrés who suddenly started arriving in shanghai and elsewhere .
he should have given more weight to the testimonies of the jews , but rabe was absolutely not anti-semitic .
not a single anti-semitic reference could be found in his diaries . in nanking , the americans and brits thought he must have been high up , because he boasted about being a nazi member and firing off a telegram to hitler .
he was n't .
to many germans abroad , being a nazi did n't mean anything .
they needed to join the party to further their careers or to achieve certain goals .
rabe had joined in 1934 , because he wanted to open up a german school for the locals . he had certainly used his nazi credentials to shelter the chinese .
the japanese soldiers , many of them very young , went on a rampage , killing civilians in every way imaginable .
why did they suddenly stop at rabe 's door in the international security zone ? he bluffed a lot , and even worried about how long he could continue bluffing .
he showed them his nazi badge .
they must have thought that hitler was around the corner .
one soldier was in the middle of raping a woman and rabe simply shouted , pointed to his swastika , and sent the soldier back over the fence .
he had no weapons , but the japanese knew he was german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you worked for the german foreign service in shanghai during the war , and then you were posted as a radio attaché to tokyo , where you stayed until shortly after the japanese surrender .
having witnessed japanese aggression in china , how did that make you feel about japan ? the japanese are difficult to understand .
many could not admit that their own countrymen committed such atrocities , but they wanted to know about it .
the rabe diaries were published in japan , and the book was enormously successful .
probably because it was a day-to-day account of what happened , and it did not condemn the japanese as a people . there was one chapter of the rabe diaries that appeared in german , but was dropped by the american publisher and never translated into english .
i describe the bestialities that were committed in the name of imperial japan as part of the human condition .

" nowhere have we seen such a lack of willingness to cooperate as in poland , " said carlos coelho , the portuguese member of the european parliament leading the inquiry commission . the 46-nation council of europe 's team of a dozen lawmakers began a round of hearings in poland on wednesday .
it was part of its efforts to shed light on allegations that poland and other european countries were home to secret cia prisons or helped the united states transfer suspects . poland has consistently denied playing host to secret cia prisons . earlier this week , the commission met with polish journalists who have been looking into the allegations , which first surfaced last year . lack of cooperation and withholding information " sometimes i feel that , when dealing with these matters , members of parliament and journalists are confronted with the same kind of difficulties : lack of cooperation and withholding of information , " said coelho . he noted that the commission had been unable to meet polish lawmakers , something it has done elsewhere . he also criticized the " reluctance of the government to offer full cooperation to our investigation and to receive our delegation at an appropriate political level .

" nowhere have we seen such a lack of willingness to cooperate as in poland , " said carlos coelho , the portuguese member of the european parliament leading the inquiry commission . the 46-nation council of europe 's team of a dozen lawmakers began a round of hearings in poland on wednesday .
it was part of its efforts to shed light on allegations that poland and other european countries were home to secret cia prisons or helped the united states transfer suspects . poland has consistently denied playing host to secret cia prisons . earlier this week , the commission met with polish journalists who have been looking into the allegations , which first surfaced last year . lack of cooperation and withholding information " sometimes i feel that , when dealing with these matters , members of parliament and journalists are confronted with the same kind of difficulties : lack of cooperation and withholding of information , " said coelho . he noted that the commission had been unable to meet polish lawmakers , something it has done elsewhere . he also criticized the " reluctance of the government to offer full cooperation to our investigation and to receive our delegation at an appropriate political level . " the commission was only able to meet with an aide to prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , an official who coelho noted lacked cabinet status and so was unable to answer all the team 's questions . romania has also found itself in the spotlight over alleged prisons .
like poland , the country has become a key us ally since the collapse of communism . " i feel obliged to highlight the difference between the openness and readiness to cooperate we were offered when we went to romania three weeks ago and what we have experienced during our visit to poland , " said coelho . relations likely to become more strained in june , poland 's then prime minister , kazimierz marcinkiewicz , dismissed as " libel " a report issued by the council of europe alleging that poland may have been involved . romania has also denied the allegations contained in the report by swiss lawmaker dick marty , who conceded that he had no formal evidence . in september , us president george w. bush acknowledged that 14 prisoners who were set to be tried had been detained in secret centers abroad but did not say where exactly they were held . the council of europe report also said that britain , germany , italy , spain and sweden may have at least tacitly violated human rights by allegedly allowing the cia to transfer or detain suspected islamist terrorists on their territory . coelho said that the commission of inquiry was set to produce its own draft report by the end of the month . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspected cia abductors identified journalists from german broadcaster ard said they uncovered the identities of three alleged cia pilots who helped to kidnap german citizen khaled el-masri , who was imprisoned in afghanistan .

" nowhere have we seen such a lack of willingness to cooperate as in poland , " said carlos coelho , the portuguese member of the european parliament leading the inquiry commission . the 46-nation council of europe 's team of a dozen lawmakers began a round of hearings in poland on wednesday .
it was part of its efforts to shed light on allegations that poland and other european countries were home to secret cia prisons or helped the united states transfer suspects . poland has consistently denied playing host to secret cia prisons . earlier this week , the commission met with polish journalists who have been looking into the allegations , which first surfaced last year . lack of cooperation and withholding information " sometimes i feel that , when dealing with these matters , members of parliament and journalists are confronted with the same kind of difficulties : lack of cooperation and withholding of information , " said coelho . he noted that the commission had been unable to meet polish lawmakers , something it has done elsewhere . he also criticized the " reluctance of the government to offer full cooperation to our investigation and to receive our delegation at an appropriate political level . " the commission was only able to meet with an aide to prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , an official who coelho noted lacked cabinet status and so was unable to answer all the team 's questions . romania has also found itself in the spotlight over alleged prisons .
like poland , the country has become a key us ally since the collapse of communism . " i feel obliged to highlight the difference between the openness and readiness to cooperate we were offered when we went to romania three weeks ago and what we have experienced during our visit to poland , " said coelho . relations likely to become more strained in june , poland 's then prime minister , kazimierz marcinkiewicz , dismissed as " libel " a report issued by the council of europe alleging that poland may have been involved . romania has also denied the allegations contained in the report by swiss lawmaker dick marty , who conceded that he had no formal evidence . in september , us president george w. bush acknowledged that 14 prisoners who were set to be tried had been detained in secret centers abroad but did not say where exactly they were held . the council of europe report also said that britain , germany , italy , spain and sweden may have at least tacitly violated human rights by allegedly allowing the cia to transfer or detain suspected islamist terrorists on their territory . coelho said that the commission of inquiry was set to produce its own draft report by the end of the month . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspected cia abductors identified journalists from german broadcaster ard said they uncovered the identities of three alleged cia pilots who helped to kidnap german citizen khaled el-masri , who was imprisoned in afghanistan .

fewer foreigners have become german citizens in the last five years . while the number of foreigners taking on citizenship across most of germany has fallen in the last half decade , in berlin the number of new citizens started rising again in 2005 due to a citizenship advertising campaign .
unlike other states that are more restrictive , berlin has adopted a quick , straightforward procedure . the city is also using the multicultural atmosphere as a selling point to encourage people to apply for german citizenship . in a bare room of the technical university in berlin , 24-year-old funda gümüsdag is writing math equations on the blackboard and explaining them to a group of youngsters . gümüsdag is a volunteer , giving extra classes twice a week to students with immigrant backgrounds , whilst studying to be a teacher and involving herself in local politics . she also appears on posters all over berlin , together with 14 other non-native germans , trying to convince foreign youngsters of the advantages of taking up german citizenship . naturalization in action gümüsdag said that getting german nationality has given her the chance to become a part of society and also getting the chance to vote . " you are saying to that society : ' hi , i 'm here and i want to go and vote , ' i want to join a party and i want to be able to put my mark on this society , " she said . gümüsdag and her family have been german citizens for 10 years , and she said there were obvious advantages - like not having to worry about visas when traveling and having the opportunity to be involved in political life . the gümüdags had to give up their turkish citizenship , since german law does not allow dual citizenship under normal circumstances . for many people this is seen as rejecting their original citizenship and is like denying their own roots , but for gümüsdag it 's not a problem - she happily celebrates christmas and ramadan . germany : is a ' country of immigration ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : citizenship is seen by some as empowering , for others it means a loss of identity people are only slowly becoming aware of the fact that germany is a country of immigration and that campaigns like the one funda is involved in are a step in the right direction , according to günter piening , berlin 's commissioner for foreigners ' affairs . " the campaign has two aims : berlin wants to increase the number of young people becoming german citizens , but they also want to encourage a debate on the issue of what it means to be german , " piening said . issues of identity are very important for young people , he added . piening has apparently made it easier to become a german by fast-tracking applications .
in other german states , it takes two years for applicants to be granted citizenship , while in berlin all applications have to be dealt with in six months . information about the requirements for naturalization , such as the minimum age and german language skills , are publicized through radio and newspapers ads or visits to schools .
the extra effort berlin puts into promoting naturalization has allowed it to buck the national trend , some say . as germany 's politicians try to encourage foreigners to commit themselves to integration , berlin has shown one way it can be done . michael lawton -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study challenges widely-held notions about islamic headscarf the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .

" nowhere have we seen such a lack of willingness to cooperate as in poland , " said carlos coelho , the portuguese member of the european parliament leading the inquiry commission . the 46-nation council of europe 's team of a dozen lawmakers began a round of hearings in poland on wednesday .
it was part of its efforts to shed light on allegations that poland and other european countries were home to secret cia prisons or helped the united states transfer suspects . poland has consistently denied playing host to secret cia prisons . earlier this week , the commission met with polish journalists who have been looking into the allegations , which first surfaced last year . lack of cooperation and withholding information " sometimes i feel that , when dealing with these matters , members of parliament and journalists are confronted with the same kind of difficulties : lack of cooperation and withholding of information , " said coelho . he noted that the commission had been unable to meet polish lawmakers , something it has done elsewhere . he also criticized the " reluctance of the government to offer full cooperation to our investigation and to receive our delegation at an appropriate political level .

that 's down a coach , a hot striker and a new team spirit . armin veh was only hired at stuttgart last february as an " interim solution " for a team that had thoroughly disappointed expectations .
nine months later , he has the swabians two points behind werder bremen at the top of the bundesliga table .
so what are the reasons for stuttgart 's remarkable recovery ? thomas haid , a sports editor who covers the team for the local stuttgarter zeitung , offered his views . " the team was completely revamped with the addition of six new players in the off-season , " haid told dw-world.de.
" and they 've also succeeded in integrating young players from the amateur ranks into the squad . " gone are petulant divas like striker daniel ljuboja - this season 's team features hard-nosed mexican nationals , ricardo osorio and pavel pardo , and youngsters like sami khediri and serdar tasci . they 're currently riding a four-game winning streak , and that has fans dreaming of stuttgart 's first league title since 1992 .
and much of stuttgart 's success is down to a coach who was initially only an emergency replacement . work that body when armin veh assumed the reins from coaching legend giovanni trappatoni last february , stuttgart was mired in mediocrity - languishing in eighth place with an astonishing 12 draws in 21 games .
few observers thought veh would last long in his new job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motivator armin veh is no longer a stop-gap skipper " there was n't much he could do but limit the damage , " haid said .
" he took over a team in catastrophic physical condition . " stuttgart finished ninth , but veh , who is known as a disciplinarian , was given the chance this year to mould the team in his own image .
the squad is back in shape and has remembered how to win games . tuesday 's victory over hamburg thanks to two goals in the last ten minutes , as well as stuttgart 's stunning comeback from two goals down earlier this season in bremen , speak volumes about the team 's condition . stuttgart have the second-best road record in the bundesliga and have scored more goals than any of their rivals except bremen .
that 's quite a reversal for a team that last season could n't even manage home victories against relegation candidates . go-go gomez it 's an old soccer cliché that in order to win games , you have to score more goals than your opponents , and the man doing that for stuttgart has been mario gomez .
with seven goals and four assists thus far , the 21-striker is having the year of his young career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart players point out a major reason for their success - striker mario gomez veh thinks gomez has earned a shot at playing for germany 's national team .
" i do n't see many german strikers with his quality , " veh said recently .
" if i were the national coach , i 'd try him out . " stuttgart still have some problems to address , if they are to stay on top .
they need to become more consistent at home , and their defense has conceded 16 goals - fifth worst in the league . but if veh and his charges can address those issues , a spot in the champions league is hardly beyond reach .
" it 's a young team that can only improve , " said haid .
" i do n't see any reason why they should n't end up under the top three .

ricke 's contract would be extended before it expired in november 2007 , the board members said , according to the online news site .

fewer foreigners have become german citizens in the last five years . while the number of foreigners taking on citizenship across most of germany has fallen in the last half decade , in berlin the number of new citizens started rising again in 2005 due to a citizenship advertising campaign .
unlike other states that are more restrictive , berlin has adopted a quick , straightforward procedure . the city is also using the multicultural atmosphere as a selling point to encourage people to apply for german citizenship . in a bare room of the technical university in berlin , 24-year-old funda gümüsdag is writing math equations on the blackboard and explaining them to a group of youngsters . gümüsdag is a volunteer , giving extra classes twice a week to students with immigrant backgrounds , whilst studying to be a teacher and involving herself in local politics . she also appears on posters all over berlin , together with 14 other non-native germans , trying to convince foreign youngsters of the advantages of taking up german citizenship . naturalization in action gümüsdag said that getting german nationality has given her the chance to become a part of society and also getting the chance to vote . " you are saying to that society : ' hi , i 'm here and i want to go and vote , ' i want to join a party and i want to be able to put my mark on this society , " she said . gümüsdag and her family have been german citizens for 10 years , and she said there were obvious advantages - like not having to worry about visas when traveling and having the opportunity to be involved in political life . the gümüdags had to give up their turkish citizenship , since german law does not allow dual citizenship under normal circumstances . for many people this is seen as rejecting their original citizenship and is like denying their own roots , but for gümüsdag it 's not a problem - she happily celebrates christmas and ramadan . germany : is a ' country of immigration ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : citizenship is seen by some as empowering , for others it means a loss of identity people are only slowly becoming aware of the fact that germany is a country of immigration and that campaigns like the one funda is involved in are a step in the right direction , according to günter piening , berlin 's commissioner for foreigners ' affairs . " the campaign has two aims : berlin wants to increase the number of young people becoming german citizens , but they also want to encourage a debate on the issue of what it means to be german , " piening said . issues of identity are very important for young people , he added . piening has apparently made it easier to become a german by fast-tracking applications .
in other german states , it takes two years for applicants to be granted citizenship , while in berlin all applications have to be dealt with in six months . information about the requirements for naturalization , such as the minimum age and german language skills , are publicized through radio and newspapers ads or visits to schools .
the extra effort berlin puts into promoting naturalization has allowed it to buck the national trend , some say . as germany 's politicians try to encourage foreigners to commit themselves to integration , berlin has shown one way it can be done . michael lawton -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study challenges widely-held notions about islamic headscarf the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .

fewer foreigners have become german citizens in the last five years . while the number of foreigners taking on citizenship across most of germany has fallen in the last half decade , in berlin the number of new citizens started rising again in 2005 due to a citizenship advertising campaign .
unlike other states that are more restrictive , berlin has adopted a quick , straightforward procedure . the city is also using the multicultural atmosphere as a selling point to encourage people to apply for german citizenship . in a bare room of the technical university in berlin , 24-year-old funda gümüsdag is writing math equations on the blackboard and explaining them to a group of youngsters . gümüsdag is a volunteer , giving extra classes twice a week to students with immigrant backgrounds , whilst studying to be a teacher and involving herself in local politics . she also appears on posters all over berlin , together with 14 other non-native germans , trying to convince foreign youngsters of the advantages of taking up german citizenship . naturalization in action gümüsdag said that getting german nationality has given her the chance to become a part of society and also getting the chance to vote . " you are saying to that society : ' hi , i 'm here and i want to go and vote , ' i want to join a party and i want to be able to put my mark on this society , " she said . gümüsdag and her family have been german citizens for 10 years , and she said there were obvious advantages - like not having to worry about visas when traveling and having the opportunity to be involved in political life . the gümüdags had to give up their turkish citizenship , since german law does not allow dual citizenship under normal circumstances . for many people this is seen as rejecting their original citizenship and is like denying their own roots , but for gümüsdag it 's not a problem - she happily celebrates christmas and ramadan . germany : is a ' country of immigration ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : citizenship is seen by some as empowering , for others it means a loss of identity people are only slowly becoming aware of the fact that germany is a country of immigration and that campaigns like the one funda is involved in are a step in the right direction , according to günter piening , berlin 's commissioner for foreigners ' affairs .

in other german states , it takes two years for applicants to be granted citizenship , while in berlin all applications have to be dealt with in six months . information about the requirements for naturalization , such as the minimum age and german language skills , are publicized through radio and newspapers ads or visits to schools .

it was part of its efforts to shed light on allegations that poland and other european countries were home to secret cia prisons or helped the united states transfer suspects . poland has consistently denied playing host to secret cia prisons . earlier this week , the commission met with polish journalists who have been looking into the allegations , which first surfaced last year . lack of cooperation and withholding information " sometimes i feel that , when dealing with these matters , members of parliament and journalists are confronted with the same kind of difficulties : lack of cooperation and withholding of information , " said coelho . he noted that the commission had been unable to meet polish lawmakers , something it has done elsewhere . he also criticized the " reluctance of the government to offer full cooperation to our investigation and to receive our delegation at an appropriate political level . " the commission was only able to meet with an aide to prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , an official who coelho noted lacked cabinet status and so was unable to answer all the team 's questions . romania has also found itself in the spotlight over alleged prisons .
like poland , the country has become a key us ally since the collapse of communism . " i feel obliged to highlight the difference between the openness and readiness to cooperate we were offered when we went to romania three weeks ago and what we have experienced during our visit to poland , " said coelho . relations likely to become more strained in june , poland 's then prime minister , kazimierz marcinkiewicz , dismissed as " libel " a report issued by the council of europe alleging that poland may have been involved . romania has also denied the allegations contained in the report by swiss lawmaker dick marty , who conceded that he had no formal evidence . in september , us president george w. bush acknowledged that 14 prisoners who were set to be tried had been detained in secret centers abroad but did not say where exactly they were held . the council of europe report also said that britain , germany , italy , spain and sweden may have at least tacitly violated human rights by allegedly allowing the cia to transfer or detain suspected islamist terrorists on their territory . coelho said that the commission of inquiry was set to produce its own draft report by the end of the month . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspected cia abductors identified journalists from german broadcaster ard said they uncovered the identities of three alleged cia pilots who helped to kidnap german citizen khaled el-masri , who was imprisoned in afghanistan .

dw-world.de spoke with erwin wickert , the editor of his diaries . german author and diplomat erwin wickert , the 91-year-old editor of the diaries " john rabe : the good german of nanking , " talked to dw-world.de about rabe , whom he first met in 1936 .
wickert is a novelist , author of numerous books on east asia and a former ambassador to china . dw-world.de : how did you meet john rabe ?
erwin wickert : i was a hobo , a bum looking for adventure , had been a german exchange student at dickinson college in pennsylvania , and wanted to take the pacific route to east asia .
when i arrived in china , i was 21 and broke - it was difficult arranging money transfers from germany in 1936 .
i was hoping to find other germans i could stay with , and was referred to rabe and his wife dora , who generously took me into their home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wickert , now 91 , was rabe 's guest in 1936 rabe had joined the nazi party in 1934 , yet he opened his home to strangers - to you and to hundreds of chinese fleeing japanese soldiers .
what kind of a man was rabe ? in hitler 's time , there were three types of germans : the nazis , the intelligentsia and the decent germans .
it was possible to belong to two of the categories , but not all three .
rabe was clearly honorable and he was a nazi in name .
he had no idea about hitler and had only heard good things .
remember , rabe had spent decades in china .
he had only been in germany briefly in 1928 during a time when the nazis were an unknown entity . still , he read german and english newspapers in china , and there were so many jewish emigrés who suddenly started arriving in shanghai and elsewhere .
he should have given more weight to the testimonies of the jews , but rabe was absolutely not anti-semitic .
not a single anti-semitic reference could be found in his diaries . in nanking , the americans and brits thought he must have been high up , because he boasted about being a nazi member and firing off a telegram to hitler .
he was n't .
to many germans abroad , being a nazi did n't mean anything .
they needed to join the party to further their careers or to achieve certain goals .
rabe had joined in 1934 , because he wanted to open up a german school for the locals . he had certainly used his nazi credentials to shelter the chinese .
the japanese soldiers , many of them very young , went on a rampage , killing civilians in every way imaginable .
why did they suddenly stop at rabe 's door in the international security zone ? he bluffed a lot , and even worried about how long he could continue bluffing .
he showed them his nazi badge .
they must have thought that hitler was around the corner .
one soldier was in the middle of raping a woman and rabe simply shouted , pointed to his swastika , and sent the soldier back over the fence .
he had no weapons , but the japanese knew he was german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you worked for the german foreign service in shanghai during the war , and then you were posted as a radio attaché to tokyo , where you stayed until shortly after the japanese surrender .
having witnessed japanese aggression in china , how did that make you feel about japan ? the japanese are difficult to understand .
many could not admit that their own countrymen committed such atrocities , but they wanted to know about it .
the rabe diaries were published in japan , and the book was enormously successful .
probably because it was a day-to-day account of what happened , and it did not condemn the japanese as a people . there was one chapter of the rabe diaries that appeared in german , but was dropped by the american publisher and never translated into english .
i describe the bestialities that were committed in the name of imperial japan as part of the human condition .
perhaps rabe summed it up best , " there is good and evil in every nation .
the brave and the criminal .
in war unfortunately , criminality always rises to the surface .

not a single anti-semitic reference could be found in his diaries . in nanking , the americans and brits thought he must have been high up , because he boasted about being a nazi member and firing off a telegram to hitler .
he was n't .
to many germans abroad , being a nazi did n't mean anything .
they needed to join the party to further their careers or to achieve certain goals .
rabe had joined in 1934 , because he wanted to open up a german school for the locals . he had certainly used his nazi credentials to shelter the chinese .
the japanese soldiers , many of them very young , went on a rampage , killing civilians in every way imaginable .
why did they suddenly stop at rabe 's door in the international security zone ? he bluffed a lot , and even worried about how long he could continue bluffing .
he showed them his nazi badge .
they must have thought that hitler was around the corner .
one soldier was in the middle of raping a woman and rabe simply shouted , pointed to his swastika , and sent the soldier back over the fence .
he had no weapons , but the japanese knew he was german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you worked for the german foreign service in shanghai during the war , and then you were posted as a radio attaché to tokyo , where you stayed until shortly after the japanese surrender .
having witnessed japanese aggression in china , how did that make you feel about japan ? the japanese are difficult to understand .
many could not admit that their own countrymen committed such atrocities , but they wanted to know about it .
the rabe diaries were published in japan , and the book was enormously successful .
probably because it was a day-to-day account of what happened , and it did not condemn the japanese as a people . there was one chapter of the rabe diaries that appeared in german , but was dropped by the american publisher and never translated into english .
i describe the bestialities that were committed in the name of imperial japan as part of the human condition .
perhaps rabe summed it up best , " there is good and evil in every nation .
the brave and the criminal .
in war unfortunately , criminality always rises to the surface .

" nowhere have we seen such a lack of willingness to cooperate as in poland , " said carlos coelho , the portuguese member of the european parliament leading the inquiry commission . the 46-nation council of europe 's team of a dozen lawmakers began a round of hearings in poland on wednesday .
it was part of its efforts to shed light on allegations that poland and other european countries were home to secret cia prisons or helped the united states transfer suspects . poland has consistently denied playing host to secret cia prisons . earlier this week , the commission met with polish journalists who have been looking into the allegations , which first surfaced last year . lack of cooperation and withholding information " sometimes i feel that , when dealing with these matters , members of parliament and journalists are confronted with the same kind of difficulties : lack of cooperation and withholding of information , " said coelho . he noted that the commission had been unable to meet polish lawmakers , something it has done elsewhere . he also criticized the " reluctance of the government to offer full cooperation to our investigation and to receive our delegation at an appropriate political level . " the commission was only able to meet with an aide to prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , an official who coelho noted lacked cabinet status and so was unable to answer all the team 's questions . romania has also found itself in the spotlight over alleged prisons .
like poland , the country has become a key us ally since the collapse of communism . " i feel obliged to highlight the difference between the openness and readiness to cooperate we were offered when we went to romania three weeks ago and what we have experienced during our visit to poland , " said coelho . relations likely to become more strained in june , poland 's then prime minister , kazimierz marcinkiewicz , dismissed as " libel " a report issued by the council of europe alleging that poland may have been involved . romania has also denied the allegations contained in the report by swiss lawmaker dick marty , who conceded that he had no formal evidence . in september , us president george w. bush acknowledged that 14 prisoners who were set to be tried had been detained in secret centers abroad but did not say where exactly they were held . the council of europe report also said that britain , germany , italy , spain and sweden may have at least tacitly violated human rights by allegedly allowing the cia to transfer or detain suspected islamist terrorists on their territory . coelho said that the commission of inquiry was set to produce its own draft report by the end of the month . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspected cia abductors identified journalists from german broadcaster ard said they uncovered the identities of three alleged cia pilots who helped to kidnap german citizen khaled el-masri , who was imprisoned in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 11.11.2006 " there is good and evil in every nation " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though a nazi party member , rabe , third from left , rescued chinese from death john rabe , a german businessman saved thousands of chinese from japanese soldiers during wwii .
dw-world.de spoke with erwin wickert , the editor of his diaries . german author and diplomat erwin wickert , the 91-year-old editor of the diaries " john rabe : the good german of nanking , " talked to dw-world.de about rabe , whom he first met in 1936 .
wickert is a novelist , author of numerous books on east asia and a former ambassador to china . dw-world.de : how did you meet john rabe ?
erwin wickert : i was a hobo , a bum looking for adventure , had been a german exchange student at dickinson college in pennsylvania , and wanted to take the pacific route to east asia .
when i arrived in china , i was 21 and broke - it was difficult arranging money transfers from germany in 1936 .
i was hoping to find other germans i could stay with , and was referred to rabe and his wife dora , who generously took me into their home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wickert , now 91 , was rabe 's guest in 1936 rabe had joined the nazi party in 1934 , yet he opened his home to strangers - to you and to hundreds of chinese fleeing japanese soldiers .
what kind of a man was rabe ? in hitler 's time , there were three types of germans : the nazis , the intelligentsia and the decent germans .
it was possible to belong to two of the categories , but not all three .
rabe was clearly honorable and he was a nazi in name .
he had no idea about hitler and had only heard good things .
remember , rabe had spent decades in china .
he had only been in germany briefly in 1928 during a time when the nazis were an unknown entity . still , he read german and english newspapers in china , and there were so many jewish emigrés who suddenly started arriving in shanghai and elsewhere .
he should have given more weight to the testimonies of the jews , but rabe was absolutely not anti-semitic .
not a single anti-semitic reference could be found in his diaries . in nanking , the americans and brits thought he must have been high up , because he boasted about being a nazi member and firing off a telegram to hitler .
he was n't .
to many germans abroad , being a nazi did n't mean anything .
they needed to join the party to further their careers or to achieve certain goals .
rabe had joined in 1934 , because he wanted to open up a german school for the locals . he had certainly used his nazi credentials to shelter the chinese .
the japanese soldiers , many of them very young , went on a rampage , killing civilians in every way imaginable .
why did they suddenly stop at rabe 's door in the international security zone ? he bluffed a lot , and even worried about how long he could continue bluffing .
he showed them his nazi badge .
they must have thought that hitler was around the corner .
one soldier was in the middle of raping a woman and rabe simply shouted , pointed to his swastika , and sent the soldier back over the fence .
he had no weapons , but the japanese knew he was german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you worked for the german foreign service in shanghai during the war , and then you were posted as a radio attaché to tokyo , where you stayed until shortly after the japanese surrender .
having witnessed japanese aggression in china , how did that make you feel about japan ? the japanese are difficult to understand .

dw-world.de spoke with erwin wickert , the editor of his diaries . german author and diplomat erwin wickert , the 91-year-old editor of the diaries " john rabe : the good german of nanking , " talked to dw-world.de about rabe , whom he first met in 1936 .
wickert is a novelist , author of numerous books on east asia and a former ambassador to china . dw-world.de : how did you meet john rabe ?
erwin wickert : i was a hobo , a bum looking for adventure , had been a german exchange student at dickinson college in pennsylvania , and wanted to take the pacific route to east asia .
when i arrived in china , i was 21 and broke - it was difficult arranging money transfers from germany in 1936 .
i was hoping to find other germans i could stay with , and was referred to rabe and his wife dora , who generously took me into their home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wickert , now 91 , was rabe 's guest in 1936 rabe had joined the nazi party in 1934 , yet he opened his home to strangers - to you and to hundreds of chinese fleeing japanese soldiers .
what kind of a man was rabe ? in hitler 's time , there were three types of germans : the nazis , the intelligentsia and the decent germans .
it was possible to belong to two of the categories , but not all three .
rabe was clearly honorable and he was a nazi in name .
he had no idea about hitler and had only heard good things .
remember , rabe had spent decades in china .
he had only been in germany briefly in 1928 during a time when the nazis were an unknown entity . still , he read german and english newspapers in china , and there were so many jewish emigrés who suddenly started arriving in shanghai and elsewhere .
he should have given more weight to the testimonies of the jews , but rabe was absolutely not anti-semitic .
not a single anti-semitic reference could be found in his diaries . in nanking , the americans and brits thought he must have been high up , because he boasted about being a nazi member and firing off a telegram to hitler .
he was n't .
to many germans abroad , being a nazi did n't mean anything .
they needed to join the party to further their careers or to achieve certain goals .
rabe had joined in 1934 , because he wanted to open up a german school for the locals . he had certainly used his nazi credentials to shelter the chinese .
the japanese soldiers , many of them very young , went on a rampage , killing civilians in every way imaginable .
why did they suddenly stop at rabe 's door in the international security zone ? he bluffed a lot , and even worried about how long he could continue bluffing .
he showed them his nazi badge .
they must have thought that hitler was around the corner .
one soldier was in the middle of raping a woman and rabe simply shouted , pointed to his swastika , and sent the soldier back over the fence .
he had no weapons , but the japanese knew he was german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you worked for the german foreign service in shanghai during the war , and then you were posted as a radio attaché to tokyo , where you stayed until shortly after the japanese surrender .
having witnessed japanese aggression in china , how did that make you feel about japan ? the japanese are difficult to understand .
many could not admit that their own countrymen committed such atrocities , but they wanted to know about it .
the rabe diaries were published in japan , and the book was enormously successful .

dw-world.de spoke with erwin wickert , the editor of his diaries . german author and diplomat erwin wickert , the 91-year-old editor of the diaries " john rabe : the good german of nanking , " talked to dw-world.de about rabe , whom he first met in 1936 .
wickert is a novelist , author of numerous books on east asia and a former ambassador to china . dw-world.de : how did you meet john rabe ?
erwin wickert : i was a hobo , a bum looking for adventure , had been a german exchange student at dickinson college in pennsylvania , and wanted to take the pacific route to east asia .
when i arrived in china , i was 21 and broke - it was difficult arranging money transfers from germany in 1936 .
i was hoping to find other germans i could stay with , and was referred to rabe and his wife dora , who generously took me into their home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wickert , now 91 , was rabe 's guest in 1936 rabe had joined the nazi party in 1934 , yet he opened his home to strangers - to you and to hundreds of chinese fleeing japanese soldiers .
what kind of a man was rabe ? in hitler 's time , there were three types of germans : the nazis , the intelligentsia and the decent germans .
it was possible to belong to two of the categories , but not all three .
rabe was clearly honorable and he was a nazi in name .
he had no idea about hitler and had only heard good things .
remember , rabe had spent decades in china .
he had only been in germany briefly in 1928 during a time when the nazis were an unknown entity . still , he read german and english newspapers in china , and there were so many jewish emigrés who suddenly started arriving in shanghai and elsewhere .
he should have given more weight to the testimonies of the jews , but rabe was absolutely not anti-semitic .
not a single anti-semitic reference could be found in his diaries . in nanking , the americans and brits thought he must have been high up , because he boasted about being a nazi member and firing off a telegram to hitler .
he was n't .
to many germans abroad , being a nazi did n't mean anything .
they needed to join the party to further their careers or to achieve certain goals .
rabe had joined in 1934 , because he wanted to open up a german school for the locals . he had certainly used his nazi credentials to shelter the chinese .
the japanese soldiers , many of them very young , went on a rampage , killing civilians in every way imaginable .
why did they suddenly stop at rabe 's door in the international security zone ? he bluffed a lot , and even worried about how long he could continue bluffing .
he showed them his nazi badge .
they must have thought that hitler was around the corner .
one soldier was in the middle of raping a woman and rabe simply shouted , pointed to his swastika , and sent the soldier back over the fence .
he had no weapons , but the japanese knew he was german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you worked for the german foreign service in shanghai during the war , and then you were posted as a radio attaché to tokyo , where you stayed until shortly after the japanese surrender .
having witnessed japanese aggression in china , how did that make you feel about japan ? the japanese are difficult to understand .
many could not admit that their own countrymen committed such atrocities , but they wanted to know about it .
the rabe diaries were published in japan , and the book was enormously successful .
probably because it was a day-to-day account of what happened , and it did not condemn the japanese as a people . there was one chapter of the rabe diaries that appeared in german , but was dropped by the american publisher and never translated into english .
i describe the bestialities that were committed in the name of imperial japan as part of the human condition .
perhaps rabe summed it up best , " there is good and evil in every nation .

energywatch says it has dealt with more than 50,000 complaints about bills in the past year .
more than a year ago firms in the industry were told to improve the way customers were invoiced .
next week the government is launching a consultation exercise aimed at improving bills and metering .
complainants say the bills can be wrong , badly estimated or confusing .
one solution could be a meter which displays in detail how much energy a customer is using and how much it costs .
but installing one would be expensive , and it is not yet clear who would bear the cost .
new ombudsman according to energywatch , billing is the biggest cause of complaints about suppliers . "
some estimated bills that are far too high mean consumers are greatly over-paying " allan asher , energywatch it said the industry paid out £ 2.5m in compensation to customers last year .
of the 200 million bills sent out in 2005 , more than a third were estimates .
" with really sky-rocketing prices , some estimated bills that are far too high mean consumers are greatly over-paying and the companies are building up , quite a few times , quite large cash sums that really belong to consumers , " said energywatch chief executive allan asher .

stephen fry is said to be interested in a role in a film portraying the life of the troubled music genius best known for the instrumental hit telstar .
ifans , who won a bafta for portraying the late comic peter cook , is ideal for the part as he is still " very rock ' n ' roll , " says director marc evans .
evans said : " it 's not obviously commercial , it 's a little more edgy . "
next year is the 40th anniversary of meek 's shotgun suicide , following his murder of landlady violet shenton . "
he could have ended up being the beatles ' producer if his life had n't spiralled out of control " marc evans , director for some , the notoriety of the gloucestershire-born music pioneer 's death has overshadowed his career achievements , such as developing the electronic effects reverb and sampling .
meek had britain 's first number one in the us in 1962 with the tornados ' telstar , which former prime minister margaret thatcher once named as her favourite pop song .
meek had even tried to promote a little-known welsh singer called tom jones , but was two years too early .
bafta telstar was also one of the first commercial successes of synthesised music , created in a studio meek built in a flat above a london leather goods store .
but his landlady was known to complain about the noise .
in february 1967 , meek quarrelled with her and shot her dead with a single-barrelled shotgun .
he then turned the gun on himself .
this happened on the eighth anniversary of the death of buddy holly , one of the music greats with whom meek was obsessed .
the shotgun belonged to heinz burt , a member of the tornados with whom meek was in love and who was initially a suspect in the killings .
the film rights to a biography of meek by john repsch have been bought by a film partnership including stephen fry 's production company , sprout .
marc evans , who directed sigourney weaver and alan rickman in the film drama snow cake , is to direct the proposed film .
evans said he was fascinated by meek , an electronics engineer and occultist who had to keep his then-illegal homosexuality secret while also creating his trend-setting music .
he said his fascination was shared by fellow welshman ifans , who was already working on how he might play the part .
' country boy ' ifans made his name internationally as hugh grant 's eccentric welsh flatmate spike in the comedy notting hill .
of meek , evans said : " it was the period in which he lived , when pop culture was being invented in post-war britain .
" he could have ended up being the beatles ' producer if his life had n't spiralled out of control .
" he was the aural equivalent of a visionary .
it was the beginning of space travel .
it was a fantastical world with new sound landscapes , and he could hear things in it that other people could n't hear . "
evans said ifans , who grew up in ruthin , denbighshire , was well-placed to play the " gangly , country boy who managed to get into the heart of what was then the centre of pop culture , london " .
" rhys is like an outsider .
he is a country boy ... sometimes i think he 's peter o 'toole and sometimes i think he 's peter cook , " he said .
" i 've been working with the super furries and he is still part of that .
he is in and out of bands .
he is a very rock 'n'roll guy . "
playwright kevin clarke , whose work includes scripts for doctor who as well as casualty , the bill and the inspector linley mysteries , is writing the meek screenplay .
the next step , said evans , was coaxing cash for the project from the limited number of sources for british-made films .
" it 's about timing , and finding the right person who gets it , " he said .
" it 's not an obviously commercial film .
it 's a little more edgy than that . "

stephen fry is said to be interested in a role in a film portraying the life of the troubled music genius best known for the instrumental hit telstar .
ifans , who won a bafta for portraying the late comic peter cook , is ideal for the part as he is still " very rock ' n ' roll , " says director marc evans .
evans said : " it 's not obviously commercial , it 's a little more edgy . "
next year is the 40th anniversary of meek 's shotgun suicide , following his murder of landlady violet shenton .
he could have ended up being the beatles ' producer if his life had n't spiralled out of control marc evans , director for some , the notoriety of the gloucestershire-born music pioneer 's death has overshadowed his career achievements , such as developing the electronic effects reverb and sampling .
meek had britain 's first number one in the us in 1962 with the tornados ' telstar , which former prime minister margaret thatcher once named as her favourite pop song .
meek had even tried to promote a little-known welsh singer called tom jones , but was two years too early .
bafta telstar was also one of the first commercial successes of synthesised music , created in a studio meek built in a flat above a london leather goods store .
but his landlady was known to complain about the noise .
in february 1967 , meek quarrelled with her and shot her dead with a single-barrelled shotgun .
he then turned the gun on himself .
this happened on the eighth anniversary of the death of buddy holly , one of the music greats with whom meek was obsessed .
rhys ifans is ' peter o 'toole and peter cook , ' says marc evans the shotgun belonged to heinz burt , a member of the tornados with whom meek was in love and who was initially a suspect in the killings .
the film rights to a biography of meek by john repsch have been bought by a film partnership including stephen fry 's production company , sprout .
marc evans , who directed sigourney weaver and alan rickman in the film drama snow cake , is to direct the proposed film .
evans said he was fascinated by meek , an electronics engineer and occultist who had to keep his then-illegal homosexuality secret while also creating his trend-setting music .

the east of england regional assembly -lrb- eera -rrb- said in the review that it praised much of the work , regenerating areas in the east , carried out by iic .
but the report also said there was a " lack of consistent " advice from eeda , and highlighted other concerns .
eeda welcomed the review and added it was making improvements to iic .
the findings of a major scrutiny review by eera are to be used to help deliver improvements to the iic programme which funds community regeneration projects in the region .
' challenge robustly ' iic is one of four core funding programmes of the eeda and was launched in december 2003 .
its current budget is £ 100m over the four-year period 2007 to 2011 .
the review , undertaken by a five member panel of the assembly , supported the overall aims and structure of the iic programme but found that implementation could have been better .
chris white , leader of the liberal democrat group on the regional assembly said : " the assembly must continue to take a close interest in this scheme over the next 12 months to see that improvements are made . "
he added there were also issues over the general effectiveness of eeda , over which the assembly should take an interest .
he said : " the assembly needs to challenge eeda more robustly as an institution to ensure that it is effective in delivering its work programme as a whole not just iic . "
eeda and eera covers an area including bedfordshire , cambridgeshire , essex , hertfordshire , norfolk and suffolk .

the findings of a major scrutiny review by eera are to be used to help deliver improvements to the iic programme which funds community regeneration projects in the region .

the east of england regional assembly -lrb- eera -rrb- said in the review that it praised much of the work , regenerating areas in the east , carried out by iic .
but the report also said there was a " lack of consistent " advice from eeda , and highlighted other concerns .
eeda welcomed the review and added it was making improvements to iic .
the findings of a major scrutiny review by eera are to be used to help deliver improvements to the iic programme which funds community regeneration projects in the region .
' challenge robustly ' iic is one of four core funding programmes of the eeda and was launched in december 2003 .
its current budget is £ 100m over the four-year period 2007 to 2011 .
the review , undertaken by a five member panel of the assembly , supported the overall aims and structure of the iic programme but found that implementation could have been better .
chris white , leader of the liberal democrat group on the regional assembly said : " the assembly must continue to take a close interest in this scheme over the next 12 months to see that improvements are made . "
he added there were also issues over the general effectiveness of eeda , over which the assembly should take an interest .
he said : " the assembly needs to challenge eeda more robustly as an institution to ensure that it is effective in delivering its work programme as a whole not just iic . "
eeda and eera covers an area including bedfordshire , cambridgeshire , essex , hertfordshire , norfolk and suffolk .

large queues meant some shoppers were turned away even before stores opened at 0700 local time -lrb- 2100 gmt -rrb- .
the console officially went on sale on 11 november but sony only made 100,000 machines available on launch day .
instead of opening at midnight , stores organised lotteries to decide who in the queue would get a long-awaited ps3 .
line dance outside bic camera 's flagship tokyo store more than 1,000 people queued for their chance to buy a playstation 3 . "
i 've been waiting for this day to come for so long " tomoaki nakamura , gamer shop attendants with microphones warned impatient customers that sales would end if there were any injuries .
" standing in line today is the only way to make sure i got one , " said takayuki sato , 30 .
tomoaki nakamura , 41 , said : " i 've been waiting for this day to come for so long .
i 'll play it all through the weekend .
no time for meals . "
the head of sony 's game unit head , ken kutaragi , known as " the father of the playstation " , expressed his gratitude to those who had waited .
" i hope you will enjoy the next-generation entertainment to your heart 's content , " he said .
the company said it would be a few days before they knew whether all retailers had sold out of all their ps3 consoles .
earlier , bloggers catalogued the numbers of people waiting outside stores .
brian ashcraft who toured electronics stores in tokyo for game blog kotaku described the scene as " organised chaos " .
the bbc news website also received e-mail messages from those queuing outside stores .
game gear the playstation 3 -lrb- ps3 -rrb- is being sold in two configurations .
the more expensive version has a 60gb hard drive and wi-fi on board and costs , in japan , 60,000 yen -lrb- £ 270 -rrb- .
the cheaper version has a 20gb hard drive , lacks the wi-fi and will cost 49,980 yen -lrb- £ 222 -rrb- .
european prices are expected to be higher than direct comparisons suggest .
clickable guide to the ps3 a voyage around the hardware a fan 's view of the ps3 both versions include a wireless controller , a blu-ray high-quality video disc and a port so they can work with a high-definition display .
buying a ps3 also gives owners free access to the online playstation network where they can meet and take on other gamers .
sony expects five games to be available at launch including ridge racer 7 , mobile suit gundam : target in sight , genji , and resistance : fall of man .
like other next-generation consoles the ps3 offers gamers much more detailed graphics than ever before .
the ibm-developed cell chip inside the console uses seven separate processing cores which can be used to make the physics in game worlds more realistic and allow computer-controlled enemies to behave with great sophistication .
" the image quality is so superb you 'd almost think it 's a real movie , " gamer hisafumi funato said after trying it out at a demonstration event in downtown tokyo .
" i want one , especially if i do n't have to stand in a long line . "
cost crunch the playstation 3 was originally supposed to go on sale in early 2006 but production problems and shortages of key components forced a delay .
the european launch of the console has been pushed back to march 2007 .
this has also meant that there are only 100,000 consoles for gamers in japan .
sony said 400,000 will be available for the us launch on 17 november .
despite the shortages , sony said it was confident of shipping six million ps3s by the end of march 2007 .
although sony has dominated home console gaming since the launch of the first playstation in 1994 its lead is under greater threat than ever before .
arch-rival microsoft released its xbox 360 console in november 2005 .
by the end of 2006 microsoft hopes to have sold about 10 million xbox 360s .
also due to launch in november is nintendo 's wii console which is far cheaper than the playstation 3 or the xbox 360 .
it goes on sale in the us on 19 november .
analysts expect sony to lose money on every console sold for some time to come .
" for all you know , it may take sony five years to get back the money it 's invested in ps3 , " said mitsuhiro osawa , analyst for mizuho investors securities , " even 10 years if it does n't watch out . "
are you going to be one of the first to get a playstation 3 ?
what is its appeal to you ?
send us your comments using the form below .
i 'm going to try and buy a ps3 , just so i can sell it on ebay .
the ps3 will not win the console wars , the wii is pure innovation -lrb- if it works -rrb- and the xbox360 is does the same thing the ps3 does , only for less money .
robo , san diego , ca when i first heard about the ps3 i was so excited that i 've hardly been able to sleep .
okay , so that 's exaggerating a bit , but since sony has messed about with the european launch date , i have flown all the way to japan to get my hands on one .
i am currently in a japanese airport with my ps3 .
i ca n't wait to get home and play it !
tim gregory , london , uk i really want a ps3 and i 'm very disappointed that it 's being released next year .
we are getting a nintendo wii instead for christmas .
i do n't think we will get the ps3 straight away though , it 's so much money !
i am most looking forward to continue the final fantasy series with ff13 , and to get singstar .
with some luck , the ps3 would come down in price , but i do n't see it happening for many years to come !
gemma tevendale , maidstone , kent i am in central tokyo now .
will be queuing up soon .
bic camera opens at 7am .
only 100k units for whole of japan .
not sure i 'm going to make it .
paul senior , oxford , uk i pre-ordered my ps3 about 6 months ago .
this gaming machine is clearly going to be one of the best .
the late release does not bother me , it gives sony more time to make it a better console for gamer satisfaction .
just looking at the previews of the games were enough to get me to buy it .
its same style controller as the ps2 is great , considering it is the best , in my opinion , and most comfortable gaming controller made .
sony have always been one step ahead , microsoft had a slight struggle and nintendo have bit the dust .
sam muller , london , uk i will definitely be one of the first in the country to get my hands on one of these monster consoles .
it appeals to me more often than not as not only is it a games console it is a multimedia centre to name a few and the added bonus of the cell rsx graphic process gives the console so much more credibility for the users to entertain themselves evermore so surreal .
benj , southport , merseyside i will certainly not be buying a ps3 .
though this console has amazing technical specifications , i have been put off by sony 's continuing neglect of its european customers .
release in japan 11 november 2006 , usa on 17 november 2006 , and europe some time in march 2007 - if we 're lucky , maybe !
sorry sony , but that 's just not good enough - you can keep your console !
mike , aberdeen , uk i 'm a diehard metal gear solid fan so i 'll be getting a ps3 when ' metal gear solid 4 : guns of the patriots ' comes out , probably in july 2007 .
it may be expensive , but it 's unbearable to imagine waiting any longer to find out what happens to solid snake !
hideo kojima at konami is a storytelling genius , i 'd still buy a ps3 even if mgs4 was the only game on the console and the price was £ 1000 !
seb barrow , trowbridge , uk i wo n't get a ps3 , it 's too expensive and the format wars are n't yet over .
i 'm glad its being released though , because now the ps2 will go down to around 50 dollars and its library will also see a drop , which , with the outrageous price of new video games nowadays , will fit my budget .
rob , i 've always stayed faithful to the playstation .
i 'll be queuing in the uk when it finally goes out on sale .
i would n't give a penny to microsoft for their xbox , if it 's anything like their operating systems it most probably crashes every 10 seconds .
give me sony any day .

arch-rival microsoft released its xbox 360 console in november 2005 .
by the end of 2006 microsoft hopes to have sold about 10 million xbox 360s .
also due to launch in november is nintendo 's wii console which is far cheaper than the playstation 3 or the xbox 360 .
it goes on sale in the us on 19 november .
analysts expect sony to lose money on every console sold for some time to come .
" for all you know , it may take sony five years to get back the money it 's invested in ps3 , " said mitsuhiro osawa , analyst for mizuho investors securities , " even 10 years if it does n't watch out . "
are you going to be one of the first to get a playstation 3 ?
what is its appeal to you ?

i 'm going to try and buy a ps3 , just so i can sell it on ebay .
the ps3 will not win the console wars , the wii is pure innovation -lrb- if it works -rrb- and the xbox360 is does the same thing the ps3 does , only for less money .
robo , san diego , ca when i first heard about the ps3 i was so excited that i 've hardly been able to sleep .
okay , so that 's exaggerating a bit , but since sony has messed about with the european launch date , i have flown all the way to japan to get my hands on one .
i am currently in a japanese airport with my ps3 .
i ca n't wait to get home and play it !
tim gregory , london , uk i really want a ps3 and i 'm very disappointed that it 's being released next year .
we are getting a nintendo wii instead for christmas .
i do n't think we will get the ps3 straight away though , it 's so much money !
i am most looking forward to continue the final fantasy series with ff13 , and to get singstar .
with some luck , the ps3 would come down in price , but i do n't see it happening for many years to come !

this gaming machine is clearly going to be one of the best .
the late release does not bother me , it gives sony more time to make it a better console for gamer satisfaction .
just looking at the previews of the games were enough to get me to buy it .
its same style controller as the ps2 is great , considering it is the best , in my opinion , and most comfortable gaming controller made .
sony have always been one step ahead , microsoft had a slight struggle and nintendo have bit the dust .

it appeals to me more often than not as not only is it a games console it is a multimedia centre to name a few and the added bonus of the cell rsx graphic process gives the console so much more credibility for the users to entertain themselves evermore so surreal .

release in japan 11 november 2006 , usa on 17 november 2006 , and europe some time in march 2007 - if we 're lucky , maybe !
sorry sony , but that 's just not good enough - you can keep your console !

hideo kojima at konami is a storytelling genius , i 'd still buy a ps3 even if mgs4 was the only game on the console and the price was £ 1000 !
seb barrow , trowbridge , uk i wo n't get a ps3 , it 's too expensive and the format wars are n't yet over .
i 'm glad its being released though , because now the ps2 will go down to around 50 dollars and its library will also see a drop , which , with the outrageous price of new video games nowadays , will fit my budget .
rob , i 've always stayed faithful to the playstation .
i 'll be queuing in the uk when it finally goes out on sale .

despite the shortages , sony said it was confident of shipping six million ps3s by the end of march 2007 .
although sony has dominated home console gaming since the launch of the first playstation in 1994 its lead is under greater threat than ever before .
arch-rival microsoft released its xbox 360 console in november 2005 .
by the end of 2006 microsoft hopes to have sold about 10 million xbox 360s .
also due to launch in november is nintendo 's wii console which is far cheaper than the playstation 3 or the xbox 360 .
it goes on sale in the us on 19 november .
analysts expect sony to lose money on every console sold for some time to come .
" for all you know , it may take sony five years to get back the money it 's invested in ps3 , " said mitsuhiro osawa , analyst for mizuho investors securities , " even 10 years if it does n't watch out . "
are you going to be one of the first to get a playstation 3 ?
what is its appeal to you ?

i 'm going to try and buy a ps3 , just so i can sell it on ebay .
the ps3 will not win the console wars , the wii is pure innovation -lrb- if it works -rrb- and the xbox360 is does the same thing the ps3 does , only for less money .

okay , so that 's exaggerating a bit , but since sony has messed about with the european launch date , i have flown all the way to japan to get my hands on one .
